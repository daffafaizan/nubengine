      treatment approaches of international pediatric diabetes centers.The hypothesis is that a
      collaboration of pediatric diabetes centers will improve the situation for children with
      diabetes ensuring that all children have the right to participate fully in all the
      experiences of childhood and adolescence, regardless of whether they have diabetes and
      wherever they live. Also it could reduce the effects of accelerated vascular ageing imposed
      by the diabetic state and provide the basis for a long-term participation in professional and
      family life without or with delayed debilitating long-term diabetes complications.

      SWEET is a real-world study. Therefore the treatment decisions are made by the patient with
      diabetes and the local treatment team.

      The SWEET database combines data from distinct sources. Data is collected locally through
      clinical databases, electronic health record systems, the standardized
      SWEET-DPV-documentation software (https://sweet.zibmt.uni-ulm.de/software.php) or centers
      download data from existing longitudinal registries. Twice yearly, data are transmitted to
      the central database hosted by the Institute of Epidemiology and Medical Biometry, ZIBMT, Ulm
      University, Ulm, Germany. The prospectively collected data is then combined into a common
      database. Inconsistent/improbability or missing data is reported back to the centers for
      correction. Data is then aggregated into an anonymized, cumulative database used for clinical
      research, scientific analysis, and nationwide benchmarking.
