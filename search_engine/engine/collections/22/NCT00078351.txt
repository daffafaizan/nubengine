      (Synvisc) injection in comparison with control treatment (saline injection) for
      osteoarthritis (OA) affecting the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Patients with TMJ OA of at
      least three-month duration and who have not responded to conservative treatments will be
      included. Patients will be randomly assigned to either high molecular hylan injection or
      control. At baseline and follow up visits, clinical outcome measures will be assessed such as
      pain and range of motion. Positive findings in clinical outcome measures will provide
      evidence for the clinical utility of Synvisc in patients with painful TMJ OA. In addition to
      clinical outcome measures, a sample of synovial fluid from the affected joint will be
      obtained at the baseline visit and at 12 week follow up, and levels of tumor necrosis factor
      alpha (TNF alpha), Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase
      (TIMP) will be analyzed. By studying the synovial fluid levels of TNF alpha, MMP and TIMP, we
      will assess the effects of viscosupplementation with Synvisc on the local inflammatory
      process and proteolytic activity in TMJ OA in comparison with control treatment. Positive
      findings in clinical symptoms and synovial fluid analysis will also provide implications of
      clinical utility of Synvisc in patients with painful TMJ OA. Furthermore, this analysis of
      synovial fluid may identify biomarkers associated with OA affecting the TMJ.
