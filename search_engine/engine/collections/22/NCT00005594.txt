      adenocarcinoma of the pancreas who are treated with ISIS 2503. II. Determine the duration of
      response in these patients receiving this regimen. III. Characterize the safety profile of
      ISIS 2503 at the recommended phase II dose and schedule in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive ISIS 2503 IV continuously for 14 days. Treatment continues every 21
      days for a minimum of 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
