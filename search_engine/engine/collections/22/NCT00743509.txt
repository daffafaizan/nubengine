      effectiveness of the combination of oral cyclophosphamide and sirolimus in sarcoma patients
      with relapsed or widespread disease who cannot be cured by surgery, radiation or conventional
      chemotherapy. Malignant connective tissue tumors of soft tissue and bone (sarcomas) are
      highly aggressive cancers. There are few available chemotherapy treatments that are active in
      treating sarcomas. Sarcomas that have metastasized (spread throughout the body) are usually
      fatal. There is a great need to identify new active drugs to treat metastatic or relapsed
      sarcomas. Low dose oral daily cyclophosphamide is an established chemotherapy regimen for
      treatment of malignant and autoimmune disease and is generally well tolerated. Sirolimus is
      approved for prevention of kidney rejection after transplantation. Temsirolimus, a form of
      sirolimus, is approved for the treatment of kidney cancer. Sirolimus combined with
      cyclophosphamide in animal models of sarcoma resulted in significant anti-tumor activity.
      Tumor and blood samples will be studied to look for known protein targets of the medication
      to help learn why certain subjects have a favorable response to the treatment.
