    
      32 patients with CTEPH (confirmed by right cardiac catheterization and imaging) will perform:
      1) pulmonary function tests; 2) measurement of maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and
      endurance; 3) evaluation of peripheral muscle strength by isokinetic dynamometry; 4)
      six-minute walk test and 5) incremental and constant load cardiopulmonary exercise test (~
      75% of maximal work-rate) with non-invasive evaluation of central hemodynamics and peripheral
      muscle oxygenation. Inspiratory muscle training will consist of twice daily sessions of 30
      breaths (~ 50% PiMAX, 4-5 minutes per session) for 8 weeks. The SHAM group will perform
      sessions of 30 breaths with no inspiratory load.
