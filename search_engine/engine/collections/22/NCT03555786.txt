      volume in 90% of patients for the retroclavicular brachial plexus block. The first subject
      received 25 ml 0.5% bupivacaine . Each subsequent patient received a dose that depended on
      the response of the previous one. If the previous block is successful, the block will be
      performed either by a reduction of the volume by 2.5 ml with a probability ß = 0.11 or by a
      same dose of the previous one with a probability 1-ß = 0.89 in the next patient.
