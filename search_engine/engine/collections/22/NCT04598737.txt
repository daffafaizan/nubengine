      modification for materials suitable for all clinical situations

      multilayered translucent zirconia provides the advantages of high mechanical properties than
      all glass ceramic in addition to the improved translucency in the new generations.

      Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to evaluate the clinical performance of newly
      introduced multilayered translucent zirconia as a monolithic laminate veneer in comparison
      with lithium disilicate laminate veneer to determine the clinical functional and structural
      integrity of the restoration
