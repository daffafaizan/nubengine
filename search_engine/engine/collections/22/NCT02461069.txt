      fumarate in patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis. More specifically the
      influence of dimethyl fumarate on peripheral immune cells will be addressed to evaluate
      changes in cytokine production by the distinct T cell subsets and the differentiation
      capacity of na√Øve T cells. Furthermore, the impact of dimethyl fumarate treatment on the
      migratory capacity of T cells as well as the evaluation of changes in the suppressive
      capacity of regulatory T cells will be evaluated. To put the obtained results into context,
      response data of dimethyl fumarate-treated patients will be compared with data from healthy
      subjects.
