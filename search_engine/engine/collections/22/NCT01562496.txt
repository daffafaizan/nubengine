      need in Parkinson's disease (PD). Animal studies have shown that 'intensive' exercise
      improves motor function and may have neuroprotective properties. The promising animal results
      have not been translated to patients with PD so far. This is a two-cluster randomised control
      trial in which twenty patients (10 at each site) will undergo a 6-month exercise intervention
      on a stationary virtual reality bike and twenty patients (10 at each site)will serve as
      controls.
