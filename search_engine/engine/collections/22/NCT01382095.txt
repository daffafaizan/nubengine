      modified E. coli heat labile enterotoxin, LTR192G, is safe and immunogenic when administered
      transcutaneously using a skin wet-patch. If the vaccine is found safe and adequately
      immunogenic in humans, a phase 2b vaccination/challenge study would be undertaken to further
      evaluate vaccine safety and allow a preliminary assessment of efficacy. With favorable
      evidence for safety, immunogenicity, efficacy, complemented by advances in standard
      methodology to combine multiple adhesins with an appropriate LT enterotoxoid form, a
      multivalent vaccine would be constructed and evaluated for further clinical development.
