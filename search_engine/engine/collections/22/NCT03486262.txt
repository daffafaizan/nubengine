      Characterize altered molecular pathways in lung cancer in patients with IPF versus lung
      cancer in non-IPF patients.

      Secondary objectives:

      Identify specific therapeutic targets Describe a cohort of lung cancers on IPF (clinical /
      radiological and pathological data) To study the relationship between neoplastic /
      preneoplastic lesions and pulmonary parenchyma reshaped by fibrosis.
