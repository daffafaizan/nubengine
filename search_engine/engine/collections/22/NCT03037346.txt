      I. To evaluate medical power of attorney documents (MPOAD) completion rate after a systematic
      social work counseling and education clinical process.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine change in medical power of attorney (MPOA)/primary family caregivers'
      knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about conditions for quality surrogate medical
      decision-making (MDM).

      II. To determine change in MPOA/primary family caregivers' knowledge of patients' values and
      goals for MDM.

      III. Evaluate patients' and MPOA/primary family caregivers' willingness to participate in
      future advance care planning discussions to discuss patients' values and goals important to
      MDM.

      IV. Evaluate predictors of patient subgroups most likely to respond to the social work
      counseling and education clinical process.

      V. Explore aspects of the Spanish language version of the advance care planning engagement
      survey to inform future validation studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants (patients and family caregiver/MPOA) complete questionnaires about knowledge,
      attitudes, and beliefs of MPOAD. Participants without a MPOAD watch a 4-minute educational
      video about the importance of the role of MPOA.

      After completion of intervention, participants are followed up at 3 months.
