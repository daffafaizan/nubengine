      nitroglycerin paste on their breast reduction scar. The study team aims to randomize 100
      patients, or 200 breasts. Each patient will receive treatment, but the breast that received
      treatment will be random. This will allow for a control breast to compare to. Patients will
      be followed for 12 months postoperatively to observe wound healing.
