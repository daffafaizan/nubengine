      (CD) are among the prevalent psychiatric disorders in children and one of the leading causes
      of help-seeking for mental health problems in children. There are several efficacious
      treatments for such problems in young children. However, most of these require that parents
      meet in groups. This is not always feasible. It is therefore a need to develop treatments
      that can deal with parents and families individually. Parent-Child Interaction Therapy (PCIT)
      is such an individually based treatment. Efficacy studies indicate symptom reduction greater
      that in treatment as usual (TAU). However, there is a need to study its effectiveness in
      ordinary clinical practise. This trial will study its effect in ordinary psychiatric clinics
      in the middle of Norway and compare it to the regular treatment (TAU) provided to young
      children with behavior problems in these clinics.
