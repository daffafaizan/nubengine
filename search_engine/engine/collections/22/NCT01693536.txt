      cardiovascular disease and possibly dementia among the elderly. There is a need to show that
      minimal intervention can reduce sodium intake and increase fitness in the elderly. Finland
      has shown that five dietician visits/year could change diet in respect to fat and fibre. In
      Australia the National Health Insurer (Medicare) funds five allied health visits/year for
      those with chronic disease, hence our use of this model. This is consistent with WHO
      guidelines for a national approach using existing health infrastructure. The elderly
      (75-95yrs) were chosen as this group is thought most difficult to change behaviour and has a
      higher incidence of dementia.
