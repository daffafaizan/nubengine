      reoccurring oesophageal cancer following chemoradiotherapy. The technique used to test this
      is called a Cytosponge™. We will be testing the use of the Cytosponge™ to determine
      completion rate, safety and acceptability of the procedure.

      Cytosponge™ is a capsule-sized device which contains an expandable, spherical mesh which is
      attached to a string. The capsule dissolves in the stomach after swallowing, releasing the
      sponge which is then retrieved by gently pulling the string after five minutes. As the sponge
      is pulled out it collects the cells from the lining of the gullet.

      The Cytosponge™ will be processed for evidence of residual cancer through analysis of
      cellular atypia and molecular biomarkers. Where available, the results will be compared with
      histology.

      Up to fifty patients will be recruited to the trial across 11 sites.
