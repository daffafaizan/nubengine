    
      Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly recognized illness associated with
      substantial mobidity and mortality. Patients develop fever followed by rapidly progressive
      and even fatal respiratory disease. SARS is associated with infection with a novel
      coronavirus. The evaluation of the inflammatory responses evoked by SARS may yield
      information regarding its pathogenesis and help with patient management. This protocol, then,
      merely aims to study disease pathogenesis and natural history, by studying samples and data
      that are collected by outside physicians or physicians at the Clinical Center and sent for
      evaluation of the inflammatory response.
