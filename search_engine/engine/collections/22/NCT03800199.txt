      into Turkish by two Turkish mother tongue translators who also speak English in advanced
      level. Then these translations will be combined into one translation and translated back to
      English. These translations will send to 7 different health professions who had experience
      working with FMS patients. The pre-final version will be composed and tested on a group of
      patients with FMS. If necessary, readjustments will be made, and the final version will be
      investigated in FMS patients. Acceptability was assessed in terms of refusal rate, rates of
      missing responses, and administration time. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's alpha
      and test-retest assessments. Re-test assessments will be conducted after one week from first
      assessment. Content validity was assessed by examining the floor and ceiling effects and skew
      of the distributions. Convergent and divergent validity was assessed by examining the
      Pearson's correlation coefficients. In addition, the confirmatory factor analysis will be
      done to evaluate the validity of ICAF. Responsiveness was determined by examining effect size
      (ES), standardized response means (SRM) and P values generated using Wilcoxon's test.
