      stress and telomere length. It is hypothesized that the high stress group (based on the
      Perceived Stress Scale)compared to low stress group will have shorter telomere length. A
      secondary aim is to evaluate whether different types of stress have differing degrees of
      association with telomere length. An exploratory aim is to assess for gender differences in
      the association between stress and telomere length. The investigators are collecting a number
      of other measures, including demographics, work sector, perceived social support, and medical
      history, in order to adjust for potential confounders in the analysis.

      This study is an extension of earlier work Dr. Rasgon has done with Dr. Elizabeth Blackburn
      at UCSF on the relationship between telomere length and mood outcomes. The investigators hope
      this study will add to the growing body of literature on stress and genetic markers of
      longevity, specifically how stress level and type is associated with telomere length. The
      increased understanding gained through this study may provide leads for predicting
      age-related diseases and early mortality in adults, thus benefiting others in the future.
