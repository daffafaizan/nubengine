      this emotional and physical stressful action. Arginin-Vasopressin prohormone (copeptin),
      which is more stable and measurable in blood, is used as an endogenous stress indicator.
      Copeptin levels have been shown to be significantly increased in vaginally delivery when
      compared to cesarean section (c / s). In a caesarean section; it is a known fact that when
      the general anesthetic method and the used anesthetic substances are taken into
      consideration, it gives a significant stress to the mother and the baby. Spinal anesthesia
      with no impaired fetal oxygenation and without orotracheal intubation and neuromuscular
      blockers may reduce fetal distress. However, there was no study investigating the effect of
      the anesthesia techniques in elective cesarean section on the fetal stress and the level of
      copeptin, in the literature review. Therefore investigators aimed to compare spinal and
      general anesthesia technique in elective cesarean section, to evaluate level of copeptin and
      their relation with fetal distress.Investigators hope that this study will guide the
      anesthesia method that can be chosen primarily in caesarean section.
