    
      Primary Objective:

      - To evaluate the feasibility of a novel concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy regimen by
      characterizing the percentage of patients who complete concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy
      as a preliminary study before a larger trial.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To report the tolerability of concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy with patient-reported
           HRQOL outcomes via RAND 36-Item Health Survey.

        -  To characterize radiation dermatitis secondary to concurrent capecitabine-radiotherapy
           through patient-reported RISR scores and to compare concurrent RISR scores to published
           reports of patients undergoing breast cancer radiotherapy only.

        -  To provide a preliminary description of the toxicity profile of concurrent capecitabine
           radiotherapy and report the frequency of grade 3 or grade 4 toxicity during combined
           therapy.

        -  To report the feasibility of completion of all study assessments, and completion of all
           study and exploratory assessments.

      Outline:

      This trial will investigate chemoradiotherapy with capecitabine at 1000 mg/m2 BID every other
      week during radiotherapy.
