      Category 2-4) and TASC II Class C or D lesions â‰¥14 cm in length in the native femoropopliteal
      artery. After successful pre-dilatation (1mm < RVD) and spot stenting (if necessary, with
      length minimized to mechanical defect), subjects will receive treatment with the Lutonix Drug
      Coated Balloon (DCB).

      The primary safety and efficacy endpoint assessments are performed at 12 months. Clinical
      follow-up continues through a minimum of 2 years and telephone follow-up through a minimum of
      3 years.
