      poverty level) - many of whom are also African American, Hispanic/Latino, or rural couples -
      face numerous challenges to their relationships. Chief amongst those challenges are: 1)
      higher risk of relationship problems and 2) lack of access to effective relationship services
      to prevent or intervene with relationship distress. Compared to higher-income couples, LI
      married and cohabiting couples are significantly more likely to divorce or separate and
      report lower relationship quality. Unfortunately, LI couples are least likely to receive
      interventions to prevent or solve relationship problems. To overcome these barriers, we
      propose to test the effectiveness of two effective web-based curricula - OurRelationship and
      PREP Online.

      A total of 1,246 LI couples will be recruited nationwide and randomly assigned to the ePREP
      program, the OurRelationship program, the ePREP program plus a coach, the OurRelationship
      program plus a coach, or a wait-list control group and followed for six months. Once randomly
      assigned to group, couples will be assessed at one month, two months, four months, and six
      months following randomization. After couples randomized to the wait-list control group
      finish their waiting period, they will be able to select the program they would like to
      complete (OurRelationship or ePREP) but will not complete research assessments during or
      following their participation in the program.
