      pathology, investigating feasibility of the investigational dye, MB-102, for use in
      fluorescent angiography compared to fluorescein sodium. Safety and tolerability of MB-102
      will also be evaluated. Control dye fluorescein sodium will be administered intravenously a
      minimum of 3 days prior to MB-102 dosing. After IV administration of dyes, images will be
      acquired of both eyes with a Zeiss fundus camera (and for some participants additional fundus
      photography will be performed with clinically-approved ocular angiography imaging systems) by
      a trained ophthalmic photographer. Participants will return for a follow-up visit after
      MB-102 dosing for further physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and reporting of
      any adverse events. Photographs will be examined for quality as well as the utility of the
      angiography in evaluating disease diagnosis and progression.
