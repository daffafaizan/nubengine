      reconstructive facial surgery will be monitored with CMA 70 catheter directly positioned in
      bone tissue.

      The monitoring is recorded during 5 days. Glucose, lactate , pyruvate , glycerol rates will
      be analysed :

        -  every hour at day 1,

        -  every two hours at day 2,

        -  every three hours at day 3,4 and 5.

      Data are managed with Labpilot software.
