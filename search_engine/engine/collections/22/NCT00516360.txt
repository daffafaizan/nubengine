      in infants admitted to the NICU. In adults, chlorhexidine used as a skin antiseptic has been
      shown to reduce the incidence of CRBSIs, and recent evidence indicates the inner surface of
      long-term central catheters as the likely route of infection. This study will evaluate 3.15%
      chlorhexidine as the daily catheter hub antiseptic to reduce catheter tip microbial
      colonization, an indication of high risk for acquiring CRBSI. The purpose of this study is to
      compare the antiseptic capability of 3.15% chlorhexidine versus isopropyl alcohol in reducing
      central catheter-related infections in neonates. This study also aims to compare the time to
      catheter hub microbial colonization in the two groups and to determine the route of catheter
      tip colonization by comparing cultures taken from the catheter tip, hub, and skin insertion
      site.

      This study will last 1 year. There are no study visits. The placement and removal of the
      catheter will be determined by the discretion of the attendant caring for the participant.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Catheters of Group 1
      participants will be treated with 3.15% chlorhexidine at the time of the daily intravenous
      tubing change. Catheters of Group 2 participants will be treated with isopropyl alcohol. For
      both groups, cultures of the inner surface of the catheter hub will be performed twice a
      week, and cultures of the inner surface of the catheter hub, tip, and skin insertion site
      will be performed upon removal of the catheter.
