      to give twice a week for six months to boys with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).
      Secondarily, we want to know if gentamicin can help strengthen the muscles of boys with DMD
      who have a particular type of genetic mutation known as a stop codon. The gentamicin is
      thought to allow for "read-through" of this type of mutation which would allow for the
      production of dystrophin, a protein which is lacking in boys with DMD.
