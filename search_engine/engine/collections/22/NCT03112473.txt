    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Bi-TENS+TOT was superior to Uni-TENS+TOT,
      Placebo-TENS+TOT alone and no active treatment in improving the upper limb motor control and
      upper limb function and community integration in people with chronic stroke.

      The null hypothesis will be that Bi-TENS+TOT is not significantly different from
      Uni-TENS+TOT,Placebo-TENS+TOT alone and no active treatment in improving the upper limb motor
      control and upper limb function and community integration in people with chronic stroke.
