      hypertriglyceridemia is necessary in pediatric populations, and extreme hypertriglyceridemia
      is relatively infrequent in HIV-infected children. Adult studies have suggested that there is
      a proportionate reduction in triglycerides of approximately 15-25% when taking fish oil
      omega-3 fatty acid supplementation, irrespective of the degree of initial triglyceride
      elevation. This trial would thus represent a proof-of-concept study in children with mild to
      moderate hypertriglyceridemia.

      The results of this study would contribute to the pool of knowledge regarding the efficacy
      and safety of this nutriceutical in the treatment of HAART-associated hypertriglyceridemia in
      children. Compared with other interventions (such as dietary changes and drug therapies),
      nutritional supplementation with fish oil is an inexpensive, simple, and likely preferable
      treatment for a potentially significant medical condition. In addition, the results of this
      study could presumably be extrapolated to benefit children with hypertriglyceridemia
      secondary to other types of drugs or illnesses.
