      patients who were under mechanical ventilator or noninvasive positive pressure ventilator
      support. Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) support by nasal pillow and high flow
      nasal cannula can improve inspiratory function in extubated patients . However, the extent of
      lung volume change or functional residual volume (FRC) change by using these two devices were
      never surveyed before in extubated patients. The investigators will check end-expiratory lung
      volume (EELV) ,anterior, medio-anterior, medio-posterior and posterior EELV by electrical
      impedance tomography after use of these two devices in extubated patients.
