      I. To design a patient decision aid video about breast reconstruction. II. To pilot test its
      acceptability with women. III. To field test the feasibility of delivery pre-consultation and
      efficacy at preparing women for their discussion with their plastic surgeon.

      OUTLINE:

      FOCUS GROUP: Survivors who previously considered breast reconstruction participate in a 40 to
      60-minute focus group to gather feedback on currently-available patient decision aids and
      educational materials. The research team uses their feedback to create an initial prototype
      of a patient decision aid video

      PILOT TEST: Survivors who previously considered breast reconstruction review the initial
      prototype of the patient decision aid video, then complete a questionnaire providing their
      feedback about the video's strengths and areas that could be improved. The research team then
      incorporates their feedback into the video."

      FIELD TEST: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Before their appointment, patients spend up to 30 minutes viewing a video and
      workbook. They also spend 5 to 10 minutes completing a questionnaire before and after the
      video and workbook, and again after their appointment. After their appointment, the research
      assistant reviews their medical record to confirm what decisions the patient and doctor made
      about breast reconstruction.

      ARM II: During their appointment, patients spend up to 30 minutes reviewing the standard
      educational booklet about breast reconstruction. They also spend 5 to 10 minutes completing a
      questionnaire before and after the booklet, and again after their appointment. After their
      appointment, the research assistant reviews their medical record to confirm what decisions
      the patient and doctor made about breast reconstruction.
