      climacteric syndrome were enrolled from April 2018 to April 2019 in the context of a
      prospective, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Women were randomized to receive
      treatment with either the botanical combination (250 mg daily divided into two doses) or
      placebo for eight weeks. At the beginning and end of the study, health-related Quality of
      Life was assessed using the Cervantes Scale.
