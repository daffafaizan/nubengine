    
      Participants in this research study have tumors that express somatostatin receptors such as a
      neuroendocrine tumor, medulloblastoma, meningioma, and neuroblastoma.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine if 90Y-DOTATOC is an effective treatment
      for tumors that express somatostatin receptors and if 68Ga-DOTATOC PET/CT can measure the
      extent of disease and measure response to this therapy. This research will determine if this
      process called dosimetry is an effective technique to determine how much 90Y-DOTATOC the
      participants can safely receive without damage to their kidneys and bone marrow.

      Goals for this study are to:

        1. Demonstrate safety and efficacy of dosimetry-guided peptide receptor radiotherapy (PRRT)
           using 90Y-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (90Y-DOTATOC) in patients with neuroendocrine and other
           somatostatin receptor expressing tumors.

        2. Monitor all adverse events associated with peptide receptor radiotherapy using
           90Y-DOTATOC.

        3. Establish 68Ga-DOTA-tyr3-Octreotide (68Ga-DOTATOC) PET/CT as an accurate technique for
           diagnosis, staging, treatment targeting, and monitoring response to 90Y-DOTATOC therapy.

      Approximately 64 people will participate in this study conducted at the University of Iowa.
