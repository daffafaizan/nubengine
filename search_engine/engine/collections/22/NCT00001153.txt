      disorders associated with hypopigmentation. The degree of ocular pigmentation is assessed
      clinically by estimating the melanin content of the iris, retinal pigment epithelium, and
      choroid. Visual function is measured in the conventional manner to study central vision, and
      electrophysiological methods to detect a misrouting of the visual pathways. The purpose of
      this study is to document the visual deficit and the pigmentary changes of patients with
      albinism, to observe their natural course, and to determine whether misrouting of the visual
      pathways is present and is correlated with pigmentation.
