    
      Specific Aim 1: Determine the relationship between PEGASUS program implementation and TBI
      guideline adherence (Aim 1a), and assess system, provider, patient, implementation and
      guideline factors associated with TBI guideline adherence (Aim 1b). Hypothesis: Centers that
      receive the PEGASUS program have higher TBI guideline adherence (main outcome), as well as
      better discharge survival and 3-month Glasgow Outcome Scale-Extended (GOSE) score (secondary
      outcomes) than centers who receive usual care.

      Specific Aim 2: Create a value stream map (VSM) to identify value-added processes of care
      associated with TBI guideline adherence. Hypothesis: ICU activity flows of TBI care during
      the first 72 hours will reveal value-added as well as non-value-added processes in severe TBI
      care. PEGASUS program implementation will result in more value-added TBI care processes and
      better TBI guideline adherence.

      Specific Aim 3: Use computer simulation to develop and disseminate a real-world best
      practices blueprint for TBI guideline adherence. Hypothesis: This model will identify the
      impact of the PEGASUS program on key performance indicators (KPIs), outcomes (Aim 1), and
      process activities (Aim 2). Iterative computer simulations will then demonstrate the
      relationship among PEGASUS program components and how relative changes in these components
      impact the magnitude, direction and choice of operations downstream in TBI care and patient
      outcomes to inform development of a blueprint for wide dissemination of best-practice
      guidelines.
