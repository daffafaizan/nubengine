      of autologous T cells that have had genetic material transferred into the cell to redirect
      them to target breast cancer cells rather than their usual target. Eligible subjects will
      have metastatic breast cancer refractory to at least one standard therapy or to newly
      diagnosed with operable triple negative breast cancer.
