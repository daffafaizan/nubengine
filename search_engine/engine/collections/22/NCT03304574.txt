    
      Adolescents and their parents (if participant is under the age of 18 years) will be
      approached and invited to participate in the study during their Emergency Department (ED)
      visit. Following consent, adolescents will be randomized to the intervention or control
      group. A tablet computer will be provided to the participants for use during their baseline
      assessment in the ED. The CheckED Yourself App will be pre-loaded on the tablet. The CheckED
      Yourself App (eHA-IPF) is an innovative electronic health screening tool with integrated
      personalized feedback about risk behaviors. The CheckED Yourself App (eHA-IPF) will be
      divided into an assessment about risk behaviors and a personalized feedback portion.
      Participants will be randomized to a control or intervention group at the time of consent.
      Those in the intervention group will receive both parts of the CheckED Yourself App, while
      the control group will receive only the assessment with no feedback.

      Those in the Intervention arm will complete the health risk behavior assessment and receive
      integrated personalized feedback from the CheckED Yourself App (eHA-IPF), and those in the
      control group will complete the health risk behavior assessment only. Participants will
      complete the questionnaire at some point during their ED visit and prior to discharge.

      Follow-up assessments will be completed at 1-day and 3 months post ED visit via an online
      survey. Reminders for the 1-day and 3-month follow-ups will be sent via email or text
      message. The 1-day assessment will focus on adolescent-reported motivation to make a health
      behavior change, the content of the ED visit including what, if any, risk behaviors their ED
      provider discussed with the participant, and satisfaction with care in the ED. The 3-month
      assessment will include a re-assessment of risk behaviors.
