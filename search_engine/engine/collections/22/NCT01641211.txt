      North Carolina public schools. Latino children have higher rates of uncontrolled asthma and
      more asthma-related emergency department visits than their White counterparts. No studies
      have evaluated Latino children's asthma device technique; poor technique can compromise
      medication delivery to the lungs.

      The TraCS engagement core has spent the last 18 months developing the Expanding Networks for
      Latinos through Community Engagement (ENLaCE) network, which is comprised of over 15
      organizations in the Greensboro area. The core would now like to conduct a feasibility study
      to determine whether ENLaCE can be used to recruit Latino children into a randomized,
      controlled trial (RCT) to improve their asthma medication device technique. This would be the
      first assessment of whether ENLaCE can be used to recruit patients.

      MEDUCATION, an NIH-funded project developed by Polyglot Systems, Inc., has developed asthma
      device technique videos in Spanish and English. The member groups of ENLaCE believe the
      MEDUCATION videos are highly relevant for the Greensboro Latino community. Children will be
      recruited from two pediatric ENLaCE clinics in Greensboro and randomly assigned to watch
      device technique videos (experimental group; n=50) or a nutrition video (control group, n=50)
      in Spanish or English after a regularly-scheduled medical visit. Children's device technique
      will be assessed before and after the visit. Process evaluation data will also be collected.
