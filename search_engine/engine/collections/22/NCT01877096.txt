      morbidity and mortality rates. Screening colonoscopy can aid in the early detection and
      prevention of CRC. A motivational interviewing (MI) intervention holds strong promise to
      increase African Americans' screening colonoscopy adherence and, by doing so, decrease CRC
      disparities. There is a great need to conduct a randomized clinical trial (RCT) that tests
      the efficacy of an MI intervention to increase screening colonoscopy adherence in African
      Americans. The first critical and necessary step in this line of research is to pilot test
      such an RCT.

      Objective/hypotheses: The primary objective of the proposed study is to conduct pilot testing
      for a future RCT which will formally test the effects of MI on screening colonoscopy
      adherence in African Americans. The results from this pilot study will directly inform the
      development of a future RCT.

      Specific aims: 1) To estimate the magnitude of the MI intervention effect size; and 2) To
      estimate the magnitude of the mediation effect sizes (drawn from Self Determination Theory).
