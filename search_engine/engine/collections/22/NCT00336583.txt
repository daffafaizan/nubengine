      considered curable in many cases. However, diagnosis of refractory or relapsed disease is
      devastating and the treatment is difficult because regimens of chemotherapy used as salvage
      therapy are available only in limited numbers. ESHAP, consisting of etoposide,
      methylprednisolone, high-dose cytarabine and cisplatin, is one of commonly used salvage
      regimen, and showed its efficacy and feasibility. But it often requires discontinuation of
      the treatment due to its myelosuppression, neuropathy and renal toxicity, which can also
      impede further treatment. Oxaliplatin, a platinum coordination complex with an oxalato-ligand
      as the leaving group and a 1,2-diaminocyclohexane carrier, possesses higher cytotoxic potency
      on molar basis than cisplatin and carboplatin, and was reported to be active in patients with
      NHL as a single agent. In addition, the substitution of cisplatin by oxaliplatin in the DHAP
      regimen, another commonly used one in relapsed or refractory NHL, showed meaningful
      anti-tumor activity with favorable toxicity profile. Based on preclinical and clinical
      findings, we will conduct a multi-center phase II study of ESHAOX, which substitutes
      oxaliplatin with cisplatin in the ESHAP regimen, to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity
      profile in patients with recurrent or refractory NHL.
