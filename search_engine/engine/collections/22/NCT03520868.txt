      accounts for 15% of strokes worldwide. Radiofrequency ablation has become a frequently used
      therapy for treatment of afib after failure of at least one anti-arrhythmic drug. Pulmonary
      Vein Isolation (PVI) remains the cornerstone of AF ablation and requires transseptal puncture
      and placement of catheters in the left atrium which can be thrombogenic and cause stroke.
      This is avoided by intra-procedural infusion of heparin and the anti-coagulation effect is
      monitored using Activated Clotting Time (ACT). With the approval of Novel Oral
      Anti-Coagulants (NOAC), increasing number of patients are undergoing AF ablation on these
      medications. It has been observed that patients on NOACs require much larger doses of heparin
      and take longer time to reach therapeutic ACT. Consequently, patients are at higher risk for
      thromboembolism and stroke. On the other hand, higher doses of heparin can expose patients to
      excessive bleeding complications. The investigators seek to explain the mechanism of "heparin
      resistance" in such a patient population and to develop a protocol that can achieve
      therapeutic anticoagulation quicker.
