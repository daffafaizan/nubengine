      during ejaculation. It is used in a way very similar to routine vasectomy, however, in a
      routine vasectomy, the vas is burned with an electrical device. With the Vas-X, there is no
      burning. The investigators are testing the Vas-X to determine whether it will offer a better
      way of performing a vasectomy.

      The investigators will conduct this study at the University of Washington Medical Center,
      Seattle.
