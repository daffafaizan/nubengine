      femoral stem with patients receiving an identically designed short uncemented femoral stem.

      Patients will be randomized a few days before the operation. At the time of surgery, the
      surgeon will use the relevant implant. Patients will be followed up for 5 years after
      surgery. The main outcome criteria is the stem subsidence measured radiographically with a
      dedicated software.
