      The subject will receive a single injection of SAV or placebo (an inactive substance) in the
      deltoid muscle of the upper arm. The subject will then be watched for 30 minutes after
      vaccination to monitor for allergic reactions. The subject will be asked to visit the study
      doctor either 6 or 9 times during the 3-month study period. Once enrolled, the subject will
      have blood drawn before receiving the vaccine (baseline) and up to 7 times after that at each
      of the required visits. The blood will be used for tests and/or for testing the subject's
      body's immune response to the SAV, to see if the subjects have developed immunity to S.
      aureus and if immunity continues up to 84 days. A Vaccination Report Card (VRC) will be
      provided to all participants. The participant will be asked to record oral temperatures and
      any reactions that occur at the SAV injection site every day for 5 days after vaccination.
      The participant will also be asked to record any physical adverse effects that they may
      experience, including headaches, nausea, muscle pain or aches, and fatigue every day for 14
      days after vaccination. In additional all medications (including over the counter
      medications) taken during the 14 days post vaccination will be recorded and the VRC will be
      returned to the research staff after 14 days.
