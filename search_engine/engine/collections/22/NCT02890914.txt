      DVD from the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, "Gynecology: Beginners Only"Â®,
      compared to routine education. All participants completed a pretest on transvaginal
      ultrasound images and principles. The intervention group repeated the test after viewing the
      DVD. During the trial, performing and logging transvaginal ultrasounds were encouraged. All
      enrolled residents repeated the test at 6-10 months after intervention.
