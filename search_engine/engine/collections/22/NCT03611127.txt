      patients carried out the following initially and after 8 weeks: spirometry, 6minute walk test
      (SMWT), and a symptom-limited incremental cycle cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), and
      different dyspnea dimensions evaluation as following: Dyspnea intensity during incremental
      exercise using Borg scale, dyspnea 12 questionnaire and COPD assessment test (CAT) to assess
      sensory perceptual, affective distress, and symptom impact domains respectively.
