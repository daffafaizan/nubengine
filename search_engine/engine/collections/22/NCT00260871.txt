      molecular biologists/geneticists to identify susceptible genes for lung cancer, especially
      for female lung adenocarcinoma, and to study the relationship between gene polymorphisms and
      clinical outcomes of lung cancer patients. Our objective is to find gene markers for
      developing useful screening tools for the high risk group in order to prevent or early detect
      lung cancer, especially female lung adenocarcinoma.

      The specific aims of this subproject include:

        1. Establish and maintain the research network that will recruit and follow up the subjects
           and families for the GEFLAC study; keeping control of the progress of the study.

        2. Coordinate all the subprojects such as integrating genotyping data with clinical data
           and environment data.

        3. Continue to employ the candidate gene approach to examine the contribution of specific
           genes to the lung cancer.

        4. Generate genotyping data for candidate genes in the exploring stage and prioritize SNPs
           of candidate genes for large scale studies.

        5. Identify susceptible genes/candidate genes to develop multiplex PCR for screening.
