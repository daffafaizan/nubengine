      disorders of the central nervous system characterized by episodes of immune-mediated
      demyelination and axonal damage mainly involving optic nerves and spinal cord. The discovery
      of a disease-specific serum NMO-immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody that selectively binds
      aquaporin-4 (AQP4) has not only distinguish NMO from MS but also enabled an appreciation for
      the wide spectrum of this disorder. Another autoantibody is the Myelin oligodendrocyte
      glycoprotein (MOGIgG) antibody that has been increasingly reported in a variety of central
      nervous system neuroinflammatory conditions including patients with phenotypes typical for
      NMOSD. Overall, NMO occurs much more commonly in nations with a predominately non-Caucasian
      population,and estimated to be as high as 10 per 100,000. Differentiation of MS from NMOSD is
      critically important because disease modifying treatment for MS, are inefficacious in or may
      aggravate NMOSD. However, in Africa and Middle East, publications and studies are rare and
      most often focus on isolated cases that clearly do not reflect the epidemiological reality in
      this area. Investigators believe that detailed assessment of serum AQP4 antibody as well as
      anti-MOG antibody in Egyptian patients with suspected NMOSD or those with idiopathic
      inflammatory demyelinating central nervous system diseases (IIDCD) other than typical MS
      would be beneficial and Eventually will help to avoid unnecessary investigations and
      treatments, recurrent and prolonged hospital course, significant morbidity, and even death.
