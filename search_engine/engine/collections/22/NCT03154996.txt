      universally recurrent, with recurrence usually occurring within two centimeters of the
      original resection cavity. Although numerous chemotherapeutic drugs demonstrate significant
      anti-tumor activity in preclinical studies, the efficacy in clinical trials has been dismal
      because systemic delivery fails to achieve therapeutic drug levels in tumor cells due to
      various factors including limited blood-brain barrier permeability and systemic toxicity.

      Convection-enhanced delivery (CED) is a method of regional drug delivery that circumvents
      this problem. Phase 1 clinical trial has shown that a potent topoisomerase inhibitor,
      topotecan (TPT), can be safely and effectively delivered by CED into patients with recurrent
      malignant gliomas. This study will expand on these clinical results to address two current
      limitations to the clinical application of CED: 1) A reliable method for non-invasively
      monitoring drug distribution throughout the tumor and brain does not exist; and 2) Duration
      of CED therapy has been limited to short-term infusions secondary to the use of externalized
      infusion pumps.

      The hypothesis is that extended chronic local-regional delivery of TPT is safe, effective and
      feasible in patients with recurrent gliomas. TPT will be directly and chronically delivered
      into the tumor and surrounding brain by CED through subcutaneously implanted pumps while
      innovating a methodology for monitoring the drug distribution through non-invasive imaging.
      This strategy will overcome the limitations of chemotherapy as currently used in the
      treatment of gliomas, and may be applicable to other central nervous system (CNS) diseases
      currently limited by drug delivery barriers.
