      long-term prognosis of chronic heart failure patients.RhNRG-1(recombinant human
      neuregulin-1)directly works on the cardiomyocytes and restored the normal structure and
      function of it. It has been found that rhNRG-1 effectively decreased the serum level of
      NT-proBNP,and is tolerated in the effective dosages groups.The aim of this phase III trial is
      to further confirm in large population that rhRNG-1 administration can effectively decrease
      the serum level of NT-proBNP and is tolerated in patients with chronic heart failure.
