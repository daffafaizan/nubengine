    
      The procedure involved is called a supine breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).In this
      study, the investigators are evaluating the value of supine MRI in surgical decision making
      for women with breast cancer either undergoing upfront surgery or for those anticipating
      surgery after receiving neoadjuvant therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the value of supine breast MRI as a new imaging method
      to assist in surgical treatment planning. It is possible that the use of supine breast MRI
      will help your doctor see the size and location of tumors more accurately
