      peanuts, cause 80% of the food allergy reactions in children in the United States. Children
      have allergic reactions to egg ranging from mild urticaria to systemic anaphylaxis. The
      current therapy for children with egg allergy is to place the child on an egg-free diet until
      the allergy is outgrown. Because egg protein is a part of a significant number of processed
      foods it is difficult to totally avoid all egg proteins. Accidental ingestions leading to
      reactions to egg can occur with a bite of a cookie (~70 mg of egg protein) or a bite of a
      cake (~55 mg of egg protein). Children typically do not outgrow their egg allergy for several
      years. Therefore it would be helpful if a specific form of therapy would make children
      outgrow their allergic reactions to egg sooner. Egg protein is given to children in this
      study in small increasing amounts to desensitize them to the egg protein with the goal of
      helping them to outgrow their allergy.
