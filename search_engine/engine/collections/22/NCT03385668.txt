      directed against MPO or with anti-MPO associated vasculitis, leading to increased disability
      and poor prognosis. The pathophysiology of this association remains unclear. Conventional
      therapies used for the treatment of vasculitis manifestations are often disappointing for the
      treatment of pulmonary fibrosis. The main cause of death in patients with anti-MPO ANCA
      associated vasculitis and associated pulmonary fibrosis is the progression of pulmonary
      fibrosis. No treatment has demonstrated efficacy to stabilize or improve pulmonary fibrosis
      associated with anti-MPO associated vasculitis.

      Previous studies showed that Pirfenidone improves survival and pulmonary function in patients
      with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and that Pirfenidone treatment is safe and well
      tolerated in IPF. Patients with anti-MPO associated vasculitis (or anti-MPO antibodies
      without vasculitis) and associated pulmonary fibrosis might benefit from the use of
      Pirfenidone. However, the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with anti-MPO
      associated vasculitis and associated pulmonary fibrosis has not been evaluated. This study
      was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in patients with pulmonary
      fibrosis and anti-MPO ANCA associated vasculitis or anti-MPO antibodies without vasculitis.
