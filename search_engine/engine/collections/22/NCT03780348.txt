      Weight-for-height/length z score (WHZ) is one of the indicators used to assess nutritional
      status of children. In the existing method, the assessment involves three steps; measuring
      height, measuring weight and deciding WHZ using a reference graphs or tables. The assessment
      takes significant time and has wider room for errors. Due to these drawbacks, it is not used
      at community level where regular active finding takes place.

      A new tool is developed to address these drawbacks. It reduces the steps to two aiming at
      reducing errors and saving time and energy. This study will compare efficiency and
      reliability of WHZ assessments done with the new tool against the existing method using a
      diagnostic randomized clinical trial.

      Trained health workers will do WHZ assessments in under five children mobilized for nutrition
      screening program. The 'average time' needed and proportions of 'classification errors' will
      be compared between the new and the existing methods. Assessments done by two anthropometry
      experts will be used as gold standard.

      The study will determine the gains of the new tool and can potentially change the global
      practice and help early detection of huge number of wasted children that are being missed.
