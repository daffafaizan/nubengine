    
      General anesthesia will be induced by intravenous dosis of fentanyl, vecuronium and etomidate
      and further maintained either by inhaled desflurane or propofol infusion, with concomitant
      empirically administered fentanyl doses and continuous infusion of vecuronium.

      After induction of anesthesia a Swan-Ganz catheter for continuous cardiac output, right
      ventricle end diastolic volume and blood saturation measurements will be introduced through
      the internal jugular vein. A transesophageal echocardiography probe will be placed
      additionally for the Tei-index measurement.

      Hemodynamic parameters will be recorded at the following time points:

        -  before induction

        -  after induction

        -  during trachea intubation

        -  before skin incision

        -  3 Min. after skin incision

        -  after sternotomy

        -  before heart positioning for graft placing

        -  before finishing placing each distal anastomoses

        -  10, 20, 30, 40 min after placing the last anastomoses

        -  10 Min. after admission to ICU, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours after surgery.

        -  TEE measurements will be obtained after sternotomy and 20 Min after placing the last
           distal anastomoses.

      The results will be compared while using the parametric ANOVA test for normally distributed
      continuous data or the nonparametric Kruskal-Wallis/Wilcoxon-U test for categoric or
      inhomogeneous distributed continuous data.
