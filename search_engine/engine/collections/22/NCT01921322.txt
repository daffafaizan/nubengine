    
      Primary objective:

      To compare the length of time to achieve target glucose range using Self-Monitoring Blood
      Glucose (SMBG), as reference method, with the 722 Paradigm Real-Time insulin pump versus MDI

      Secondary Objectives:

      To compare glycemic variability (using CGM as reference method) with the 722 Paradigm
      Real-Time insulin pump versus MDI

      This is a prospective, randomized (open label), multi-center study. The clinical study staff
      will conduct screening tests according to inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to verify the
      subject's eligibility for the study.

      Inpatient Period A patient is admitted into hospital for treatment of diabetes

      Randomization

      Subjects are randomized (at a 1:1 ratio) to group A or B in the study database. A total of 80
      subjects will be randomized into 2 study groups:

        -  Group A will wear 722 Paradigm Real-Time System (treated with 24h per day insulin
           infusion)

        -  Group B will be on MDI and wear the CGMS-Gold (treated with 4 insulin injections).

      It is anticipated that the total duration for the study will be within one year from site
      initiation to finalization of all data entry and monitoring.

      Each subject will participate in the study approximately 2 weeks.
