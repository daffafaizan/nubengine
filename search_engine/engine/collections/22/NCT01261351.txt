    
      100 pre-eclamptic patients will be compared to 200 control patients (100 control matched on
      gestational age at inclusion and 100 control matched on delivery mode (section).

      Blood and urine samples will be collected at PE diagnosis, delivery and post partum.

      Two axes will be considered:

        1. Thrombography, or kinetic measurement of thrombin generation, by studying the coagulant
           profile according to Hemker's method in CAT System (Calibrated Automated Thrombogram)
           and by thromboelastogram in ROTEM technique (delocalized coagulation analyzer), in
           parallel to specific activation markers (thrombin-antithrombin complex, fibrin
           monomers).

        2. The balance of prostacyclin/thromboxane A2 by using ELISA method for urine samples and
           genotype-phenotype correlation (Polymorphism of prostacyclin-synthetase's promoter
           CYP8A1).
