      have a poor self esteem and difficulties to express their own wishes. In this study
      investigators suggest an analysis of a type of memory, that is known to be essential, to
      profile an identity functioning: self-defining memories. To date, no study has explored SDM
      in women with IPV. The characteristics of the SDM in women victims of IPV will be compared to
      a group of women who has never been diagnosed in this situation. Those memories could be used
      in therapy. A French adaptation of the questionnaire proposed by Singer & Moffitt (1992) will
      be used (Berna et al., 2011a, 2011b) for the assessment of SDM.

      Four elements will be study: specificity, meaning, content, affect.

      The two groups will have two visits:

        -  the first to verify inclusion criteria and assessed psychotraumatic and depressive
           symptoms;

        -  the last to characterize the SDM.
