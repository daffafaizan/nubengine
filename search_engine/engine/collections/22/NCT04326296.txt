           Each team was included in the group of three people.Cohort B: pd-l1 monoclonal antibody
           900mg q3w+ lenalidomide 25mg/d, administration for 21 days/discontinuation for 7
           days;Cohort C: pd-l1 monoclonal antibody 20mg/kg q3w+ lenalidomide 25mg/d,
           administration for 21 days/discontinuation for 7 days.If none of the 3 patients in
           cohort A in phase 1 showed dose limited toxicity (DLT) within 21 days of their first
           use, they were enrolled in cohort B, and so on.If 1 of the first 3 subjects in a dose
           group developed DLT during the DLT observation period after the first combination
           administration, an additional 3 subjects were added to the dose group.If none of the
           additional 3 subjects developed DLT, the next incremental dose group was entered.If DLT
           appears in 1 or more of the additional 3 subjects, the investigator shall decide whether
           to adjust the regimen, or increase the regimen, or terminate the climb.If DLT appears in
           2 or more subjects in the initial 3 subjects of a dose group during the observation
           period of the first combined DLT, the investigator shall decide whether to adjust the
           dosing regimen, or increase the dosing regimen, or terminate the climbing.

        2. In phase 2, 24 patients will be further included under the initially determined dose
           level and the appropriate administration regimen. Disease control rate (DCR) will be
           calculated according to the data obtained in phase 1, and the group with the highest DCR
           dose will be selected for the expansion study.
