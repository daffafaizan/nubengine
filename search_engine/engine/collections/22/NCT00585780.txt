      double-blind placebo controlled laboratory study with 40 individuals meeting current alcohol
      dependence criteria (DSM-IVTR) who are admitted to the Clinical Neuroscience Research Unit
      and initiated on Prazosin vs Placebo (16mg/day) after admission and initial detoxification
      (if required). Experimental laboratory sessions are conducted after subjects achieved full
      dose after the 2-week titration, in week 3-4 of inpatient stay. The laboratory outcomes
      included alcohol craving, anxiety, negative affect and neuroendocrine and sympathetic arousal
      measures. Individuals who wished to remain on study medication for the outpatient (Arm 2)
      were maintained on study medication throughout the outpatient phase for a total period of 12
      weeks.

      Arm 2 of the POC study is a 12-week randomized clinical trial (RCT) of Prazosin (16mg/day)
      versus Placebo in 100 treatment seeking alcohol dependent individuals, to assess whether high
      anxiety and distress, including alcohol craving, manifest as increased alcohol withdrawal
      symptoms at treatment entry moderates Prazosin effects on alcohol use outcomes. Primary
      alcohol use outcomes include heavy drinking days, any drinking days and secondarily
      drinks/day. Additional secondary outcomes include alcohol craving, anxiety and mood symptoms
      and sleep disturbances. Patients from Arm 1 who wished to continue on study medication for
      the outpatient phase were included in Arm 2. Arm 2 patients were initiated on study
      medication upon presenting with a negative breathalyzer without any minimum pre-treatment
      alcohol abstinence period prior to medication initiation.
