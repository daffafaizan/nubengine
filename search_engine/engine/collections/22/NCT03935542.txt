      coronary intervention (PCI). Despite the recent advances in PCI techniques and stent
      technology, most randomized studies failed to prove the superiority of systematic 2 stenting
      strategy compared with provisional side branch intervention strategy.

      A certain amount of ischemic burden is required to achieve the benefit of revascularization
      over medical treatment. Compared with major epicardial vessels, side branches are smaller,
      more variable in anatomy, supplying less myocardium and less clinically relevant. Therefore,
      it is important to assess the myocardial mass at risk of side branches to determine the
      appropriate treatment strategy for bifurcation lesions. However, how to define the clinically
      relevant side branches which can be associated with the benefit of revascularization in a
      cardiac catheterization laboratory is not well-known.

      The investigators performed this study to investigate the anatomical attributes that
      determine ischemic burden and myocardial territory of diagonal branches and to develop a
      prediction model for a clinically relevant diagonal branch using myocardial perfusion imaging
      (MPI) and coronary CT angiography (CCTA).
