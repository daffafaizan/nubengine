      group and Sham group. Stroke patients in both groups will participate in a 20-session gait
      training program, which includes overground walking and stair climbing exercises. Robotic
      group will walk with the powered Ankle Robot, which provide ankle dorsiflexion support during
      swing phase of walking; Sham group will walk with the Ankle Robot with very low assistance
      level, which provide only tactile feedback but no ankle support in order to evaluate the
      placebo effect. A series of clinical assessments will be carried out to assess the functional
      recovery in stroke patients before and after the gait training program.
