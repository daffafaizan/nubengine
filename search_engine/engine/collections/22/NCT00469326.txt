      myocardial in patient with stable angina during elective PCI. These data provide
      evidence-based support for using atorvastatin 7 days before PCI (dosage 40mg/d),
      alternatively three or more days (unknown dosage). We want to confirm this results for
      shorter pre-treatment period (two days) with dosage 80mg per day.
