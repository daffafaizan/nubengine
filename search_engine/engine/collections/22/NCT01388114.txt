      inflammatory and coagulation response. The mortality rate associated with septic shock is
      high, up to 40-70%. Currently, the diagnosis of sepsis depends on microbial infection and
      systemic inflammatory response syndrome, which lacks sensitivity and specificity.
      Accordingly, Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) offered new recommendations about the
      diagnosis of sepsis in 2001, which included the serum level of procalcitonin (PCT). Increased
      PCT levels through the clinical course correlated with higher mortality in critically-ill
      patients. On the other hand, recent studies also showed PCT levels could guide the antibiotic
      treatment in patients with sepsis or lower respiratory tract infection. Besides usage in
      sepsis population, serum PCT level could also be used for aids in diagnosis of bacterial
      infection and for guide of antibiotic treatment in acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive
      airway disease. However, current method of PCT assay depends on the Kryptor system developed
      by BRAHMS, Germany, with the functional sensitivity of 60 pg/mL. Each assay costs 1300 NT
      dollars, which is too expensive for serial follow-up of serum PCT levels. A real-time
      diagnostic technique with e- Ab sensor for serum PCT level measurement will offer a test with
      lower cost, and increase the applicability of serum PCT level in daily clinical practice.
      Here, the investigators conduct a study to develop a real-time diagnostic technique with e-
      Ab sensor for serum PCT level measurement in patients with sepsis.
