      not been shown to be as effective alone without the physical therapy. However, there are
      multiple studies that document the benefit of adding a steroid injection to the physical
      therapy. After a review of the literature, there are studies that compare different dosages
      of intra-articular steroid injections,value and site of the injections, and accuracy of
      clinical injections. There are currently no studies that compare the results after
      intra-articular versus subacromial injections in combination with physical therapy. This
      study would help us determine if location of the injection is a major factor in regaining
      motion. If it is significantly important to be intra-articular with the steroid, than it may
      be important to send patients for fluoroscopic guided injections routinely rather than risk
      the chance of not being within the joint.
