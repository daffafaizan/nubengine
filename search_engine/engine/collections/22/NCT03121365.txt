    
      This study has three main objectives. The first is to test the effects of digital versus
      standard literacy promotion by way of a randomized controlled trial design. The second aim is
      to explore the reading behaviors and reading activities between parents and their infants
      when comparing the use of e-books to standard board books. The third aim is to identify
      themes regarding dialogical reading behaviors among parents participating in the video
      sub-study.

      Participants will be stratified by clinic site and randomized to receive literacy promotion
      using 1) standard early reader board books or 2) digital electronic early reader e-books. We
      will recruit and consent one hundred eligible parent-infant dyads, with the infant being
      between 5 and 7 months of age at enrollment.

      In this intervention, parent-infant dyads randomized to the digital arm will receive
      developmentally appropriate e-books. Those randomized to the standard arm will receive
      developmentally appropriate board books. Participants will receive either the e-book or board
      book at the time of their 6, 9 and 12 month well visits. In addition to the books,
      parent-infant dyads in both arms will be provided information on the importance of early
      parent-child reading activity by pediatric clinicians using the Reach Out and Read framework.

      The main outcome will be differences in Bayley-3 Composite scores between groups. Secondary
      aims include differences in StimQ Reading Subscale Scores and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression
      Scale Scores between groups.
