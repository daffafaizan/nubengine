      to improve temperature in preterm newborns in the delivery room (DR), hypothermia on
      admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at NMH is common. In a cohort of infants
      < 32 weeks' gestation born at NMH in 2019, 54% of infants had a rectal temperature < 36.5 oC
      on admission to the NICU.(2)

      Many preterm infants have procedures performed soon after admission to the NICU; in 2019, 98%
      of infants born before 29 weeks' gestation at NMH had an umbilical venous catheter inserted.
      This may/often involve(s) prolonged periods of handling and potential exposure to cold.

      The investigators prospectively studied a cohort of 26 infants < 32 weeks who had invasive
      procedures within 3 hours of birth performed in the NICU at NMH between November 2018 and
      June 2019. Almost three-quarters [19/26 (73%)] had an abnormal temperature at the beginning
      of the procedure; and 17/26 (65%) had an abnormal temperature at the end of the procedure.
      Only 3 (11%) infants maintained a normal temperature throughout the procedure. Perhaps more
      concerning is the severity of the hypothermia observed; 13 (50%) infants had a temperature <
      36.0oC before and 11 (42%) after the procedure. The median duration of procedure was 53 (37,
      73) minutes.(3)

      The investigators think that in extremely preterm infants, placing a peripheral intravenous
      cannula on admission to the NICU, instead of umbilical catheters (UVC and/or UAC), will
      increase the proportion of infants with a rectal temperature in the normal range at 2 hours
      of life.
