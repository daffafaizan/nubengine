      of the scapula and the buttocks and sometimes radiates to the lower extremities. In the

      cases are chronic. Appropriate use of assessment questionnaires is one of the most important
      steps in the evaluation of the functional level of the patient and in deciding on an
      effective treatment protocol. The purpose of study is to determine the Turkish version,
