    
      MARIO-3 (Macrophage Reprogramming in Immuno-Oncology) is a prospective Phase 2 multi-arm,
      multicenter, open-label, combination cohort study designed to evaluate IPI-549, Infinity
      Pharmaceutical's first-in-class, oral immuno-oncology product candidate targeting
      immune-suppressive tumor-associated myeloid cells through selective inhibition of
      phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)-gamma. IPI-549 will be administered in combinations with
      Tecentriq and Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) in front-line triple negative breast cancer (TNBC)
      and in combination with Tecentriq and Avastin (bevacizumab) in front-line renal cell cancer
      (RCC).

      This study will enroll approximately 90 treatment-na√Øve patients across the following disease
      cohorts. Cohort A will be composed of patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic
      triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Cohort B will be composed of patients with locally
      advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      The primary objective of MARIO-3 is to evaluate the complete response (CR) rate per Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 following combination treatment with
      IPI-549 and front-line treatment in patients with TNBC and RCC. Its secondary objectives
      include evaluation of the safety, objective response rate (ORR), time to CR (TTCR), time to
      response (TTR), duration of CR (DOCR), duration of response (DOR), and progression-free
      survival (PFS).
