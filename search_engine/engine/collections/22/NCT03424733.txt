      the brain and spine. Currently, there are several treatments designed to decrease the
      frequency of attacks and delay disease progression. One of these treatments, interferon beta,
      has shown the potential to decrease relapse rates by approximately 30%, but because the body
      quickly clears these proteins, patients require more frequent dosing. Another interferon
      therapy called pegylated interferon beta-1a (Plegridy) was released and it was shown to last
      longer in the body than interferon beta-1a. This is why Plegridy can be take by an injection
      into tissue under the skin once every 14 days. However, some of the most common side effects
      of interferon beta therapy include flu-like symptoms and injection skin reactions, which can
      often cause patients to want to stop treatment. Clinical practitioners often advise patients
      to take acetaminophen (Tylenol) or aspirin before the injection in order to prevent the onset
      or decrease the severity of flu-like symptoms. A previous study with patients taking
      interferon beta-1a showed that taking a low dose oral steroid (prednisone) in addiction to a
      medication like Tylenol reduced flu-like symptoms compared to just taking Tylenol by itself.
      Because Plegridy lasts longer in the body and has more convenient dosing for patients,
      researchers in this study decided to investigate whether taking prednisone in addition to
      acetaminophen before the injection would help decrease or prevent the occurrence of flu-like
      symptoms and injection site reactions in patients taking the therapy.
