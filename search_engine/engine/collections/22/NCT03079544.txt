      lymphoma with relatively high incidence in China. L-asparaginase based chemotherapy are
      widely used with Chinese patients and has been reported to improve overall response and
      prolonged the long-term survival in some clinical trials with very limited patients. However,
      most patients were treated out of clinical trials in China. Therefore the real incidence of
      adverse events and treatment outcomes are largely unknown. This study is designed to evaluate
      the incidence of adverse events and treatment outcomes by social media-based
      (www.house086.com, www.wechat.com) self-report from patients who are treated out of clinical
      trials.
