    
      Patients with solitary fibrous tumor will be randomized to receive 6 cycles of trabectedin or
      doxorubicin plus dacarbazine.

      In case of progression or unacceptable toxicity while under the experimental treatment prior
      to the completion of the 6 cycles, the patients will be offered to cross to the other arm
      (trabectedin arm to doxorubicin plus dacarbazine arm and vice versa).
