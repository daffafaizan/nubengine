      xenograft, with the use of Puros Cancellous Particulate Allograft (Puros Cancellous), a
      mineralized allograft, for the augmentation of localized alveolar ridge defects in edentulous
      sites. The purpose of the study will be to determine placement time, ease of use, stability,
      esthetics and to clinically evaluate the efficacy of the list products. A biopsy will be
      taken from a subset of the patient population, at one investigational site, to evaluate the
      grafted site's formation of new bone. The study hypothesis is that if CopiOs Pericardium and
      Puros Cancellous are used, the a single, localized alveolar ridge defect will clinically
      improve at an edentulous site.
