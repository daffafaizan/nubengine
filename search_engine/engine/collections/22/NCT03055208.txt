      Most recurrences develop at the edge of the surgical margin and a common reason for an early
      recurrence of a glioblastoma is when tumors are not completely resected. This may be the case
      when intraoperative neuro-monitoring indicates that further resection would impair certain
      motor functions. Physicians can identify residual tumor in early (24-72h after surgery)
      postoperative MRI scans and could treat these regions. However, this treatment would not be a
      part of the recommended standard of care and thus, any further treatment of this areas will
      need a clinical trial.

      The aim of this trial is to evaluate if the use of another modality to deplete these areas of
      residual tumor identified in early postoperative MRI scans will provide a relevant benefit in
      terms of progression-free survival (which means a prolongation of the time that patients do
      not experience a re-growth of the tumor). The modality is termed "radiosurgery", which is a
      non-invasive technique to delete cells without using a blade but a highly focused beam of
      gamma rays.

      The machine that focusses these rays (like a magnifying glass that can focus light), is
      called 'gamma knife'. Gamma knife radiosurgery is a safe and effective treatment for a
      plethora of malignant and benign brain tumors and the technique is used since the 1950s and
      there has been a continuous improvement of precision and patient comfort up to now.
