      decisions. This is especially true in a trauma setting where the situation in the operating
      room can change drastically in a few seconds. Anesthesiologists who cover trauma calls
      overnight are subject to long work shifts and demanding schedules that may adversely affect
      their performance. In combination with the disruption of circadian rhythm that can occur with
      night shift work, decline in performance from the long work shifts can lead to errors in
      judgment.

      An anonymous questionnaire included two groups of different items were used. Items of the
      first group are about the personal data i.e. age, sex, marital status and parenting status,
      consumption behavior (tea, coffee, carbonated drinks, tobacco, anxiolytics, antidepressants,
      psychotropic agents and sport), and professional activity (number of extended worked shifts
      per month, number of weekends worked per month).

      Items of the second group are related to the night shift itself i.e. number of cases, and the
      rest hours during the shift.

      Psychomotor Vigilance Task, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, Epworth Sleepiness Scale and Trail
      Making Test before and after the shift were performed.
