      40% improvement of pain feeling. Three months later, the pain level was still significantly
      reduced in comparison with the beginning of the treatment, but the clinical improvement was
      less than at the end of the treatment. We thus propose to realize real or sham rTMS sessions
      at 3 weeks interval during 6 months with subjects presenting a significant clinical
      improvement after a 3 week-rTMS or sham treatment to evaluate the response maintenance.
