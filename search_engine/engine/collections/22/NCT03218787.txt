    
      A. Primary Objective:

      To show non-inferiority of the primary endpoint of all death or all MI (modified ARC) from 3
      to 12 months following XIENCE implantation in HBR subjects with HBR treated with 3-month DAPT
      compared to a historical control after propensity score adjustment.

      B. Secondary Objective:

        -  To show superiority of the major secondary endpoint of major bleeding (Bleeding Academic
           Research Consortium [BARC] type 2-5) from 3 to 12 months following XIENCE implantation
           in HBR subjects treated with 3-month DAPT compared to a historical control after
           propensity score adjustment.

        -  To evaluate stent thrombosis (ARC definite/probable) from 3 to 12 months following
           XIENCE implantation in HBR subjects treated with 3-month DAPT against a performance goal
           (PG).

      Approximately 2,000 subjects from approximately 100 sites globally will be enrolled, with at
      least 50% of subjects in the United States (US) and subject registration was capped at 300
      per site.

      All registered subjects will be followed at 3, 6 and 12 months post index procedure.

      The data collected from this study will be compared with the historical control of
      non-complex HBR subjects treated with standard DAPT duration of up to 12 months from the
      XIENCE V USA study, which is a US post-approval study to evaluate the safety of XIENCE V
      EECSS in "all-comer" population under real-world setting.
