      utilization, mental health, and wellbeing of patients. To do so, the investigators will
      administer a survey to approximately 17,000 subjects of a recent medical financial
      intervention. In that intervention, a non-profit charity, RIP Medical Debt, purchased and
      abolished medical debt for a randomly selected about 6,000 (out of the 17,000) study
      subjects. In this current protocol, the investigators will compare surveyed outcomes of
      subjects who received and did not receive the medical debt abolishment intervention. Because
      debt abolishment was randomized, comparing surveyed outcomes of treated and control subjects
      in the cross-section will allow the study to estimate the causal impact of the medical debt
      abolishment. The survey will measure the effects of medical debt on three sets of outcomes:
      (i) health care utilization, as measured by medical care visits, prescription drug
      utilization and adherence, and unmet need for medical care; (ii) mental health, as measured
      by validated screens for depression and anxiety; and (iii) subjective wellbeing, as measured
      by self-reported health, forgone consumption, and financial strain. This study would be the
      first to provide a direct, causal connection between the rising personal debt associated with
      U.S. health care and the health outcomes of its recipients.
