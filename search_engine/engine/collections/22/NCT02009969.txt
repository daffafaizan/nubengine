      been suggested to be part of the pathology of severe mental illnesses. Studies have shown
      that in persons with bipolar disorder, increased body mass index (BMI) is associated with
      irregular changes in the brain. This association has not been tested in persons with
      psychosis. In this study, we will be measuring abdominal fat distribution as measured by MRI
      to see if this is associated with abnormal brain morphology.
