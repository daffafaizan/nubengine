      of prothrombin induced vitamin K absence or antagonist-II (PIVKA-II) in surveillance program
      for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC). The goal of this study is to compare if
      the testing of AFP + PIVKA-II in intervals of 3 months is more effective in diagnosing early
      stages of HCC than the 6 month interval of AFP that is commonly used
