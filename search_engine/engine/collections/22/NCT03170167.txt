      medicine and mind-body skills group visit for adolescents living with chronic illness and
      their parents. The goal of this study is to evaluate the preliminary efficacy and feasibility
      for these group visits. Approximately 50-100 patients and 50-100 parent enrollees of the
      Communitas group visits will be recruited to participate in this survey study optionally.
      During the group visits, both the patient and parent groups will learn about and experience
      various coping, self-care, pain and stress-reduction modalities, participate in group sharing
      to promote engagement with a diagnosis and provide emotional support, and benefit from
      facilitated discussions about some of the more practical aspects of living with chronic
      illness. The group visits will be offered to patients and their parents as clinical service,
      regardless of enrollment in the survey study, and will be billed to insurance as consult
      group visit with the pediatrician. The group visits will be held at both the Osher Center for
      Integrative Medicine and Mission Bay Children's Hospital and will be led by a pediatrician,
      starting in October 2016. The study will be set up as a pre-post evaluation, without a
      control group, using patient-report and parent-report qualitative and quantitative
      assessments at baseline, after completion of the series of group visits, and 3 months later.
      In addition, some families may be asked if they would like to participate in a videotaped
      interview before and after the start of the program.
