    
      BACKGROUND:

      The proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and purine nucleoside metabolic inhibitor clofarabine
      demonstrated greater than additive activity in combination in preclinical xenograft models,
      justifying the clinical evaluation of this combination for its antitumor activity

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To establish the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib
           and clofarabine in patients with refractory solid tumors, lymphomas, or myelodysplastic
           syndromes (MDS)

        -  To determine the molecular effects of the clofarabine-bortezomib combination on
           biomarkers of cell death and DNA damage in tumor biopsy tissue

        -  To explore the mechanism of action of the bortezomib and clofarabine combination by

      examining markers of DNA damage and apoptosis in tumor cells before and after treatment

      -To characterize the changes in MDS residual disease burden that occur with bortezomib

      and clofarabine treatment

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Study participants must have histologically confirmed solid tumors or lymphomas or
           myelodysplastic syndromes that have progressed on standard therapy known to prolong
           survival or for which no standard treatment options exist

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18

        -  No major surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy within 3 weeks prior to entering the study

        -  Adequate organ function

      STUDY DESIGN:

        -  This is an open-label Phase I trial

        -  The starting dose of clofarabine will be 1 mg/m2 administered intravenously on days 1
           through 5 of a 21-day cycle; bortezomib will be administered at 0.8 mg/m2 subcutaneously
           on days 1 and 4 of a 21-day cycle.

        -  Dose escalation will follow a 3+3 design, with dose limiting toxicities defined during
           cycle 1.

        -  Dose escalation will proceed in cohorts comprised of two separate groups of patients
           (one group of patients with solid tumor/lymphoma and one group of patients with MDS),
           with at least 1 from each group, until hematologic DLT or the second grade 2 hematologic
           toxicity is observed, at which point, dose escalation will proceed separately for two
           cohorts: (1) patients with solid tumors/lymphoma and (2) patients with MDS.

        -  Up to 33 patients will be accrued to a PD expansi n cohort at the MTD to further assess
           pharmacodynamic endpoints in tumor and blood.
