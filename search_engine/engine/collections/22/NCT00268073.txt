      not been well studied. Patients with mild insufficiency tolerate it well; moderate to severe
      insufficiency however is poorly tolerated and can result in the death of the patient or at
      least require re-operation. Re-operation for neo-aortic insufficiency in this small size
      child is a difficult operation and the operative options are very limited. The introduction
      of the Sano modification of the Norwood procedure introduced a new set of variables due to
      the presence of a ventricular incision and possible distortion of the neo-aortic valve. It is
      therefore critical to determine the incidence of neo-aortic insufficiency and compare it to
      the standard Norwood operation, as well as to determine the clinical consequences of the
      presence of this phenomenon immediately postoperatively as well as long-term, up to
      completion of the stage II of the Norwood procedure (Glenn stage).
