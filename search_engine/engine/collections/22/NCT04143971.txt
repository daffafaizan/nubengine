      diet which they will have 3 alternate days in the week eating only 30% of their total energy
      requirement and on the other days of the week they receive a total calorie of 100% of their
      energy requirement , therefore there will be a total of -210% TEE reduction in their received
      energy in the week. the other group will be under continuous calorie restriction meaning on
      all the days of the week they will be eating 70% of their total energy requirement resulting
      in a total of -210% TEE reduction in their received energy in the week. both groups will
      receive 3 consultation sessions with a nutritionist, also to prevent any deficiency,
      multi-vitamin-mineral supplements will be given to both groups participants.
