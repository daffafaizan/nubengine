      psychiatric disorders in the general population, and the co-occurrence of those disorders
      represents a significant public health problem. Levels of alcohol use have been shown to be
      associated with levels of depressive symptoms among comorbid populations. Previous medication
      trials with SSRI antidepressants in this comorbid population have produced disappointing
      results. Mirtazapine is a non-SSRI medication with a unique structure and mechanism of
      action. Recent study results suggest that mirtazapine may be more effective and faster acting
      than other antidepressants. Our own recent open label pilot study suggested robust
      within-group efficacy for mirtazapine for decreasing both the drinking and the depressive
      symptoms of AD/MDD subjects. However, no placebo control group was employed in that study, so
      between-group efficacy versus placebo could not be assessed. The current grant submission
      proposes to conduct a first double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study to provide a
      preliminary assessment of the efficacy of mirtazapine versus placebo for decreasing the
      alcohol use and depressive symptoms of persons with comorbid AD/MDD. If the results of this
      proposed double-blind pilot study are promising, then the effect sizes found in this proposed
      study will be used to help design an adequately-powered R01 treatment trial to definitively
      test the efficacy of mirtazapine versus placebo in this comorbid population.
