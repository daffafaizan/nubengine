      to treat people who have advanced solid tumors. This study will look at the relative
      bioavailability (BA) (Part A), food effect and multiple-dose PK and safety of the oral
      solution (OS) (Part B) and food effect and safety of the enteric-coated tablet (ECT)
      formulation (Part C).

      The study enrolled 53 patients (pts). Prior to initiation of Part A, 4 participants were
      enrolled in a dose escalation cohort. Participants in the study received:

      â€¢ Alisertib 15 mg to 50 mg orally In the first 2 cycles of all 3 parts of the study, a single
      dose of alisertib was administered on Day 1 (PIC or OS in Part A [n=19 pts]; OS, in the fed
      or fasted state, in Part B [n=6 pts]; ECT, in the fed or fasted state, in Part C [n=24 pts]),
      In Part A, participants then continued on the PIC formulation at 40 mg BID for 7 days (Days 3
      - 9). In Part B, participants continued on the OS formulation at a calculated dose
      administered BID for 7 days (Days 3 - 9). In Part C, the ECT formulation was continued at 40
      mg BID for 7 days (Days 3 - 9); however, dose escalation to 50 mg BID was permitted after
      Cycle 1 based on tolerability and safety findings in the prior cycles. All participants took
      doses at a gap of 12 hours each day for 7 days followed by a 14-day rest period in a 21-days
      cycle for the remaining cycles.

      This multi-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was 30 months. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, and final
      assessments were performed approximately 30 days after last dose of study drug.
