    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of escalating doses of radiotherapy (RT)
      administered concomitantly with a fixed dose of cisplatin and etoposide within the same
      overall treatment time.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of radiation therapy.

      Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) or intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy (IMRT) 5 days a week for 8 weeks. Patients also receive cisplatin intravenously
      (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 8, 28, and 36 and etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-5
      and 28-32.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 8 weeks and 6 months.
