      improved nutrition seems to be a good solution to the challenges with low physical activity
      level, poor physical fitness, poor nutrition and psychosocial health challenges among
      children and adolescents. Low physical activity levels and physical fitness is recognized as
      one of the major public health challenges in the 21st century, and it negatively affects
      cognitive skills and academic performances. Providing school based health promoting
      interventions makes it easier to reach all children and adolescents regardless of social and
      cultural background, and hence reduce social inequalities in health.
