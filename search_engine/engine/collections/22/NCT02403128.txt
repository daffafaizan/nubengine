      complete eye exam, including IOP measurement, color photos and intravenous fluorescein
      angiography, spectral domain OCT and vitals. Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be
      treated with an intravitreal injection of 2.0 mg aflibercept under usual aseptic precautions.
      Follow up visits will be on Day 7, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180. At each follow-up visit,
      best-corrected ETDRS visual acuity, IOP measurement and central foveal thickness (CFT) by
      SDOCT will be obtained. Color photos and IVFA will be performed at month 3 and 6 visits.

      Retreatment shall be performed no sooner than two months after previous injection for one or
      more the following criteria 1. CFT >310 microns 2. Intraretinal or subretinal fluid on SDOCT
      3. Increase in CFT by 50 or more microns from the lowest value observed after intravitreal
      aflibercept injection 4. Decrease in vision by 5 or more letters frpm the previous visit
      associated with OCT evidence of macular edema. 5. Appearance of new hemorrhage on color
      photographs.

      Final follow-up will be at six months. Data collected will include, change in ETDRS visual
      acuity from the baseline, change in CFT, number of injections, number of eyes completely dry
      by SDOCT, and number of eyes with a thrombosed RAM by IVFA.
