      associated with several cardiometabolic risk factors; insulin resistance, diabetes,
      dyslipidemia, central adiposity, that increase risk for MI and stroke. A new class of drugs
      used to treat type 2 diabetes has been introduced; Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV)-inhibitors
      (Januvia®, Onglyza®, alogliptin). Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPPIV)-inhibition could be a safe
      and effective therapy for HIV-associated insulin resistance and diabetes. However, no safety
      data exist. The research question is: If HIV+ adults with stable immunologic (CD4+ T-cell
      count >350 cells/μL) and virologic (plasma HIV RNA <50 copies/mL) function are given a
      DPPIV-inhibitor would their CD4+ T-cell count and plasma HIV RNA level increase, decrease, or
      stay the same? Theoretically, DPPIV-inhibition could enhance their immune system by
      increasing SDF-1α levels; a potent inhibitor of HIV-entry into T-cells, or harm the HIV+
      immune system by inactivating CD26 on immune cells. We hypothesize that DPPIV-inhibition will
      not harm the immune system in HIV+ people. We propose a blinded randomized controlled pilot
      safety trial of an FDA-approved DPPIV-inhibitor in virologically- and immunologically-stable
      HIV+ men and women. We will monitor CD4+ T-cell count, plasma HIV RNA levels, immune
      activation markers, and safety outcomes (lipid/lipoprotein profiles, blood pressure, kidney
      and liver function) during 4-6 months of DPPIV-inhibitor exposure vs placebo in 20 HIV+
      adults. If safety is confirmed, the efficacy of DPPIV-inhibition in HIV+ with insulin
      resistance will be tested in future trials that examine potential glucoregulatory and
      cardiovascular benefits.
