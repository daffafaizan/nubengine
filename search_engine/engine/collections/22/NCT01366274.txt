      smaller tidal volumes and prevention of loss of positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP).
      There is concern that manual hyperinflation (MHI) may conflict with this strategy and cause
      volutrauma and atelectrauma potentially leading to biotrauma.

      This single-blinded randomized study aims to compare two methods of manual hyperinflation
      (protective - moderate tidal volumes with positive end expiratory pressure) and
      non-protective (large tidal volume and no positive end expiratory pressure) in ventilated
      acute trauma patients, to investigate the effect on inflammatory markers, lung compliance,
      oxygenation and sputum volume.
