      craving for cigarettes in smokers undergoing pharmacological treatment with Bupropion
      (Zyban)for 2 months. We compare cue-induced reactivity to smoking videos in smokers who were
      successfully treated with Bupropion to smokers who are still smoking. We measured the brain's
      metabolic activity after exposure to videotapes showing smoking and neutral scenes in
      Positron Emission Tomography using FDG. There were 2 scanning sessions, one with a smoking
      videotape and one with a neutral video separated by a week. So far we have compared the
      brain's metabolic activity in 6 abstinent smokers and 6 still smokers.
