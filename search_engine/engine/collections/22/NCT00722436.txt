      significant blood loss in small children and infants. Patients may experience blood losses
      that exceed one to two blood volumes. In an effort to reduce our transfusion requirements, we
      have introduced tranexamic acid into our practice. However, the benefit of tranexamic acid in
      pediatric craniofacial surgery has not yet been reported. We hypothesize that the
      intraoperative use of tranexamic acid in pediatric patients presenting for craniofacial
      reconstructions will reduce blood loss and allogeneic transfusion requirements.

      This is a randomized, blinded, prospective study that will investigate the potential benefit
      of tranexamic acid to reduce the intraoperative bleeding and blood transfusions in pediatric
      patients undergoing craniofacial surgeries. An initial dose of 100 mg/kg tranexamic acid
      (Cyclokapron 100mg/ml) or an equal volume of a placebo will be administered over 15 minutes
      after the induction of anesthesia and before the skin incision. A maintenance infusion of 10
      mg/kg/hr of tranexamic acid or equal volume of a placebo will be started upon completion of
      the initial dose and will be continued until skin closure. The primary outcome will include
      the reduction in the total volume of allogeneic erythrocytes.
