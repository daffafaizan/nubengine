      protein expressions in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded human breast cancer tissue
      specimens. Results from the Ki-67 test is indicated as an aid in the assessment of the
      protein status of breast cancer patients. While the p53 kit provides the antibody that offer
      direct visualization and semi-quantification of the protein expression through a brightfield
      microscope, the GenASIs GoPath system is designed to complement the routine workflow of the
      pathologist in the analysis and review of immunohistochemically stained histologic slides.
