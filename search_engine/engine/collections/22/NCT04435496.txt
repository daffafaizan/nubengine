    
      This study is a mono-center, open-label, single-arm (non-randomized trial, in which each
      participant receives GYN-CS® 3 or GYN-CS® 10) prospective study for the insertion evaluation
      of GYN-CS®. Providing no complications occur, the women will remain in the study for 3 years.

      The study will be conducted in 20 healthy women between 18 and 48 years scheduled for
      elective Caesarean section.

      The learning curve parameters are the time of the procedure (starts after removal of the
      placenta when the uterus is completely empty and ends when the device is correctly inserted)
      and a scale for the ease of insertion of the device.

      Following insertion of GYN-CS® 3 and 10, women will be reexamined at discharge, at 6-8 weeks,
      at 1, 2 and 3 years after insertion. At 3 years after insertion of the GYN-CS® 3, it will be
      removed during the follow-up visit. At 3 years after insertion of the GYN-CS® 10, the device
      doesn't need to be removed at the follow-up visit. During every visit a vaginal ultrasound
      and gynecological examination are performed as well as a satisfactory scale of the IUD is
      questioned at the patient.
