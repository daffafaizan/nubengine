      I. Determine the therapeutic activity of intrathecal topotecan, in terms of response rate and
      time to central nervous system (CNS) progression, in pediatric patients with recurrent or
      refractory neoplastic meningitis.

      II. Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate the
      concentration of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease type (acute lymphoblastic leukemia vs.
      other leukemia/lymphoma vs medulloblastoma vs other solid tumors). (Recurrent CNS acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia stratum only open to accrual as of 11/30/04)

      INDUCTION: Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride intrathecally (IT) over 5 minutes twice
      weekly for 6 weeks.

      CONSOLIDATION: Beginning 1 week after completion of induction, patients receive topotecan
      hydrochloride IT over 5 minutes weekly for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE: Beginning 2 weeks after completion of consolidation, patients receive topotecan
      hydrochloride IT over 5 minutes twice monthly for 4 months and then monthly through year 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months, every 3
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-77 patients will be accrued for this study.
