      combination with LBH589 in all solid tumors, lymphomas; and enriched for EBV driven tumors.
      The phase 2 component will be a single arm, non-randomized study restricted to nasopharyngeal
      carinoma only (endemic type).

      A "3+3" dose escalation design will be adopted. Patients will start taking LBH589 three times
      a week and will have a run in period of one week, followed by continous administration of
      RAD001 from week 2. Pharmacokinetic assessments will be done on day 1 of LBH589
      administration and day 1 of concurrent administration of LBH589 + RAD001. ON day 31, there
      will be a one week drug holiday. This is done to explore the eliminaition kinetics from
      steady state,as well as the durability of target modulation.

      AEs of patients will be monitored closely. In the event of grade 3/4 toxicity, the cohort
      will be expanded to 6. Dose escalation of LBH589/RAD001 may proceed until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD)is reached. Once the MTD is established, an expasion cohort comprising 20
      EBV driven tumors will open at two different LBH589 dose schedules.

      Treatment will be continued until progression of disease, unacceptable toxcity, or
      discontinuation criterion is met.
