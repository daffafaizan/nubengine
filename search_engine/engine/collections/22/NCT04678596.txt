      after the orthodontic treatment, and in addition to orthodontic model and photograph records
      before, during and after the treatment. Patient comfort and satisfaction will be evaluated by
      applying questionnaires to patients before treatment, immediately after starting treatment, 2
      days later, 1 week later, 1 month later, 1 week before and after the treatment, and the
      effects of 2 different treatment methods on the patients will be evaluated according to the
      data obtained. QLF recordings are also taken at the beginning of treatment and at 3-month
      intervals, and the effects of single plaque use and 3 different plaque use on white spot
      lesion formation will be evaluated.

      Hays Nance analysis will be used in the orthodontic models to determine the change in the
      amount of perplexity. In this way, tooth movement speeds can be determined. There are studies
      in the literature with single-stage transparent plates, but there are no studies with
      different-stage plates. In our study, which of the two different types of treatment is more
      comfortable on patients and affects the movement of teeth faster; In addition, the
      investigators plan to investigate which one has a low risk of white spot lesions on the
      teeth.
