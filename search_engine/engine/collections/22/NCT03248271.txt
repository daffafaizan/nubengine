      diabetes and another 25% is at risk for diabetes. Elderly patients with diabetes are at
      increased risk for disability and reduction in their instrumental and basic activities of
      daily living. The prevalence of frailty is higher in people with diabetes that with age
      matched controls without diabetes. One of the major contributing factors to frailty is
      sarcopenia.

      Insulin is an important anabolic hormone that prevents protein breakdown and to a lesser
      extent stimulates protein synthesis. There is some evidence that the ability of insulin to
      stimulate anabolic processes may be reduced in diabetes.

      Insulin has cardiovascular properties, resulting in simultaneous adrenergic and vasodilatory
      responses that have opposing influences on blood pressure. Epidemiological studies have
      demonstrated that the use of insulin is a risk factor for syncope.

      The investigators will study 30 older adults age 65 and older with type 2 diabetes who have
      never taken insulin to manage their diabetes but now need insulin to manage their diabetes.
      Data will be compared pre insulin start and 3 and 6 months after starting insulin.
