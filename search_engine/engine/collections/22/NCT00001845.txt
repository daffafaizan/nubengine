      quantitate regional increases in cerebral blood flow. The purpose of this study is to acquire
      the technical experience required to perform MR perfusion imaging studies of the hypercapnic
      cerebral blood flow response. Cerebral blood flow will be increased by inhalation of carbogen
      (an air mixture containing 5% CO2) or IV injection of the carbonic anhydrase inhibitor
      acetazolamide. The technical experience obtained in this study will be used to design a study
      of the pharmacological and physiological mechanisms underlying cerebral blood flow increases
      during hypercapnia.
