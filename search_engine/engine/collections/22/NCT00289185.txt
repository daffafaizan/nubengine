    
      This is a phase 2b trial designed to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of RTS,S/AS02D
      when co-administered with a multivalent DTPw/Hib (Aventis Pasteur's TETRActHib vaccine).
      Infants randomized to the control group will receive a licensed hepatitis B vaccine,
      Engerix-B in place of RTS,S/AS02D.

      Data pertaining to RTS,S/AS02D or Engerix-B will be collected in a double blinded manner;
      data relating to TETRActHib will be collected in an open fashion.

      Oral polio vaccine (OPV) will be administered at birth, 8, 12, 16 weeks in co-administration
      with other vaccines and will not be administered as part of this protocol. Antibody titers to
      OPV will not be assessed as part of this protocol.
