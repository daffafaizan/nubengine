      demonstrated that catheter ablation not only improves the quality of life but also reduces
      the risk of stroke and all cause mortality. However, until now the guideline has recommended
      the continuation of oral anticoagulation (OAC) therapy in patients who are at risk of stroke
      or systemic embolism (SE) based on the CHA2DS2-VASc score, even though they have sinus rhythm
      following catheter ablation. The aims of this retrospective study is to assess the rate of
      stroke/SE during follow-up period after AF ablation and identify the independent risk factors
      for stroke/SE in patients who underwent catheter ablation for AF.
