      molecular events provoking their onset have not been yet identified. Drug delivery techniques
      have to overcome the almost impermeable blood-brain barrier (BBB) and can be grouped into two
      main categories: (i) invasive and targeted, and (ii) non-invasive and non-targeted methods.
      However, the technological advances of the past decades revealed the immense potential of
      focused ultrasound (FUS) in transcranial applications. In contrast to other techniques,
      FUS-mediated BBB opening is both non-invasive and targeted. The localized energy delivery
      coupled with the circulation of intravenously administered microbubbles initiates biological
      effects confined only to the vessel walls and contained only in the targeted region within
      the brain.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and feasibility of focused
      ultrasound-induced blood-brain barrier opening in Alzheimer's disease patients, using a
      single-element transducer with neuronavigation guidance. The investigators will also test
      whether treatment with focused ultrasound alone alters the amyloid protein levels in the
      treated brain areas and its potential effects on the cognitive function of Alzheimer's
      patients.
