    
      Therasphere consists of glass microspheres containing a radioactive material called
      Yttrium-90.

      Therasphere is delivered into the liver tumor through a catheter placed into the hepatic
      artery which is the artery that provides the main blood supply to the tumor, this way
      delivering the radioactive material directly to the tumor and sparing the rest of the liver
      tissue from radiation.
