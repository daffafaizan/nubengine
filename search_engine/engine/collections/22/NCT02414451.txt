      social interaction, and secondarily on language tasks, anxiety, adaptive behaviors, and
      global function in high functioning adults and adolescents with autism in a double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled trial. The investigators will also examine whether response to treatment
      can be predicted based upon markers of autonomic functioning, such as skin conductance and
      heart rate variability, and whether anxiety predicts treatment response. The investigators'
      hypothesis is that social functioning and language abilities will benefit from serial doses
      of propranolol, as the investigators have demonstrated in previous single-dose studies. The
      investigators also predict that those with the greatest degree of autonomic dysregulation
      will demonstrate the greatest benefit from the drug.
