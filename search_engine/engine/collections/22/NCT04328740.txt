        -  To establish the safety of oral TP-1454 administered once daily in patients with
           advanced metastatic or progressive solid tumors a monotherapy and in patients who are
           eligible for standard of care treatment with ipilimumab and nivolumab as combination
           therapy

        -  To establish the dose of TP-1454 recommended to be used alone and in combination with
           ipilimumab and nivolumab in future studies for selected advanced solid tumors

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To establish the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of orally administered TP-1454 alone and
           in combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab

        -  To observe patients for any evidence of antitumor activity of TP 1454 alone and in
           combination with ipilimumab and nivolumab by objective radiographic assessment
