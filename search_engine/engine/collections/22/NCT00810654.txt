      the effects of 8 g wheat protein ingestion in patients with celiac disease.

      Fourteen patients with coeliac disease, 18-70 years old are recruited. During the first
      period, patients consume once daily a gluten-containing food product with the AN-PEP enzyme
      for 2 weeks. After a 2-week washout period (second period), patients enter the third period
      of this study, and are randomized to one of two groups and consume the same gluten-containing
      food product with AN-PEP or placebo.

      Period 1: Patients are given a food product containing 8 g of wheat protein, to which AN-PEP
      is added, once daily for 14 d.

      Period 2: Wash-out period of 14 d. During this period, patients will consume a gluten-free
      diet.

      Period 3: Patients who are negative for coeliac disease symptoms during the 1st period will
      be randomized across two groups. Both groups receive a food product containing 8 g of wheat
      protein once daily for 14 d. One group receives additional AN-PEP with the gluten meal
      whereas the other group receives the placebo.

      Patients will visit the outpatient clinic five times; one visit before the start of the
      study, a visit during and at the end of the first period, and a visit during and at the end
      of the third period. During three of the visits, spike-biopsies are taken from the duodenum
      by oesophago-gastro-duodenoscopy. Blood samples are taken during all of the five visits.
      Patients will also fill in a quality of life questionnaire at the start and the end of the
      first and third period.
