      tolerability and effectiveness of vedolizumab IV in participants with acute intestinal GvHD
      who have received no systemic therapy for the treatment of acute GvHD (prophylaxis
      acceptable) other than corticosteroids.

      The study enrolled 17 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Vedolizumab 300 mg

        -  Vedolizumab 600 mg

      All participants will be infused intravenously at the same time each day throughout the
      study. Vedolizumab IV will be administered on Days 1, 15, 43, 71, and 99. After approximately
      10 participants are enrolled at each dose level and have data available from the Day 28
      evaluation, safety, tolerability, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic (PK), results will be
      assessed for each dose level, and the appropriate dose for subsequent participants in the
      study will be determined.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in multiple countries. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 32 weeks. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic
      after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
