    
      This is an open-label, multi-center, FIH study which employs a single ascending dose (SAD)
      design to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of single IVT doses of
      MHU650 in up to 24 patients with macular edema. The screening period for this study will be
      up to 60 days. A single dose of MHU650 intravitreal injection will be administered at
      Baseline / Day 1 in the study eye. The follow up period will last until Day 60 / end of study
      (EOS) during which ophthalmic, medical and safety laboratories will be performed. A post
      study safety phone contact call will occur 30 days after the EOS visit. Patients can receive
      rescue treatment at any time during the study following MHU650 administration.
