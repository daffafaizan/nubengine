    
      BARD is a 66 week prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial in Blacks
      (individuals who self-report Black ancestry) who have inadequately controlled asthma while
      taking low-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). BARD will examine the efficacy of increasing
      the dose of ICS with or without the addition of a long-acting beta agonist (LABA) to
      determine whether individual patients respond better to one treatment than another and, if
      so, whether the responses are different for children and adults or if they are related to
      genetic ancestry.
