      Despite the fact that many authors suggest that the patients with altered passive eruption
      are more susceptible to gingivitis and periodontitis due to the excess of gingiva, which
      impedes the correct oral hygiene procedure, there is to-date no clinical study confirming
      this assumption. The aim of the present study is therefore to examine the onset, progress and
      the healing of experimental gingivitis in patients with altered passive eruption when
      compared to patients with normal gingival anatomy.

      Study design This is single centre interventional non randomised case-control study.

      Interventions To achieve optimum gingival health and to standardize gingival baseline
      conditions all subjects participated in a pretrial period 7 days before T0. On day 7(T0),
      after professional scaling and polishing a powered toothbrush (Oral-B pro 3000, Braun,
      Procter and Gamble, USA), individually chosen interdental brush (Tepe, Sweden), and standard
      toothpaste (AZ - pro expert, Procter and Gamble, USA), along with oral hygiene instructions,
      were provided. Subjects were instructed to brush the teeth by using powered toothbrush.

      Individual cast models were prepared on alginate impressions. A 2-mm thick film of technical
      wax was set on the supra gingival area at buccal and proximal surfaces of study teeth on test
      quadrant. The stent were delivered at day 0. Subjects were instructed to wear the stent prior
      to the oral hygiene session throughout the experimental gingivitis period to prevent plaque
      removal during brushing of the remaining dentition. On Day 42 (T6): After recording of
      clinical parameters, oral hygiene instruction and an additional session of supragingival
      scaling, as needed, and polishing were given.
