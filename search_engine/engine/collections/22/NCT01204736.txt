      individuals with tetraplegia. As a result, surgical reconstruction of elbow extension via
      tendon transfer is considered a fundamental intervention that benefits the patient, even if
      other tendon transfers aimed at improving hand function are never performed. Presently, there
      are two common tendon transfer surgeries used to restore elbow extension following spinal
      cord injury. These are the posterior deltoid to triceps transfer and the biceps to triceps
      transfer. Both surgeries significantly improve voluntary elbow extension, although there is
      variability in the amount of control that is restored among patients. This study will
      directly compare the performance of the posterior deltoid transfer to the biceps transfer
      with regard to: voluntary elbow extension strength, the ability to activate the transfer, and
      neural factors associated with voluntary and involuntary control of individual muscles. These
      comparisons will be made in functionally relevant postures and will provide fundamental
      information that will improve clinical understanding of the capacity of each of these two
      procedures to restore elbow extension.

      The fundamental hypothesis of this proposal is that an inability to maximally activate the
      transferred posterior deltoid and the transferred biceps significantly limits the elbow
      extension moment that can be produced.
