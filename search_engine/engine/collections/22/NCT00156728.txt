      although the exact prevalence of AF in the heart failure population is still unclear. Recent
      studies show a prevalence of AF ranging from about 10% to 50%, although the type of AF
      observed and investigated in these studies is not always clearly described.

      A number of mechanisms attributed to congestive heart failure may contribute to the
      development of AF Experimental congestive heart failure promotes sustained AF by ionic
      remodeling and increased interstitial fibrosis. In contrast to tachycardia-mediated AF, in
      congestive heart failure no shortening of atrial refractoriness occurs. Atrial tissue stress
      caused by congestive heart failure may also contribute to promotion of AF by inducing
      triggered activity, affecting atrial refractoriness properties or resulting in increased
      tissue mass supporting re-entry [31]. Existence of these mechanisms suggests that treatment
      of congestive heart failure may also influence the development and progression of AF in these
      patients. Conversion of chronic AF has been observed in patients with congestive heart
      failure treated with biventricular pacing Ventricular ionic remodeling likely underlies the
      increased risk for proarrhythmia in heart failure patients exposed to antiarrhythmic drugs,
      prolonging the action potential duration , which therefore should be avoided in patients with
      congestive heart failure.

      The independent prognostic significance of AF in heart failure patients is still not
      completely clear. Results from some recent studies suggest no independent prognostic
      significance of AF in heart failure patients Result from other large studies on congestive
      heart failure suggest an independent prognostic effect of AF in patients with AF and
      congestive heart failure, associated with an increased risk for pump failure death and
      all-cause mortality a significantly reduced 1-year survival and a higher mortality among
      heart failure patients who developed AF A recent review with regard to the mortality in
      studies on congestive heart failure suggests that concomitant AF does not have an additional
      effect on the mortality in patients with severe heart failure, but does increase the
      mortality in the setting of mild-to-moderate heart failure This observation may be attributed
      to the fact that the atrial contribution to left ventricular filling is limited in patients
      with severe diastolic dysfunction, whereas the atrial contribution may still be of
      hemodynamic importance in mild-to-moderate heart failure
