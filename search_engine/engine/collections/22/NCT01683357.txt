      result of a policy for which those patients considered resectable and presenting 4 or more
      lesions, bilobar CLM were systematically approached in a one stage operation.

      Patients were considered unresectable once there was concomitance of more than 3 lung
      metastases, diffuse peritoneal carcinomatosis, and/or extra-hilar lymph node metastasis.

      Outcome measures The primary outcome was the feasibility on an intention-to-treat basis. To
      this purpose we studied the ratio between the number of patients surgically explored and
      those who effectively received resection.

      The secondary outcome was the safety of the procedure. To this purpose we studied morbidity,
      mortality, amount of blood loss, rate of blood transfusions, and postoperative trend of liver
      function tests.

      The tertiary outcome measure was the reliability of the procedure from an oncological
      standpoint. For this purpose we studied the following:

        1. the rate of true local recurrence (cut-edge) after a minimum follow-up of 6 months;

        2. the long-term follow-up, analysing the overall survival (survival after surgery), time
           to recurrence (survival without recurrence), and time to liver recurrence (survival
           without liver recurrence).

        3. the overall survival compared with that based on an intention-to-treat criterion also
           including the outcome of those patients who met the inclusion criteria but resulted
           unresectable on exploration.
