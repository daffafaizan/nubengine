      approval, which didn't require written parental consent. Children age 1-12 years, undergoing
      elective general anesthesia via an inhalation induction were randomized to one of three
      groups of 30 patients each one, for iv placement, either 60s (group E), 90 or 120 s (group L)
      following loss of lid reflex. Movement on iv placement and incidence of laryngospasm were
      determined. Difficulty with iv placement was also recorded. Statistical analysis included
      contingency testing, ANOVA, and non parametric testing. A P-value <0.05 was considered
      significant.
