    
      Twenty-four volunteers will be allocated equally into three groups (i.e. group A, B, C).
      Group A, B, and C will have one, two, and three infections respectively. Every infection will
      be performed with 50 L3 Necator americanus larvae. Group A will receive infection at week 4
      only. Group B will be infected at week 2 and week 4. Group C will be infected at week 0, 2
      and 4. To maintain blinding, group A and B will receive mock infections with water at week 0
      and week 0 and 2 respectively. The interval between each CHHI is 2 weeks. Before every
      infection, the safety will be assessed by a review of adverse events data with a local safety
      monitor.

      Sixteen weeks after the last infection (week 20), all volunteers will be offered treatment
      with a 3-day regimen of albendazole to abrogate infection. Volunteers with average egg counts
      >250 eggs per gram will be asked if they would be willing to keep their infection for a
      maximum of two years (chronic donors). No more than four volunteers will be selected to be
      chronic donors. Six months after the last infection (or after the last donation for the
      chronic donors) volunteers will undergo their last visit.
