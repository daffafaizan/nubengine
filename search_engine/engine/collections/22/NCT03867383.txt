      blood loss during Cesarean section, both in the US and worldwide. Exogenous calcium has been
      shown to increase uterine muscle contraction in in vitro and in animal studies. Calcium is
      also an essential factor in normal blood clotting. Anesthesiologists commonly administer
      intravenous calcium chloride during Cesarean as well as other types of surgery, but formal
      randomized studies to determine efficacy in improving uterine tone have not been performed.

      In this pilot, randomized controlled study, the anesthesiologist will administer a one-time
      dose of intravenous calcium chloride 1gram versus placebo at the time of fetal delivery to
      women identified as having high risk of hemorrhage during Cesarean delivery. Primary outcome
      assessed will be a composite measure of uterine atony. Data from the pilot study will be used
      to perform power and sample size calculations for a larger study. Secondary outcomes assessed
      will include total blood loss, subjective assessment of uterine tone by the blinded
      obstetrician performing surgery, safety, side effects, and pharmacokinetic profile of calcium
      chloride in pregnant women.
