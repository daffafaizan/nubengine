    
      This is a multicenter randomized seamless phase I/II trial with a phase I for determination
      of maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Trifluridine/tipiracil, followed by a randomized phase II
      trial (randomization ratio 2:1) with an experimental arm with Trifluridine/tipiracil in
      combination with standard radiotherapy and a standard - calibration arm (internal control)
      with capecitabine CRT flanked by translational research, designed to assess the clinical
      performance and efficacy of Trifluridine/tipiracil compared to current standard capecitabine
      chemoradiation in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer.

      The primary clinical objective in phase I is to determine the dosage and feasibility of
      Trifluridine/tipiracil based chemoradiation and in phase II whether Trifluridine/tipiracil
      with preoperative chemoradiation improves pathological complete remissions in patients with
      locally advanced rectal cancer.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate Trifluridine/tipiracil chemoradiation with respect
      to disease free survival, overall survival, local regional failure, pathological down-staging
      (ypT0-2N0) rate, tumour regression grade, histopathological R0 resection rate, neoadjuvant
      rectal score (NAR), and perioperative complication rate. Safety and toxicity, according to
      NCI CTC AE v5, quality of life and feasibility of the regimen are further secondary
      objectives that are to be evaluated.
