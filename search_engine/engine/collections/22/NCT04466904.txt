    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, the first trial to
      assess the safety, tolerability, and PK/PD of IBI362 administered as multiple injections in
      Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes. The investigators and subjects will be blinded to the
      study drug IBI362 and placebo. Dulaglutide will be used as an open-label active control
      group. In this trial, 42 eligible patients will be recruited and randomly allocated to three
      cohorts. Each corhot will be randomized as an 8:4:2 ratio to IBI362 (n = 8), placebo (n = 4),
      and Dulaglutide 1.5 mg (n = 2).
