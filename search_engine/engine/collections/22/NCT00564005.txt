      therapy were made. Stroke patients will receive one of these three approaches and be
      evaluated pre- and post-treatment. the treatment will last 3 weeks and 5 days per week. The
      evaluation will include clinical measures of motor function, ADL, and quality of life,
      kinematic performance, and activation patterns of cortex.
