    
      The emergency service of the city of Essen (NRW, Germany), which is organised by the Essen
      fire-department, will perform a prehospital triage stroke-score using a smartphone-app
      (Join-Triage, Allm) when referring patients with suspected stroke to the university clinic
      Essen. The triage stroke-score FAST-ED (Field Assessment Stroke Triage for Emergency
      Destination), as well as the expected time of arrival will be transmitted by an additional
      smartphone-app in advance of the arrival (Join, Allm). Patients will receive emergency workup
      to identify stroke etiology and presence of large vessel occlusion. Final diagnosis, presence
      of large vessel occlusion and type of revascularisation treatment will be registered.
      Sensitivity, specificity and further criteria for test quality will be calculated for the
      stroke triage by emergency service in field using the FAST-ED.
