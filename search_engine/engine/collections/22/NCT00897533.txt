        -  Assess mesenchymal and epithelial markers in tissues from patients with non-small cell
           lung cancer treated with erlotinib hydrochloride on clinical trial ECOG-E3503.

        -  Determine the loss of epithelial markers (E-cadherin) and gain of mesenchymal markers
           (vimentin/cytokeratin co-expression) in these patients.

        -  Assess whether mesenchymal and epithelial markers are predictive of progression-free
           survival (PFS) of these patients.

        -  Identify a single nucleotide polymorphism profile via whole genome mapping and other
           known biomarkers to predict PFS of these patients.

      OUTLINE: Tissue samples are analyzed by whole genome mapping for single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) rate and by signal detection rate and by quantitative immunohistochemistry
      for mesenchymal (vimentin/cytokeratin) and epithelial (E-cadherin) marker transitions. After
      biomarker identification and gene mapping are complete, a model to predict progression-free
      survival in these patients is developed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 137 samples will be accrued for this study.
