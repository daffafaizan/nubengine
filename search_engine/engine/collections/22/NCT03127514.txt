    
      AMX0035 is a combination therapy designed to reduce neuronal death through blockade of key
      cellular death pathways originating in the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER). This
      clinical trial is designed to demonstrate that treatment is safe, tolerable, and able to slow
      decline in function as measured by the ALSFRS-R. The trial will also assess the effects of
      AMX0035 on muscle strength, vital capacity, and biomarkers of ALS including markers of
      neuronal death and neuroinflammation.
