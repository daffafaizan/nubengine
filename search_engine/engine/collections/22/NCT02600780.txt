      treated with Febuxostat 40 mg Tablets and other with Allopurinol 300 mg Tablets once daily
      for 3 months period.

      Gender, age, height, weight, creatinine and ALT levels, co-morbidities and other
      complications were monitored at screening and as per eligibility criteria 50 patients were
      enrolled in the study. Efficacy was determined by monitoring serum uric acid levels during

      period. Investigator collected and recorded all the data of visits in CRF which was analyzed
