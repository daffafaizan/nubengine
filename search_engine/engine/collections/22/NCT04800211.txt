    
      This study was conducted as a randomized, parallel-group, open-label, 24-week, controlled
      clinical study split into an initial 12-week study (Study 1), with a follow-up at 24 weeks
      (Study 2) in a sub-population of switchers. For Study 1 a total of 450 subjects were
      enrolled. Of those subjects who successfully completed Study 1, 150 were then enrolled into
      Study 2 with no interruption in study participation. The study compared changes in BoE and
      BoPH in AS who switched to ad libitum use of one of two test EVPs with those in the Control
      group who continued to smoke conventional cigarettes. The study enrolled AS who were
      considered to be in overall good health.
