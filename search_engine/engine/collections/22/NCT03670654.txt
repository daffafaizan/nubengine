      severe persistent asthma will be randomly assigned into two groups: Pilates method - PM
      (training group) or muscle stretching exercises - MSE (control group). All subjects will
      receive the same educational session and will perform the physical exercise proposed for the
      group for 12 weeks, 3 times/week, 40-minute sessions. The data normality will be analyzed by
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov, the variables obtained before interventions will be compared with the
      Student t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test. Comparisons of the initial and final data on outcomes
      will be analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA with appropriate post hoc of Holm-Sidak. The
      significance level will be set to 5% for all tests.
