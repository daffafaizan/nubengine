      is a new echocardiographic technique for evaluating myocardial function, which has
      demonstrated its superiority compared to LVEF in many clinical situations. It therefore seems
      promising to evaluate this new tool in the earlier detection of adverse myocardial
      chemotherapy with anthracyclines. The ultimate goal is indeed to determine a reliable and
      reproducible parameter for cardiac toxicity diagnostic to avoid chemotherapy interruption,
      thus improving the survival of these patients.

      The main objective of this project is to evaluate the association between changes in
      myocardial deformation longitudinal 2D strain echocardiography between baseline and 6 weeks
      after initiation of anthracycline therapy for acute leukemia and the occurrence of impaired
      left ventricular function within 12 months after starting treatment.

      It is a prognostic study of clinical-looking, without randomization. The inclusion will take
      place over a period of 12 months with a total follow-up of 12 months.

      The analysis will focus on the identification of parameters predictive of alteration of Fe
      VG.
