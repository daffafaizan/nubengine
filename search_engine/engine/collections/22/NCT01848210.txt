    
      The drug being tested in this study is the fixed-dose combination of coumarin and troxerutin
      called Venalot®. Venalot is being tested to treat the symptoms of chronic venous
      insufficiency. This study will look at symptom relief in people who take Venalot®.

      The study will enroll approximately 808 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Combination coumarin + troxerutin extended release tablets

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take two tablets three times a day throughout the study.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in Brazil. The overall time to participate in this
      study is up to 18 weeks. Participants will make 6 visits to the clinic.
