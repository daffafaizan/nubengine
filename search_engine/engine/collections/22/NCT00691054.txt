      Primary

        -  To establish preliminary evidence of efficacy of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized
           nanoparticle formulation in patients with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic
           pancreatic cancer that failed first-line therapy with a gemcitabine
           hydrochloride-containing regimen.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety and characterize the toxicity profile of this drug.

        -  To determine the complete, partial, and overall response rates and duration of response
           in patients with measurable disease.

        -  To determine CA 19-9 response.

        -  To determine progression-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      annually thereafter.
