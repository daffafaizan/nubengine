      heart surgery, or combined valvular and CABG surgery are eligible for the study. Subjects
      will be randomized prior to surgery (1:1) to receive 5 g magnesium or placebo (saline) bolus
      by the anaesthesiologist upon removal of the crossclamp. On postoperative days 1 through 4,
      subjects will receive either IV MgSO4 (5g in 250 ml normal saline) or IV placebo (250 ml
      normal saline) infusion over 4 hours daily. Atrial fibrillation (and other arrhythmias) will
      be detected by placing all subjects on continuous 24-hour ECG telemetry monitoring for
      postoperative days 0 through 4.

      The study is powered to detect at least a 30% relative reduction in postoperative atrial
      fibrillation in the CABG group; n=756. Because of the higher incidence of atrial fibrillation
      in the Valve +/- CABG group a total of 500 patients will be required to detect at least a 30%
      difference between treatment groups. These sample sizes are based on an alpha of 0.05 and 80%
      power.
