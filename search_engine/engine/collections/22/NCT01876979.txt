      To identify which option of wiring the jaws together during treatment of mandible fractures
      is more cost effective to the patient, Erich arch bars or IMF (Intermaxillary Fixation)
      screws. Patients who sustain mandible fractures that meet the inclusion criteria will be
      randomized to one of the two treatment types listed above. The overall treatment in both
      categories is consistent with the standard of care, the only difference being the method
      utilized to achieve intermaxillary fixation during the course of the surgery.
