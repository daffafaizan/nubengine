      quality of life. Characterized by excessive fibroblast proliferation and collagen deposition,
      skin fibrosis underlies a wide spectrum of dermatologic conditions ranging from pathologic
      scars secondary to injury (e.g., burns, surgery, trauma) to immune-mediated diseases.
      Effective anti-scarring therapeutics remain an unmet need, underscoring the importance of
      developing novel approaches to treat and prevent skin fibrosis.

      In vitro data show that LED-RL can modulate key cellular and molecular processes involved in
      skin fibrosis. Two phase I clinical trials (STARS 1 and STARS 2) demonstrated the safety and
      tolerability of LED-RL at fluences of 160 J/cm2 up to 480 J/cm2 on normal human skin. The
      administration of LED-RL phototherapy in the early postoperative period may optimize wound
      healing and prevent excessive scarring. The results from this study may change the current
      treatment paradigm for fibrotic skin diseases and help to pioneer LED-RL as a safe,
      non-invasive, cost-effective, portable, at-home therapy for scars.
