      without respiratory depression. These effects, as well as neuroprotective properties in
      experimental studies would be ideal in neuroanaesthesia and in neurocritical care. Poor grade
      SAH patients are treated in intensive care units (ICU). These patients are sedated often with
      propofol. However, to assess the patient's neurology, the propofol sedation must be stopped
      and the wakening of the patient may take time. Dexmedetomidine would be more advantageous,
      allowing wakening during the infusion. However, the effects of dexmedetomidine on cerebral
      autoregulation are unknown in SAH patients.

      15 SAH patients requiring sedation, mechanical ventilation and ICP monitoring will be rolled
      in to the study.
