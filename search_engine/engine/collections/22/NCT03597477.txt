      few data address the effectiveness and harms of medications for procedural sedation in this
      population. It's advisable to be used as a first line medication with alpha-2 agonists for
      procedure sedation. The primary goal of this study was to compare the effectiveness of
      dexmedetomidine sedation, also determine the 50% and 95% effective doses in children with and
      without ASD undergoing MRI scanning.
