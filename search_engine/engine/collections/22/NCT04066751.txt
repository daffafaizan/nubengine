      accelerated loss of lung function and mortality. Our preliminary data indicate that cigarette
      smoke exerts deleterious effects on airway epithelial function including the reduction of
      CFTR activity, enhanced mucus expression, and a pronounced reduction in mucociliary transport
      (MCT). Preliminary data also indicate that approximately 50% of patients with COPD have
      reduced CFTR activity, as detected in the upper airways, lower airways, and sweat glands.
      Furthermore, CFTR dysfunction is independently associated with chronic bronchitis, can
      persist despite smoking cessation, and can be reversed by the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor
      (VX-770) in vitro by activating wild-type CFTR, resulting in a robust increase in MCT.
      Combined with unprecedented clinical improvement via augmented mucociliary clearance in CF
      patients with a responsive CFTR mutation treated with ivacaftor, these data indicate that
      CFTR represents a viable therapeutic target to address mucus stasis in a large subset of COPD
      patients (potentially representing over 4 million patients in the U.S. alone). This project
      will investigate the hypothesis that ivacaftor can augment CFTR activity in individuals with
      COPD who exhibit chronic bronchitis, resulting in meaningful improvements in epithelial
      function and respiratory health. Our initial pilot study in patients with COPD and chronic
      bronchitis demonstrated that ivacaftor was safe, demonstrated stable pharmacokinetics, and
      exhibited a trend towards efficacy in patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and sweat chloride.
      The current trial will test the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ivacaftor
      in a larger number of COPD patients with chronic bronchitis and for a longer treatment
      period, evaluating the potential of CFTR potentiator therapy to address acquired CFTR
      dysfunction in this population and set the stage for larger and longer-term trials in the
      future.
