      study in which participants were to be enrolled into 8 cohorts.

      In Part 1 healthy participants were randomized in a 3:1 ratio (erenumab:placebo) into 6
      cohorts: 5 cohorts received the investigational product (IP) as an SC administration and 1
      cohort received it as an IV administration. In Part 2 a total of 12 migraine patients were
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio (erenumab:placebo) in cohort 7. An additional 8 migraine patients
      could have been enrolled and randomized in a 3:1 ratio in the optional cohort 8, however this
      cohort was not enrolled.
