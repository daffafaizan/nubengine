      repeated episodes of intense fear, accompanied by serious physical symptoms, such as chest
      pain, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, or abdominal stress. Available
      treatments for PD include medication therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a type
      of psychotherapy that teaches people how to view panic attacks differently and how to reduce
      anxiety. Approximately 30% of patients refuse medication, however, and nearly 50% do not
      achieve remission with CBT alone. Therefore, there is a pressing need for additional
      non-pharmacologic treatment methods. Panic-focused psychodynamic psychotherapy (PFPP) and
      applied relaxation training (ART) are among some of the other available treatments for PD.
      During ART, individuals are taught to relax their muscles while being exposed to increasingly
      frightening situations. PFPP combines elements of CBT with other, more extensive approaches
      aimed at determining the anxiety's origin and at finding ways to reduce it. This study will
      compare the effectiveness of PFPP, CBT, and ART in treating PD.

      Participants in this single blind study will be randomly assigned to receive PFPP, CBT, or
      ART for 12 weeks. All participants will attend between 19 and 24 treatment sessions over the
      course of the study. Upon completing the study, participants will attend monthly follow-up
      visits for an additional 12 months. Participants assigned to ART who have not responded by
      the end of treatment may opt to receive PFPP or CBT. Outcomes will be assessed using a
      variety of scales to determine depression and anxiety symptoms.
