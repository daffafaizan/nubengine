      coronary intervention (PPCI) may increase the risk of stent thrombosis. Parenteral treatment
      is needed mitigate this risk.

      We have recently shown a novel regimen of enoxaparin (bolus 0.75 mg/kg followed by an
      infusion of 0.75 mg/kg/6h) to provide consistent antithrombotic effects until the end of the
      infusion (1). We have also demonstrated the high prevalence of delayed platelet inhibition in
      opiate-treated patients (1).

      This is a feasibility study for a larger randomised controlled trial (RCT). We aim to assess
      recruitment rate and collect pilot data on safety and efficacy. This will be a single-centre,
      open-label RCT comparing this novel regimen of enoxaparin to the local standard-of-care which
      usually consists of unfractionated heparin and a glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor. The study
      population will be opiate-treated patients undergoing PPCI. Pre PPCI, patients will be
      allocated in 1:1 ratio using a simple randomisation method using sealed envelopes, to either
      enoxaparin 0.75 mg/kg bolus followed by 0.75 mg/kg infusion over 6 hours (n=50) or the
      standard-of-care of UFH and tirofiban (n=50).
