      allergies it tends to be more persistent and also its prevalence seems to be rising.
      Currently there is no proven treatment other than strict avoidance. We are attempting to
      decrease the risk of anaphylaxis on accidental ingestion by desensitizing subjects to peanut
      using peanut oral mucosal immunotherapy (OIT). We are also studying the effect of peanut OIT
      on the peanut specific immune response to determine if tolerance to peanut protein will
      develop. Children ages 1 to 18 with peanut allergy will be randomized to peanut OIT or
      placebo. Subjects will undergo a modified rush immunotherapy on the first day and then
      increase the doses at least every two weeks up to a maintenance dose of 4 grams (equivalent
      to about 13 peanuts). Doses will be taken daily at home except for dose increases which will
      be done on the research unit. Subjects will undergo a double-blind, placebo-controlled food
      challenge (DBPCFC) after 12 months and then be unblinded. Placebo subjects will cross over to
      open-label peanut OIT and undergo an identical buildup schedule up to 12 months. All subjects
      will then complete at least 36 months of peanut OIT therapy after which once skin prick (<5
      mm) and IgE (<15 kU/L) criteria are met, they will then complete the end of study DBPCFC.
      Dosing will continue up to a maximum of 60 months after which even if criteria are not met,
      the subject will undergo the end of study DBPCFC. Outcome variables of interest include
      response to DBPCFC, skin prick testing, peanut specific IgE, and adverse events. These
      results will be compared between the start and end of peanut OIT using appropriate
      statistical analysis.
