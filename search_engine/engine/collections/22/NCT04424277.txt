      subjected to increasing and gradual loading of the respiratory system by a negative-pressure
      inspiration device. The respiratory work will be recorded continuously by measuring the
      transdiaphragmatic pressure (reference technique).

      The recording of the deformation of the diaphragmatic apposition zone by speckle tracking
      technique will make it possible to define a multi-dimensional deformation index of this
      muscular portion.

      The reproducibility and the repeatability of this index will be evaluated then this index
      will be compared to the reference technique, as well as to the fraction of thickening. The
      deformation of the accessory muscles will also be evaluated in a second step.
