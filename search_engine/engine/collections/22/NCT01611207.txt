      (SCWT) under clinical, safety and economic aspects in the treatment of postoperative
      Iatrogenic Subcutaneous Abdominal Wounds (ISAW). The hypothesis is based on the assumption
      that the application of NPWT for the treatment of postoperative abdominal wound healing
      impairments (with intact fascia) results in a decrease of time until achievement of wound
      closure (with confirmation after 30 consecutive days) and for this reason more wound closures
      can be achieved in the maximum treatment period of 42 days compared to the control therapy.
