      symptoms. The participants still suffer after the acute phase of the infection from shortness
      of breath, coughing, chest pain or fatigue. Therefore, a special interdisciplinary
      consultation was built. The consulatation is not only addressed to people who have been
      hospitalized due to COVID-19, but also to those with mild symptoms during infection. During
      the consultation hours, personal health data are collected that serves as the basis for this
      research project.
