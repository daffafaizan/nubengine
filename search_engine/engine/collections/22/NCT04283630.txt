      study was designed to compare the magnitude changes in RHI (primary outcome), plasma NO
      metabolites (nitrate and nitrite), and plasma vitamin C, plasma oxidized LDL, and blood
      (secondary outcome) following treatment with inorganic nitrate and vitamin C placebo (N) and
      inorganic nitrate combined with vitamin C (NC). Following baseline testing, eligible subjects
      were randomized to receive either treatment (N) or treatment (NC) for 4 weeks (period1), and
      participants were then crossed over to the alternate treatment for another 4 weeks (period
      2). There was a 2-week washout at crossover.
