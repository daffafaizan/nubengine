      week. Untreated pathological hyperbilirubinaemia, however, can result in long-term
      neurological sequelae, which compromise childhood development, or may result in perinatal
      death. Worldwide, this condition aï¬€ects at least 481,000 term or near term newborn babies
      annually, causing 114,000 deaths and more than 63,000 cases of moderate or severe disability.
      In high-income settings, early diagnosis and treatment in neonatal intensive care units have
      dramatically improved the outcome for babies at risk. However, true population-based data
      from middle to low-income countries are scarce and NH contribution to morbidity and mortality
      remains unclear. The Democratic Republic of Congo is one of the 5 countries with the highest
      neonatal mortality rate: 29 per 1000 live births, with an estimated 96,963 annual deaths. NH
      diagnosis is mostly performed by visual inspection, which is not very reliable, and it is not
      systematically reported in maternity records. The primary objective is to evaluate the
      prevalence of neonatal hyperbilirubinaemia in a cohort of in-hospital consecutive live
      births. The secondary objective is to evaluate the possible risk factors for NH in the mother
      and the baby. The results of this survey will provide essential baseline data for the
      community. If the frequency of the NH and severe NH in the area is higher than routinely
      reported, prompt and appropriate management guidelines can be put in place to improve
      treatment to decrease neonatal mortality and neurological disabilities.
