      Gallium-68 DOTATOC, the physicians will be asked to describe the type of treatment that they
      would recommend. After the test is performed and the result reviewed, the physician will be
      asked to reevaluate the therapeutic and management options. Data will be analyzed to
      determine the impact of the testing on patient management.

      Gallium-68 has been designated an "orphan drug" due to the relative rarity of NETs. It is
      expected that the data collected from this and other similar trials will be used to provide
      data to the FDA regarding the safety and efficacy of this drug as an imaging agent for NETs
      and ultimately lead to FDA approval.
