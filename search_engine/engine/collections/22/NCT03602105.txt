      a significant increase in the prevalence of OA over the decades. In the United States knee OA
      affects 19% of adults aged 45 years or older. OA is associated with an extensive high
      economic and personal burden, largely attributable to the effects of disability, comorbid
      disease, and the expense of treatment.

      Given the aging population, the number of total joint arthroplasty procedures (TJA) for hip
      and knee is likely to increase substantially. In light of poor physical function prior to
      surgery among older patients and the likelihood of an added decrease during hospitalization
      and risk of poorer outcome after surgery, it is hypothesised that prehabilitation
      (preoperative exercise) would improve outcomes after surgery, however evidence for its
      efficacy is still lacking
