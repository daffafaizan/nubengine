      Hemophilia A is a serious and common hereditary bleeding disorder caused by deficiency of
      coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Patients with this disease are treated with recombinant
      factor VIII or factor VIII concentrates derived from plasma.

      Administration of exogenous FVIII in 15-35% of cases, cause the formation of antibodies to
      FVIII (inhibitors) that neutralize the activity of factor VIII, making the treatment
      ineffective.The development of inhibitors of factor VIII (FVIII) is the most serious and
      challenging complication of the treatment of hemophilia A and represents the highest economic
      burden for a chronic disease. Therefore, research is making great efforts to optimize the
      best therapeutic approach for the disease.

      It has been observed that FVIII inhibitors display a wide range of immunoreactivity when
      tested against different classes of FVIII concentrates (with/without von Willebrand factor
      -VWF). It has been demonstrated that the different inhibitors reactivity may correlate with
      different ability of inhibitors to impair thrombin generation, as tested by Thrombin
      Generation Assay (TGA). In these patients TGA assay might be a tool to predict which FVIII
      concentrate has the greater haemostatic effectiveness.

      It is also uncertain if the different classes of FVIII used in ITI protocols may have a
      different effectiveness in reducing the occurrence of BT bleedings and if this may correlate
      to lower reactivity, epitope specificity, VWF content and may be predicted by TGA. It would
      be very helpful to be able to give an evidence based diagnostic and prognostic instrument,
      the TGA, to aid physician to optimize the therapy for all inhibitors patients.
