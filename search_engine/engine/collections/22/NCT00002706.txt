      I. Compare the incidence of surgical complications, peri-operative morbidity, and mortality
      in patients with stage I or IIa, grade I-III endometrial cancer or uterine cancer undergoing
      surgical staging through laparoscopic assisted vaginal hysterectomy vs total abdominal
      hysterectomy.

      II. Compare the length of hospital stay after surgery in patients receiving these treatments.

      III. Compare the quality of life of patients receiving these treatments. IV. Compare the
      incidence and location of disease recurrence in patients receiving these treatments.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo vaginal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (BSO) via
      laparoscopy.

      ARM II: Patients undergo total abdominal hysterectomy and BSO via conventional laparotomy.

      Patients in both arms also undergo pelvic and para-aortic lymph node sampling. Quality of
      life is assessed at baseline, at 1, 3, and 6 weeks, and then at 6 months.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3
      years.
