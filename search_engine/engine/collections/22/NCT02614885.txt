    
      This study is a single-center, prospective, open label study of a radiofrequency ablation
      device. 10 patients who are scheduled to undergo prophylactic mastectomy will be recruited by
      the clinical investigators at the investigational site in accordance with the inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. Once the breast tissue is removed, the radiofrequency ablation device
      will be used on the ex vivo tissue to ablate a lesion around a cavity created in the tissue.
      The ablation lesion will be characterized. The study period per subject is the time it takes
      to assess the ablation lesion histologically.
