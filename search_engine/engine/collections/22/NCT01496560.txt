      colonoscpy. These factors may be demographic, antrophometric, socio-ecomomic, related to
      previous medical staus or to anxiety levels.

      We will try to find an objective parameter for prdiction of pain during colonoscopy, so
      pre-procedural intervantion will be applied in order to reduce the pain.
