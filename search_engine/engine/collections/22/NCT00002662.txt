        -  Compare the response rate in women with metastatic or locally advanced, inoperable
           adenocarcinoma of the breast treated with docetaxel vs paclitaxel.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the time to disease progression, duration of response, quality of life, and
           survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 3
           weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and after courses 4 and 6.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (200 per arm) will be accrued for this study.
