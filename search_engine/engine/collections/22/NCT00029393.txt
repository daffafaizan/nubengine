      Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has curative potential for individuals with sickle
      cell disease. While the results of conventional HCT have been good, this treatment carries
      risks of significant short- term and longterm toxicities. For this reason, HCT has been
      reserved for children who have experienced severe symptoms that predict a poor outcome. Of
      interest, some patients developed stable donor-host hematopoietic chimerism after
      conventional HCT. Due to a natural enrichment of donor erythrocytes in the blood, those who
      developed stable chimerism had a significant clinical benefit, even when there was a minority
      of donor cells. These observations have paralleled efforts to develop less-toxic,
      non-myeloablative preparative regiments for transplantation, proved first in a canine model
      of transplantation, and subsequently translated successfully in a clinical trial for older
      adults with hematological malignancies.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Multicenter open-label phase I-II study in 30 children with sickle cell disease that combines
      a non-myeloablative pre-transplant hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) therapy with
      modulated post-grafting immunosuppression to control host-versus-graft and graft-versus-host
      reactions. The approach relies on the ability to establish and maintain donor-host chimerism.
      The primary study endpoint is stable donor cell engraftment; secondary endpoints measure the
      impact of therapy on sickle cell-related symptoms and end-organ damage (disease-free
      survival, patient survival, graft-versus-host disease, complications etc). The trial will be
      conducted within the existing network of Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers, and will be
      centrally coordinated by the Sickle Cell Coordinating Center.
