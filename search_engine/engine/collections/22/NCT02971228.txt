    
      This was a single-center, open-label, 2-part, randomized cross-over trial. The trial was to
      enrol up to 20 adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and assess the safety and
      efficacy of the Bionic Pancreas (BP) using either the iLet or iPhone platform when used with
      the glucagon analogue ZP4207 (dasiglucagon) versus Lilly glucagon.

      In Part 1, patients participated in two 1-day treatment arms in random order (iPhone-based BP
      using ZP4207 (dasiglucagon) and iPhone-based BP using Lilly glucagon) according to a
      pre-generated randomization scheme. In Part 2, it was planned to enrol additional patients to
      participate in two 1-day treatment arms in random order (iLet using ZP4207 (dasiglucagon) and
      iLet using Lilly glucagon) according to a pre-generated randomization scheme. However, due to
      unavailability of the iLet, the sponsor decided to stop the trial upon completion of Part 1.
      Part 2 of the trial using the iLet was consequently not conducted.

      One day the BP will use glucagon analogue ZP4207 (dasiglucagon) and the other day the BP will
      use Lilly glucagon. Subjects will also receive insulin lispro through the BP on both days.
      The trial will be conducted at single center, the Massachusetts General Hospital Diabetes
      Center in Boston, MA.
