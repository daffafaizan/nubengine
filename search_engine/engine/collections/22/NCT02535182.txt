      and membrane localization of Rap1 in PBMCs can be altered in individuals undergoing
      autologous Hematopoietic Cell Transplant (HCT) for Multiple Myeloma by administering a daily
      beta-blocker (propranolol) to 20 participants. Outcomes of patients on this clinical trial
      will be compared to 20 participants in a control arm.
