      mg/m2), Busulfan IV (3,2 to 4,8 mg/kg/d), TBI 2 grays and CD3/CD19 graft depletion. A minimum
      of 8 106 CD34+ cells/kg were infused on day 0. No post grafting immunosuppression was applied
      if the graft contained < 2.5 x 104 CD3+ cells/kg. At Day 30 and 60 post-graft we perform an
      donor CD56+ cells injection. The investigators develop this strategy in an European
      collaboration working on haploidentical stem cell transplantation for childhood refractory
      and metastatic solid tumors.
