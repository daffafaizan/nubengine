    
      This is a Phase 1 randomized double-blind dose-escalation clinical trial in healthy
      hookworm-naïve adults conducted at the George Washington Medical Faculty Associates,
      Washington, DC, and the George Washington University School of Medicine and Health Sciences,
      Department of Microbiology, Immunology and Tropical Medicine, Washington, DC. In total, 24
      subjects will be progressively enrolled into 2 cohorts of 12 subjects each. In the first
      cohort 8 subjects will receive 30µg Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel co-administered with 500µg CpG 10104
      and 4 subjects will receive 100µg Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel® only, in a randomized, double-blinded
      fashion. In the second cohort 8 subjects will receive 100µg Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel
      co-administered with 500µg CpG 10104 and 4 volunteers will receive 100µg Na-GST-1/Alhydrogel
      only, in a randomized, double-blinded fashion. Vaccinations will be administered
      intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle according to a 0, 2, 4-month schedule. Each subject
      will participate in the study for 68 weeks (16 months) and the total duration of the study is
      estimated at approximately 19 months.
