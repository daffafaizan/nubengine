      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of PGG beta glucan in combination with alemtuzumab
      and rituximab. (Phase I) II. Assess the rate of complete response of patients with high-risk,
      early-intermediate stage CLL who are treated with alemtuzumab, rituximab, and PGG beta glucan
      before meeting standard National Cancer Institute-International Workshop on Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia (NCI-IWCLL) criteria (Hallek, Cheson et al. 2008) for treatment. (Phase
      II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To monitor and assess toxicity of this regimen. II. Clinical evaluation of toxicity. III.
      Serial monitoring of cytomegalovirus (CMV) viral load by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

      IV. To assess the rate of overall response in CLL patients using this treatment regimen.

      V. To determine time to progression, time to next treatment, and duration of response in CLL
      patients using this treatment regimen.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the correlation between the individual prognostic markers (17p-, 11q-, unmutated
      VH gene, use of VH3-21, ZAP70+, CD38+) and clinical outcome.

      II. To assess response to this combination regimen using an expanded definition of response,
      including bone marrow studies with immunohistochemical studies for residual CLL cells and
      sensitive flow cytometry for minimal residual disease in patients in complete clinical
      remission.

      OUTLINE: This is phase I, dose-escalation study of PGG beta-glucan followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive PGG beta-glucan intravenously (IV) over 2-4 hours on days 1, 5, 10, 17, 24,
      and 31; alemtuzumab subcutaneously (SC) on days 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26,
      29, 31, and 33; and rituximab IV on days 10, 17, 24, and 31. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months, every 3
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 5 years.
