      includes a screening and baseline visit, 8 acupuncture treatments (2 per week for 4 weeks),
      and a follow-up visit and treatment 1 week after completion of the study treatment sessions.
      To determine the effects of acupuncture on pain, patients and healthy controls will undergo
      psychophysical pain testing at four points throughout the study: Baseline (appointment 1),
      post-treatment 1 (appointment2), post treatment 8 (appointment 9), and at the final follow-up
      session (1 week from last treatment - appointment 10).Participants will also fill out a brief
      report on pain, sleep, and functioning on a palm pilot. This is expected to take less than 2
      minutes per day and will occur throughout the 6 week study period.
