      of individuals need to be vaccinated to protect those who do not respond to the vaccine and
      those who cannot be vaccinated. While vaccine hesitancy has been noted as a growing problem
      among parents, there are few evidence-based strategies for providers to utilize to discuss
      vaccination with these parents. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop effective
      communication tools to increase parental confidence in vaccines. A tool based on the
      principles of motivational interviewing (a goal-oriented, collaborative counseling style) may
      be effective in addressing this need. Thus, the aim of this study is to determine the impact
      of a motivational interviewing-based (MI-based) tool on pediatric vaccination rates through
      assessment of changes in the percentage of patients achieving the goal of completion of all
      recommended doses in children 6 years of age and younger. Secondary aims include determining
      the impact of the motivational-interviewing based tool on parental health beliefs regarding
      vaccines and the impact of the training on provider knowledge and confidence in using
      motivational interviewing.
