      for neuronal physiology, it appears that high serum calcium concentrations may be toxic to
      neurons. An analysis of the Rotterdam Study showed that, among older adults, higher
      concentrations of calcium were associated with greater cognitive disorders and faster
      cognitive decline. Similarly, delirium and behavioural disorders are reported in older adults
      with hypercalcemia. In contrast, other studies failed to find any association. For example,
      in France, an analysis of the EPIDOS study found no association between calcium concentration
      and cognitive performance. Thus, further studies remain necessary to make firmer conclusions
      about this link. In particular, it is interesting to note that all previous studies have used
      the serum concentrations of calcium or corrected calcium, but not yet ionized calcium. This
      assay is yet more reproducible, more sensitive and more correlated with clinical events. We
      propose that the non-use of ionized calcium assay may explain, at least in part, the
      discrepancies between previous studies.
