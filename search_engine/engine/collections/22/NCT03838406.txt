      second leading cause of cancer deaths in Korea (18.7%). Although the number of radical
      resection has increased due to the development of early diagnosis, many patients experience
      recurrence after radical resection. It is also diagnosed as a non - resectable disease
      locally advanced at the time of initial diagnosis, or with a metastasis. In patients with
      recurrent / metastatic gastric cancer, conventional palliative chemotherapy is the best
      treatment, and in advanced gastric cancer, combination therapy with fluoropyrimidine
      (fluorouracil, capecitabine, S1) and platinum (oxaliplatin, cisplatin). The progression-free
      survival was 3-5 months, and overall survival of 6-10 months in metastatic gastric cancer
      patients.

      The investigators evaluated the incidence of BRCA loss in patients with advanced gastric
      cancer and observed the treatment outcome and prognosis according to BRCA loss. And the
      investigators evaluated the possibility of BRCA loss as a predictive and prognostic factor.
