      cardiovascular risk when measured with clinical (assessement of intima-media-thickness) or
      biochemical (hsCRP, MMP-9 etc.) markers. Well controlled patients (HbA1c < 8.0 %) will
      receive either pioglitazone or placebo (randomised, double-blind) for 4 weeks. Blood will be
      drawn to investigate the change in cardiovascular or metabolic markers and mRNA will be
      isolated from circulating mononuclear cells to investiagte the degree of activation of the
      immune system, which is another measure for the risk of atherosclerosis development.
