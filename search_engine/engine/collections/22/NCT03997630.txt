      of this study is to compare a prophylactic use of high-flow nasal cannula oxygenation
      (experimental group) to low-flow oxygenation (control group) after thoracic trauma. 770
      patients will be included. Randomization will be conducted with random block and patients
      will be randomized in 1:1 ratio in one of the two groups. Randomization process will be
      stratified on: age (more or less 65 years old), use of peridural analgesia and existence of
      extra thoracic trauma. Only the oxygenation technique is studied, all other aspects of
      management will be handle by the attending physician.

      All patients will be followed from enrollment to hospital discharge. To ensure the same data
      collection in all centers, six visits are planned: day (D) 1 (inclusion), D7, D14, D28.

      Classical blinded methods cannot be used for the evaluation of these kinds of devices. To
      ensure the same evaluation for all patients and in all centers, all relevant outcomes will be
      evaluated by an independent clinical event committee. Statistical analysis will be performed
      by an independent statistician.

      Primary endpoint will be analyzed according to intention to treat. Secondary outcomes will be
      analyzed as exploratory analysis.
