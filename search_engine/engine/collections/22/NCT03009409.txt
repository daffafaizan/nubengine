      with low-dose ketamine will be equivalent to the controller performance without low-dose
      ketamine. The primary outcome measure, controller performance, is the percentage of time
      during the maintenance phase when the depth-of-hypnosis (DOH) measure is within +-10 points
      of the set point in patients receiving low dose ketamine versus those receiving saline
      control.

      This study will consider other clinical data of interest from both intra- and post-operative
      contexts in order to establish a broader understanding of the potential implications of the
      use of a low dose of ketamine during closed-loop controlled anesthesia. In the OR, the
      investigators will record other indications of anesthetic quality, such as vital signs and
      the occurrence of any unwanted intra-operative events. Propofol and remifentanil consumption
      will be quantified, and the requirement of any other interventions will be recorded. The
      investigators will also record post-operative patient outcomes that have previously been
      associated with ketamine administration, such as acute post-operative pain intensity, opioid
      requirements, the occurrence of PONV, and shivering occurring in the post-anesthesia care
      unit (PACU).
