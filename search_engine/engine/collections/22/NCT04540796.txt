      B-lymphocytes expressing identical surface antigens. CD22 is a surface protein specifically
      expressed on B-lymphocytes and is expressed in B-lymphocytic malignancies. It is known to
      negatively regulate the B-cell receptor via its cytosolic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based
      inhibitory motifs. JNJ-75348780 is a novel human bispecific antibody that recognizes the CD3
      antigen on T-lymphocytes and the CD22 antigen on mature and malignant B-lymphocytes.
      JNJ-75348780 is hypothesized to lead to cytotoxicity, T-cell activation and induction of
      cytokines upon engagement of CD3 on T-cells and CD22 on malignant B-lymphocytes. The study
      consists of screening phase, treatment phase and post-treatment phase. The total study
      duration will be up to 2.7 years. Efficacy assessments will include radiographic image
      assessments, positron emission tomography scan, bone marrow assessment, endoscopy or
      colonoscopy, physical examinations. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.
