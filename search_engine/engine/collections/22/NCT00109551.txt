      remain high despite significant progress made over the past 20 years. There remain
      significant nutritional deficiencies in these populations, especially important are vitamin
      and mineral deficiencies.

      Comparisons: In this study, we are comparing the morbidity and mortality experience for
      children 1-36 months of age randomized to one of four daily supplementation regimens:
      placebo, zinc alone, iron-folic acid alone, zinc + iron-folic acid.
