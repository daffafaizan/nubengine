      in the operating room (OR). Patients treated in the physician's office will have endoscopic
      sinus surgery performed with the balloon sinuplasty devices. Patients treated in the OR will
      have endoscopic sinus surgery performed with or without balloon sinuplasty devices. Both
      primary treatment of sinusitis as well as revision of previously treated sinuses will be
      allowed. Resource absorption will be evaluated for both venues.
