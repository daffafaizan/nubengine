      enzymes responsible for the degradation of glycosaminoglycans. MPS are multisystemic diseases
      with significant clinical overlap between their types, with cardiac problems being among the
      most commonly observed manifestations and are also among the main causes of mortality in
      these patients. Enzyme replacement therapy and bone marrow transplantation, despite being
      well established treatments, are not yet capable of reversing or preventing the progression
      of some of the cardiological manifestations of MPS. On the other hand, these patients may
      benefit from other conventional drug or surgical treatment, which can be instituted at an
      appropriate time if there is a better understanding of how these manifestations progress. In
      particular, the occurrence of aortic root dilation, although described in animal models, has
      only recently been evaluated in the studies on mucopolysaccharidoses.

      In addition, verifying the effectiveness of losartan in controlling these manifestations in
      the animal model opens the perspective of clinical use of this drug. Losartan is a low-cost
      drug and, if its efficacy is demonstrated, may represent an accessible therapy directed at
      the unmet needs of these patients.
