      pyromania. Ten subjects with DSM-IV pyromania will receive 8 weeks of naltrexone or placebo.
      The hypothesis to be tested is that naltrexone will be effective in reducing the urges to set
      fires patients with pyromania. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment
      of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.
