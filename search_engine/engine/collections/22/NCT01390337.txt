      remission induction therapy. Subjects may receive up to 2 cycles of induction therapy.
      Subjects who have a complete response (including complete remission (CR) with incomplete
      hematologic recovery) are eligible to receive up to 3 consolidation cycles. In consolidation
      subjects will receive AC220 plus high dose cytarabine. Subjects achieving a composite
      Complete Remission (CRc) will be eligible to receive AC220 alone for up to 12 additional 28
      day cycles.

      Subjects will be enrolled into successive gender balanced cohorts of 6 subjects (at least 3
      must be females) to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Dose escalation decision will
      be made based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) that occur during the first remission
      induction cycle. Seven and 14 day schedules will be evaluated.

      After the MTD and schedule is established, the study will open to enroll between 14 to 34
      subjects. Subjects will receive AC220 during induction and consolidation at the MTD and
      schedule established. Stopping rules will be used to evaluate safety at the current dose. If
      testing at a dose level must be stopped, then a lower dose may be tested. MTD will also be
      established for the maintenance therapy.
