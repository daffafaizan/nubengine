      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for smoking and alcohol (SA) + varenicline
      (Chantix) among heavy drinking smokers (i.e., CBT for SA). The project involves two phases.
      In Phase 1, an open-label pre-pilot study of CBT for SA will be conducted with 10 heavy
      drinking smokers. The primary results of this phase will be used to refine the CBT for SA
      protocol. In Phase 2, a randomized, controlled pilot study will be conducted with 40 heavy
      drinking smokers comparing CBT for SA with standard smoking counseling (SC). All participants
      in the randomized pilot study will also receive varenicline (Chantix).

      Primary and Study Completion dates were changed 6/2016 to reflect an additional year added
      year to the study.
