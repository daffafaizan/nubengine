      increases the hepatic glucose production, thus contributing to type 2-diabetic hyperglycemia.
      In the current study we wish to examine whether non-alcoholic fatty disease (NAFLD) results
      in hepatic glucagon resistance. This could result in hyperglucagonemia through a feedback
      mechanism acting on the level of pancreatic alpha cells. Cirrhosis and type 1 diabetes,
      respectively, has previously been shown to be associated with hepatic glucagon resistance but
      it has not been examined in relation to NAFLD in humans so far.
