      physician services, and prescription drugs. Additionally to the disease progression with the
      reduction in lung function, COPD patients experiment a progressive decline in functional
      capacity and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) with a significant burden in terms of
      disability. Shared Decision Making is defined as an approach where clinicians and patients
      share the available information to making clinical decisions, and where patients are
      counseled. SDM is a way to empower patients when decisions are made about treatment as a
      determinant factor in patient-centered care. Decision aids have been proven effective in
      improving disease knowledge, decision making, and self-care.
