      a potency similar to that of BoNTA. Inhibition of neurotransmitter release was due to the
      interference of the hexapeptide with the formation and/or stability of SNARE complex.
      Notably, this peptide did not exhibit in vivo oral toxicity nor primary irritation at high
      doses. These findings demonstrate that Argireline is a anti-wrinkle peptide that emulates the
      action of currently used BoNTs.

      In vivo study, Topical Argireline 10% is applied on lateral preorbital area twice daily for
      30 days. The result demonstrates a significant anti-wrinkle activity by decreased skin
      wrinkle 30%. These findings demonstrate a significant anti-wrinkle activity for Argireline,
      in agreement with its in vitro and cellular activities. Topical Argireline represents a
      bio-safe alternative to BoNTs in anti-wrinkle therapy.
