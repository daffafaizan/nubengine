      spinal level to maximally open the affected neuroforamen. It is an alternative to lumbar
      mechanical traction.

      The spinal level of vertebral level requiring traction is palpated and a soft roll is placed
      and the patient side lies on the unaffected side. For further distraction both hips are
      flexed until movement is noted at the spinal level needing traction.

      Further, distraction applied by rotating upper trunk to opposite side of pain.

      Stabilization exercises are mainly used for the stability of joints and for improving muscle
      strength.

      The first step of lumbar stabilization exercises are to maintain functional back positions
      during all activities. The second step is to improve strength and endurance of the core
      muscles.
