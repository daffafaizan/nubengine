      Inflammation is a cornerstone of ARDS and the ratio is not a sufficiently accurate tool to
      predict the evolution of ARDS. A reproducible marker would be helpful to adapt the
      therapeutics and maybe limit their deleterious effects.

      The investigators made the hypothesis that patients moderate to severe ARDS (comparable
      PaO2/FiO2 ratio) with a higher strain may have higher inflammation.

      Moderate/severe ARDS will be ventilate with protective ventilation (low tidal volume and PEEP
      set to limit plateau pressure under 30cmH2O). Markers of inflammation will be measured in the
      broncho Alveolar Lavage the first day and in the blood the following days. Strain will be
      measured at the bedside using the nitrogen washout-washin. Markers of inflammation and strain
      will be analysed with ventilatory and oxygenation.
