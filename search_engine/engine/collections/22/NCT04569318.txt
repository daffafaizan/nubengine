    
      Single arm, single site proof-of-concept trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      LEDINBIO PoC Device, with 8 x 15-minute twice-weekly treatments and 3 month safety follow-up,
      in the treatment of cataract.

      Only one of the subject's eyes will be treated during the study. In addition, spectral data
      (fluorescent emission) will be collected using the device to monitor the progress of the
      treatment, and to determine the suitability of these measurements for future clinical
      diagnoses
