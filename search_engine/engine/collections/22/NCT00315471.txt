      blood vessel in the body, and its branches. Inflammation causes segments of the vessels to
      become narrowed, blocked, or even stretched, possibly resulting in aneurysms. The disease is
      very rare but most commonly occurs in young Asian women. Symptoms may include arm pain with
      use, decreased or absent pulses, lightheadedness or dizziness, headaches, and visual
      disturbances. Many individuals with Takayasu' arteritis, however, have no apparent symptoms
      despite disease activity. Additionally, current tests used to measure vessel inflammation are
      considered unreliable and inconsistent. It is therefore very difficult to determine the
      extent of disease activity in a person with Takayasu's arteritis. This study will use novel
      scientific methods to establish new biomarkers that can be used to monitor disease activity
      in individuals with Takayasu's arteritis. These biomarkers may be used to help direct
      clinical care and assist in future drug development.

      Study visits will occur monthly for the first year, then every 3 months thereafter for the
      remainder of the study. Blood and urine collection will occur at every visit. A physical
      examination, disease assessment, and review of medications will occur every 3 months;
      participants may also be asked to complete various questionnaires. Diagnostic testing, which
      may include chest radiograph, echocardiogram, magnetic resonance imaging, or angiography,
      will occur every 6 months. Tobacco, alcohol, and drug use will be assessed on a yearly basis.
      Participants may have additional study visits if a disease flare or disease-related
      complications occur during the study.
