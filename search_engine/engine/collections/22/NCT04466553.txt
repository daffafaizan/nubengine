      intraparenchymal hemorrhage who are admitted under the neurology service in the Neurocritical
      Care and Medical ICU will be screened for eligibility.

      A repeat CT scan 6 hours after stabilization to show that there has been no increase in size
      of the ICH will determine eligibility in the trial. Patients that meet eligibility criteria
      after this CT will be taken to the OR within 24-72 hours for a minimally invasive, navigation
      guided endoport based evacuation of the clot using the NICO BrainPathâ„¢ system.

      At baseline, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and the Modified Rankin Score (mRS) will be
      captured, along with baseline demographics. The GCS and mRS will be recorded at 1-, 3, and
      6-month post-operatively. A follow-up CT will be captured at 3 months. Mortality and adverse
      events will be reviewed at each timepoint.
