      adnexal surgery and hysterectomy compared to conventional multiport laparoscopic surgery.
      Meanwhile, no study mentioned benefit of single port laparoscopic surgery in myomectomy
      because single port myomectomy needs more labor and operator's skill than other pelvic
      surgery. At this point, the investigators need to verify the effectiveness and benefit of
      single port laparoscopic myomectomy.
