      opioid abuse. We will use a 4 cell randomised parallel controlled trial, consisting of active
      or sham TMS, and active or sham tDCS [a-tDCS, a-TMS; s-tDCS, a-TMS; a-tDCS, s-TMS; s-tDCS,
      s-TMS). The investigators hypothesise that each of the active interventions alone will be
      superior to pure sham in reducing craving and use. Moreover, The investigators hypothesise
      that COMBINING the two active treatments will be synergistic and will produce the largest
      reductions in craving and use.
