    
      (Non-clinical summary) Tramadol is a centrally-acting synthetic analgesic of the
      aminocyclohexanol group with opioidlike effects. Tramadol is extensively metabolized
      following administration, which results in a number of enantiomeric metabolites that display
      different opioid-receptor binding properties, and monoaminergic reuptake inhibition.
