      analgesia techniques. The most common regional block used to achieve postoperative analgesia
      following mastectomy is the paravertebral block, during which local anesthetic is injected
      into the paravertebral space which contains the thoracic spinal nerves, between the
      costotransverse ligament and the pleura. At our institution there has been recent interest in
      an alternative regional block. The pectoral nerve block is performed by injecting anesthetic
      between the pectoralis major and the pectoralis minor (PECs I) or between the pectoralis
      minor and the serratus anterior (PEC II).

      The proposed advantage of the pectoral nerve block for regional anesthesia during breast
      surgery is equal analgesic efficacy with fewer potential complications.
