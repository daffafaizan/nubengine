      acute myeloid leukemias in complete first remission after induction therapy. Umbilical cord
      blood grafts are frequently used for patients lacking an HLA- matched family donor
      (Matched-sibling donor, MSD) as well as in the absence of an appropriate unrelated donor
      (10/10 MUD). As any HSCT, UCB transplantations are associated with the risk of acute and
      chronic GVHD, post- transplant immunodeficiency with increased risk of infections as well as
      relapse. Especially the risk of infection and therefore non- relapse mortality (NRM) or
      transplant- related mortality (TRM) is significantly higher in UCB transplantations as
      compared to MSD or 10/10 MUD transplantations. All of these risks have been linked to a
      significant delay in immune reconstitution including various immune cell populations like CD4
      and CD8 T cells, Treg, NK, iNKT, pDC and others.

      The investigators therefore make the hypothesis that if T-cell-mediated immunity was rapidly
      generated after a partially HLA-compatible UCB transplantation will reduce the risk of
      infection and to prevent relapse without increasing the risk of GVHD.
