      interventions designed to reduce anxiety and inattention. We will explore whether this
      intervention is safe, and whether it can impact the stress, anxiety, and difficulty in focus
      of employees in the workplace. Participants will view two different nature videos in two
      different formats. Each video will be experienced through Virtual Reality or non- Virtual
      Reality.
