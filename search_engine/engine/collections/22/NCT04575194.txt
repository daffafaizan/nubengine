    
      This is a prospective study of patients aged ≥18 years, who are overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg / m2
      in the presence of dyslipidemia or hypertension or obstructive sleep apnea or fatty
      infiltration or prediabetes) or obese patients (BMI ≥ 30 kg / m2). Patients' data will be
      collected before starting medication (time 0) and at 3 and 6 months under treatment in the
      clinical practice of the selected drug, as described in the drug's package leaflet, along
      with a simultaneous dietary intervention and exercise. Patient groups will be comparable in
      age, gender and BMI.

      The aim of the study is the comparison of the efficacy of liraglutide vs.
      naltrexone/bupropion in metabolic and cardiovascular markers.

      The following parameters will be measured:

        -  Weight, height, waist and hip circumference

        -  24-hour recording of blood pressure and heart rate

        -  HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, urine albumin/creatinine ratio

        -  Bioelectric impedance for determination of total and visceral fat and muscle mass
           Indirect calorimetry for the determination of resting metabolic rate and total energy
           expenditure

        -  Determination of baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) and heart rate variability (HRV) to
           investigate the function of the autonomic nervous system

        -  Blood sample test meal at 0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150 and 180 min to determine insulin
           concentration and gastrointestinal hormones involved in hunger and satiety with modern
           indirect calorimetry to determine postprandial thermogenic analog scales (VAS)

        -  Neuropathy tests

        -  Assessment of quality of life with the SF-36 questionnaire and assessment of the feeling
           of hunger and satiety

        -  Echocardiographic determination of the left systolic and telodiastolic diameter of the
           left ventricle, cardiac fat and the Tei index at times 0 and 6 months with medication

        -  Pericardial fat
