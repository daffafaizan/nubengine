      renal scars, the use of anti-inflammatory agents may be the best strategy to reduce renal
      scarring. In animal studies, the use of corticosteroids has been shown to be effective in
      preventing post-pyelonephritic scarring. We will conduct a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial to determine the efficacy of 3 days of daily adjuvant dexamethasone
      on the incidence of renal scarring 4 to 6 months after a first febrile urinary tract
      infection (UTI). We hypothesize that the proportion of children with UTI who develop renal
      scarring will be lower among children who are treated with both dexamethasone and antibiotics
      as compared with children treated with antibiotics alone.
