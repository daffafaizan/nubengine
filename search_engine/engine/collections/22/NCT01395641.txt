      synthesis of neurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin. AADC deficiency is a rare genetic
      disorder. Taiwanese carry a high prevalence of AADC deficiency due to the founder mutation
      IVS6+4 A>T, and patients usually die before the age 5-6 years due to severe motor
      dysfunction.

      Gene therapy with adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 2 (AAV2) driven human AADC (hAADC)
      has been tested in both animal models and Phase I clinical trials of Parkinson disease. We
      have done a compassionate treatment of 8 patients with AADC deficiency by AAV2-hAADC and
      demonstrated a result that among the treated patients, 4 could stand with support, 3 could
      sit with support, and there was no virus-associated toxicity. The longest follow up has
      exceeded 4 years.

      This study is to prove the safety and efficacy of AAV2-hAADC treatment for patients with
      Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) deficiency.
