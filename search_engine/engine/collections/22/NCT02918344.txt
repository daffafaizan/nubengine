      Correction of distocclusion can be achieved through lengthening of the mandible, and a
      balanced facial appearance can be obtained by increasing chin projection.

      Calcium phosphate paste is used in mandibular lengthening surgery to avoid an unaesthetic
      notching at the lower border(1)(2) and to help stabilize the segments when osteosynthesis
      slippage is feared for. A recently performed retrospective study showed an increase of
      infectious complications when calcium phosphate paste was used for this indications. Several
      precautions were identified that could be undertaken to decrease the infectious
      complications. The study concluded that a prospective study was required in which these
      precautions were implemented to determine whether infectious complications can be reduced.

      The aim of this study is to investigate whether the hardened paste still increases the
      incidence of site infections after implementation of several precautions and the use of a
      standardized antibiotic prophylactic protocol.
