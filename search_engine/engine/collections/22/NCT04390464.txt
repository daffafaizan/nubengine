      as potential treatments for COVID-19 disease against Standard of Care alone. These agents
      target the dysregulated immune response that drives the severe lung, and other organ, damage
      frequently seen during COVID-19 infection. This trial will compare these immunomodulatory
      agents to Standard of Care over a 14-day treatment period, with follow-up at 28 and 90 days.
      Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio across treatments.

      TACTIC-R will use a platform design with interim analysis to make efficient decisions about
      efficacy and futility (e.g. lack of efficacy and risk of harm) of the trial treatments. This
      enables the trial to stop recruiting to arms early where a clear efficacy decision can be
      made. It also allows for the addition of further arms.

      TACTIC-R will also iterate an algorithm for use of clinical and biochemical phenotyping to:

        1. Stratify patients to therapeutic arms according to probability of efficacy

        2. Identify early indicators of failure of therapeutic strategy.

      By collecting samples for genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics and immunological
      phenotyping, parallel studies associated with TACTIC-R will investigate host susceptibility
      factors for development of severe COVID-19-related disease and predictive biomarkers of
      response to therapeutic strategy.
