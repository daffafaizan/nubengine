      use 1:10th of the amount of seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine in approx.50 HIV/AIDS
      patients.A control group of approx.50 matched patients for age ,treatment schedule and immune
      status will receive the regular injection of trivalent vaccine. We will follow patients
      clinically for symptoms compatible with seasonal influenza and for direct side effects of the
      vaccine.In addition we will measure anti influenza antibody in the two groups .Follow up will
      be for 6 months following vaccination.Anti influenza antibody will be measured at 1,3,6months
      using hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) test.
