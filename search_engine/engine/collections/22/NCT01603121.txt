      are two treatment periods separated by approximately one week. One treatment will consist of
      a 10 hour subcutaneous infusion of lisofylline, and the other treatment will consist of a 10
      hour intravenous infusion of lisofylline.

      Eligible subjects will be admitted to the Infusion Center the morning of dosing (Day 1, Day
      7) during each treatment period, receive their assigned dose of study drug on Day 1 and Day
      7, and will remain confined to the Infusion Center until approximately 3 hours following the
      start of study drug administration for the remaining blood draws. The subjects will then be
      escorted to the Sleep Center of Eastern Virginia Medical School for an overnight stay during
      which time their heart rate and oxygen saturation will be monitored by pulse oximetry. The
      next morning the subjects will return to the Infusion Center for a final blood draw and
      physical examination. The Infusion Center and the Sleep Disorders Center are both within
      Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.

      All subjects will be assigned to a treatment sequence according to a randomization schedule.
