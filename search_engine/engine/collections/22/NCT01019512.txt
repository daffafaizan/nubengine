      imaging techniques, the ability of the Flexitouch Lymphedema System to maintain reductions in
      limb volume after completion of the reductive phase of complex decongestive therapy in a
      population of patients with upper limb lymphedema secondary to the effects of breast cancer
      treatment. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the drainage territory of the lymphatics of
      the affected arm and chest using CT and to determine whether these patterns are changed by
      treatment with the Flexitouch Lymphedema System/daytime garments versus Flexitouch Lymphedema
      System/daytime garments/nighttime bandaging versus standard self-care. OUTLINE: Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients undergo complex decongestive therapy
      comprising daily compression garment (sleeve and glove) use, daily manual lymphatic drainage
      (self-administered), and nighttime bandaging with low stretch Comprilan bandages. Arm II:
      Patients undergo daily compression with garments (sleeve and glove), nighttime bandaging with
      low stretch Comprilan bandages, and daily Flexitouch treatment over 1 hour every evening. Arm
      III: Patients undergo daily compression with garments (sleeve and glove) and daily Flexitouch
      treatment over 1 hour every evening. In all arms, treatment continues for 3 months.
