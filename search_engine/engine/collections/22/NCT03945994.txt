      Alongside medical and psychological support, people may need support with engaging in
      meaningful activities and developing relationships. The focus of this study is on advancing
      understanding of how services can improve the support they offer to people around social
      relationships.

      In a previous study, a Connecting People programme was developed which supported people to
      make plans for developing their network of contacts in the community. When delivered fully,
      it helped people feel more included in society and better able to access advice, information
      and practical support from people they know.

      This research project aims to look at how Connecting People can be effectively established
      within community mental health teams by social workers trained as part of the 'Think Ahead'
      initiative. The investigators want to know how to implement the Connecting People programme
      well, assessing whether tools such as manuals, guidance and specific training help or hinder
      this process. The investigators want to know when implemented, compared to standard care,
      whether the programme benefits mental health service users and is cost-effective.

      The study will last 15 months and is organised into two phrases:

        1. Implementation of the programme in community mental health teams in five areas in
           England. Outcome data will be collected from each participating team and results will be
           compared between teams who implemented the programme and those that only offered
           standard care.

        2. Exploration of how successful implementation was across the five areas, using a
           check-list and in-depth individual and group interviews to understand the features that
           supported or hindered the process.
