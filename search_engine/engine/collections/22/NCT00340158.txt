      that disproportionately affects young women. Clinical features of IBC include warmth,
      redness, edema, skin dimpling and rapid enlargement; the hallmark pathologically is dermal
      lymphatic invasion. Minimal criteria necessary for a clinical diagnosis of IBC have been
      debated and relatively little is known about the epidemiology, pathogenesis and molecular
      characteristics of these very lethal tumors. This project, funded by a grant from the
      Department of Defense awarded to PHL, would develop a national registry of approximately 300
      volunteers (aged 18 years or older) with IBC. Subjects will provide access to medical
      records, pathology records, slides, blocks and tissue (fixed and frozen) and x-rays and
      consent to an interview. Recruitment will be performed at collaborating institutions and
      through an IBC research foundation (Owen Johnson) that maintains a website and e-mail contact
      lists. The registry resources would be made available collaboratively to anyone in the breast
      cancer research community, based on merit as determined by a designated committee. Central
      aims of the study include determining whether clinically or pathologically defined IBC
      differs in clinical behavior or biologically, identifying markers in IBC that may provide
      useful information about the aggressive potential of breast cancers generally, and evaluation
      of tissue for mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV) related sequences. The purpose of this IRB
      submission is to review the role of MES as a collaborating pathologist on this study.
      Enrollment is closed as of this time.
