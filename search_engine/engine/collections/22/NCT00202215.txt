      this study is to more systematically evaluate the success of the Chrysalis Day Hospital
      Program in dealing with some features of eating disorders commonly experienced by its
      patients.

      At intake all clients will be approached to give informed consent to participate. If they do
      consent they will have their height and weight recorded( if they request they will not be
      told their weight)as part of the usual intake process conducted by a dietician.

      When clients exit the program they again will be approached to be weighed. The body mass
      index will be calculated and compared to admission values.

      The Chrysalis Program is a unique day hospital approach to treating individuals with severe
      personality disorders (primarily Borderline)that views the eating disordered behaviour common
      to these clients as a symptom of many and by addressing core issues of affect dysregulation
      as well as psychoeducation about eating the eating problems will improve .
