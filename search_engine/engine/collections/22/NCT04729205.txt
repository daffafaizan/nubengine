      receive 3 cycles of PROMITIL treatment, administered at four-week intervals, in combination
      with FOLFOX, administered at two-week intervals. Thereafter, patients may continue treatment
      with FOLFOX only, or with another regime at the investigator's discretion and will be
      followed up until death. Patients will be successively assigned, in order of accrual, to be
      concomitantly treated with PROMITIL and FOLFOX, at doses of PROMITIL meant to clear a dose of
      this combination treatment from DLT. Six patients will be treated with an initial
      DLT-clearing dose (Cohort 1). PROMITIL dose escalation from Cohort 1 to Cohort 2 will be
      authorized after 5 or 6 Cohort 1 patients complete their first two cycles of combination
      treatment with up to 1 DLT event reported for all 6 treated patients. If 2 or more Cohort 1
      patients suffer from a DLT event in the first two cycles of treatment, 6 patients will be
      enrolled to Cohort -1 and treated with one dose level lower of PROMITIL. If 2 or more DLT
      events occur in Cohorts 2 or -1, the study will be discontinued for these patients and only
      patients in Cohort 1 will complete the study as planned. In any case, the total number of
      evaluable patients in the DLT-clearing phase will be no more than 12.
