      normal pattern group (ND) with a traditional meal pattern. The TRE group consumed 100% of the
      daily energy needs in an 8-hour time window: from 1PM (post meridiem) to 8:00 PM whilst the
      ND group consumed 100% of their daily energy needs in 3 meals between 8:00 AM (ante meridiem)
      and 8:00 PM. During the experimental period, training loads were similar and standardize in
      the two groups. partecipants were tested before and after 8 weeks of the intervention. Body
      composition , basal metabolism, performances indexes and blood parameters were measured.
      After the completition of the first two months of study, subjects were ask to volunteer to
      continue the intervention for 10 extra months. A total of twenty subjects from, 10 from each
      group (TRE or ND) continued and completed the second part of the study.
