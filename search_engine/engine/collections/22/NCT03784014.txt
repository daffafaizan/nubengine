      used for genetic profiling. Patients can be considered as pre-eligible for the randomized
      phase when all genetic material have been received by the Platform.

      Randomization phase: the randomization will allocate the following arms with a ratio 1:1:

        -  experimental Arm NGS : treatment strategy based on NGS results [exome, RNASeq]

        -  standard Arm No NGS: treatment strategy not based on NGS (Note that for these
           participants and under specific conditions, subsequent NGS analyses may be allowed
           within the scope of the trial)

      Single-arm phase II sub-trial: at the end of the first-line treatment and regardless of tumor
      response as per RECIST v1.1, patients randomized in Arm NGS and for whom a targetable
      alteration has been identified by the Molecular Tumor Board will be considered as
      pre-eligible for the targeted sub-study. The mandatory post-chemotherapy wash-out period of
      21 days will provide time to achieve all the required tests and examinations.
