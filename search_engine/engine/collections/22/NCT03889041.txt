      degrees of feeding and swallowing difficulties Feeding and swallowing difficulties cause
      aspiration-induced recurrent pneumonia, malnutrition, dehydration and stressful interactions
      with their caregivers. There is lack of knowledge regarding the concerns of caregivers of
      children with EA-TEF related to feeding and swallowing disorders.Therefore, the aim of this
      study was to assess concerns of caregivers of children with EA-TEF related to
      feeding-swallowing difficulties.
