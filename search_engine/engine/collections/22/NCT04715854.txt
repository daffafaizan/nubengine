      hypoxemia can be corrected with low flow nasal cannula. When placed above nasal cannula, some
      systems have demonstrated their interest in improving the performance of the patient's oxygen
      delivery. For example, two recent studies have shown that adding a Double-Trunk Mask (DTM) or
      Surgical Mask (SM) above nasal cannula has the potential to improve the PaO2 despite no
      change in oxygen output (1, 2) . However, no study has compared the effect on PaO2, of the
      addition of a classical aerosol mask above nasal canula.
