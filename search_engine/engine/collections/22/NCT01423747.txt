      prognosis compared to all other patients with ALL. For these patients additional therapy
      approaches are required after they have achieved remission with multimodal chemotherapy.
      Allogeneic haematopoetic stem cell transplantation shows promising results mainly due to an
      immunological antileukaemic control by the graft-versus-leukaemia effect, but treatment
      related mortality and morbidity remains a serious problem.
