      Case-Report-Form (eCRF) was designed to collect relevant pre-specified items by the Clinical
      Trial Center North (CTC). All German sites that have implanted EndoBarrierÂ® since 2010 were
      invited to provide patient results. Data-acquisition is projected to a period of 5 years and
      a maximum of 1000 patients. An extension of data-acquisition is planned.
