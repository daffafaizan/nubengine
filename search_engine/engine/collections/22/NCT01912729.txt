      scalable, cost-effective, participant friendly behavioral intervention technologies (BITs)
      for the prevention of depression in adolescents. The investigators define BITs as
      interventions that use information and telecommunications technologies such as the internet,
      mobile or traditional phones, computers and/or other technologies to support and deliver
      psychological and behavioral interventions. Through usability testing, focus interviews, and
      field trials, investigators may modify the technologies and intervention based on immediate
      usage data.
