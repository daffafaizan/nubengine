      stimulation to the extremities is effective for improving sleep in children with sensory
      processing difficulties. The investigators will use Touchpoints to deliver the intervention.
      The Touchpoints look like a regular watch, and vibrate at different low level frequencies to
      produce a calming effect on the body. More information about Touchpoints can be found here:
      https://thetouchpointsolution.com/pages/shop-touchpoints. The investigators hypothesize that
      these types of wearable vibrating devices may help children fall asleep faster and possibly
      stay asleep longer. This study will allow the research team to test these assumptions.

      In this study, each child will be asked to do the following things:

        1. Wear an activity tracker watch on their wrist before bed and through the night for 10
           days consecutively (Baseline)

        2. Wear both the activity tracker watch (wrist) and the Touchpoints (both ankles) before
           bed and during sleep for 10 days straight. (Intervention)

        3. Wear the activity tracker watch on their wrist before bed and through the night for 10
           additional days (post-test)

      During the study, the parents will be asked to fill out a brief sleep diary.
