      inclusion is menarche. Overweight- with a Body Mass Index (BMI) percentage above 85%, divided
      into 2 groups: 15 girls with diagnosed PCOS, and 15 girls without diagnosed PCOS, without any
      other medical comorbidities. Followed at the pediatric endocrinology unit.

      The 2 groups would participate in 2 anaerobic tests to evaluate their performances. The data
      received will be used to evaluate their anaerobic attributes, and for comparison between the
      2 groups to determine any differences.

      The participants will be asked to refrain from any form of physical exercise during the
      previous day.

      After explanation to the patient and his parent and obtaining an informed consent, the
      participants will start the tests.

      The first test is the Repeated Sprint Test: The participant will run a distance of 40 meters,
      for 6 repetitions. The optimal running time will be calculated, total running time and the
      Performance Decrement of the run will be calculated.

      After that, there will be a 1-1.5 hours resting phase. The second test is the "Wingate Test"-
      the participants will be instructed to pedal at a maximal pace for 30 seconds on an
      ergometric bicycle against a resistance adjusted according to their BMI. The Peak Anaerobic
      Power, the Mean Anaerobic Power and the Fatigue Index will be calculated.
