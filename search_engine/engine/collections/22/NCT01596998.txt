      period after surgeries involving the anterior abdominal wall. However, the information
      regarding the sensitive range of the blockade and its duration is still limited. Since that
      the area of administration is an intermuscular plane, it is possible to infer a large area of
      absorption. Knowing plasma concentrations is essential to balance the usefulness of this
      technique with potential systemic toxicity associated with its use.

      As an additional effect, clinically, the use of vasoconstrictors may prolong the duration of
      the blockade significantly, depending on the drug used and site of administration. To date,
      no studies evaluating the effect of the addition of vasoconstrictor both in the plasma
      concentrations achieved, and the quality, extent and duration of the TAP block.
