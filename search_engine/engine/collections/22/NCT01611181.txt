      in Denmark approximately 12,000 operations are performed annually (2/1000/year). The
      perioperative and postoperative blood loss generally constitutes ½ -1½ litres which is
      frequently associated with symptom-producing anaemia which obstructs mobilisation and
      increases the risk of complications.

      Postoperative iron supplementation for a period of up to 12 weeks is therefore a frequently
      adopted practice. However, there is no consensus or evidence that support postoperative iron
      supplementation and the effects of iron deficiency are unclear. It is well-known that iron
      supplementation causes gastrointestinal adverse effects in up to 25% of cases.
