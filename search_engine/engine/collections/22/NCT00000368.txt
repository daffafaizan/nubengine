      panic disorder (PD) who respond to an initial course of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)
      alone. For those who do not respond sufficiently to CBT alone, to determine if the addition
      of pharmacotherapy is acceptable and if this improves response among those inadequate
      responders to CBT alone.

      This multicenter study builds upon the findings of a prior study comparing imipramine,
      placebo, CBT, and their combination in the treatment of PD patients with no more than mild
      agoraphobia. That study found response rates were as high with CBT or imipramine alone as
      with their combination. Given the added cost of combined treatments, it therefore seems
      reasonable to begin with monotherapy. Further, following general principles of medical
      practice, it would be reasonable to initiate treatment with the less invasive cognitive
      behavioral intervention. It is then important to learn what should be done following initial
      treatment.

      All patients initially receive CBT alone. Patients are then randomized into 1 of 2 post-acute
      studies, depending on response status. Responders are randomized to a maintenance study
      comparing no maintenance with 9 months of continued CBT. Nonresponders are randomized to a
      study comparing paroxetine with continued CBT. The following outcomes will be examined: the
      necessity of maintenance therapy in maintaining response; the ability of adjunct
      pharmacotherapy to improve the response of patients who did not respond to CBT alone;
      possible predictors of response and relapse; and possible mediators of response.
