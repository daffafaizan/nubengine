      hospitalized patients. Following the first episode, up to 15% of people experience recurrent
      disease. A major risk factor for recurrent disease is exposure to systemic antibiotics.

      Oral vancomycin given four times daily is one of the treatments for Clostridium difficile
      infection; it is not known if giving oral vancomycin at a lower dose such as once daily may
      help prevent recurrences. Oral vancomycin may be most helpful in preventing recurrences when
      given to patients at greatest risk of recurrent disease, such as when they are receiving
      systemic antibiotics.

      To evaluate this, the investigators propose comparing the rates of recurrent Clostridium
      difficile infection in patients who receive oral vancomycin with systemic antibiotics to when
      patients take systemic antibiotics alone.
