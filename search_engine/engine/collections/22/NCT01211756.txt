      continue to experience significant symptoms. There is a strong need for better treatments
      including treatments that can safely be given adjunctively with concurrent antidepressants in
      order to improve overall efficacy of treatment.

      Oxytocin is a neurohypophyseal peptide best known for its role as a neurohormone involved in
      parturition and lactation. In addition to these well established peripheral effects, there is
      a compelling body of converging evidence indicating that oxytocin plays a critical role in
      the regulation of a number of diverse centrally-mediated behavioral and cognitive processes
      that are highly relevant to mood regulation and mood disorders, including social attachment
      (Argiolas and Gessa 1990; McCarthy and Aaltemus 1997).

      Each subject will be enrolled for a 8 week treatment period after a screening phase. Study
      procedure involves weekly clinic visits as an outpatient. Twenty patients will be randomly
      assigned to either 40 IU oxytocin twice daily or vehicle placebo. After 4 weeks, treatments
      will be crossed over such that subjects that received oxytocin will receive placebo and vice
      versa. The study ratio is 1:1. Dose of oxytocin is based upon previous studies in humans
      showing improvement in psychiatric populations related changes in behavior and brain function
      (Kosfeld et al, 2005; Kirsch 2005; Heinrich M 2003).

      The total study duration for each individual subject will be approximately 9 weeks, which
      includes up to 31-day screening period, a baseline (randomization) visit, four week treatment
      period, 1 week washout, baseline 2 visit, and four weeks cross over treatment.
