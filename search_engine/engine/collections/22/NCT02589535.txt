    
      Primary objective: to determine the time course level of the circulating EPC (CD133/CD34),
      SDF-1a, and HIF-1 in septic patients undergoing major abdominal surgery.

      Secondary objective 1: to investigate the relationship between these factors: CD133/CD34,
      HIF-1 and SDF-1a.

      Secondary objective 2: to investigate the relationship between CD133/CD34, HIF-1, SDF-1Â° and
      outcomeof septic/septic shock patients treated with standard conventional therapy alone (CT)
      or with extracorporeal hemoperfusion therapy (HCT).

      In this trial, we hypothesize that CD133/CD34, HIF1 and SDF1a will increase in septic
      surgical patients as consequence of impaired tissue perfusion and cellular hypoxia. Our
      hypothesis is based on the fact that the stimulation of factors hypoxia-related, as SDF-1a
      and HIF-1 could be the primary step for bone marrow stem cells stimulation. Furthermore, we
      assume that survivors septic patients will show higher levels of EPC, HIF-1 and SDF-1a.

      Each day, the anesthesiologist of the operating room and the on-call anesthesiologist will
      alerts the principal investigator to a potential eligible patient. Participants included in
      the trial will be divided into two groups:

        -  C group: postoperative non septic patients in emergency surgical ward (ES) (control
           group)

        -  S group: postoperative septic shock patients in intensive care unit (ICU) Healthy
           volunteers (H group) will be recruited from among staff members of the University
           Hospital of Foggia

      The research study can provide useful parameters for early diagnostic and therapeutic
      interventions in sepsis which is the leading cause of death from infection, with an incidence
      of approximately 10% in ICU postoperative patients according to recent epidemiologic studies.
