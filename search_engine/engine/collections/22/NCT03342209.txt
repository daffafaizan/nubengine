      requires immediate attention. It is responsible for up to 40,000 emergency department (ED)
      visits and 5000 to 6000 deaths per year, making it one of the leading causes of poisoning
      death in the United States. The management options for CO poisoning are limited to high flow
      oxygen by face mask or hyperbaric oxygen treatment. While half-life of carboxyhemoglobin
      (COHb) in a patient treating with high flow oxygen via a nonbreathing face mask is 90
      minutes, it becomes 30 minutes with hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBO).

      The hypothesis of this study is using high flow nasal oxygen therapy in the CO poisoning may
      be more effective and safer treatment method comparing to standard oxygen therapy in the ED.
      Also, it may be a safe promising alternative of hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

      The aim of the study is to determine the half-life of COHb in CO-poisoned patients with high
      flow nasal oxygen therapy in the ED.
