    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the 6-months progression-free survival (PFS) rate with the combination of
      dose attenuated doublet chemotherapy with durvalumab in advanced non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) patients with Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) 2
      status or age >= 70.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate overall response rate. II. To determine the safety profile of the regimen.
      III. To determine the median PFS and overall survival.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Exploratory investigation of biomarkers that could potentially serve as predictive
      indicators: characterize immunoprofile in peripheral blood by flow cytometry.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (SQUAMOUS NSCLC): Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 15-60 minutes,
      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3
      weeks for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who do not progress receive durvalumab IV every 4 weeks for up to 35 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (NON-SQUAMOUS NSCLC): Patients receive carboplatin IV over 15-60 minutes, pemetrexed
      IV over 10 minutes and durvalumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      who do not progress receive durvalumab IV and pemetrexed IV every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
