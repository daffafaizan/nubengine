      I. Assess the efficacy of gemcitabine hydrochloride, paclitaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride,
      and pegfilgrastim, in terms of response rate, in patients with metastatic or unresectable
      transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder or urinary tract and renal insufficiency.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. II. Determine the
      median time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

      III. Determine the median survival duration in patients treated with this regimen.

      IV. Assess the safety and efficacy of pegfilgrastim in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenous (IV) over 20 minutes, paclitaxel IV
      over 60 minutes, gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 90 minutes, and pegfilgrastim
      subcutaneously on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 9 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.
