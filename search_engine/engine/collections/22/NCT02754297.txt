    
      A prospective, single-center, non-comparative, open phase 2 study. In this study,
      personalized peptide receptor radionuclide therapy (P-PRRT) with 177Lu-Octreotate (LuTate)
      will be administered to patients with progressive and/or symptomatic inoperable
      neuroendocrine tumors (NET) of any origin expressing the somatostatin receptor.

      The primary objective to assess the objective response rate at 3 months following a
      four-cycle induction course of P-PRRT will be assessed for at least the first 85
      participants.

      This study as a compassionate aim to provide access to personalized PRRT patients at CHU de
      Québec - Université Laval center, and therefore this study has no pre-determined recruitment
      period duration or limited number of participants, and may remain open as long as necessary
      to fulfill this aim.
