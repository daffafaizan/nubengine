      procedures. However, because of the risk of reinfusion of salvaged blood contaminated by
      tumor cells, the use of autotransfusion in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) patients undergoing
      liver resection is controversial. The critical points include whether tumor cells can be
      cleared by autotransfusion, whether autotransfusion increases the risk of recurrence or
      metastasis, and what are the indications for autotransfusion. Moreover, some other issues are
      still not addressed. For example, is it warranted to take the risk of tumor dissemination by
      using autotransfusion to avoid allogeneic blood transfusion? Do the remaining tumor cells
      after additional filtration by leukocyte depletion filters still possess potential
      tumorigenicity?
