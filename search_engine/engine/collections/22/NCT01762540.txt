      insulin resistance. The underlying mechanisms are insufficiently characterized, however
      glucocorticoid induced changes of Growth Hormone (GH) and the Insulin-like growth factor I
      (IGF-I) appear to be of outmost importance.

      We wish to investigate the mechanism behind glucocorticoid induced catabolism and insulin
      resistance.

      More specific we wish to investigate:

        -  Whether glucocorticoid induces IGF-I inhibiting substances in serum or interstitial
           fluid that block the ability of IGF-I to phosphorylate its receptor in vitro

        -  Whether glucocorticoid inhibits intracellular IGF-I and insulin signaling in vitro and
           in vivo

        -  The mechanisms by which growth hormone counteracts the CG-mediated inhibition of IGF-I
           action
