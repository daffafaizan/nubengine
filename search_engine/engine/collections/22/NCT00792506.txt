      monoclonal protein in the blood or urine and disease in the bone marrow (BM). The malignant
      plasma cells accumulate in the BM and intricate interactions occur between the BM
      microenvironment and the MM cells, frequently causing bone destruction, which in turn
      stimulates tumour growth. The tumour itself, its products and the host response to it result
      in the multitude of symptoms and organ dysfunction characteristic of MM, including bone pain,
      renal failure, susceptibility to infections, anaemia and hypercalcemia. The median age at
      diagnosis is 68 years and men are more frequently affected than women.

      ITF2357 is a novel and proprietary molecule synthesized by Italfarmaco S.p.A. Research
      Laboratories, provided with an established and powerful HDAC-inhibitory activity. It is being
      developend for a range of possible clinical applications both in oncohaematological
      conditions and in chronic inflammatory diseases. The former application is consistent with
      the well known antitumor pharmacological properties of HDAC-inhibitors as a family (i.e.
      cell-cycle arrest, pro-apoptotic and cell-differentiating effects); the latter application
      (chronic inflammation) is based of the demonstrated anticytokine effect of ITF2357.
