      promoting patient comfort, tolerability and safety while improving office efficiency. The
      cystoscope, named the Uro-C, is light-weight, ergonomic, handheld, battery-operated portable
      system that integrates a disposable cannula with a reusable handle that contains video
      electronics, is wireless capable, and has a liquid crystal display (LCD) monitor. Cystoscopy
      with the new system is performed in a standard manner to cystoscopy with currently available
      endoscopes, so risks are no different than when currently available endoscopes are used.

      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm, open-label clinical usability study in
      subjects who are candidates for office diagnostic cystoscopy. The primary objective of this
      initial device assessment is to evaluate the performance of the cystoscope for direct
      visualization of the urethra and bladder.
