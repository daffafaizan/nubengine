      although its possible adverse events. Continuous epidural administration of local anesthetics
      can stabilize the analgesic block and reduce the anesthesiologists' workload but is
      associated with an increase in operative vaginal delivery.

      Epidural intermittent boluses performed by anesthetist are associated to reduction of
      dosages, but they could provide insufficient analgesia and they involve the constant
      anesthetist's presence in the operating room.

      This is a multicenter randomized controlled trial with two arms, funded by grant of Regione
      Emilia Romagna, in which we will compare two different epidural analgesia protocols:
      anesthesiologist's supervised versus intermittent boluses with PCEA.
