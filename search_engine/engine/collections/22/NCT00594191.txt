      endothelial dysfunction. In cirrhosis sinusoidal endothelial dysfunction further increases
      intrahepatic resistance and portal pressure. Previous studies have shown that statins improve
      hepatic endothelial dysfunction in cirrhosis, suggesting that statins could be an effective
      therapy for portal hypertension (PHT). This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects
      of continuous simvastatin administration on the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), as a
      surrogate marker of prognosis, and its safety in patients with cirrhosis and PHT.
