      controlled ventilation with PEEP after apnoea during induction of general anesthesia, might
      offer several benefits but safety issues needs more investigation. This study compares the
      safety of using pressure controlled with PEEP during induction of general anesthesia
      immediately after apnoea to a standard method starting ventilation manually without PEEP
      immediately after apnoea.
