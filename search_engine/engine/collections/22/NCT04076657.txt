      numerous vision diagnoses, including convergence and accommodative insufficiencies, following
      sport-related concussion (SRC). Researchers have found associations with worse neurocognitive
      test scores, higher post-concussion symptom burden, and longer recovery among patients with
      receded NPC relative to concussion patients with normal NPC. Although oculomotor dysfunction
      may resolve spontaneously or improves with vision therapy exercises in the post-acute phase
      of recovery, it is unclear if early intervention can improve recovery outcomes. The Brock
      String is a cost effective and practical vision therapy exercise for congenital convergence
      insufficiency (CI), and initial research supports effectiveness with SRC patients who have
      receded NPC in the subacute phase of recovery (e.g., weeks to months post injury). Early
      vision therapy intervention may be efficacious in improving recovery times and reduce
      healthcare costs by eliminating later therapies for chronic deficits.
