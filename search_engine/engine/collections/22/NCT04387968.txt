      and consequently multiple exposures and risks.

      The global covid-19 pandemic has affected France and the Loiret, the sarscov-2 coronavirus,
      has infected several thousand people. On May 7, 2020, there were 75 deaths at the CHRO
      hospital in Orleans, excluding EHPAD. The contamination rate of the population of the Loiret
      department has been estimated at 5.6% of the population by Public Health France. This rate is
      very low and does not allow the use of serological screening tests because of too many false
      positives or false negatives, there should be a prevalence of the disease greater than 60%.
      The French health authorities do not recommend the use of a screening test at the present
      time in view of the uncertainties of the results of this test. The Loiret Management Center,
      the Department and Orléans Métropole have decided to offer a covid-19 serological screening
      test, the covid-19 presto test, to voluntary territorial agents regardless of their return to
      work following the national "deconfinement "on May 11, 2020 This can only be done through an
      epidemiological surveillance study validated as part of a research protocol.
