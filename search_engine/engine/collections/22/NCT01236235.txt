      enrolled in 2011/2012 but data will be collected from medical charts from ATV initiation date
      (Feb 2008 - July 2010) until July 2013 at the latest (if no ATV discontinuation, or death, or
      lost to follow up).

      Non probability sample:

        -  Specialized HIV management centers will be contacted in order to recruit about 15-20
           sites per country.

        -  Each site will have to enroll an average of 8-12 consecutive patients (min:5; max:30)
           fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria.
