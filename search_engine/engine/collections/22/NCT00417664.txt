      Between 32 - 80% of cardiac surgery patients may experience post-operative delirium. Because
      failure to recognize delirium leads to increased morbidity and mortality and prolonged
      hospital stays, there are compelling clinical and financial reasons to improve the
      identification and treatment of delirium. Dexmedetomidine, a selective alpha2-adrenergic
      receptor agonist, may be an alternative to current postoperative sedation when it comes to
      lowering the incidence of delirium.

      Comparisons: The use of postoperative (at sternal closure) dexmedetomidine will be compared
      to current standards of care propofol and midazolam for postoperative sedation.
