    
      Part A was a 1-week, open-label study to assess safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      biomarkers for three dose levels of edasalonexent and is now complete.

      Part B was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple dose study to evaluate
      the safety, efficacy, PK, and PD of edasalonexent over 12 weeks. Patients who participated in
      Part A also participated in Part B, along with newly enrolled patients. Patients received
      either edasalonexent 67 mg/kg/day, edasalonexent 100 mg/kg/day, or placebo in Part B. Part B
      is now complete.

      Following completion of Part B, patients receive edasalonexent for 138 weeks in Part C, the
      open-label portion of the MoveDMD study. Patients on the 67 mg/kg/day treatment moved to the
      100 mg/kg/day treatment. Patients on the 100 mg/kg/day treatment remained on the 100
      mg/kg/day treatment. If clinically indicated, concomitant treatment with eteplirsen (Exondys
      51â„¢) may be acceptable in patients with amenable gene mutations during Part C after the
      patient has been exposed to edasalonexent for 6 months.

      **Following completion of MoveDMD Part C, access to edasalonexent for trial participants will
      continue through the open-label extension study, GalaxyDMD.**
