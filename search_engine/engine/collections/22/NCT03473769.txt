      established therapies.Epic's electronic medical record (Epic systems, Verona, WI) contains a
      surveillance tool that uses predictive analytics to identify patients at risk of becoming
      septic four hours after the alert becomes active. This affords the opportunity to intervene
      sooner, but it remains unclear what the best course of action should be in a population at
      risk of sepsis, only some of which may go on to develop the illness. We propose an automatic
      intervention, consisting of enhanced monitoring, that is tied to the alert. No therapeutics
      will be mandated. Instead, additional monitoring information will lead to faster diagnosis
      and therapy, and improved clinical outcomes.
