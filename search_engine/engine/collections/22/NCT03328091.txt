      counseling or in-person pre-test genetic counseling. Outcomes evaluated are: prevalence of
      germline mutations, uptake of genetic testing, satisfaction with testing, knowledge of
      multi-gene panels, distress, result disclosure to relatives, and the impact on personal or
      family medical care. Through this study, the investigators will learn about the inherited
      causes of prostate cancer, and how and when genetic testing should be offered to this
      population.
