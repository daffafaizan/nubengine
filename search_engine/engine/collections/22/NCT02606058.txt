      transfusion is a simple way of giving the baby extra blood at birth by delaying the clamping
      of the umbilical cord by 60 seconds or more. There is promising evidence from randomised
      trials that placental transfusion in babies less than 37 weeks of pregnancy may improve their
      blood pressure, reduce the number of blood transfusions needed and decrease bleeding into the
      brain, bowel disease and infection. However, we not know if babies born before 30 weeks of
      pregnancy benefit or if placental transfusion increases or decreases death or childhood
      disability. Despite this uncertainty more doctors are recommending that all very preterm
      babies are given a placental transfusion at birth. It is important to find out if placental
      transfusion does more good than harm, before it becomes even more widely used.

      The Australian Placental Transfusion Study will enrol at least 1600 women who will give birth
      to babies born less than 30 weeks of gestation. These participants will be randomly assigned
      to either standard treatment where the umbilical cord is clamped within 10 seconds of birth
      or a second method where the umbilical cord will be clamped after waiting for 60 seconds or
      more at birth while the baby is being held below the level of the placenta. The main research
      question is whether placental transfusion reduces death and disability when the baby is
      discharged from hospital and into childhood.
