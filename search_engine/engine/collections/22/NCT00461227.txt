      experience wheezing, coughing, chest tightness, and trouble breathing. Although asthma is a
      major public health problem among Puerto Ricans, little research has been done to determine
      the influence of heredity and environment on the disease in this population. To learn more
      about these relationships, this study will examine the effects of certain genes and allergens
      on the development and severity of asthma in Puerto Rican children.

      This observational study will recruit both children with asthma and children without asthma.
      Participants will meet with study staff twice during the study. The first visit will take
      place at participants' homes. Participants will complete questionnaires about demographics,
      respiratory and general health, and household characteristics. Lung function testing,
      collection of blood samples, and collection of household dust samples will also take place at
      the home-based visit. The second visit will take place at the study site. At this visit,
      participants will undergo allergy tests on the skin and a methacholine challenge test to
      assess their airway responsiveness and asthma severity. The methacholine challenge test will
      involve inhaling mist through a mouthpiece and blowing forcefully into a special apparatus
      called a spirometer. Parents will be asked to provide information about their children's
      exposure to pets in early life. Each visit will last approximately 1.5 hours and will be
      scheduled close to the date on which a participant enters the study.
