      patients. Once the informed consent form is signed, the subcutaneous device for continuous
      glycaemia motorization will be implanted and demographic, comorbidities and treatments of
      every patient will be registered. During the first 96 hours, capillar glycaemia, NIHSS scale,
      HbA1C levels, cerebral recanalization treatment and glycaemia correcting treatments will also
      be reported. In the following days (7, 30 and 90 days after stroke) modified Rankin Scale,
      NIHSS scale and stroke secondary prevention treatments will be evaluated. At day 90, a new
      measure of HbA1C will be done.
