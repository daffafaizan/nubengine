      Primary

        -  Evaluate the effect, in terms of size and number reduction of computed tomography (CT)
           scan-detected undetermined lung nodules, in asymptomatic subjects with lung nodules at
           high-risk for developing lung cancer treated with inhaled budesonide vs placebo.

      Secondary

        -  Compare average modification of nodule size and nodule number due to inhaled budesonide
           versus placebo.

        -  Correlate the modulation of biological markers of lung cancer in serum and sputum after
           treatment with the modification of lung nodules sizes.

        -  Determine treatment toxicity, side effects, and safety of inhaled budesonide.

        -  Evaluate the role of CT scans in estimating the grade of respiratory impairment and
           emphysema.

        -  Determine the effect of inhaled budesonide on respiratory function before and after
           treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study.

      Participants are stratified according to gender, smoking habit (current vs former smoker),
      and nodule characteristics (solid vs semisolid or non-solid). Participants are randomized
      into 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Subjects receive inhaled budesonide twice daily for 1 year in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Subjects receive inhaled placebo twice daily for 1 year in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Participants undergo blood and sputum collection periodically during study for biomarker and
      correlative studies.

      After completion of study therapy, subjects are followed at 1 month and continue CT scan
      screening.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 202 patients will be accrued for this study.
