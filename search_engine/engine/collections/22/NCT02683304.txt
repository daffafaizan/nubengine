      A. To seek an association between S100B protein levels and the onset of pain depending on
      whether it is more or less than 3 hours.

      B. To assess the association between S100B protein levels and mortality at day 28.

      C. To evaluate the association between S100B protein levels and hospital care: average length
      of stay in the emergency department, lumbar puncture, brain imaging, average length of
      hospital stay.

      D. To evaluate the prognostic value of determination of S100B protein on the occurrence of a
      secondary headache at 1 month.
