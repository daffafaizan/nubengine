      list and then are re-consented periodically thereafter until they undergo the lung transplant
      surgery. A pre-surgical assessment consisting of medical history, physical exam, ECG, chest
      X-Ray, and blood tests are conducted. After lung transplant surgery, patients are assessed
      for continued eligibility. Within 6-24 hours after the end of surgery, patients are
      randomized to receive one infusion of study drug or placebo through a central venous
      catheter. Each day for 5 days following transplant surgery, patients are monitored for
      transplant rejection, infections, adverse events and laboratory test changes. On
      post-randomization Days 14, 30, 60, 90, 180, 270 and 365, patients will be monitored for
      acute transplant rejection, infections and cancer, pulmonary function tests and adverse
      experiences. Pulmonary biopsies will be performed on post-randomization Days 30, 60, 90, 180
      and 365. Blood samples will be drawn during each visit.
