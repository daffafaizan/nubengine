      or a boot for treatment and the patients need to use crutches for balance. These fractures
      can lead to complications including non union or delayed union in addition to risks of
      clotting of the leg vessels (deep vein thrombosis) where these clots can dislodge and migrate
      to the lungs (pulmonary embolus) resulting in breathing difficulties and/or death. Also these
      fractures commonly result in patients needing a temporary period of residential care.
      Therefore, if the healing time can be reduced, there is a potential for large benefits for
      the patient and reduced care costs for health and social care services.

      Teriparatide hormone is one of the new medications used for treating osteoporosis(weak
      bones), and studies in the USA have reported that Teriparatide hormone treatment can
      accelerate bone fracture healing time in pelvic fractures.

      Other reports also support faster healing time when Teriparatide hormone is used.

      The investigators are carrying out this feasibility study with 10 participants, in order to
      provide the information that will prepare us for carrying out a definitive study in the
      future.
