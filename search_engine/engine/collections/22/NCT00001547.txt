      characterized neuropsychiatric toxicity. The primary purpose of this study is to determine if
      treatment with IFN-A in combination with ribavirin alters human brain biochemistry as
      measured by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The study population will be drawn from
      subjects simultaneously enrolled in a NIDDK protocol (98-DK-0003) that employs IFN-A and
      ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Subjects will be evaluated
      prior to IFN-A/ribavirin treatment and then followed prospectively with the specific aim of
      identifying the emergence of central nervous system (CNS) effects. The principal outcome
      measures will be as follows: determinations of specific brain metabolites as measured by
      proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), a brief, non-invasive, and minimal risk
      procedure; ratings of mood, cognitive, and behavioral symptoms.

      The hypotheses being tested in this study are as follows:

        1. Treatment with IFN-A/ribavirin will decrease measures of neuronal integrity (NAA/CRE
           ratio) in a brain region specific fashion.

        2. The degree of change in NAA/CRE in certain brain regions (e.g. prefrontal cortex) will
           correspond to the development of mood or cognitive symptoms.

      The questions being asked in this study are relevant to the clinical management of HCV
      patients, since adverse neuropsychiatric effects of IFN-A and ribavirin frequently complicate
      protocol participation and occasionally result in a subject being taken off protocol. There
      are no anticipated number of patient days per year required for this study, as all
      participants will be simultaneously enrolled in NIDDK protocol 98-DK-0003.
