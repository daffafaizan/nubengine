    
      At the peak of the COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic in New York City, there was a shortage of
      hospital resources as well as a fear among many New Yorkers of going to the hospital.
      Emergency Services dead on arrival calls increased by as much as eight-fold.We created the
      CROWN Program, a pulmonary physician guided home-care protocol to treat ambulatory COVID-19
      (SARS-CoV-2) patients with moderate to high risk features. This is a retrospective review of
      our CROWN program's patient characteristics, results and outcomes.
