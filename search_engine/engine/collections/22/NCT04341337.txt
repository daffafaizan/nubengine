    
      -  Objective: Using the example of Pressurized Intra Peritoneal Aerosol Chemotherapy
           (PIPAC), the investigators analyze the development model of this procedure and provide
           an ethical analysis of the involvement of the industry in this development.

        -  Summary Background Data: In the case of breakthrough innovation, medical training is
           essential for safe use of the new procedure. Pharmaceutical companies may organize this
           training; but when it becomes the only training opportunity to use the device,
           scientists and clinicians are exposed to a conflict of interest.

        -  Methods: The investigators performed a literature review of PIPAC publications using the
           STROBE criteria. Then, the investigators conducted interviews with an expert panel to
           analyze the ethical impact of involvement of the industry in the development of the
           PIPAC procedure.
