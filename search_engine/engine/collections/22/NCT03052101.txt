      Consortium (RLDC) and through the Histiocytosis Association websites. Participants will have
      access to the questionnaire via REDCap (an online data management system) and each
      participant will be provided a link to complete the survey. In case of lack of internet
      access or inability to complete the online questionnaire, a paper survey will be mailed out
      with a pre-paid envelope to return the survey.
