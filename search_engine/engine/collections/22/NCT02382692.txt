      tumors and other pathologies. These procedures are performed in the immediate vicinity of the
      skull base. The risk of injuring the membranes covering the brain in a way that requires
      further treatment is less than 1% [ 1]. Such Injuries to the skull base could lead to the
      loss of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The destruction of the natural barrier raises the
      potential risk of ascending infections of the membranes and the brain itself from the nose.
      Leakage of cerebrospinal fluid in the usually bloody surgical field of view is not always
      distinguishable and is sometimes only noticed postoperatively. The spontaneous closure of a
      leaky membrane of the brain without further surgical treatment is known. This is why small
      traumata in the skull base often remain undetected.

      At the end of the operation, a thin gauze is inserted into the nose on both sides in addition
      to the usual tampon. The tampon and the additional gauze are removed the day after the
      operation and will be sent with a tube of venous blood to the laboratory. The gauze and the
      venous blood will be checked for beta-2-transferrin, which is a biomarker for cerebrospinal
      fluid.

      During further clinical standard controls will the patient be asked about symptoms of fluid
      leak through the nose.

      If positive, regardless to this study, the patient must have an additional CT scan of the
      sinuses and another blood sample checking for beta-2-transferrin.
