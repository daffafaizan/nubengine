        -  Determine the overall survival of patients with stage III or IV squamous cell head and
           neck cancer treated with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil followed by accelerated
           fractionation/concomitant boost radiotherapy and cisplatin.

        -  Determine the unconfirmed complete response rate in these patients after treatment with
           induction chemotherapy.

        -  Determine the overall complete response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed) in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction Chemotherapy: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over
           30-60 minutes on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-4. Treatment repeats
           every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Beginning within 3-4 weeks after administration of the second course
           of induction chemotherapy, patients receive accelerated fractionation radiotherapy once
           daily, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks with concomitant boost radiotherapy once daily, 5
           days a week, for the last 2.5 weeks of radiotherapy. Patients also receive concurrent
           cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 22.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months
      for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
