      I. To collect gynecologic tissue and blood from participating Gynecologic Oncology Group
      (GOG) institutions.

      II. To provide a repository for long-term storage of gynecologic tissue and blood that will
      be used in studies designed to better understand the molecular biology of gynecologic tumors.

      III. To make available, through the GOG Tissue Bank, tissue and blood for proposed projects
      conducted by GOG and non-GOG investigators.

      OUTLINE:

      Snap frozen tumor tissue, OCT molds of tumor tissue, formalin-preserved tumor tissue, buffy
      coat-prepared tumor tissue, and blood samples are collected and stored in the repository.
      Patient information is kept confidential, and patients are not informed of any research/test
      results from use of their tissues.
