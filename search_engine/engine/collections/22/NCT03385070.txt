      2025.HT accounts for almost 50% of deaths due to stroke and coronary artery disease.
      Salt-sensitive hypertension (SSH) accounts for about the half of all HT cases. Na+ /K+-ATPase
      activity is impaired in patients with SSH . Impaired Na+ /K+-ATPase activity in the lens
      epithelium results in cortical opacities in the peripheral equatorial region of the lens.A
      definite diagnosis of salt sensitivity is difficult, expensive, and associated with low
      patient compliance. Salt sensitivity is a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and
      morbidity regardless of blood pressure and for other diseases such as asthma, gastric
      carcinoma, osteoporosis, and renal dysfunction. The present study is the first to investigate
      the potential of using lens opacity to predict SSH.

      The transparency of the whole lens is largely based on epithelial cell permeability and Na+
      /K+-ATPase activity. Circulation is activated by Na+ /K+-ATPases, which are present at
      20-fold normal concentrations, particularly in the equatorial than in the anterior epithelial
      cells.

      The mechanisms associated with SSH pathogenesis, such as signaling pathways involving Src
      family kinase (SFK), endothelin, connexin, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), aldosterone,
      transient receptor protein V4 (TRPV4) ion channel, with-no-lysine kinase-Ste20-like
      proline/alanine rich kinase/oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1 (WNK-SPAK/OSR1), and
      Ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate (Rac1) , are important to the physiology of the lens
      epithelium. Compelling studies suggest that inhibition of these pathways may facilitate
      opacity.
