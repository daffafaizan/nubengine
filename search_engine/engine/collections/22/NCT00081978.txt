      specifically for you by your doctor. There are three treatment groups in the study. One group
      will be given a dosage of TMC125, 400 mg twice daily. Another will be given 800 mg twice
      daily. The third group, a control arm, will not receive TMC125 (formulation TF035). The
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (determinations of the concentration of drug in
      your blood and its evolution over time) of TMC125 will also be evaluated in this study.
      Patients who have known resistance to NNRTIs and 3 or more protease inhibitor (PI) mutations
      may be eligible to participate. One-hundred-fifty (150) patients will be enrolled into this
      study. TMC125, 400mg twice daily for 48 weeks; TMC125, 800mg twice daily for 48 weeks.
