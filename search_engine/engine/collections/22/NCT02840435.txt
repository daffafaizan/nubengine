      to Quit" through a randomized-control trial. This study will compare abstinence outcomes in
      the Sit to Quit study group to a control group using the North Carolina State Tobacco Quit
      Line. This is an investigational study (n=60) designed to test Sit to Quit (STQ) versus Quit
      Line (QL) through a pilot randomized control trial. The proposed study is designed with
      double-blind procedures (participants and study staff) for randomization of 60 participants
      recruited through Duke Smoking Cessation Program into two groups: STQ and QL. STQ
      participants will receive access to the STQ Instructional Video, the STQ manual, and
      proactive Quit Coach calls supporting STQ. QL participants will be instructed to contact the
      NC Quit Line and will receive access to "web Coach" (Alere Well-being site), the Quit Line
      manual, and proactive Quit Coach calls supporting "Quit for Life." All statistical analysis
      will be performed under the directions of the statistician designated in key personnel.
      Outcomes of variables including: demographic variables, evaluation responses, and abstinence
      rates will be analyzed using general regression models using an ANOVA-based design. The study
      Principal Investigator Dr. James Davis will ultimately be responsible for data and safety
      monitoring. Subject data will be collected during visits and captured in the Electronic
      Medical Record. Data will be collected by phone, and this data will be stored in REDCap.
      Participants that experience events related to their clinical treatment will be recommended
      to follow-up with their provider.
