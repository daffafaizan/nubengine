      differences in cognition (thinking), by analyzing results of cognitive testing in individuals
      with a history of hypoglycemia as compared with those without known hypoglycemia.

      This pilot study will identify cognitive domains of interest in participants with
      hypoglycemia, as well as inform the development of a future battery of assessments, which
      could be replicated in a larger sample. Cognitive domains which will be assessed include:
      memory, language, executive function, and psychomotor speed.
