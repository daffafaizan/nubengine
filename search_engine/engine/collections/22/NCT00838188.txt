      gastric tube is thus recommended. Sucking skills mature at around 34 weeks when
      nipple-feeding is introduced. In the absence of evidence-based data to decide the best timing
      to introduce breastfeeding, many clinicians use empiric criteria, such as the infant's
      weight, gestational age, and the ability of infants to bottle feed as proxies of readiness to
      breastfeed. Despite some evidence of physiological benefits of preterm infants feeding at the
      breast, many neonatologists consider direct breastfeeding to be too fatiguing for preterm
      infants. It is not known, however, whether preterm infants who are breastfed expend more
      energy than bottle-fed infants
