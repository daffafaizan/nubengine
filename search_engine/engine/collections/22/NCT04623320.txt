      resistance in type 1 diabetes subjects. The plasma insulin concentration is acutely raised
      and maintained at 100 Î¼U/ml by a continuous infusion of insulin. Meanwhile, the plasma
      glucose concentration is held constant at basal levels by a variable glucose infusion. When
      the steady-state is achieved, the glucose infusion rate equals glucose uptake by all the
      tissues in the body and is therefore a measure of tissue insulin sensitivity.

      These data will be compared with the results of a 13C glucose breath test. Breath tests using
      13C substrates are based on the principle that 13C CO2 in the exhaled breath can be measured
      as a metabolic tracer.

      Breath testing has a major advantage over the clamp test in that it can be performed
      non-invasively and repeatedly without necessary supervision by medical staff.
