      received an NNRTI containing treatment for prevention of mother to child transmission (MTCT),
      and who have never used a protease inhibitor (PI) may be eligible to participate. TMC125 (at
      800 mg b.i.d. of the old formulation and after the formulation switch, 200 mg b.i.d. of the
      new formulation) will be studied versus an active control (investigator selected PI). All

      patients will be enrolled in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Chile, Costa Rica, Russia,
      South-Africa, Spain, Thailand, UK, USA, Thailand, India and Malaysia. The duration of the
      study is 48 weeks with an optional extension for patients in the TMC125 treatment group until
      virologic failure or commercial availability of the drug. TMC125 at 800mg twice daily of the
      old formulation; after the formulation switch, TMC125 at 200mg twice daily of the new
      formulation. The initial duration is 48 weeks with an optional extension for patients in the
