      UC-MSC-derived MTF administered to two arms osteoarthritis patients with grade 2, 3, or 4
      radiographic OA severity (20 per arm). The first arm will receive an intra-articular
      injection of MTF into the knee joint under fluoroscopy. The second arm will receive 12
      subcutaneous MTF injections, once per week.

      For both arms, the primary objective of safety will be defined as freedom from treatment
      associated adverse events for the period of one year. The secondary objective of efficacy
      will include evaluation at baseline and at months 3 and 12 of efficacy endpoints of joint
      function improvement as assessed by Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
      Index (WOMAC).
