      the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA).Although MTX is very effective and well tolerated,
      the major drawback is the large interpatient variability in the clinical response.MTX is
      intracellularly converted by folylpolyglutamate synthetase (FPGS) to methotrexate
      polyglutamates (MTXPGs), which enhance the intracellular retention of MTX. Furthermore, the
      Î³-linked sequential addition of glutamic acid residues inhibits finals steps in the de novo
      purine and pyrimidine biosynthesis, resulting in anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory
      effects.76 adult, MTX-naive patients who fulfill the American College of Rheumatology
      criteria (ACR) for RA with a Disease Activity Score in 28 joints (DAS-28) > 3.2 are enrolled
      at two sites in Vienna (Austria).Clinical status is assessed by the number of joint counts
      and the Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ).Patients are randomly assigned to receive
      either a standard dose or a higher starting dose of 25 mg orally. In week 5, a subcutaneous
      dose of 25 mg is administered to each patient to get a reference level (bioavailability of
      100%).The patients participate for 16 weeks, in which blood samples are collected at weeks 1,
      2, 5, 6, 10 and 11 to perform pharmacokinetic analyses and metabolite measurements.The
      determination of erythrocyte MTXPG-levels is performed by using a HPLC technique.The primary
      outcome is the objective clinical response (measured in a rheumatic score, DAS-28), secondary
      outcome parameters are quality of life and routine laboratory parameters used in
      rheumatology. This clinical outcome will be correlated with MTX pharmacokinetics in blood,
      MTXPG kinetics in erythrocytes, and their impact on the folate pathway.
