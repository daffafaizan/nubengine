      enrolled. IIM is defined as Dermatomyositis (DM) or Polymyositis (PM), meeting the Bohan &
      Peter (1975) diagnostic criteria for definite or probable DM or PM. Patients will be randomly
      divided into 2 groups arranged by registration order. One million units of Recombinant Human
      Interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) was administered subcutaneously every other day for 3 months. All
      patients were followed up for 3 months after withdraw of IL-2.
