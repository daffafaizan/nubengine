      up to 35% of cancer survivors experience clinically-significant levels of distress.
      Psychosocial interventions may be effective for improving quality of life and reducing levels
      of mood disturbance in these patients. Unfortunately, barriers to accessing psychosocial
      intervention are common, and many are unable to access those services. Internet- based
      psychosocial interventions improve accessibility of care and offer additional methodological
      advantages, including the ability to easily collect self-report data, track exposure to the
      intervention, and evaluate effects of specific intervention components. The proposed study
      will evaluate whether a website developed specifically for providing psychological treatment
      and enhancing communication between cancer survivors can improve distress among cancer
      survivors who indicate that they have high levels of distress. If successful, the study will
      also provide valuable information needed to improve the treatment and to adequately conduct a
      larger trial comparing internet-based and face-to-face treatments.
