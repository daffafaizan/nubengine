      had a laparoscopic inspection only. The postoperative pain scores were significantly
      different favouring appendix removal (p < 0.01). Relative risk calculations indicated a 2.4
      fold (95% CI: 1.3 - 4.0) greater chance of improving or becoming pain free after laparoscopic
      appendectomy. The number needed to treat was 2.2 patients (95% CI: 1.5 - 6.5). There was no
      significant relation between postoperative pain scores and histopathology findings.

      Conclusions Chronic or recurrent appendicitis is a realistic clinical entity that can be
      treated successfully by elective appendectomy leading to significant pain reduction in
      properly selected cases. Histopathology of the removed appendix does not contribute to the
      diagnosis.
