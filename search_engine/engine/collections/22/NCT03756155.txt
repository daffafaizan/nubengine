      after every 10 participants eligible and completing the study, there will be 5 participants
      assigned to each group. Group 1 will complete a protocol with 10 sets of 10 second isometric
      holds followed by 10 second rest intervals between sets. Each repetition will be performed as
      closely to the targeted 30%-40% value. Group 2 will complete a protocol with 5 sets of 20
      second isometric holds followed by 20 second rest intervals between sets. Each repetition
      will be performed as closely to the targeted 30% value. Resistance for both testing
      conditions will be performed against the examiner's external resistance/against the Microfet
      hand held dynamometer. Immediately after the intervention, all participants will again repeat
      their maximal grip on their affected arm using the Jamar hand held dynamometer and will grade
      their pain level. (The protocol will be identical to the pre testing procedure from above).
      The pain score and force output will be obtained and documented. Once these steps are
      complete, testing will cease. All participants will be instructed to follow their referring
      provider's treatment intervention.
