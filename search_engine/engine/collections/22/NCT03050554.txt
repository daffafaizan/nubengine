      investigators will assess the safety and tolerability of SBRT combined with Avelumab. In
      Phase II, investigators will determine whether SBRT combined with Avelumab improves relapse
      free survival. Subjects with Stage I NSCLC who are not undergoing surgical resection will be
      candidates for enrollment. Subjects will receive definitive stereotactic body radiation
      (SBRT) in 4-5 fractions combined with concurrent and adjuvant Avelumab at 10mg/kg for a total
      of 6 cycles. Subjects will be evaluated for safety as measured by the occurrence of adverse
      events, serious adverse events, and laboratory abnormalities. Three blood draws will be
      obtained to analyze anti-tumor immune responses and immune correlates.
