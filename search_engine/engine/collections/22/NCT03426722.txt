      of patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) receiving treatment with imatinib.

      It affects the quality of life (QoL) of patients and could also be a factor that affects
      compliance with treatment. Some studies suggest that L-carnitine may improve muscle cramps
      associated with cirrhosis or hemodialysis. However, the efficacy of L-carnitine for muscle
      cramps occurring after imatinib treatment has yet to be reported. Thus, we aim to evaluate
      the efficacy of L-carnitine for the treatment of muscle cramps after imatinib in patients
      with GIST and apply in the future.
