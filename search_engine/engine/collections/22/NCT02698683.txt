      normal or malnourished according to anthropometric measures. As an additional evaluation of
      nutritional status, serum albumin and zinc were recovered on the 1st and 7th days of
      hospitalization. Lymphocyte count was also recorded on the 1st and 7th days. Investigators
      correlated nutritional status with lymphocyte count and zinc dosage.
