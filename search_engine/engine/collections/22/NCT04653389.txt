    
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) has an insidious onset, high degree of invasion, and rapid
      disease progression. Tumor cells can easily invade the intrahepatic vasculature, especially
      the portal vein or hepatic venous system, and form portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT) or
      hepatic vein tumor thrombus (HVTT).PVTT/HVTT is one of the main adverse factors for the
      long-term survival of HCC. The location and scope of its occurrence are closely related to
      the prognosis, and it is also a main hindrance to the improvement of the overall curative
      effect of HCC in recent years.

      As the treatment of HCC converts to multi-disciplinary therapy, the neoadjuvant therapy will
      be commonly used in the treatment of HCC with PVTT.Early clinical data already support a safe
      combination of immune checkpoint inhibition with TACE. Moreoverï¼ŒThe preliminary results of
      our previous trial (CISLD-5) showed that TACE combined with anti-programmed-death-1 antibody
      in patients with BCLC stage A/B HCC beyond Milan criteria has a significant effect.In
      addition, radiation therapy (RT) can irradiate both the tumor thrombus and the primary tumor
      .In numbers of retrospective studies, preoperative radiotherapy can achieve radical resection
      in some patients.

      This study is to analyze the safety and efficacy of preoperative TACE and anti-PD-1 Injection
      combined with or without preoperative radiotherapy of vein tumor thrombus and postoperative
      anti-PD-1 injection in the treatment of technically resectable hepatocellular carcinoma
      patients with vein thrombosis.
