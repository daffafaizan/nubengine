      (PROM) in PAH.The first two steps have been completed (qualitative study and Delphi consensus
      study) leading to the development of a provisional 37-items questionnaire. A reduction of
      items in this provisional questionnaire and the validation of the final questionnaire are the
      goals of the current study.
