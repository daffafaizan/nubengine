      metabolic control (i.e. poorer blood glucose, blood pressure, and lipid control), and greater
      risk for complications and death compared to White Americans. Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) is the
      primary marker for glycemic control and is a strong independent predictor of development of
      complications and increased mortality in T2DM. Key self-care behaviors that influence
      glycemic control (and HbA1c) include diet, physical activity, self-monitoring of blood
      glucose and medication adherence. Systematic review of multiple randomized clinical trials
      (RCTs) show that self-care interventions that include diabetes education and skills training
      are effective in improving metabolic control in diabetes. Recent findings indicate that
      patients with diabetes, especially ethnic minority patients, prefer telephone-delivered
      diabetes education to group visits or internet-based education. Multiple RCTs have documented
      the effectiveness of telephone-delivered self-care interventions in T2DM. Preliminary data
      from our group also suggest that a culturally-tailored telephone-delivered diabetes education
      and skills training intervention is an effective strategy to improve metabolic control in AA
      patients with T2DM.

      This study provides a unique opportunity to address gaps in the literature by testing the
      efficacy of a technology-intensified diabetes education/skills training (TIDES) intervention
      in AAs with poorly controlled T2DM. The long-term goal of the project is to identify
      effective strategies to improve metabolic control and hence reduce diabetes complications and
      mortality rates in AAs with T2DM.
