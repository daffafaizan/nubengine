      courses for people with rheumatic diseases. Before using the application participants will be
      asked to report their strengths in a written format. After using the mobile application to
      reflect on their strengths the participants will be interviewed about their experience of
      using the application and on the task of reflecting on their strengths. They will also be
      asked to fill out a questionnaire on perceived usefulness and user-friendliness. Before and
      after using the application the participants fill out questionnaires on emotions (Positive
      and Negative Affective Scale) and self-efficacy (The Arthritis Self-efficacy Scale). All
      interviews will be audio-taped and analyzed with a qualitative approach. Descriptive analysis
      will be applied for quantitative data.
