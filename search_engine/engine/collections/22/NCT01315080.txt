        1. patients with MF treated by percutaneous drainage and saline solution.

        2. patients with MF treated by percutaneous drainage and saline solution plus percutaneous
           triamcinolone.

      These patients are treated following usual clinical practice in our Department. All the
      procedures are made through an ultrasound-guided way. During the follow-up of these cases
      (clinical and with ultrasound) resolution rate will be registered by the same investigator.

      The follow-up will be at least 6 months.
