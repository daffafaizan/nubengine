      surgeons routinely use ureteral stents after the endourologic removal of stones to facilitate
      in urine passage and facilitate excretion of any left over stones. There is a multitude of
      literature that reveals that most patients find ureteral stents to be uncomfortable. This
      discomfort often causes pain severe enough that patients anxiously anticipate stent removal,
      and often request early stent removal, and/or require use of pain medications that have many
      side effects and cause further discomfort to these patients.
