      infections worldwide. Currently the condom is the only method available that has been shown
      to be effective against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). However, women
      who are at the greatest risk for acquiring HIV are often unable to negotiate condom use.
      Therefore, it is important that effective female-controlled barrier methods, such as topical
      microbicides, be made available to women. BufferGel has sufficient buffer capacity to acidify
      twice its own volume in human semen, which inactivates STD pathogens, including HIV. Unlike
      most other topical microbicides, BufferGel is non-detergent so it should not cause genital
      irritation and lesions. The safety and acceptability of BufferGel still need to be studied
      more carefully.

      Participants are divided into two cohorts. Cohort IA consists of sexually abstinent women and
      cohort IB consists of sexually active women. Within each U.S. cohort, participants are
      assigned to apply BufferGel either once or twice daily. Within each international cohort, all
      participants apply BufferGel twice daily. Participants apply BufferGel for 14 days. Pelvic
      examinations are performed at Days 7 and 14.
