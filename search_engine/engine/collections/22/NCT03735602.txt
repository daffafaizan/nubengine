      variety of clinical vision measures and functional visual tasks. However, the neural
      mechanisms underlying the astigmatism remains unknown. The current study recruited three
      groups (patients with with-the-rule astigmatism and amblyopia, patients with with-the-rule
      astigmatism but without amblyopia, normal controls) of subjects and patients receive
      perceptual learning training (orientation discrimination task) which lasts for around 15
      days. This main aim is to compare the contrast sensitivity function and neural response to
      gratings before and after the orientation discrimination task in the astigmatism or amblyopia
      patients.

      Patients with astigmatism or amblyopia were included in this study. All participants
      underwent an ophthalmic examination that included slit-lamp biomicroscopy, visual acuity,
      quick CSF under full optical correction, 9-SF life quality questionnaire and fundus
      examination.
