      confocal microscopy (FCM) imaging for avoidance of conduction abnormalities during repair of
      common congenital heart defects. Study results will be compared to a cohort of similar
      surgical patients following standard surgical procedures where FCM was not used. We will
      analyze pre-and postoperative ECGs to identify conduction abnormalities.
