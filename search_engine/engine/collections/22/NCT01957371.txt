      impairment, and a host of co-morbid physical and mental health conditions. Although several
      treatments are successful in treating Veterans with PTSD, many Veterans fail to complete
      these treatments and many others complete treatment without significant relief from symptoms.
      Yoga is one integrative treatment option that has shown promise for a number of physical and
      mental health conditions, including the treatment of depressive, and anxiety disorders in
      civilian samples, and chronic pain in Veterans. Yoga is widely offered in Veterans Affairs
      (VA) PTSD Treatment Programs, yet there is a lack of research on its efficacy for PTSD in
      Veterans.

      Mindful Yoga Therapy (MYT) is a 12-week treatment protocol incorporating meditation,
      breathing exercises, mindful movement practice, and guided rest (yoga nidra) that has been
      developed specifically for Veterans with PTSD. This pilot clinical trial will examine the
      efficacy of MYT with baseline, 12 week, and 24 week follow-up assessments that will include
      diagnostic, neurocognitive, and psychophysiological measures conducted by a research team
      member blinded to the study purpose.
