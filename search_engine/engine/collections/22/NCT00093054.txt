      juice or placebo juice twice a day for 6 months. Participants will have follow-up visits at 3
      and 6 months, and whenever they experience a symptomatic episode. Urine, vaginal and rectal
      specimens will be taken at each visit to test for the presence of bacteria that cause urinary
      tract infections. Participants will complete a questionnaire at study entry, Day 3, Weeks 1
      and 2, and monthly thereafter or whenever there is a recurrence of symptoms.
