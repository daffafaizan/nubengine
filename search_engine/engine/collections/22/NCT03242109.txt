      sampled in three major areas of Molise region, starting from the main cities (Campobasso,
      Termoli, Isernia) by cluster sampling, then, within each township, participants are selected
      by simple random sampling, using electronically generated numbers.Exclusion criteria are
      pregnancy at the time of recruitment, disturbances in understanding or willingness, current
      poly-traumas or coma, refusal to sign the Informed Consent form. All subjects identified are
      sent a letter inviting them to participate in the project, followed a few days later by a
      phone call. The recruitment started in the area of Campobasso, then it moved to the areas of
      Termoli.
