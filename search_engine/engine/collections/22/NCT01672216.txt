      140 patients with chronic obstipation. The study is divided into two trials. After three
      months the first trial is completed and can be extended directly into the second trial
      (completed after 12 months) after an interim analysis. Primary endpoints are changes from
      baseline to three and twelve months in the Altomare ODS Score.
