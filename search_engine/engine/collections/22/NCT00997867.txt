    
      Specific Aim: Research study to determine the relationships between perineural catheter
      insertion distance and subsequent continuous peripheral nerve block effects.

      Hypothesis: during ultrasound-guided perineural catheter placement, inserting the catheter
      0-1cm past the needle tip is associated with decreased postoperative pain compared with
      inserting the catheter 5-6cm past the needle tip.
