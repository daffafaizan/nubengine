    
      Rationale for Study Duration Predicting that strict BP control reduces the relative risk of
      recurrent stroke by 30% during the planned observation period of 3 years, the number of
      participants necessary to detect the recurrent stroke with rate of 2.5%/year and 7.5%/3 years
      is 2482 patients per group with a detection power of 90% and Î±-error of 0.05. A drop-out rate
      is estimated as 20%.

      Therefore, the study will be continued for 3 years until a total of 330 patients with
      recurrent stroke in both groups are identified.

      Rationale for Dosing Regimen One of ARB, losartan, is chosen for Step 1 therapy, because
      angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) is preferred as the first line of anti-hypertensives.
      Furthermore, a stepwise combination therapy of BP lowering drugs diuretic,
      hydrochlorothiazide, and calcium channel blocker, amlodipine, will be used, because the
      Japanese guidelines recommend the combination for BP control in prevention of recurrent
      stroke. (Step 2 to Step 5). Finally (as Step 6), a selective aldosterone antagonist,
      spironolactone, will be added for the treatment of with refractory hypertensive patients
      whose BP does not reach to the target.

      Treatment Plan The dosages of study drugs will be determined according to the package insert
      for the drug.

      Patients who are not treated with antihypertensive agent or treated with one antihypertensive
      agent at enrollment will start from Step 1. Patients who are treated with two
      antihypertensive agents at enrollment will start from Step 2.

      In principle, treatment duration will be for 4 weeks at each step.
