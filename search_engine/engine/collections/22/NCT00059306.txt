      paralysis, loss of sensation and speech, and other problems. A lacunar or small Subcortical
      stroke affects the inner part of the brain causing small "pea sized" areas of damage due to
      blockage of small blood vessels within the brain.

      This multi-center study will recruit 3000 participants (20 percent of whom will be Hispanic)
      to find out if using aspirin and clopidogrel is more effective than using aspirin alone to
      prevent recurrent stroke in patients with lacunar stroke confirmed by MRI, and if lowering a
      patient's blood pressure below the usual limits will also help prevent recurrent stroke and
      maintain thinking ability. Both aspirin and clopidogrel are widely-used for blood clotting
      and stroke prevention. Investigators intend to find out if using the drugs together is more
      effective than using aspirin alone.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of 2 types of treatment: either aspirin alone
      or the combination of aspirin and clopidogrel. In addition, participants will be assigned to
      one of 2 groups of blood pressure control. The difference between the two groups is the
      target level of systolic blood pressure-either 130-149 or below 130. The goal of the blood
      pressure aspect of this trial is to find out if lowering blood pressure after stroke helps to
      prevent recurrent stroke and preserves cognition.
