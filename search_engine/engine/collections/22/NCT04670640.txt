      traumatized people become highly distressed when attending to emotional stimuli, which can
      lead to feelings of detachment from their bodies and environment. It is difficult to engage
      highly dissociative traumatized patients in trauma-focused treatment; however, these patients
      benefit from acquiring basic emotion regulation skills, including present-centeredness and
      body awareness. Various practices that involve present-centeredness and body awareness
      (including mindfulness-based interventions) have been shown to demonstrate short-term and
      long-term improvement in cognition, emotion regulation and clinical symptoms in dissociative
      people with trauma exposure.

      In order to address this issue, the researchers will evaluate the effectiveness of
      interventions that engage present-centered awareness and/or body focus.
