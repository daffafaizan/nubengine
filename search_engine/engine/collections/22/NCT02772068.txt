      apparently normal systolic function, so called "heart failure with a preserved ejection
      fraction" or HFpEF. To date, no effective therapy for HFpEF has been found, in part because
      of failure to discern key pathophysiologic pathways.

      An extensive amount of pre-clinical work has identified that altered sarcoplasmic reticulum
      (SR) Ca2+ uptake, storage, and release play a major role in the changes in cardiac relaxation
      associated with aging, especially regarding sequestration of Ca++ by the sarcoplasmic
      reticular Ca++-ATPase (SERCA2a), which causes cardiac muscle relaxation by reducing cytosolic
      Ca++. Istaroxime is a relatively new drug that augments lusitropic function by upregulating
      SERCA2a activity in the heart.

      Because of the clear importance of slowed relaxation in HFpEF, and the evidence that
      depressed SERCA2a activity contributes to the slowed relaxation with aging, the proposed
      study may be establish the "impairment of SERCA2a" hypothesis as a mechanism of impaired
      relaxation in HFpEF subjects.
