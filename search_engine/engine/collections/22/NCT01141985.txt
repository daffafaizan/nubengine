    
      This will be a prospective, single center clinical trial of up to 300 consecutive eyes of
      subjects scheduled to undergo ocular surgery requiring an initial incision, specifically,
      cataract surgery. Subjects will be screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects will be
      examined preoperatively to establish a baseline for ocular condition.

      Subjects will undergo unilateral cataract surgery using the LenSx Laser for one or a
      combination of the following laser procedures: anterior capsulotomy, laser lens
      phacofragmentation and corneal incision with implantation of an intraocular lens (IOL).
      Surgeon and staff comments will be solicited for ergonomic and packaging features of the new
      disposable contact lens. Subjects will be evaluated intraoperatively to assess comfort of the
      new disposable contact lens, as well as the completion of anterior capsulotomy, laser lens
      phacofragmentation and completion of corneal incisions. All patients will be evaluated
      postoperatively at one day, one week and 1 month to follow the condition of the surgical eye.
      Further follow up can be performed at the discretion of the surgeon.
