      of sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), which is a condition where the inner ear is unable to
      convert sound into nerve impulses to the brain. This hearing loss and its detrimental effect
      on language development contribute nearly $4 billion annually to the health care costs in the
      U.S. Unlike other types of SNHL, CMV induced hearing loss can be treated. Several clinical
      trials have demonstrated that antiviral therapy may prevent progressive hearing loss if
      administered early in life for severely affected (symptomatic CMV) infants. These promising
      findings have given rise to a debate regarding the best method for identifying and treating
      the more numerous asymptomatic CMV-infected infants.

      One approach is to conduct universal newborn hearing screens, and then do CMV diagnostic
      testing only on the infants who fail the hearing screen. This targeted approach should
      identify those infants at greatest risk of developing progressive hearing loss and consequent
      communicative difficulties. Utah is the first state to mandate this approach whereby infants
      under three weeks of age who fail their newborn hearing screening undergo CMV testing. In
      this trial, the hearing screen targeted approach will be used to identify patients eligible
      for participation in a double blind placebo controlled randomized clinical trial of antiviral
      valganciclovir therapy. The results of this trial will inform public policy, potentially
      shift our current clinical practice regarding pediatric hearing loss evaluation, and
      potentially offer a therapeutic option to asymptomatic CMV-infected infants with SNHL.
