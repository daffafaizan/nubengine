      intraperitoneal surgical procedures with a minimal number of access points in the abdominal
      wall. At the present time these procedures are hybrids. It is expected a better cosmetic
      result and lower incidence in parietal complications in front of laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy, but is necessary to investigate that these benefits should not be associated
      with complications of the new access to abdominal cavity.

      Methods. Prospective randomized clinical series of 60 female patients with gallstones that
      underwent endoscopic surgery, 20 of them operated with conventional laparoscopic approach, 20
      by transumbilical endoscopic approach and 20 of them by transvaginal endoscopic approach.
      Variables as surgical wound infection, urinary tract infection, evisceration, hernia,
      mortality and other complications will be analyzed.
