      clinical and epidemiological data of cancer Patients affected by SAR- Covid-2 infection over
      a period of 1 year. Descriptive statistical approaches will be used to process the data.

      The aim is to evaluate the development rate of severe clinical forms of infection in patients
      with SARS-Cov-2 and the possible association with tumour characteristics and treatment.

      In addition, the results of serological tests can be compared with the outcome of the
      diagnostic swabs and the clinical evolution of the infection in order to obtain more
      information regarding the significance of specific antibody development.
