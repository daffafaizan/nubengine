      United States, most of who are adolescents and young adults. In addition to the
      well-recognized physical sequelae of this condition, several studies have linked severe acne
      to considerable social impairments and serious psychological conditions including suicidal
      ideation and major depression. Furthermore, severe acne has been recognized in some studies
      as a risk factor for breast cancer, suggesting that these conditions may have common causes.
      Little is known about the role of diet in the pathogenesis of acne. Recent analyses of the
      Nurses' Health Study II and the Growing-Up Today Study suggest that high intake of milk
      increases the risk of developing acne during adolescence. Despite the consistency of findings
      between these two studies, they cannot be regarded as conclusive and further research is
      needed in this area. Establishing the nature of the association between milk intake and acne
      can have broad clinical and public health implications. It could enhance the currently
      existing therapeutic options for the treatment of acne. More importantly, public health
      recommendations regarding milk and dairy intake could be designed in order to prevent its
      effects on the sebaceous glands and probably other hormone sensitive glands like the breast.

      To test the hypothesis that milk intake increases the risk of developing acne, we will
      compare the effect of minimizing milk and dairy intake against not making changes in the diet
      of subjects who usually consume at least 2 servings/day of milk and dairy products on the
      recurrence of acne lesions among patients previously treated with isotretinoin.
