      has been shown to reduce tumor size and permit better resection of HER-2 positive breast
      cancers. This study will evaluate the activity of a neoadjuvant treatment with docetaxel and
      trastuzumab given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by the combination of caelyx,
      cyclophosphamide and trastuzumab every 3 weeks for 4 cycles. Patients will undergo breast
      cancer surgery 2-5 weeks after the completion of neoadjuvant therapy. Adjuvant therapy after
      surgery will be given according to existing guidelines, and will include an additional 10
      cycles of trastuzumab.
