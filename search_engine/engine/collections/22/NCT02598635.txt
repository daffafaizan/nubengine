      levels. Vitamin D deficiency may be involved in generalized atherosclerosis, vascular
      calcification and cardiovascular mortality. Among others, Osteoprotegerin (OPG) has been
      implicated in the pathogenesis leading up vessel calcification in this patients. Furthermore,
      very low levels of 25-(OH) vitamin D in peritoneal dialysis patients are associated with
      increased levels of OPG and high values of vascular calcification scores in x-rays.

      It is unknown whether cholecalciferol supplementation in patients on peritoneal dialysis with
      low levels of 25-(OH) vitamin D could change the proteins associated with vascular
      calcification.

      The objective is to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study focusing on
      the impact of Cholecalciferol substitution in 25-OH vitamin D deficient peritoneal dialysis
      patients on circulating OPG and other osteogenic biomarkers levels during 16 weeks of
      intervention.

      Moreover, the impact of cholecalciferol on serum calcium and phosphorus levels, Kidney
      Disease Quality of Life Short Form, and ultrasound characteristics of carotid arterial will
      be performed during the first four weeks after inclusion, and after 28 weeks
      postintervention.

      Peritoneal dialysis patients found to have 25-(OH) vitamin D levels <20 ng/ml will be
      included and will be randomized to receive either oral cholecalciferol therapy or placebo.
      Cholecalciferol will be administered at a daily dose of 4800 IU over a time period of 16
      weeks.

      All in all, 58 subjects will be included in this study.
