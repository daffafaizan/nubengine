      radiofrequency ablation in chronic knee osteoarthritis.

      Osteoarthritis of knee joint is one of the most common disease conditions with advanced age
      and leads to considerable morbidity in terms of pain, stiffness, limitation in functions,
      disturbance in sleep and psychological disturbance

      A diagnostic genicular nerve block (GNB) with local anesthetic is performed before RF
      genicular ablation, and a successful response to GNB is considered to indicate the need for
      RF genicular ablation
