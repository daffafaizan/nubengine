      Criteria (RDoC) sleep parameters: Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), sleep onset latency, and
      wake after sleep onset in an insomnia cohort including those at elevated risk for depression
      (e.g. low SES, minority). This will be tested by administering internet-based dCBT-I to
      people with insomnia and adding face-to-face CBT-I in non-remitters, as well as comparing the
      RDoC sleep outcomes to an attention control group post-treatment and at 1- and 2-year
      follow-ups. This study will also determine the acute and long-term effectiveness of
      face-to-face CBT-I in non-responders to dCBT-I on RDoC sleep outcomes relative to a
      comparison group post-treatment and at 1- and 2-year follow-ups.

      This study will also determine the effects of dCBT-I and CBT-I using a stepped-care model for
      prevention of major depressive disorder incidence and relapse across 2 years. Specifically,
      rate of depression of both dCBT-I and CBT-I will be compared to a control group.

      This study will also evaluate changes in rumination as a modifiable behavior (post-treatment)
      that mediates the effect of insomnia treatment on depression risk.
