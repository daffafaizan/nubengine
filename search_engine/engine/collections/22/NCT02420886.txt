      suppose that adding the Cytokines (LIF 5ng/ml, HB-EGF 5ng/ml and GM-CSF 2ng/ml) as a growth
      factor that have multi-ways to might improve embryo development in vitro so we decide to
      design a trial to compare the embryogenesis by sibling Oocytes of the same patient between
      two arm of the same culture media and the same culture condition. One arm with Cytokines and
      the other is traditional one and closely monitor the outcome within the 2 arms and record the
      results.
