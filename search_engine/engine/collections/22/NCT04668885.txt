      induction chemotherapy and fail HMA +/- combination, have very poor outcomes and there is no
      FDA-approved therapy outside of some targeted therapies which can only be applied to a small
      patient population. CPX-351 is an investigational (experimental) drug that works by combining
      two anti-cancer drugs cytarabine and daunorubicin. CPX-351 is experimental because it is only
      FDA approved for the treatment of adults with two types of AML: newly diagnosed
      therapy-related AML or AML with myelodysplasia-related changes.

      This is an open label clinical trial of lower doses of CPX-351 in relapsed/primary refractory
      older AML and MDS patients ineligible to receive intensive chemotherapy. The first arm is for
      particpants with primary refractory/relapsed AML and the second arm is for higher risk MDS
      participants after HMA failure.
