      neck pain, headache in RA patients is not measured yet, so we aimed at assessing the the
      effectiveness of 3rd occipital nerve blocks in headache management in RA patients who used
      other medical agents and to compare the results with those of the patients who used only 3rd
      occipital nerve pulsed radiofrequancy on clinical and radiographic bases.
