    
      This is an open-label Pilot Study to determine the efficacy of Tasigna® in adults with
      neurofibromatosis (NF1) and plexiform neurofibromas with the secondary goals of determining
      the toxicity, and tumor markers in this genetically defined population. The rationale for
      this study arises from the response of human and murine NF1 cells to Tasigna® in vitro and
      the clinical response in NF1 patients with plexiform neurofibromas using the similar drug,
      Gleevec®. Following enrollment each subject will initially receive Tasigna orally at 200 mg
      twice daily for two weeks. If tolerated, the dose will be increased to 300 mg twice daily
      after a minimum of two weeks and will be increase to a maximum dose of 400mg twice daily
      after an additional two weeks if tolerated. Subjects will have his/her dose increased as
      tolerated dose during the first three months of therapy. The maximum targeted dose is 400mg
      twice daily.
