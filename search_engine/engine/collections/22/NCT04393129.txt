      was selected from a clinic specialised in ACL reconstruction and rehabilitation based in
      Athens, Greece. Patients of the specific clinic had received the same surgical technique and
      rehabilitation protocol. Ability to return to sport was examined 9 months after surgery and
      approval was given according to the rehabilitation progress. A list of eligible study
      subjects was formed and, after inclusion and exclusion criteria were screened for, they were
      invited to participate in the study. Study participants, after having declared consent and
      passed the criteria were asked to answer the study questionnaires. Communication with
      participants was done through telephone and email, and all questionnaires were completed
      online.
