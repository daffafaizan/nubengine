    
      This study is a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of melatonin in outpatient adult patients suspected to be afflicted
      with COVID-19. Participants will be enrolled as outpatients within 72 hrs of onset of
      COVID-19 symptoms. The study will evaluate the safety of the intervention through 28 days of
      follow-up as compared to the control arm as assessed by cumulative incidence of serious
      adverse events (SAEs), cumulative incidence of Grade 3 and 4 adverse events (AEs), and/or
      discontinuation or temporary suspension of the investigational medication (for any reason).
      Additionally, the study will aim to evaluate the clinical efficacy of melatonin as compared
      to placebo as assessed by hospitalization, COVID-19 related symptoms and mortality. The
      ultimate goal is to determine in an adequately powered study if the anti-inflammatory and
      antioxidant actions of Melatonin can reduce the severity and prevent progression of COVID-19
      when started in mild disease.
