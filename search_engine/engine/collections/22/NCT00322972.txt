      target of community-wide mass antibiotic treatment to eliminate trachoma. We will also study
      the impact of community-wide antibiotic distribution on antibiotic-resistance in
      pneumococcus. Communities in Goncha Siso Enese district of East Gojam Zone, Ethiopia will be
      randomly assigned to different treatment schemes and monitored to study the following
      research questions:

      Specific Aim 1. To determine whether biannual mass treatments is more likely to eliminate
      ocular chlamydia from hyper-endemic communities than annual mass treatments.

      Specific Aim 2. To determine whether children form a core group for the transmission of
      trachoma.

      Specific Aim 3. To determine whether latrine construction prevents the return of infection
      into a community after mass treatment.

      Specific Aim 4. To determine the effect of mass azithromycin treatments on antibiotic
      resistance in pneumococcus and the reduction in mortality.

      Specific Aim 5. To determine whether annual mass treatments are more likely to eliminate
      ocular chlamydia from hyper-endemic communities than biennial mass treatments.
