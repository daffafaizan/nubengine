      expression markers, for example pentraxin 3 [PTX-3], serum/glucocorticoid regulated kinase 1
      [SGK1], and glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta [GSK3b]) to be developed as a biomarker for use
      in diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome, assessment of effectiveness of medical or surgical
      treatment, and detection of relapse of endogenous Cushing's syndrome after surgery.

      The primary study hypothesis is that FKBP5 levels are elevated in patients with Cushing's
      syndrome, and these levels decrease after successful surgical treatment.

      This is a non-randomized specimen collection study with pre- and post-surgery follow-up
      periods. This study will be performed in patients with adrenocorticotropic hormone
      (ACTH)-dependent Cushing's syndrome scheduled for curative surgery and followed until relapse
      of endogenous Cushing's syndrome or up to 3 years post-surgery. No study medication will be
      given.
