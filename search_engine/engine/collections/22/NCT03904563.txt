      maintenance therapy after concurrent chemoradiotherapy in locally advanced lung
      adenocarcinoma.

      All patients received 4 cycles of weekly docetaxel (25mg/㎡) and nedaplatin (25mg/㎡)(DP), each
      of 1 day's duration, combined with split-course thoracic radiotherapy, with one-month
      break.Bevacizumab maintenance therapy starts 1-2 months later after the chemotherapy.The
      recommended dose for intravenous infusion is 15mg/kg body weight, and the drug is given every
      3 weeks for 6 courses. Toxicities will be graded according to National Cancer Institute
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v. 4.0.
