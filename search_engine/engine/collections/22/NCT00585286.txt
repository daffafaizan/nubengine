      4 will receive up to 3 treatments with an FDA IDE and Institutional Review Board approved
      10,600nm fractional carbon dioxide laser system. Improvement of acne scarring is evaluated at
      1 month and 3 months post-treatment.

      Post-treatment responses evaluated are immediate erythema, immediate edema, and any other
      immediate responses. Evaluations are conducted immediate post treatment and one week
      post-treatment. Key safety data include the severity scoring of post-treatment responses, as
      well as by photodocumentation.

      The incidence of side effects such as scarring, pigmentary changes, etc. are evaluated at
      follow-up visits one and three months post-treatment. Key safety data include the incidence
      rates and severity scoring of side effects, as well as by photodocumentation
