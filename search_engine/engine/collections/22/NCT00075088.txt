      groups: Group 1: Patients will have pre-hospital ECG intervention. Group 2: Patients will
      have routine emergency heart care. Information will be collected about time symptoms started,
      clinical management, and other measures. All patients will be contacted by telephone 12
      months later and interviewed as to whether they experienced any cardiac symptoms.
