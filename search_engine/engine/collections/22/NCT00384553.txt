      cisplatin followed by high dose chemotherapy with treosulfan, etoposide and cisplatin (TEC)
      an autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(aPBSCT). In case of only partial
      remission a second identical high dose chemotherapy and aPBSCT follows. Patients with primary
      refractory disease or early relapse within 6 months should receive a allogenous stem cell
      transplantation. For Patients with CD 20 positive B-cell lymphoma the chemotherapy regiments
      DHAP and TEC are combined with rituximab.
