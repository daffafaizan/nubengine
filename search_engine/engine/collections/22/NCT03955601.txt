      million in western countries. Data from Asian studies show a 3-4 fold higher
      incidence.Majority of newly diagnosed aplastic anemia patients are younger and in Armed
      forces bone marrow transplant cohort of 1324 patients 64 % patient are younger than 24 years
      of age and 87% patients younger than 40 years (unpublished data).There is no donor registry
      in Pakistan and patients lacking sibling match donor cannot proceed to stem cell transplant
      due lack of matched unrelated donors. Horse antithymocyte globulin is not available currently
      in Pakistan and response to Rabbit antithymocyte globulin is dismal as shown in number of
      international studies. So haploidentical stem cell transplant remains only curative option
      for patients lacking Matched sibling donor. Currently there are 2 major platforms used for
      haplo-identical stem cell transplant. Post transplant cyclophosphamide based using TBI and
      haplo regimen of Peking university. TBI is not available for most of our patients in Pakistan
      due to cost,non-availability and lack of expertise. The investigators have formulated a novel
      TBI free regimen incorporating Busulphan, antithymocyte globulin and using co-primed bone
      marrow and peripheral blood harvest to minimize graft-versus-host disease and facilitate
      engraftment. Post transplant cyclophosphamide, Cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil will be
      used for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis
