      study will be conducted in 3 parts, a single ascending-dose (SAD) phase in normal healthy
      volunteers (Group A), a single-dose (SD) phase in patients with CHB (Group B), and a multiple
      ascending-dose (MAD) phase in patients with CHB (Group 1c-3c). Cohort 4c is a single
      ascending dose with a possible duration of up to 48 weeks. Cohort 5c is a multiple dose
      cohort with a possible duration of up to 72 weeks.
