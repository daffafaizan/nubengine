      who have been registered for the DETECT-OCT study To assess the patient's status at 5- and
      10-year, follow-up visits are scheduled at the outpatient visit if they are currently
      followed-up at the registry. However, if there is no follow-up observation at the current
      registrar, we will follow-up the telephone survey and visit as much as possible. Patients who
      have already passed the 5-year follow-up period from January 2, 2013, the first time to
      register, will be followed up by medical records to confirm the progress. To track the
      progress to the 10-year follow-up, we will conduct prospective observations by telephone
      survey.
