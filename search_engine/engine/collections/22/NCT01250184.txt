      in Medellin. The subjects are patients with myofascial trigger points (MTP) in muscles of the
      shoulder girdle (levator scapulae, trapezius, infraspinatus) diagnosed by neck ans shoulder
      pain lasting langer than 6 weeks, and that have not received rehabilitation treatment and are
      not currently taking analgesic medications. We have calculated a sample of 45 patients in
      each group.

      The physical and rehabilitation doctors who evaluated the patients and the nurse who assessed
      the patients were blinded to treatment allocation. Physicians who performed the MTP injection
      did not participate in the evaluation of primary and secondary outcomes. Physical therapists
      who conducted the therapeutic exercise program did not participate in the evaluation of
      primary and secondary outcomes.
