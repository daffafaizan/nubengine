    
      All students (around 300) between 16 and 18 years of age from one Gymnasium, receives a
      questionnaire. They are asked to answer whether they have had pain in the anterior part of
      their knee within the last month. If so they are invited to participate in a scientific
      study. An equivalent group with no pain are invited to participate as a control group.

      In both groups navicular drop and drift will be measured together with the dorsal flexion.
      The investigations are made single-blinded as the investigators do not know if the "patient"
      has pain or not.
