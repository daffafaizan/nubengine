      I. To develop a multimodality statistical model to act as a surrogate marker scheme of early
      changes in high grade glioma patients undergoing radiation therapy, using conventional MRI,
      MR diffusion tensor imaging, perfusion, permeability, and spectroscopic imaging while
      incorporating the radiation dose calculations delivered locally and the results of a clinical
      questionnaire into the model.

      II. To assess treatment response to tumor and normal tissue changes. OUTLINE: Patients
      undergo multimodality MRI imaging at baseline, weeks 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6, and then 4-6 weeks
      after completion of radiation therapy.
