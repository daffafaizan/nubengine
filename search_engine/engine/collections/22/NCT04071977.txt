      supply to its endothelial cells in states of constant hyperglycemia. This entity is
      classified in two main categories: non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and proliferative
      diabetic retinopathy, the latter is characterized for the presence of neovascularization as
      oppose to the first one.

      Oxidative stress has been considered as one of the main factors in the development of
      diabetic retinopathy. It is a result from an imbalance between oxidants production and
      cellular antioxidant defenses, which provokes DNA damage.

      The treatment of diabetic retinopathy simply includes glycemic, lipemic and blood pressure
      control. Only when the view is compromised is when a vitrectomy is performed, which usually
      occurs in the more advanced stages such as the proliferative stage. Antioxidant therapy has
      been used as a coadjuvant for these interventions, complementing the action and efficacy of
      the treatment established for diabetic retinopathy in the early stages. However, in order to
      obtain vitreous and aqueous humor, the vitrectomy procedure is required, which is only
      carried out in the proliferative stage.

      Diabetic retinopathy is a specific and chronic complication of diabetes mellitus and is known
      to have a prevalence of 43.6% internationally and 31.5% in the Mexican population. It
      represents the main cause of visual blindness and weakness in the economically active
      population, which also affects the quality of life and the productivity of the people who
      suffer it.

      The researchers intend to evaluate whether antioxidant therapy influences the levels of
      oxidative stress markers at the ocular level.
