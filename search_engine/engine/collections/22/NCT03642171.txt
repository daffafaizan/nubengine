      not yet available. Here we describe a long term Post Market Surveillance Study involving
      women who will received UT 380® device as a contraceptive method. Reports of case series
      usually contain detailed information about the individual patients. This includes demographic
      information (e.g. age and gender) and information on diagnosis, treatment, response to
      treatment, follow-up after treatment and patients experience of the treatment. In addition,
      it also include the health care staff's experience of the use of the UT 380. The result of
      this study will be used for different purposes e.g. marketing activities such as posters,
      folders, or targeted journals and/or conferences.
