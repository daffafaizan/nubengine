    
      A prior ten-year prospective, observational, study was initially approved in March of 2008 by
      the IRB board through the Atrium Medical Center, Premier Health Partners in Middletown, Ohio
      45005 and registered through the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP). Expedited
      approval continued annually through 2013 at which time the IRB board was closed. All
      participants signed a study consent and HIPPA consent. Recruitment closed in 2013. The
      original protocol was designed to investigate the incidence of breast cancer in women
      presenting with symptoms of hormone deficiency treated with subcutaneous testosterone
      implants or, testosterone combined with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole implants. A
      computer program was specifically designed to track and follow patients prospectively and all
      patients continued to be followed through 2018.
