      visits in preventing stillbirths and mortality through 6-12 months of age in Mali, West
      Africa, where rates of infant and under five mortality are among the highest in the world.
      Using an individually randomized placebo-controlled double-masked trial design, pregnant
      women will receive a single dose of oral azithromycin or placebo at their second and/or third
      trimester antenatal care visits and during labor, and to infants at their DPT-1 and DPT-3
      vaccination visits, which occur at approximately 6 and 14 weeks of age, respectively. The two
      co-primary outcomes are (1A) a composite outcome of stillbirths and mortality through 6-12
      months of age and (1B) mortality between 6 weeks and 6-12 months of age. The study sample
      size is powered to detect a 20% relative reduction in both of the two co-primary outcomes.
      The study is designed to inform policymakers regarding the effectiveness of azithromycin for
      the prevention of stillbirth and infant mortality in both urban and rural parts of the
      country when administered during routine antenatal and intrapartum care and infant
      immunization visits. To achieve this aim, three cohorts will be enrolled: a mother-infant
      cohort in a rural part of the country with infant mortality rates that are higher than the
      national average, a supplemental infant-only cohort enrolled form the same rural communities,
      and third urban mother-infant cohort residing in Bamako, Mali's capital. Sub studies designed
      to elucidate the protective mechanisms of azithromycin treatment will be embedded within the
      larger study and will be added in the future.
