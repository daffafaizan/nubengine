      with left ventricular hypertrophy and other adverse cardiac consequences. Fluid management is
      therefore an important aspect in the management of dialysis patient. In Hong Kong, PD
      patients with common medical problems related to dialysis are assessed and managed in the
      renal nurse clinic by pre-approved intervention protocols. Although it is the general
      impression that management of PD patients with fluid overload by a nurse-lead intervention
      protocol is robust and could reduce the work load of medical staff, the efficacy of this
      approach remains undetermined. The objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness
      of treating PD patients with fluid overload by a structured nurse-lead intervention protocol.
      We plan to recruit 100 PD patients with fluid overload, which is defined as overhydration
      (OH) â‰¥ 2 litres as measured by bioimpedance spectroscopy. These patients will be assessed and
      managed by a renal nurse specialist in the ambulatory renal center according to a
      standardized protocol previously approved by the Hospital Authority. The improvement in the
      degree of overhydration will be determined by bioimpedance spectroscopy 4 and 12 weeks after
      treatment. Change in body weight, blood pressure, degree of oedema, as well as the knowledge
      on salt and fluid restriction will also be assessed.
