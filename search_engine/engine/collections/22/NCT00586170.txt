        1. That treatment of 5th metatarsal non-union fracture with PEMF will achieve earlier
           resolution and/or higher success compared to surgery alone of 5th metatarsal non-union
           fractures.

        2. PEMF will stimulate increased expression of critical growth factors (i.e. BMP-2, BMP-4,
           BMP-7 as well as TGFb, IGF-1, FGF-2 and VEGF) at the non-union site to facilitate
           osseous healing of 5th metatarsal non-union fractures.
