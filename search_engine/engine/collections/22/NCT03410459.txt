      comorbidities. Still, there are questions as to the frequency of long-term adverse effects:
      data on alterations in bone health are missing,

      The goal of this trial is to examine long-term effects of laparoscopic gastric bypass (LRYGB)
      and sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) on bone mineral density, fracture risk, and body composition â‰¥ 5
      years post-surgery.
