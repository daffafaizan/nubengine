      bipolar disorder (BD) in an outpatient mental health clinic serving youth with bipolar
      spectrum disorders. In collaboration with the University of Pittsburgh, this study will
      systemically operationalize, implement, and examine the specific training, supervision, and
      programmatic systems needed to successfully implement and sustain the intervention in an
      adherent manner to achieve positive patient outcomes. This study therefore presents a unique
      opportunity to enhance understanding of the necessary procedures for implementing the
      treatment in the community, while allowing us to examine effectiveness of the intervention at
      the community level.

      Aim 1: To examine the short- and longer-term feasibility and acceptability of a training
      program in DBT for adolescents with BD through clinician satisfaction ratings.

      Aim 2: To examine the short- and longer-term effects of the training on practitioner
      knowledge and performance, and patient outcomes.
