      necessary skills and information are more likely to follow through with recommended care and
      have better health outcomes at reduced costs. Identification of individuals at increased risk
      of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) is crucial for cancer survivors and their
      families to benefit from biomedical advances in cancer prevention, early detection, treatment
      and survivorship. The primary purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility and
      acceptability of two remote interventions aimed at promoting cancer genetic risk assessment
      (CGRA) for HBOC. The randomized controlled trial will have 3 arms: usual care (UC) vs.
      targeted generic print (TP) vs. tailored telephone counseling and navigation intervention
      (TCN).
