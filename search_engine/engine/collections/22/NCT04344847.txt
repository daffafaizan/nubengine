      cases reported in the literature.

      GISTs could be safely removed laparoscopically during LSG surgery with negative microscopic
      resection margins, with 1-2cm safety margin. Margins less than 1cm, high mitotic rate are
      adverse prognostic factors.

      Examining the whole stomach before resection is mandatory and can easily be done during LSG,
      GIST can be removed safely with LSG
