      pancreas that release too much insulin. Some children with CHI have these cells throughout
      their pancreas (called diffuse disease); others have them located in specific areas of the
      pancreas (called focal disease). Children who have focal disease located in specific areas of
      the pancreas may be cured with surgery. F-DOPA is a radioactive drug that is picked up by
      these cells and used for positron emission tomography (or PET), an imaging technique used in
      nuclear medicine departments. In this study, researchers will validate the efficacy and
      safety of using PET/CT with F-DOPA in the pre-operative localization of focal disease in
      children with hyperinsulinism.
