      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES I. Determine which of 3 ALA (aminolevulinic acid) doses (10, 20 or 30
      mg/kg) provide optimal discrimination between normal and malignant tissue intraoperatively.

      II. Determine whether or not the use of ALA (compared to comparable cases performed without
      the aid of ALA) leads to a higher rate of gross total resection, as determined by
      postoperative MRI scanning within 48 hour of surgery completion.

      III. Compare time-to-progression and survival to that in comparable cases performed without
      the aid of ALA.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study

      Patients receive aminolevulinic acid orally (PO) 4 hours before undergoing surgery. After
      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at week 5 and then every 8-12 weeks
      for 27 months.
