      safety following oral administration of encapsulated tyramine prior to treatment with
      double-blind (DB) study drug (CX157 Modified Release Tablets, 125 mg administered twice per
      day (BID) or matching placebo administered BID) and the administration of tyramine in yogurt
      along with a standard meal during the DB study treatment administration, after CX157 reached
      steady state.

      Prior to treatment with DB study treatment, baseline cardiovascular sensitivity to oral
      tyramine administered in a fasting state was established in 15 subjects during Period 1 Days
      1-3. Following completion of Period 1, the study's 12 subjects were randomized to CX157 (10
      subjects) or placebo (2 subjects) and treated for six consecutive days (Days 4-9) to reach
      steady state. Subjects continued their DB study treatment in Period 3 (Days 10-12); however,
      during this period tyramine was administered to subjects in the fed state on Day 10 (tyramine
      20 mg), Day 11 (tyramine 40 mg) and Day 12 (tyramine 80 mg).

      The tyramine pressor dose (minimum dose of tyramine necessary to achieve endpoint) for Period
      1 was established through a series of three tyramine challenges (24 hours apart) with
      tyramine doses based upon a predetermined paradigm. During Period 1, untreated fasting
      subjects received an initial tyramine challenge dose of 400 mg and were monitored for SBP
      endpoint changes (SBP increase of â‰¥30 mmHg on three consecutive occasions at least five
      minutes apart over a 10-minute (i.e., TYR303). If pressor endpoint was achieved, the tyramine
      challenge dose administered on Period 1 Day 2 was reduced to 200 mg. However, if endpoint was
      not achieved, the tyramine challenge dose was raised on Period 1 Day 2 to 600 mg. This dose
      escalation/reduction paradigm was repeated on Period 1 Day 3 based upon the results of Period
      1 Day 2 in order to establish the tyramine pressor dose during that period.

      During Period 2 (Days 4-9) subjects were treated with CX157 or placebo twice daily to reach
      the steady state. On Day 8 of Period 2, single-blind yogurt without tyramine was administered
      with lunch to familiarize subjects and the clinic staff with the procedures for Period 3.

      The tyramine challenges for Period 3 Days 10 - 12 began after six consecutive days of
      treatment with CX157 or placebo twice daily. The tyramine doses for Period 3 were 20, 40, and
      80 mg (24 hours apart). The endpoint for Period 3 was the same as described above for Period
      1, reaching of the pressor endpoint (i.e., TYR303).

      The study planned for 12 healthy male volunteer subjects to be randomized at Period 2. Ten
      (10) subjects were to be randomized to CX157 MR Tablets, 125 mg and 2 to matching placebo.
      Approximately 15 subjects were to enter Period 1 in order to ensure randomization of 12
      subjects to Period 2 of the study.
