      following the use of high flow nasal humidified oxygen? Participants will be from 2 sub
      groups:

        1. Patients already undergoing TOE (as this is the most common and consistent group who
           have optiflow- about 4-5 patients per week)

        2. Volunteers (staff) who would agree to experience the optiflow whilst awake for the same
           period as those undergoing TOE

      The study will involve a 7 day follow up survey to see if they had experienced complications
      (runny nose, nasal discomfort, sore throat, epistaxis), what their severity was and how long
      they lasted for.
