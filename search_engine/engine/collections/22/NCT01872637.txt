      those who are not hospitalized. No studies have examined the effectiveness of Home Health
      (HH) physical therapy on improving function in older adults with multiple co-morbidities
      after hospitalization. Our goal is to enable older adults with multiple chronic conditions to
      recover function by providing adequate content and dose of intervention after
      hospitalization. This intervention is designed to work within the existing Medicare system
      and has potential for immediate clinical impact.

      Purpose: The primary aim of our study is to determine if a progressive multi-component (PMC)
      intervention, initiated upon discharge from an acute care hospital, improves gait speed at
      the end of one 60-day episode of care, more than documented usual care (UC) physical therapy.
      We hypothesize that there will be a greater improvement in gait speed measured for the PMC
      group compared to the UC group following one episode of care. Benefits of PMC will be
      apparent at the end of usual care and will increase further at the end of the 60 day episode
      of care (primary endpoint).

      Design: We propose to conduct a single blind randomized two arm clinical trial (RCT) in older
      adults discharged from acute care and referred to HH physical therapy. Both interventions
      (PMC & UC) will be Medicare-reimbursed. All assessments and interventions will occur in the
      patients' homes.

      Methods: Twenty individuals who are 65 years of age or older with multiple co-morbid
      conditions will be enrolled.
