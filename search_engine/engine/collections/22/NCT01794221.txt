      decreased the incidence of recurrent adhesions after circumcision. The investigators
      hypothesize that the incidence of recurrent adhesions will be decreased with use of 2-octyl
      cyanoacrylate skin adhesive.

      Secondary Objective(s) To assess parent satisfaction and comfort level after circumcision
      with use of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate skin adhesive and compare to those undergoing circumcision
      without the use of 2-octyl cyanoacrylate skin adhesive.
