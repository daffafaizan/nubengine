      schizophrenic patients. Second generation antipsychotics were the choices for these patients.
      But which one of second generation antipsychotic was the better choice did not have
      definitive results. We compared risperidone and olanzapine in schizophrenic patients with
      neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia to see their effects in improving tardive dyskinesia.
      We also collected the data of average dose of risperidone and olanzapine to help the dosing
      strategy guidelines for the schizophrenic patients with neuroleptic-induced tardive
      dyskinesia.

      Method: This randomized, rater-blind, parallel group, flexible dose study enrolled patients
      from Taoyuan Mental Hospital from July 2000 to December 2003. Schizophrenia, schizophreniform
      or schizoaffective disorder (DSM-IV) patients who met the research criteria of
      neuroleptic-induced tardive dyskinesia research criteria of DSM-IV and no less than moderate
      severity (> or =4) of global impression of extrapyramidal syndrome rating scale (ESRS). 60
      patients were random assignment to risperidone or olanzapine for 24 weeks. The primary
      outcome was to compare the change of total scores of abnormal involuntary movement scale from
      baseline to study endpoint.
