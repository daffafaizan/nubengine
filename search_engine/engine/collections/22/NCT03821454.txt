      cancer of stage I - IIIC and pathologically assessed residual cancer cells (no pathological
      complete response, non-pCR) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy with anthracycline, taxane, or
      both. Participants who have residual components of ductal carcinoma in situ are assessed as
      having a pathological complete response. Participants with tumor-positive lymph nodes
      excluded.

      Other key eligibility criteria are low- hormone receptor (HR)positive, including low-ER and
      low-PR, low-ER and PR-negative, low-PR and ER-negative. The definition of low hormone
      receptor (HR) positive is nuclear staining of 1%-10% of the epithelial component of the
      tumor.

      Eligible participants are centrally enrolled after pathological assessment and are randomly
      assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either capecitabine plus standard therapy or standard
      therapy alone (control).

      The trial treatments are standard postsurgical treatments, which included endocrine therapy
      in participants with estrogen-receptor-positive (nuclear staining â‰¥ 1%) disease, targeted
      therapy in participants with HER-2 overexpression and radiotherapy (if indicated), with or
      without capecitabine.

      After surgery, the capecitabine group receive oral capecitabine (at a dose of 1250 mg per
      square meter of body-surface area, twice per day, on days 1 to 14) every 3 weeks for eight
      cycles. The concomitant administration of postsurgical endocrine therapy is allowed.
      Postsurgical radiotherapy could be given before or after randomization and could be
      concomitant with postsurgical endocrine therapy.
