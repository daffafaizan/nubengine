      units (ICUs) for the microbiological diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).
      However, the importance of selecting a specific lung segment for sampling is still a matter
      of debate.

      Non-bronchoscopic blind mini-bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is currently used for the diagnosis
      of VAP with satisfactory sensitivity and specificity. In the presence of pneumonia,
      microbiologic concordance between the left and right lungs becomes crucial. If concordance is
      low, the reliability of blind sampling becomes questionable.

      When the bacterial distribution in the right and left lungs of VAP patients has been
      investigated using bronchoscopic sampling techniques, rates of microbiological concordance
      between the two specimens have varied widely (from 53% to 92%). The factors potentially
      associated with concordant culture yields have never been explored, and it is unclear whether
      the use of guided, bilateral lung sampling would actually improve the appropriateness of the
      antibiotic regimens prescribed for patients with suspected VAP.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the frequency of microbiologic concordance
      between the right- and left-lung samples in ICU patients undergoing bronchoscopic BAL
      performed with two different fiberoptic bronchoscopes for the suspicion of VAP. Secondary
      objectives are to identify factors associated with such concordance and to evaluate the
      suitability of treatments prescribed based on unilateral vs. bilateral BAL cultures.
