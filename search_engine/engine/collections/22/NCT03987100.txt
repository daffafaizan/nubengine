    
      -  Administration of the antibiotic according to the usual procedures for prescribing
           services: in particular, neither the indications nor the doses nor the methods of
           administration are fixed by the protocol

        -  Opportunistic sampling strategy: no biological samples are specifically collected for
           the purposes of the study (measurements of concentrations on "bottoms" or "left-over"
           samples); the performance of this non-invasive sampling strategy has been previously
           demonstrated in the neonatal population.

        -  Micro-analytical method (assay of concentrations on micro-volumes, of the order of 50Î¼L)

        -  Population pharmacokinetic analysis
