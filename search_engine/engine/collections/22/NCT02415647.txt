      contributing to diagnostic systems as informed by research on genetics, neuroscience, and
      behavior. The RDoC approach is based on identifying the most elemental units of analysis
      relevant to psychiatric disorders (such as genes and molecules) and using this matrix as a
      framework for investigation. In this case-control family study, the investigators will be
      using self-report questionnaires and computer-based tests to develop diagnostic methods for
      neuropsychiatric disorders in children, their siblings, and their parents. They will do this
      by recruiting "normal" and "affected" children, their siblings, and their parents. They will
      look at the subject, sibling, and parents to determine if psychiatric disorders are
      inherited. "Affected" children, ages 6-12, are those who have been diagnosed with a
      psychiatric disorder. Participants will undergo a battery of questionnaires/evaluations and a
      blood draw. The investigators will determine if the questionnaires and tests that reflect the
      constructs (such as reward prediction and willingness to work) predict psychopathology and
      impairment. The blood draw will be genotyped to determine if the measured constructs are
      associated with neuropsychiatric candidate genes, cross-disorder candidate gens and a
      cross-disorder polygenic score.
