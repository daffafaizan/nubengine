      for obesity. Despite this, it is often undiagnosed. Patients who have bariatric surgery have
      improvements in their eating patterns, including binge eating. However there is variability
      in the degree of weight loss and post-operative complications following bariatric surgery,
      associated with disordered eating.

      Guided self help for BED (GSH) is a treatment which, like bariatric surgery, is effective in
      reducing the number of binge episodes in people who binge eat. It is not known whether GSH
      prior to surgery, in patients undergoing bariatric surgery has any additional benefit for
      reducing bingeing, or improving weight loss in these patients.
