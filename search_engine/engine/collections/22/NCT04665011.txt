      non-invasive blood pressure (Caretaker, Caretaker Medical, Charlottesville, VA) sensors in
      place on the index and middle fingers, respectively, each patient will be asked to perform
      three mild, 10-sec Valsalva maneuvers with at least 45 seconds between. Pulse recordings will
      be collected from each device to compare phases of the Valsalva pulse response including
      pulse amplitude changes and baseline movement. The primary outcome is the correlation between
      pulse amplitude ratios for the pulse at the end of the Valsalva to an average baseline pulse.
