      dysfunction. the incidence of convulsion is very high in neonatal period, especially in the
      first week after birth. the incidence of convulsion decreases gradually with the increase of
      age. The incidence of convulsion reported by Bassan et al was 1.5 ‰ ~ 3.5 ‰ in term infants
      and 10% ≤ 130% in premature infants. Most of the neonatal convulsions suggest that there are
      serious primary diseases in the body. in addition to hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy,
      intracranial hemorrhage and infection, a large number of studies have proved that genetic
      factors play a key role in the occurrence of neonatal convulsions and epileptic
      encephalopathy in infants. Nearly 20% to 50% of neonatal convulsions are idiopathic
      convulsions. it has been thought that KCNQ2 gene, a potassium channel subunit located in
      20q11.3, and KCNQ3 gene, another potassium channel subunit located in 8q24, are mutated. Is
      the molecular basis for some benign familial neonatal convulsions, Usually the prognosis is
      good, but with the expansion of the study sample, investigators found that KCNQ2 may be
      associated with refractory epileptic encephalopathy, and there are few international reports
      in this regard. The study of KCNQ2 gene has led to a new understanding of the etiology of
      neonatal convulsion. The researchers hope to explore the etiological distribution and
      influencing factors of KCNQ2-related neonatal convulsions or refractory epileptic
      encephalopathy, and to improve the level of assessment, identification, intervention and
      shunt of KCNQ2-related convulsions. To formulate countermeasures and measures for prevention,
      management and health education.
