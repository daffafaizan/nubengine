      infarction.The assay is also intended to assist in the prognosis relative risk to all cause
      mortality (ACM) and major adverse cardiac events (MACE) consisting of myocardial infarction,
      revascularization, and cardiac death in patients who present with symptoms suggestive of
      acute coronary syndrome (ACS) without a diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

      All specimens were collected under a separate specimen collection protocol (Protocol No,
      7B5-02-09A01-01: Clinical Specimen Procurement for Biomarker Evaluation of Suspected ACS).
      The specimens that will be tested include approximately 8300 specimens collected from 1101
      subjects presenting to Emergency Departments with signs and symptoms of Acute Coronary
      Syndrome and will be provided to the clinical sites performing investigational Troponin I
      testing.
