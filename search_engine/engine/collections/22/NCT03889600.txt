      limited efficacy of the REDD-CAT social service screening and referral intervention to inform
      the design of a fully-powered trial. The study will determine the feasibility of delivering
      the REDD-CAT intervention in a clinical, point-of-care context to inform the design and
      implementation strategy for a fully powered clinical trial. It is not the purpose of this
      pilot clinical trial to determine sample size for a larger, fully-powered trial, as
      investigators already have data from prior readmissions research supporting sample size and
      power estimates using readmission rates as a primary outcome measure. After obtaining
      informed consent from a participant and gathering baseline data, the study research assistant
      (RA) will send a flag in the electronic medical record (EMR) to notify the nurse care manager
      that a patient has enrolled in the REDD-CAT pilot. The nurse care manager will then
      incorporate the administration of the REDD-CAT to the patient as part of standard care
      discharge planning. He or she will utilize the REDD-CAT results report as a guideline for
      generating appropriate referrals to address unmet social needs identified. To inform
      secondary measure selection for a future larger study, the RA will administer to enrolled
      patients a number of standardized measures, including the PHQ-9, GAD-7, Ways of Coping
      Questionnaire, and Diabetes Distress Scale. All baseline measures will be re-administered at
      30-day follow-up to patients via the telephone. Data on hospitalizations and ED visits during
      the 30-day period post-discharge will be obtained from patients' medical records, and all
      data gathered will be stored in a REDCap electronic database.
