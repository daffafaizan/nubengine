      necessity to identify new models to cope with regular periodic follow up of patients affected
      by diabetes mellitus. Telemedicine offers an acknowledged instrument to provide clinical
      health care at a distance, increasing patient compliance and the achievement of therapeutical
      goals. This study wants to verify the feasibility and the efficacy of teleconsultation in
      patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus. In particular by a randomized controlled approach the
      effects on glycemic control of patients followed by teleconsultation or traditionally in
      standard visit in the outpatient clinic. The patients in the teleconsultation group will
      arrange their bookings on a website (http://www.telediabete-fid.it/) In this website they
      could also access to web educational courses (mainly nutrition, insulin management, glucose
      monitoring auto-control) or to nutritional and psychological counselling.
