    
      Block of the medial and lateral plantar branches of the tibial nerve will be performed under
      the medial malleolar-calcaneal axis (MMCA) in order to preserve the calcaneal nerves.

      Blocks of the deep peroneal nerve (DPN) and the superficial peroneal nerve (SPN) will be
      added to provide an adequate anesthesia.

      Every block will be performed under Ultrasound using a 27-gauge, 5-cm, short bevel needle.

      5 mL of 0.375% Ropivacaine will be injected for each block. The sensory blocks will be
      assessed by pinprick test and cold test every 10 minutes for 40 minutes in the following
      locations: Calcaneal nerves, Lateral plantar nerve and Medial plantar nerve.

      The extent of sensory block will be graded as follows: 2: normal sensation; 1: decreased
      sensation; and 0: no sensation (complete block).
