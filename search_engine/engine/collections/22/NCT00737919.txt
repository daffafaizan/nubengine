      patients who will undergo an elective carotid endarterectomy due to a tight asymptomatic
      stenosis. The patients will be randomized into two groups consuming either plant sterol
      (2g/day) or plant stanol (2g/day) spreads for two to six weeks, until the operation. Serum
      lipids, lipoproteins and sterols will be analyzed at the randomization, before the operation
      and one month after the operation. The carotid arteries will be examined for their
      composition of sterols.

      This study gives new information concerning the relationship between dietary consumption of
      plant sterols and stanols and the sterol composition of the carotid plaques.
