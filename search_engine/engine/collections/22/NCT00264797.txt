      adolescents with substance abuse disorders and indicates that they have poorer substance use
      treatment outcomes and poorer prognosis and risk of persistence and progression of drug use
      and behavior problems into adulthood. Although research indicates that the majority are not
      treated for ADHD while in substance treatment, we do not know whether concurrent
      pharmacotherapy for ADHD will improve treatment outcomes. This Clinical Trials Network (CTN)
      study will evaluate the efficacy of osmotic-release methylphenidate (OROS-MPH), relative to
      placebo, in treating ADHD and decreasing substance use in adolescents (13-18 years old) with
      ADHD and a substance use disorder. Approximately 300 participants will be recruited at 11
      sites and randomly assigned to either OROS-MPH or matching placebo for a 16-week treatment
      period, during which all participants will receive individual cognitive-behavioral therapy as
      a standardized treatment for substance abuse.
