      IIA, IIB, and IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after complete resection. Cisplatin and
      vinorelbine combination is the standard of care in adjuvant setting. The BR. 19 trial
      reported adjuvant gefitinib after complete resection of early stage NSCLC(stage IB 49%, II
      38%, III 13%) did not confer disease free survival(DFS) or overall survival(OS) advantage in
      overall population. While the median gefitinib treatment time is only 4.8 months. There are
      only 76 patients with EGFR mutations included in this analysis. The study closed prematurely
      in 2005.

      Activating somatic mutations of the tyrosine kinase domain of epidermal growth factor
      receptor (EGFR) have been characterized in a subset of patients with advanced NSCLC.The EGFR
      mutation rate was 30% in Chinese NSCLC. Patients harboring these mutations in their tumors
      show excellent response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs). This randomized phase
      III trial is studying gefitinib to see how well it works compared to cisplatin-based
      chemotherapy in treating patients who have undergone surgery for stage II-IIIA(N1-N2) NSCLC
      with EGFR activating mutation in Asian population.
