      survival of less than 1 year. Recently, a randomized study of Pomalidomide and dexamethasone
      conducted in compared with placebo and dexamethasone showed that pomalidomide can improve
      survival of this group of patients.

      Pomalidomide is a new immunomodulatory drug which has been shown to be active in myeloma
      patients who relapse after bortezomib and lenalidomide. A recent phase III study comparing
      pomalidomide plus dexamethasone with placebo plus high dose dexamethasone in patients with
      prior exposure to bortezomib and lenalidomide, showed that the use of pomalidomide
      significantly improve the overall survival of these patients. However, this study did not
      include Asian patients. Therefore the efficacy and toxicity of pomalidomide remains to be
      described in Asian patients
