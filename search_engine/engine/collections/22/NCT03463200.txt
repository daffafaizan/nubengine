      improved with the application of Kinesio Taping. The aim of this study is evaluate the effect
      of Kinesio Taping on back muscle fatigue of low back pain patients. Sixty-four women, between
      18 to 50 years old, with chronic nonspecific Low Back Pain will attend this study. They will
      be randomly assigned in four different groups: control group (CG), KT with tension group
      (KTT), KT no tension group (KTNT) and MicroporeÂ® group (MP) and submitted to three
      evaluations: pre, three and ten days after intervention, analysing the electromyography
      activity of longissimus muscle and the sustained time during a fatigue test. The variables
      analysed during the evaluations will be median frequency (MP) slope of longuissimus muscle
      and sustained time during the Ito test.
