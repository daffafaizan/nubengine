      neck cancer, but there can be substantial added toxicity with chemoradiotherapy compared to
      radiation therapy alone. Neoadjuvant therapy with cisplatin / 5-fluorouracil has demonstrated
      activity in this disease, and taxanes appear to improve response further. Docetaxel /
      cisplatin / 5-fluorouracil has been shown to be a highly active regimen. However, with the
      potential added toxicities of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, it is important to minimize toxicity
      while maintaining efficacy. Chemotherapeutic agents that are DNA cycle-specific like
      5-fluorouracil are more stomatotoxic than those that are cell phase non-specific. Of note,
      several studies have suggested that docetaxel and cisplatin is a highly active combination
      when used for advanced disease or as neoadjuvant therapy .

      This study will therefore test the efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin and
      docetaxel without 5-fluorouracil followed by chemoradiotherapy with carboplatin to determine
      whether promising response rates with modest toxicity can be achieved. Carboplatin will be
      used as the radiosensitizing agent during chemoradiotherapy to reduce nephrotoxicity and
      neurotoxicity as compared to further treatment with cisplatin.
