    
      A randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT) to compare the use of deproteinized bovine bone
      mineral (DBBM) in combination with autogenous bone chips versus a DBBM alone for the
      augmentation of bony dehiscence after dental implant placement

      Objectives: 1. To test whether the use of DBBM is not inferior to the use of a combination of
      DBBM and autogenous bone chips for the filling of bony dehiscence around dental implants

      2. To test whether a digital impression technique can be used to measure guided bone
      regeneration in comparison to conventional measurement with a dental probe and to compare
      these observations with cone beam CT images

      Study Design: Randomized, controlled, single center, split mouth study

      Study Population: Partially edentulous male or female patients in need for oral implants for
      a fixed prosthetic implant supported rehabilitation and where a Guide Bone Regeneration (GBR)
      procedure is indicated during implant treatment

      Patient Number: 14

      Duration of treatment: The time in the study for each patient will be 1 year and 4 months.
      The treatment period includes implant and abutment installation (in a twostage procedure),
      with a healing time of minimum 12 weeks before the start of the prosthetic phase.

      Study devices: Implants: 3.3 / 4.1 / 4.8 mm Straumann Bone level implants Bone Graft: DBB
      (Demineralised Bovine Bone, Bio OSS) Measuring Devices: Cadent iTero & software and Dental
      Probes Prosthetics: Straumann (computer aided design computer aided manufacturing (CAD CAM)
      crowns and abutments

      Outcome variables:

      Primary outcome variable: Difference in bone fill between DBB + bone chips vs. DBB without
      bone chips afer 24 weeks of submerged healing. The "ideal bone volume" as defined at base
      line (= 100%) will be compared to the received bone fill [%] at re-entry measured by a
      digital impression technique (before and after GBR, and at abutment connection, before and
      after raising a flap, and at the 1-year follow-up).

      The method of digital impression will be compared to CBCT immediately after implant placemetn
      and 1 year and periodontal probing during surgery and re-enty
