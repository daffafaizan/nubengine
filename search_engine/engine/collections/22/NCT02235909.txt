      an active comparator losartan which the same class of drug and is approved for use in the
      pediatric population aged 6 years and older. Approximately 260 subjects will participate in a
      6-week, double-blind, randomized, treatment phase, followed by a 2-week, double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled withdrawal phase. This study also includes a 44-week,
      open-label extension Phase in which all subjects will receive azilsartan and other
      antihypertensive medications (if needed) in order to reach an optimal blood pressure. Blood
      pressure will be assessed in the clinic throughout the study, and subjects may also
      participate in a 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring procedure at baseline, at the
      end of the double-blind Phase and at the end of the open-label Phase.
