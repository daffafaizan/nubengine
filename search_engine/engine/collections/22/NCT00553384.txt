    
      The study consists of five visits. The first visit is a screening visit at which the
      eligibility of the subject is determined and a blood sample is taken. At this visit, the
      subject is also given ovulation test strips and instructions to perform urine-based ovulation
      self-tests at home for a period of several days following the onset of menstruation. The
      subject is instructed to test her urine at home until an LH surge is detected.

      When the subject ovulates and is available for a visit she will come to the Rockefeller
      University Hospital within one day of detecting an LH surge for the first of four Test
      Sessions.

      The four Test Sessions are identical with the exception that the subject is exposed to a
      different odor stimulus.

      We will be measuring:

        1. skin temperature

        2. sweating, as measured by skin conductance

        3. salivary cortisol levels.

        4. mood
