    
      This is a cross-over group, double-blind, randomized clinical trial in healthy volunteers
      comparing dextromethorphan and inactive control on freeze-induced hyperalgesia, experimental
      pain, diffuse noxious inhibitory control (DNIC), pupillary reaction and reaction time.

      The influence of CYP3A4 and MDR1 polymorphism on the dextromethorphan analgesic efficacy will
      be measured.

      The study design is divided in two study sequences and each subject participates in the two
      study sequences and receive the two treatments (dextromethorphan and placebo).

      Each study sequence consists of 3 assessment days (Day -1, Day 0 = first treatment
      administration and Day 1).
