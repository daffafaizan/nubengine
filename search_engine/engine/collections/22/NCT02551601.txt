      choroidal abnormalities. These are usually associated with retinal diseases and leading to
      severe visual dysfunction. Choroidal thickness is therefore helpful in diagnosis and
      treatment for many chorioretinal conditions. With the advent of spectral domain optical
      coherence tomography and enhanced depth imaging technique, choroidal thickness has been
      investigated widely in normal eyes and various chorioretinal diseases including central
      serous chorioretinopathy (CSC), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), highly myopia and
      Vogt Koyanagi-Harada disease. Similar to retinal thickness, a normal baseline choroidal
      thickness might be used for interpretation. This value might be affected by several variables
      including age, gender and ethnicity. Although there were previous studies on subfoveal
      choroidal thickness in normal eyes from many countries, there has been no such study in
      Thailand. The purpose of this study was to determine the subfoveal choroidal thickness in
      normal Thai eyes and study the associations with gender, age, refractive error and axial
      length using SD-OCT and EDI technique.
