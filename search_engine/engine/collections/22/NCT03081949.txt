      mortality, and Nigeria probably has the highest burden of the disease in the world.
      Unfortunately, much about the disease including its aetiology, epidemiology and treatment is
      not yet well described. This will be a prospective, national, multicenter cohort study,
      conducted in centres in Nigeria. It is expected that approximately 500 patients with PPCM and
      500 apparently healthy pregnant women will be recruited over a 6-month period with follow-up
      at 3-monthly intervals for 18 months. The objectives of the study are:

      i. To describe the burden and demographic, social and clinical characteristics of PPCM in
      Nigeria.

      ii. To describe the ventricular remodelling and outcomes (rehospitalisation rate,
      cardio-embolic events and survival) of PPCM in Nigeria.

      Sub-study:

      iii. To study the relationship between selenium deficiency, oxidative stress and PPCM in
      Nigeria.

      iv. To describe the prevalence of selenium deficiency and its relationship with cardiac
      function in apparently healthy pregnant women in Nigeria.

      v. To study the impact of sodium selenite supplementation on cardiac function among selenium
      deficient PPCM patients who have not recovered left ventricular function at 6 months after
      the diagnosis.

      This will be the largest systematic evaluation of PPCM in Nigeria, and it is hoped that the
      information will assist in developing locally applicable treatment guidelines, policies and
      interventions for this seemingly deadly disease.
