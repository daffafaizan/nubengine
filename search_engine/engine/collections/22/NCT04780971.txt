    
      ULTRA-CTO is a prospective multicentre non-randomised investigator-initiated trial designed
      to enrol 200 subjects with an indication for PCI CTO and who have at least one intermediate
      (angiographically 30-90%) stenosis in a non-CTO vessel or major side branch of the CTO vessel
      with a diameter of at least 2mm.

      The main objective of the study is to evaluate both the value of post-PCI RFR and post-PCI
      FFR for detecting suboptimal stent result (SSR) in the acute phase and the stability of these
      measurements over time.

      After angiographically successful CTO PCI, intra-coronary physiologic assessment (RFR, FFR,
      coronary flow reserve (CFR) and index of microcirculatory resistance (IMR)) of the CTO vessel
      will be performed directly. A staged procedure including several measurements is planned at 4
      Â± 2 weeks after the index procedure. These measurements include same intra-coronary
      physiologic measurements as performed at index procedure and optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) imaging of the stented segment in the CTO target vessel.

      Prior to the staged procedure occurrence of cardiovascular events and clinical classification
      will be assessed.
