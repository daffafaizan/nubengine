    
      The present RCT is an open-label faisability study. OctaplasLGÂ® or a placebo (0.9% NaCl) will
      be allocated to patients with a septic shock-induced coagulopathy defined by decreased
      platelets (<150,000/mm3 or >30% decrease within 24 hours) and an INR>1.40, and started within
      the 6 hours following coagulopathy diagnosis.
