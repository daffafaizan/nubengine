      months, or a total of 78 treatments. 6mm punch skin biopsies (2) will be done prior to
      starting therapy, once during treatment (2) and at the completion of the study (2). Clinical
      assessments and photography will be done parallel to the skin biopsies. Results (clinically
      and histologically) will be analyzed.
