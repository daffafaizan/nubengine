      about effect of RIC on platelet function during off-pump coronary artery bypass surgery. In
      this study investigators are going to perform RIC after anesthesia induction (remote ischemic
      pre-conditioning) and after completion of coronary anastomoses (remote ischemic
      post-conditioning), and compare platelet function parameters with control group.
