      treatment while they are symptomatic, but the plateau of the dose response curve for inhaled
      corticosteroids (ICS) may have been reached. Studies in symptomatic adults and asymptomatic
      children with asthma suggest measuring induced sputum eosinophils allows better asthma
      management. We will recruit 80 children with severe asthma (treated with at least 500 mcg/day
      inhaled fluticasone or equivalent). We will see them every three months for a year, and
      perform sputum induction and measurements of exhaled nitric oxide (eNO). Half will be
      randomised to conventional management; half will have a reduction of ICS if there are no
      sputum eosinophils, or (if a sample cannot be produced) eNO is normal. The trial endpoint is
      whether there is a significant reduction in the median dose of ICS in the inflammatory
      markers group, with no increase in total number of asthma exacerbations. This study is also
      hypothesis generating. We will use our panel of markers (a) to try to improve clinical
      monitoring; and (b) to determine the molecular mechanisms of relapse of severe asthma.
