    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For Arms D-F, to establish the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs)
      of different treatment combinations of avelumab when administered in combination with
      checkpoint agonist(s) with or without radiation in patients with metastatic solid tumors in
      order to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select the recommended phase 2 dose
      (RP2D).

      II. To correlate pre- and post-treatment CD8 expression with clinical benefit (complete
      response [CR], partial response [PR], or stable disease [SD] for > 6 months).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the different treatment combinations in patients with
      metastatic solid tumors by assessing objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1 and immune-related RECIST (irRECIST).

      II. To evaluate the efficacy of the different treatment combinations in patients with
      metastatic solid tumors by assessing progression-free survival (PFS), duration of response
      (DOR), and overall survival (OS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To understand the mechanism of action of the avelumab plus an immune modulator
      combination, as well as potential mechanisms of resistance.

      II. To characterize the effect of avelumab combinations on immune biomarkers in peripheral
      blood and tumor tissue obtained from subjects pre- and post-treatment.

      III. To compare the response in irradiated versus non-irradiated lesions in Arms D-F.

      IV. To investigate immune biomarkers that are potentially predictive of response and
      resistance with the combination of avelumab and an immune modulator.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 6 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive utomilumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1 of each cycle
      and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1. Cycles repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of
      each cycle and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients receive anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of
      each cycle, utomilumab over 60 minutes on day 1, and avelumab IV over 60 minutes on days 1
      and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM D: Patients undergo radiation therapy on days -14 to -1. Patients receive avelumab IV
      over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 of beginning day 15 of cycle 1 and utomilumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM E: Patients undergo radiation therapy on days -14 to -1. Patients receive avelumab IV
      over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1 and anti-OX40 antibody
      PF-04518600 IV over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15, and. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM F: Patients undergo radiation therapy on days -14 to -1. Patients receive avelumab IV
      over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15 beginning day 15 of cycle 1, utomilumab IV over 60 minutes
      on day 1, and anti-OX40 antibody PF-04518600 IV on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients will be followed up at 30 days and then every
      12 weeks.
