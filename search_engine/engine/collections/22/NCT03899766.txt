    
      Venipuncture is one of the most unpleasant procedures for children. Previous studies
      demonstrated the effectiveness of distraction techniques in reducing anxiety and pain but no
      one compares the specific activities of animals assisted intervention (AAI), clowns and
      musicians for this procedure.

      In the Hospital involved in the present study, venipuncture service has a week schedule for
      Health Support Activities. In specific days children can benefit of Health Support Activities
      as part of routine care.

      Aims of the present study are: evaluate efficacy of AAI, clowns and musicians in the
      reduction of childrens' distress and pain during venipuncture with respect of a control group
      undergoing venipuncture in the days where Health Support Activities are not scheduled;
      compare distress and pain levels between groups; evaluate caregiver's anxiety and its
      influence on child pain and distress; explore parents' and staff opinion.
