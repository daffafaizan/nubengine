      differences in movement, muscle tone, pressure and sensation. Wearing shoes over the years
      can cause changes in walking and pain. In the examination of the feet of patients suffering
      from chronic pain in the heel was found a smaller volume of muscle, and calcification in the
      heel area that could be caused by increased pressure. Although the trend of physiotherapy
      treatments has changed in recent years from passive to active treatments, the overwhelming
      majority of studies are testing passive therapies only as a treatment option for chronic heel
      pain. Barefoot walking has not been tested as an option for treating chronic pain in the
      heel, although there are studies indicating that bare feet lead to reduced heel pressure,
      increased muscle work, and better proprioception.The purpose of this study is to examine the
      effect of barefoot walking on the level of pain, function and pain threshold for stress in
      patients with chronic heel pain.
