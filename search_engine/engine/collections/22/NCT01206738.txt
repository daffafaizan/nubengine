      which requires effective behaviour change interventions. Intervention modelling experiments
      (IMEs) are a way of exploring and refining an intervention before moving to a full-scale
      trial. They do this by delivering key elements of the intervention in a simulation that
      approximates clinical practice by, for example, presenting GPs with a clinical scenario about
      making a treatment decision. Earlier IMEs have been paper-based, which limits what can be
      done in the simulation.

      Web-based IMEs provide the potential for better clinical simulations, which have the
      potential to lead to better interventions. The current proposal will run a full, web-based
      IME involving 250 GPs that will advance the methodology of IMEs by directly comparing results
      with an earlier paper-based IME. Moreover, the web-based IME will evaluate an intervention
      that can be put into a full-scale trial that aims to reduce antibiotic prescribing in primary
      care. Reducing inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics in general practice is a national
      priority; indeed, antibiotic use is increasing in the UK and Scotland's prescribing is second
      highest amongst UK administrations. More effective behaviour change interventions are needed
      and this proposal will develop one such intervention and a system to model and test future
      interventions. This system will be applicable to any situation in the NHS where behaviour
      needs to be modified, including interventions aimed directly at the public.
