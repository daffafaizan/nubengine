      technological innovations for its control is obesity and studies indicate that microbiota of
      obese patients have a high level of intestinal microflora imbalance, with serious
      consequences such as loss of digestive function and the combination of toxins to protein.

      Potential mediators of intestinal microbiota are prebiotics, probiotics and synbiotics,
      supplements considered safe because they are naturally contained in food and human
      microbiota. Its use has been studied as a new therapeutic approach for the regulation of
      intestinal microbiota in various situations of disease, including in severe obesity.

      This study aims to analyze the effect of synbiotics supplementation on body mass index in
      participants diagnosed with morbid obesity. The methodology used is the randomized clinical
      trial, placebo-controlled with blinding of patients, healthcare staff and outcome assessors,
      with follow-up of 90 days.

      Patients will be randomized into two groups: control group to receive placebo (polydextrose -
      12 g / day) and synbiotic group - group supplemented with synbiotic (fructo-oligosaccharide
      and probiotics - 12 g / day). Probiotics are: Lactobacillus acidophilus; Lactobacillus
      rhamnosus; Lactobacillus paracasei; Bif√Ødobacterium lactis.

      At the moments proposed in this study, will be conducted assessments of food intake,
      nutritional status and metabolic / inflammatory parameters (body mass index, high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein, albumin, triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and
      LDL-cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, glycated hemoglobin, fasting insulin, weight,
      height).
