      Potential subjects will be identified using records provided by the St. Elizabeth Healthcare
      Thoracic Oncology and Radiology Department. Potential subjects will be screened for
      eligibility. Study investigator and designees will review patient electronic medical records,
      extracting data related to the ordering/completion of a LDCT and interventions that occurs
      thereafter. Collected data will focus on dates of encounters, diagnostic imaging/procedures,
      and treatments. Please see Appendix A for a complete list of data points. All of the data
      that will be collected for study purposes will be kept confidential. This will be attained by
      the following: First, each enrolled subject will be assigned a study specific serial number
      for the database. All study documents and data collection tools will be maintained with the
      investigative site file in a locked cabinet in a secure location maintained by the
      investigator. The database will not include the patient's name or hospital medical record
      number. No one will have access to the database but the study principal investigator and
      study staff designated by the principal investigator. However, study data may be reviewed by
      the Institutional Review Board of record, an appointed study monitor, an internal auditor for
      St. Elizabeth Healthcare, and necessary regulatory authorities. The security of the database
      will be maintained under the direction of the principal investigator. Fourth, when the study
      is completed, the manuscript is published, and IRB storage document requirements have been
      met, the file will be permanently deleted and destroyed
