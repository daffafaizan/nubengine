      CD20-positive cancers. It contains ten high affinity binding domains for CD20, and one
      binding domain for CD3. IGM-2323 is able to eliminate CD20-positive lymphoma cells by
      engaging T-cells and lymphoma cells, leading to T-cell dependent cellular cytotoxicity.
      Additionally, IGM-2323 is also able to eliminate lymphoma cells by recruiting complement to
      the surface of lymphoma cells, leading to complement dependent cytotoxicity.

      In our preclinical studies, we observed activity against rituximab resistant cells carrying
      low levels of CD20. We have also observed much lower cytokine release with IGM-2323 relative
      to comparable IgG format bispecific T-cell engaging antibodies, which is expected to result
      in reduced risk of the serious adverse effects from cytokine release syndrome (CRS).
