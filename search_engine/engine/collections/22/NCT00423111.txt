      cognitive performance. The origin of these cognitive deficits is not known, since the
      severity of cognitive deficits was not found to be correlated with disease parameters such as
      duration, lesion load or disease intensity as measured on standard scales (e.g. EDSS). The
      research hypothesis we plan to test is that the individual intensity of cognitive deficits is
      correlated with degeneration of specific neuronal structures related to cognitive
      performance, such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex.

      To test this hypothesis, we plan to perform volumetric measurements of such regions on MRI
      scans obtained from MS patients during the course of their clinical evaluation, and attempt
      to correlate those with the results of neuropsychological tests performed by the same
      subjects around the time of MRI scanning.
