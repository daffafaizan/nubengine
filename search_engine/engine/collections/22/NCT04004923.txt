      submucosal myomas, polyps, uterine septum, and abnormal intrauterine bleeding. Two different
      methods for distension of the uterus for hysteroscopy are available currently. One is
      monopolar and the second is bipolar. The monopolar fluid contains mannitol and the bipolar
      fluid contains serum physiologic. Passage of the distention fluid into the uterine veins
      during hysteroscopy might lead to volume overload, water intoxication, hyponatremia,
      pulmonary edema or brain edema. However, the effect of monopolar hysteroscopy or bipolar
      hysteroscopy on intracranial pressure in patients undergoing hysteroscopy is unknown. Optic
      nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) measurement is a surrogate marker of invasive intracranial
      pressure. This study aims to compare the impact of monopolar and bipolar hysteroscopy on
      intracranial pressure by using ONSD measurement in patients undergoing hysteroscopy.
