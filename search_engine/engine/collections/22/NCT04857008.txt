      necessary to ensure adherence to utilization of the digital program, as well as any potential
      safety issues associated with recruiting and offering an intervention to cancer patients with
      moderate anxiety or mild depressive symptoms. Data relating to patient experience, adherence,
      satisfaction and pre-post intervention outcomes will also be tracked.

      The study will run in two distinct phases to first assess the process of clinical
      implementation by prescribing oncology clinicians, and in a second more expanded phase,
      further assess the clinical implementation and impact on enrolled patients.

      Study Phase 1: We aim to identify promoters and barriers to the clinical implementation of
      BNT001, a software application that delivers a 10-session digitally administered version of a
      published manualized therapy for stress management in adult cancer patients that has
      established efficacy in improving quality of life and mood.

      Study Phase 2: We aim to further identify promoters and barriers to provider clinical
      implementation of BNT001, assess patient acceptability and feasibility including patient
      adherence to BNT's 10-sessions, and obtain preliminary data on BNT001's impact on
      cancer-related distress.
