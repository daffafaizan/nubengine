      dose and regimen for further evaluation in Part 2. SY-1365 will be administered intravenously
      weekly & twice weekly for 3 weeks of each 4 week cycle. Dose escalation will proceed until
      the determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or a recommended dose and regimen for
      evaluation in Part 2 of the study. Part 1 was concluded in September 2018 with a total of 32
      evaluable patients.

      Following the identification of a recommended dose and regimen from Part 1, the study entered
      Part 2 to further evaluate safety and the antitumor activity of SY-1365 in patients with
      select solid tumors, and to confirm target engagement and downstream pathway impact in
      patients with any solid tumor histology.

      Preliminary anti-tumor activity will be evaluated in up to approximately 102 evaluable
      patients in Part 2, with SY-1365 administered alone, in combination with carboplatin, or in
      combination with fulvestrant. Part 2 will consist of five cohorts:

        -  Cohort 1: approximately 24 patients with advanced ovarian cancer with 3+ previous lines
           of treatment. Monotherapy

        -  Cohort 2: approximately 24 patients with relapsed ovarian cancer with previous platinum
           therapy. SY-1365 + Carboplatin

        -  Cohort 3: approximately 12 patients with clear cell ovarian cancer. Monotherapy

        -  Cohort 4: approximately 20-30 patients with biopsy-accessible, advanced solid tumors of
           any histology. Monotherapy.

        -  Cohort 5: approximately 12 patients with HR+ metastatic breast cancer post CDK4/6 +
           hormonal therapy treatment. SY-1365 + fulvestrant.

      Overall, the study may enroll up to approximately 137 evaluable patients across dose
      escalation (Part 1) and expansion cohorts (Part 2, Cohorts 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5).
