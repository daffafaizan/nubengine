      eye. These cells likely perform a protective function, but it is also possible that their
      dysregulation could lead to disease. Using a larger cohort, our investigation hopes to better
      understand the function of these cells and their potential to be linked to dry eye disease.
      Further, the way in which these cells are collected, using an at-home self-collection of
      tears using an eye wash method with sterile saline solution, immediately upon awakening,
      could potentially provide relief to dry eye sufferers if performed on a daily basis.
