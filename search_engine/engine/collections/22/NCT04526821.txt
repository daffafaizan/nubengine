      classified as a pandemic by the World Health Organization. Health care providers are at high
      risk to become infected with the SARS-CoV-2 due to their continuous exposition to infected
      patients. Multiple strategies are being developed as potential prophylactic regimens, however
      to date (4th Aug 2020) none has proven to be effective for preventing the SARS-CoV-2
      infection. Lactoferrin, an iron-binding protein with multiple physiological functions
      (anti-microbial, anti-inflammatory, and immunomodulatory), is one of the most important
      proteins present in mammalian milk. It has shown to inhibit the SARS entry to target cells by
      inhibiting the union of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein with its receptor (ACE-II receptors),
      blocking the heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptor and it decreases the viral load of
      SARS-CoV-2 infecting culture cells in in vitro models. The study hypothesis is that
      lactoferrin given as a daily oral food supplement to health care workers will decrease the
      frequency of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The investigators will conduct a randomized double blinded
      placebo control clinical trial in physicians, nurses and nurse assistants who work in areas
      of care for patients with COVID-19 (emergency, hospitalization, and Intensive Care Unit) in
      hospitals in Lima, Peru, to determine the effect of bovine lactoferrin on the prevention of
      COVID-19 infection.
