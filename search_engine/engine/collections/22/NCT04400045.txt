      combine immunodeficiency in NBS is allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).
      Standard myeloablative conditioning regimens in DNA repair disorders lead to increased
      morbidity and mortality after HSCT. Low doses of alkylators are used to reduce toxicity
      rates, which, however, increase the risks of mixed chimerism and graft failure. The data of
      treosulfan usage in NBS are sparse. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of low dose
      treosulfan based conditioning regimen in NBS, treosulfan 21g/m2 in combination with
      fludarabine 150mg/mg, cyclophosphamide 40mg/kg, thymoglobulin (Genzyme) 5mg/kg and rituximab
      100mg/m2 will be used from day -6 to -1 day, followed by stem cell infusion. The primary
      endpoint is event-free survival, where graft failure, death, and malignancies are considered
      as events.
