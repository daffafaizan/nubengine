      importance in the accomplishment of numerous actions due to an essential function: The
      handgrip strength. The handgrip and pinch movements are very important for an accomplishment
      of daily activities. For an evaluation of the movements, the dynamometry has been used in
      many fields of health and frequently in the area of rehabilitation. However, if the type of
      dynamometer used is not suitable for children, a measurement of the handgrip may be
      compromised. Therefore, the present study verified the effectiveness of an electronic
      dynamometer to evaluate the handgrip strength and pinch in children and adolescents.
