    
      Miromatrix Medical Inc. has developed a new biologic mesh, called MIROMESHÂ®. MIROMESH
      received FDA 510(k) clearance with an indication for reinforcement of soft tissue on March
      31, 2014 under K134033. Miromatrix Biologic Mesh is a non cross-linked, acellular surgical
      mesh that is derived from the highly vascularized porcine liver. This study will serve to
      provide clinicians with high-quality clinical data in order to provide them with a higher
      degree of confidence when selecting MIROMESH for ventral hernia repair.
