      Ventilation device (Philips Respironics autoSV Advanced) for the treatment of complex central
      sleep apnea (CompSA). The features of autoSV Advanced include an automatic expiratory
      pressure (EPAP) adjustment, an advanced algorithm for distinguishing open versus obstructed
      airway apnea, a modified auto backup rate which is proportional to subject's baseline
      breathing rate, and a variable inspiratory support. Our primary aim was to compare the
      performance of the advanced servo-ventilator (BiPAP autoSV Advanced) with conventional
      servo-ventilator (BiPAP autoSV) in treating central sleep apnea (CSA).

      Study Design: A prospective, multicenter, randomized, controlled trial.

      Setting: Five sleep laboratories in the United States.

      Participants: Thirty-seven participants were included.
