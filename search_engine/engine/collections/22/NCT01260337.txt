      portion controlled meal plan plus a group behavior modification program or to a control group
      that consists of a group diabetes support and education (DSE) program. Random assignment will
      be stratified by whether or not a subject is taking insulin at baseline, which will be
      included as a covariate in all subsequent analyses. Treatment assignments are unmasked. At
      the end of 24 weeks both groups will have completed 9 group sessions (weeks 0, 1, 2, 4, 8,
      12, 16, 20 and 24). At week 16, each participant will meet individually with the study
      physician to review their progress to date. These meetings will take place at the week 16
      group visit. The PCD program is aimed at achieving and maintaining a decrease in weight and
      providing a group behavior modification program from 0-24 weeks. The DSE program is aimed at
      providing diabetes support and education from weeks 0-24. A Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE)
      will review the effects of diet and weight loss, exercise, and medications on blood glucose
      levels among all participants at the individual session before any changes in dietary intake
      or exercise are prescribed. Participants will be counseled on strategies to prevent
      hypoglycemia and will be given a blood glucose meter and strips and instructed to measure
      their blood glucose at least two times per day while participating in the study. In addition,
      the causes, symptoms and treatment of hypoglycemia will be reviewed including when to contact
      their health care provider.
