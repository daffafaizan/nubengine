      ability to load share and to limit motion following subsidence of the interbody spacer. In
      contrast, a dynamic plate system utilizing variable-angle screws maintains load-sharing and
      stiffness following subsidences. Increasing the load on the bone graft in the interbody space
      increases the rate of graft fusion. Although literature exists supporting the in vivo use of
      anterior cervical plate systems and the advantages of screw angulation, there is no data
      evaluating and supporting the use of anterior plate systems in the lumbar spine. The
      different biomechanical loads between cervical and lumbar spine suggest cervical data may not
      generalize to the lumbar spine. Additionally, it will be useful to characterize the effect of
      different screw configurations on subsidence and stress shielding and fusion success. The
      proposed study will not only assess clinical outcomes following Trinica ALP implantation, but
      will also provide valuable comparison data regarding two different screw configurations.

      The study is a prospective, randomized, between groups design. The subject pool will be
      comprised of individuals who are appropriate for spinal fusion surgery, and who meet the
      inclusion criteria. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three screw configurations.
      All subjects will receive structural allograft (Puros A Anterior Allograft) as interbody
      support. Other procedures identified by the surgeon to be in the best interest of the patient
      may be completed but are not required by the protocol.
