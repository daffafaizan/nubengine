      and functional capacity of patients at risk for diabetic neuropathy. This is a randomized,
      controlled and blind clinical trial with type 2 diabetes patients. The eligibility criteria
      are 10 years or more of diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, between the ages of 50 to 75 years,
      both sexes, and registered in the Primary Health Care Unit of São João or in the Diabetes
      Education Center in Minas Gerais state, Brazil. As exclusion criteria, it will be considered
      the presence of ulcers in the feet, amputations of the lower limbs, deficits in cognitive
      abilities, and previous treatment using reflexology. For the calculation of the sample size,
      a pilot test will be conducted with 8 diabetic patients. It will be used the statistical
      software Biostat® 5.3. The sample found was of 60 patients who were divided into 2 groups of
      30 patients each, Control Group (CG) and Treatment Group (TG). The TG will receive self-care
      guidelines with feet and 12 sessions of foot reflexology, while the CG will only receive the
      guideline. For the evaluations, it will be applied the instrument for quality of life (SF-36)
      and for functional capacity, the Stanford Health Assessment Questionnaire. This research will
      follow the standards set by resolution 466/12 of the National Health Council, for research
      with human beings and will be conducted in accordance with the ethical recommendations of the
      Declaration of Helsinki.
