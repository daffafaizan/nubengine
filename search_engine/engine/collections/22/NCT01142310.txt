      hippocampus. An extensive literature suggests that corticosteroid-induced changes in the
      hippocampus are, in part, mediated through increases in extracellular glutamate. In animals,
      agents that decrease glutamate release prevent dendritic changes in the hippocampus secondary
      to stress or corticosterone. We have developed a research program using patients receiving
      prescription corticosteroids (e.g., prednisone) to explore the effects of corticosteroids on
      the human hippocampus. Our research program is translational in focus, with a goal of
      exploring whether the reported effects of corticosteroids on the animal hippocampus are also
      found in humans. A current focus of our research is examining glutamate release inhibitors in
      patients taking corticosteroids. We have both open-label and placebo-controlled pilot data
      suggesting that the glutamate release inhibitor lamotrigine is associated with significant
      improvement in declarative memory (a measure of hippocampal performance) in this population.
      A definitive study examining declarative memory in corticosteroid-dependent patients
      receiving lamotrigine vs. placebo is proposed. Neuroimaging and mood will also be assessed.
