      pressure, shortness of breath, diaphoresis, and nausea, detection of a rise and/or fall of
      troponin with at least one value above the 99th percentile of the upper reference limit is
      essential to the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction (AMI). However, current troponin
      testing has limitations, including antibody specificity, assay imprecision, lack of
      standardization and a relatively late increase in the circulating troponin level after the
      onset of ischemia. Studies have shown a low diagnostic sensitivity of troponins when measured
      early (<6 hours) after symptom onset. Although there are some more sensitive troponin assays
      with a coefficient of variation (CV)10% at the 99th percentile of a normal reference
      population, most troponin assays have an imprecision CV of around 20% at the 99th percentile
      of the reference population. The early insensitivity of troponin results in an unmet need in
      the clinical evaluation of patients presenting with suspected ACS and AMI.

      Copeptin may improve early AMI diagnostic sensitivity because of a number of unique
      characteristics.

        -  Copeptin levels are elevated at presentation in patients with AMI compared to patients
           with other presentations.

        -  Copeptin levels are elevated in patients with AMI even when troponin levels were not
           elevated at the time of initial presentation.

        -  Thus, a combination of troponin and copeptin levels at presentation may result in a more
           accurate diagnosis of acute AMI than troponin alone.

        -  Copeptin levels drop 1 day after an AMI.
