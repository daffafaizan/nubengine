      literature and scientific knowledge, intraoperative burst suppression patterns might be
      caused either by hypotension resulting in a reduced cerebral circulation or by an
      oversedation of anesthetics correlating with a very deep level of hypnosis.

      Some publications exist that discuss the occurrence of intraoperative burst suppression
      especially in elderly people (aged â‰¥ 60 years) as a predictor of postoperative delirium and
      postoperative cognitive dysfunction.

      None of the studies however was able to prove a causal relationship between burst suppression
      and postoperative delirium. Contrary it might simply be an epiphenomenon.

      Conducting this interventional trail primarily aims to prove whether specific
      anesthesiological interventions, such as the treatment of intraoperative hypotension in first
      line and/or the reduction of the concentration of anesthetics in second line, reduce
      intraoperative burst suppression. Hence it might be possible to investigate a possible
      casualty between burst suppression and postoperative delirium in a second trial.
