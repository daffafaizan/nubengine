      non-immunosuppressive analogs, GP11046 and GP11511 were capable of promoting telogen to
      anagen transition. Since GP11046 and GP11511 possess the neurotrophic properties of FK506
      without its immunosuppressant capability, the neural action of these immunophilin ligands may
      play an important role in the hair cycle. This finding has significant clinical implications
      in that immunophilin ligands may have the potential to reverse alopecia. To further
      investigate this possibility we propose to explore the response of transplanted miniaturized
      scalp hair follicles to topically applied immunophilin ligands.
