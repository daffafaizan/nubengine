    
      Investigational Device: 0.3-mL intraocular gas (C3F8) injection

      Objectives

      Primary

        1. To compare the proportion of eyes with central VMT release on OCT after pneumatic
           vitreolysis with gas injection versus observation (sham injection) in eyes with VMT
           without an associated macular hole.

           Secondary

        2. To evaluate visual function outcomes at 24 weeks after gas injection is performed
           compared with sham injection.

      Study Design: Multi-center, randomized clinical trial
