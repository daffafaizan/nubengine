      First group received 20 sessions of 20 minutes each of low-frequency (1Hz) rTMS applied over
      the left temporoparietal cortex (LTPC).

      Second group received sham (placebo) stimulation over the LTPC for the same period of time.
      All patients were considered as having refractory schizophrenia and in use of at least
      400mg/day of clozapine and refering auditory hallucinations occuring at least 5 times a day.
