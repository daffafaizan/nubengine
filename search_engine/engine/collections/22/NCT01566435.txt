      (nab-paclitaxel, cisplatin, cetuximab, and 5-FU) regimen included two therapeutic changes:
      nab-paclitaxel was substituted for docetaxel and cetuximab was added. The investigators
      propose to eliminate cetuximab from the ACCF regimen to isolate the treatment effects of
      nab-paclitaxel when given with cisplatin and 5-FU. The primary objective of the ACF proposal
      is to determine the complete (CR) rate by clinical examination at the primary tumor site
      following two cycles of ACF. An important secondary objective will be to compare the tumor
      response rates at the primary site following two cycles of ACF to our historical experience
      following two cycles of ACCF (protocol # ABX 218/HRPO# 08-0911). In addition, the
      investigators will compare adverse events (AEs) between patients who receive ACF to the
      historical group given ACCF. From these two comparisons, we aim to determine if either ACF or
      ACCF is superior based on a balance of efficacy (using the surrogate prognostic endpoint of
      CR rate at primary tumor site) and toxicity.
