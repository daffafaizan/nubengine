      Primary

      -Clinically assess the early toxicity of SBRT with integrated boost for clinically localized
      prostate cancer

      Secondary

        -  Determine the technical feasibility of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) with
           integrated boost for clinically localized prostate cancer

             -  Determine the treatment planning and dosimetric feasibility

             -  Evaluate the treatment delivery quality assurance

        -  Clinically assess early efficacy, late toxicity, and quality of life for patients
           receiving SBRT with integrated boost for clinically localized prostate cancer

      Patients will undergo 5 total radiation treatments over 7-17 day period.

      Patients will be asked to complete American Urological Association Symptom Index (AUA SI),
      Sexual Health Inventory of Men (SHIM), and the Expanded Prostate Index Composite
      (EPIC)questionnaires. The EPIC assesses bowel, urinary, and sexual function. These
      questionnaires will be completed at the following time points: Baseline, AUA SI will be
      collected on the last day of treatment, and every 3 months for the first year following the
      start of radiation, then every 6 months for year 2.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed-up every 3 months for the first
      year, then every 6 months for year 2.
