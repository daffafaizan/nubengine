      comparison of the VTC and in-person modalities using rigorous methodology and a sophisticated
      analysis of equivalency between clinical and process outcome domains. In addition, cost
      effectiveness of this modality will be addressed. Approximately 130 combat Reservists,
      National Guardsmen, or veterans were recruited from multiple clinical sites. Prospective
      participants received a comprehensive assessment at baseline to determine eligibility. The
      exclusion criteria selected are consistent with large PTSD randomized clinical trials as well
      as research using the CPT protocol with military populations with PTSD. The treatment was
      delivered twice a week over 6 weeks by a doctoral level psychologist. Quality control
      procedures were incorporated into the study's design to ensure integrity, fidelity and
      standard administration of the CPT intervention across both conditions. Participants received
      additional assessments at mid-treatment, immediately post-treatment, and at 3 and 6 months
      post-treatment. Outcome domains include: 1) clinical outcomes (symptom severity, social
      functioning); 2) process outcomes (perception of treatment, satisfaction, group therapy
      alliance, treatment compliance, and attrition and treatment credibility); and (3)
      cost-effectiveness outcomes.
