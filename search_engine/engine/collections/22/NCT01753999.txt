      to significant amounts of dust while working in rescue, recovery and debris removal. A
      significant number of these responders have reported least one new or worsened upper airway
      respiratory symptom when examined in 2004 with 50% of responders continuing to have symptoms
      of chronic rhino-sinusitis or upper airway disease (UAD) in 2007. In addition, about 50% of
      those with UAD referred to our sleep center reported new onset snoring on their
      questionnaires immediately following their exposure and had unusually high prevalence of
      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) that did not appear to be related to obesity, which is the
      usual risk factor for OSA. This suggests to us that mechanisms other than obesity may be
      important in the pathogenesis of OSA in these subjects. Given their chronic nasal symptoms
      they also provide a unique opportunity to examine the relationship between nasal pathology
      and OSA and test if nasal symptoms reported by the subjects in the WTC Health Program (WTCHP)
      are an indicator of increased nasal resistance due to nasal inflammation resulting from
      exposure to the WTC dust. Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) is the standard therapy for OSA but
      despite its efficacy has poor adherence. Subjects with high nasal resistance (such as
      responders with UAD and OSA) may experience additional pressure during expiration at the
      upper airway resulting in greater difficulty in tolerating CPAP therapy than those who do not
      have high nasal resistance. Reduction of excess expiratory positive pressure by the modality
      known as Cflexâ„¢ during CPAP therapy (CPAPFlex) may improve comfort and adherence in these
      subjects without compromising CPAP efficacy. In the present proposal we will study responders
      enrolled at the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute of Robert Wood
      Johnson Medical School (RWJMS) and the NYU School of Medicine Clinical Center of Excellence
      at Bellevue Hospital
