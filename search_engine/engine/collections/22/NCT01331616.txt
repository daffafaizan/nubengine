      bevacizumab (Avastin), by undergoing a baseline visual examination with Visual evoked
      Potentials testing. This will allow testing of the patient's optic nerve function
      bilaterally. Patients will then begin their normally scheduled treatment with avastin, and
      other chemotherapeutic agents, as well any radiation treatments scheduled. Once patients have
      completed their treatment with avastin for 6-8 weeks, they will then undergo their second
      Visual Evoked Potential testing, with both studies then being compared for any changes within
      the optic nerves. Patients will also be recommended to have stringent follow up with an
      Ophthalmologist to include confrontational visual field testing, external and anterior
      segment examination, and dilated fundus examination. The investigators main objective is to
      assess whether or not bevacizumab causes a direct toxic effect on patient's optic nerves
      leading to an acute/subacute optic neuropathy.
