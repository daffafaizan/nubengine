      systolic function evaluation from echocardiographic examinations. LVivoEF technology is based
      on a novel image processing algorithm for LV edge detection and ejection fraction (EF)
      evaluation. LVivoEF provides fully automated measurements of the left ventricle (LV) from two
      apical views the four chamber (4CH) and the two chamber (2CH).
