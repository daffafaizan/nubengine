      reactions tends to be severe and produce significant permanent and delayed side effects.
      Evidence suggests that the use of a prone breast IMRT technique has the potential to decrease
      the risk of moist desquamation in large breasted women to the levels that are now seen when
      average/smaller breasted women are treated with supine IMRT. As prone breast XRT is currently
      only offered at 6 of 15 of the Ontario Cancer Centres polled for the purposes of providing
      motivation for this study, a multicentre RCT is feasible to confirm and quantify the
      improvement provided by the prone technique and provide Level 1 evidence for it to be adopted
      world-wide.
