      If eligible, the patient will receive NL-201 treatment by vein. Tumor response to treatment
      will be assessed every 6 weeks for 12 weeks, and every 12 weeks thereafter until disease
      progression.

      Patients will be able to receive study treatment as long as it is tolerated and there is
      evidence of clinical benefit. Safety follow- up will occur within 7 days after the last dose
      of NL-201. Patients will then enter long-term follow-up until starting a subsequent therapy.
