    
      The HeartMate II (HM II) LVAD is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for
      use in destination therapy (DT) patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IIIB/IV
      symptoms.

      The ROADMAP trial is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, controlled, observational
      study that is designed to evaluate the effectiveness of HM II LVAD support versus optimal
      medical management (OMM) in ambulatory NYHA Class IIIB/IV heart failure patients who are not
      dependent on intravenous inotropic support and who meet the FDA approved indications for HM
      II LVAD destination therapy. Subjects will be enrolled in one of two cohorts: OMM or LVAD.
      Together with the investigator, the subjects will decide which cohort to enter into at their
      baseline visit. This study will include experienced HM II LVAD implant centers as well as
      community centers that care for a large volume of heart failure patients. Study patients will
      be followed for up to 24 months post enrollment for survival, quality of life and functional
      status.
