      analgesia (IVPCA) with morphine. Multimodal analgesia could improve the quality of
      perioperative pain control and reduceside effects of opioids. Previous researches marked that
      perioperative pain after cesarean section includes somatic wound pain and visceral uterine
      contraction pain.

      According to Academy of Breastfeeding Medicine, propacetamol is a safe pain-killer for an
      expectant mother and almost free from breast milk after intravenous injection. This study is
      a prospective double-blind randomized-controlled trial to evaluate that propacetamol could
      reduce visceral uterine contraction pain after cesarean section. Post cesarean section women
      will divide into three groups:

        1. pain control with IVPCA for 2 days

        2. pain control with IVPCA and propacetamol 1g every 6 hours for 2 days

        3. pain control with IVPCA and propacetamol 2g every 6 hours for 2 days
