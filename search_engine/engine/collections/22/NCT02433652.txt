    
      There are 4 types of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), each capable of
      causing dengue illness ranging from a mild illness to life-threatening disease. This study
      will evaluate a trivalent live attenuated dengue admixture vaccine that contains 3 different
      monovalent dengue vaccine candidates, representing 3 of the 4 dengue serotypes (DENV-1,
      DENV-3, and DENV-4). Study researchers will evaluate the safety and protective efficacy of a
      single dose of the trivalent dengue vaccine against viremia and rash induced by infection
      with an attenuated DENV-2 virus (rDEN2Δ30-7169), administered 6 months after the trivalent
      dengue vaccine.

      This study will enroll healthy adults with no history of previous flavivirus infection. At
      Day 0 (study entry), participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the trivalent
      dengue vaccine admixture or placebo. On Day 180, all participants will receive the
      rDEN2Δ30-7169 vaccine. Study visits will occur on Days 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21, 28, 56,
      90, 150, 180, 184, 186, 188, 190, 192, 194, 196, 201, 208, 236, 270, and 360. Visits will
      include physical examinations and blood collection. All participants will record their
      temperature 3 times a day for 16 days after each vaccination.
