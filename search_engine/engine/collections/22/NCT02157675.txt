      a minimum 7-day washout period in which no test product is administered. Subjects will then
      crossover to a second 19-day treatment period to complete the study. Subjects receive test
      product (polyherbal capsule or placebo capsule) daily during the treatment periods. Two
      exercise test sessions followed up to 5 days will occur during the study using a modified
      seated arm-curl bench. Muscle strength is assessed on each day of the 5-day exercise test
      period. Safety is assessed during the study by collecting adverse events (AEs), clinical
      laboratory data (serum hematology and chemistry), and vital signs (blood pressure, pulse,
      respiration rate, temperature).
