    
      This study will be conducted in 2 phases: a dose-escalation phase corresponding to Part 1 and
      a dose-expansion phase articulated in 2 concomitant parts (i.e., Parts 2a and 2b).

      All parts of this study are single arm and open label. In all parts, tumor assessments will
      be performed at screening and every 3 cycles thereafter, while the subject remains on study.
      U3-1565 clinical activity will be assessed measuring tumor response by physical examination
      and imaging according to RECIST version 1.1, if applicable.
