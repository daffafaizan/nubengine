    
      Helicobacter pylori (HP), a bacterium present in many people's stomachs, is one of the major
      causes of ulcers and cancers. Up to 20% of patients infected with HP may develop peptic
      ulcers. However, failure rate is rising due to multiple resistant HP infection. The
      eradication rate of first line clarithromycin based therapy has fell to below 80% and
      increasing number of patients also failed the second line quadruple therapy. The aim of this
      clinical trial is to compare the efficacy and tolerability of H. pylori eradication with a
      10-day quadruple therapy versus sequential therapy as empirical first and second line
      treatment.

      Methods: Eligible H. pylori positive patients were randomized to receive either QUAD
      (esomeprazole 20mg twice daily, bismuth subcitrate 120mg four times daily, tetracycline 500mg
      four times daily and metronidazole 400mg four times daily) for 10 days or SEQ (esomeprazole
      20mg twice daily for 10 days, amoxicillin 1g twice daily for first 5 days, clarithromycin
      500mg twice daily and metronidazole 400mg four time daily for the subsequent 5 days). All
      patients returned 8 weeks after completing the treatment for a Urea Breath Test (UBT) to
      confirm eradication. Patients who failed their respective therapy were crossover to receive
      the alternative regimen.
