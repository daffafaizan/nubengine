      interval of 3 months each. The post intervention questionnaire regarding knowledge, attitude
      and practices was planned filled at the end of the programme i.e. 9th to 12th month from
      start of the programme. A community based tobacco cessation programme, which has the
      potential of being first of its kind, for women, was planned by the department of Preventive
      Oncology for the women in a geographical community in and around Mankhurd in Mumbai,for
      providing tobacco cessation counseling services. Doorstep services were provided to these
      women as they were unlikely to avail the tobacco cessation services at the clinic in TMH
      since their priority is managing household chores and caretaking of their family. The
      selected community was a part of women cancer screening programme namely; Tata Memorial
      Hospital Mobile Outreach Programme (TMH-MOP). The women who were current tobacco users at the
      time of screening under TMH-MOP were enrolled for this study.The women were intervened thrice
      at an interval of 3 months each and tobacco cessation counseling was provided at each
      intervention. The post intervention data was collected at the end of all the 3 counseling
      sessions. Sessions were held for rapport building with the participant women. Questionnaire
      were filled to record the information on the details of different forms of tobacco usage,
      factors responsible for initiation and continuation of tobacco use, pre-intervention and
      post-intervention knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding tobacco habits and severity of
      tobacco use (Fagerstroms scale). This programme was aimed at creating awareness and educating
      women regarding the health hazards of tobacco use, at the community level, at their door
      step.
