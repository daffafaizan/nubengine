    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of Digital Cognitive Behavior
      Therapy for Insomnia (dCBTI) in reducing severity of depression and also in preventing the
      incidence and relapse of depression among insomniacs. dCBTI is an online form of Cognitive
      Behavioral Therapy (CBT) used with people who experience trouble sleeping at night
      (insomniacs). This study will allow us to determine whether this form of digital therapy is
      helpful in reducing the severity of depression and in preventing the development and relapse
      of depression in people suffering from insomnia.

      Participants will be recruited from several well-developed sources, including the HFHS Sleep
      Center Clinical database. Once a participant meets inclusion criteria and provides consent, a
      link to the internet portal will be provided to complete the remaining survey questions.
      After completion of this assessment, participants will be automatically randomized to one of
      2 active online insomnia treatment conditions. Each treatment involves 6 weekly "sessions"
      which each take up to 20 minutes to complete.

      A post-treatment questionnaire immediately following the 6-week treatment phase will be
      completed. In addition, a follow up questionnaire assessment will be completed approximately
      1 year after treatment. Each of the 3 separate questionnaires will take 20-30 minutes to
      complete. Participants will be compensated.
