    
      ATARI is a multi-centre, open-label, multiple two-stage parallel cohorts phase II clinical
      trial for patients with relapsed gynaecological cancers, with ARID1A-deficient ('loss') and
      "no loss."

      The trial tests the ATR inhibitor drug AZD6738 and a PARP inhibitor drug olaparib to assess
      the response in groups of patients selected based on their cancer cell subtype and the
      presence of an abnormality in ARID1A.

      The treatment groups are: 1A - Women with clear cell subtype with (ovarian/uterus) ARID1A
      loss treated with AZD6738. 1B - Women with clear cell subtype with (ovarian/uterus) ARID1A
      loss treated with AZD6738 + olaparib. 2 - Women with clear cell subtype (ovarian/uterus) with
      no ARID1A loss treated with AZD6738 and olaparib. 3 - Women with other rare gynaecological
      cancers (carcinosarcoma, cervical, endometrioid type) irrespective of ARID1A loss treated
      with AZD6738 and olaparib.
