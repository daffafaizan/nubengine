      configurations on modulating the somatosensory/nociceptive system.

      This is done to investigate the hypothesis, that different stimulation protocols can be used
      to modulate the somatosensory and nociceptive system, as shown in the previous studies, but
      that it is necessary to uncover the most efficient way to do so.

      The study uses a double-blinded, sham-controlled, longitudinal design, where quantitative
      sensory testing will be used to assess the somatosensory function of the participants before
      and after a receiving a specific configuration of HD-tDCS on three consecutive days.
