      bare metal and covered stents to treat native and recurrent aortic coarctation in selected
      children, adolescents and adults. The investigation will have two phases: Phase One will
      examine the safety and efficacy of the bare metal stent, and will collect information about
      the covered stent when used as rescue therapy for aortic injuries occurring during bare metal
      stent procedures.

      The aims of the Phase One study are to assess the use of the CP bare metal stent to:

        1. provide a reduction equivalent to surgery in arm-leg systolic cuff blood pressure
           gradient 12 months after dilation and stent implantation, in comparison to the
           pre-dilation gradient;

        2. accomplish gradient relief with a shorter number of days in hospital than surgery;

        3. accomplish gradient relief with a rate of occurrence of serious procedure-related
           adverse events occurring within 30 days of dilation that is equivalent to surgery; and

        4. accomplish gradient relief with a rate of occurrence of post-procedural paradoxical
           hypertension that is lower than surgery.
