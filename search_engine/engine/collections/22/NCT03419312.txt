      Tonic spinal cord stimulation for chronic primarily neuropathic pain har been used for over
      50 years. Tonic stimulation in frequencies from 20 to 70 Hz produces analgesia and
      paresthesia in the targeted area.

      Burst stimulation, a novel spinal cord stimulation pattern, is an intermittent high frequency
      parenthesis-free therapy. This stimulation pattern consist of 5 spikes with an inter-spike
      frequency of 500 Hz, delivered at 40 Hz.

      Clinical effectiveness and noninferiority of Burst stimulation has been proved. A few studies
      suggest that Burst stimulation induce different activities in cerebral pathways, compared
      with tonic stimulation. Patient reported attention to pain assessed by the pain vigilance and
      awareness questionnaire (PVAQ) seems to differ between burst and tonic spinal cord
      stimulation. This trial is designed to investigate cerebral mechanisms of burst stimulation,
      using PET O15-water measured blood flow and tissue perfusion as a proxy for cerebral
      activity.

      Key events in study implementation:

      Study phase 1

        -  Study Inclusion and baseline visit.

        -  Implantation of spinal cord stimulation system.

      Study phase 2:

        -  Study visit 1(study day 0): Collection of Patient Reported Outcome Measurements (PROM)
           data, Randomization to study sequence, blood sampling, PET 0, programming of SCS-system.

        -  Study visit 2 (study day 14): Blood sampling, PET 1, collection of PROM-data, SCS system
           switched off for washout.

        -  Study visit 3 (study day 21): Collection of PROM-data, programming of SCS-system, blood
           sampling.

        -  Study visit 4 (study day 35): Blood sampling, PET 2, collection of PROM-data,
           programming of SCS-system.
