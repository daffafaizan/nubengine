      select a dose(s) and regimen(s) that may be used in future clinical development. Study
      evaluations will include safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and efficacy evaluations
      (Disease Assessments). Adverse events will be evaluated throughout the study. The study is
      divided into 4 periods: a screening phase, a pharmacokinetic run-in phase, a treatment phase,
      and a post treatment follow-up phase. An end-of-treatment visit will be completed less than
      or equal (<=) 30 days (+7 days) after the last dose of study drug or prior to the start of a
      new anticancer therapy, whichever comes first.
