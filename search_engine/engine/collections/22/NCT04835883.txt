      can affect virtually every organ. A subset of SLE patients continues to suffer significant
      morbidity and mortality from active disease, with visceral organ involvement. Therefore, it
      is urgent to develop a more effective therapy for SLE disorder, especially for
      treatment-refractory patients.

      Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells are known to be effective in modulating immune
      cells such as T lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, and Neutral Killer (NK) cells
      and treating acute Graft-Versus-Host Disease (GVHD). Also, based on the anti-inflammatory and
      immunomodulatory properties, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells have been widely
      studied as a candidate for the treatment of refractory immune- and inflammation-mediated
      disease, and have extensive experience of use.

      Half-matched allogeneic bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells, the active ingredient of
      CS20AT04 Injection, not only have the potential to differentiate into various mesenchymal
      cells but also have various immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects, and thus are
      expected to induce and maintain remission of lupus nephritis and lupus cytopenia.

      This study is designed to investigate the following. Subjects enrolled into the CS20AT04 with
      corticosteroid taper regimen arm will receive two infusions of CS20AT04(2.0Ã—10^6cell/kg), on
      0 day and on 12 weeks post-enrollment. Subjects will return for efficacy and safety
      assessments on 3 days, 1 week, and every 4 weeks each post-infusion until Week 24. Safety
      monitoring will be continued at 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years post-infusion.
