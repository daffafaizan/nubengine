      in humans under two strictly controlled dietary conditions, high unsaturated fat and high
      carbohydrate, in 20 individuals with low HDL cholesterol and overweight or obesity. The
      participants will be given the controlled diets for 4 weeks in a randomized crossover design.
      They will be admitted to the Brigham & Women's Hospital Center for Clinical Investigation
      (CCI) the morning of Day 28 when they will be infused intravenously with a stable isotope
      tracer, trideuterated (D3), leucine for 10 minutes as a bolus. Blood will be sampled in the
      hospital through 24 hours, and thereafter at the ambulatory clinical center throughout 94
      hours. HDL subtypes will be prepared in Dr. Sacks's laboratory at Harvard School of Public
      Health (HSPH) and analyzed for content of lipids and proteins, and for incorporation of the
      tracer into apolipoprotein A-I, the principal protein of HDL. These data will be studied by
      interactive modeling to a multi-compartment model of human HDL physiology that best fits the
      observed data. The model will yield HDL metabolic rates during unsaturated fat and
      carbohydrate-rich diets which will be tested for statistical significance.
