      motherhood. Different types of professional recommendations have been used to support the new
      mother in this process.

      Randomised studies have shown that postnatal support can influence the breastfeeding duration
      positively. Various studies has offered different kinds of interventions with home visits
      and/or telephone calls as the generally used approach, but the proper follow-up on the
      breastfeeding support in the postnatal period after the mother leaves the hospital is not yet
      clear.
