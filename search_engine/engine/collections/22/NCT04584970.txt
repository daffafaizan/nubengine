    
      Purpose: To evaluate postoperative pain scores and postoperative opioid use in pediatric
      idiopathic scoliosis surgical patients using virtual reality (VR) as a method of immersive
      distraction compared with standard electronic use postoperatively.

      Participants: Patients age 11-17 undergoing idiopathic scoliosis surgery on Enhanced Recovery
      After Surgery (ERAS) spine protocol at our institution.

      Procedures (methods): Participants will be randomized to intervention arm (VR) or control arm
      (iPad). Baseline pain and anxiety scores will be assessed. On postoperative day 1, each
      patient will receive a visit by the research assistant who will assess pain scores, PCA use,
      etc. The intervention group will be offered a VR device for up to 30 minutes. The control
      group will be offered an iPad for up to 30 minutes. This visit will be performed twice on
      postoperative day 1. Follow up survey will be conducted at 48-72 hours and 7-10 days
      postoperatively.
