    
      The main objective of this interventional, monocentric, transverse, nonrandomized and
      prospective study is to assess the concordance of step counting between connected soles and
      video, in elderly subjects hospitalized in Follow-up and rehabilitation care, at Paul Brousse
      hospital, having recovered maximum walking capacities of participants, on 10 meters.

      After inclusion, following data will be collected : Measure blood pressure, heart rate,
      neurological and cardiological exam, pneumological exam, Short Physical Performance Battery
      Score

      Feetme connected soles comply with European standards (CE label no. 29762). The study will
      consist of 10-metre walk for patient during a rehabilitation session :

        -  By wearing the soles connected to patient's size (in patient's usual shoes). The
           recording of data will be triggered by an investigator, via an application downloaded on
           a smartphone. The application will trigger and stop the registration of soles.

        -  While being filmed by a camcorder mounted on a tripod (excluding the face) for
           footsteps.

      The test will be filmed (excluding the face) to avoid a measurement bias in counting steps.
      Two physician observers will view each patient's film in a second time in order to perform
      the step count.

      Before starting the walk, an on-site observer will ensure that the footings are set to 0 for
      counting step and that the recording is stopped after 10 metres.

      If this is deemed possible by the referring physiotherapist, the same protocol will then be
      carried out over 30 meters (new test: the patient who can do it will perform 40 meters in
      total (10 meters then test of 30 meters).
