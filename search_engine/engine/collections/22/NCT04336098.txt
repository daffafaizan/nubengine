    
      A Phase 1, open-label, first-in-human, SRF617 monotherapy and combination therapy dose
      escalation, safety, and tumor biopsy expansion study in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      The monotherapy dose escalation portion of the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics, and preliminary efficacy of SRF617 as monotherapy in
      patients with advanced solid tumors. The monotherapy tumor biopsy expansion portion of the
      study will further evaluate the safety and intratumoral pharmacodynamics of SRF617
      monotherapy. The combination therapy dose escalation portion of the study will evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, PK, and preliminary efficacy of SRF617 in combination with gemcitabine
      + albumin-bound paclitaxel, or SRF617 in combination with pembrolizumab, in patients with
      locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.
