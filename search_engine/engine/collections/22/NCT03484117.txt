    
      Overview:

      Participants will be HIV-infected Hispanic immigrants age ≥18 years. Participants will be
      recruited from Partners-affiliated infectious disease and primary care clinics as well as
      clinics and community-based organizations in the Greater Boston area with high contact with
      HIV-infected Hispanics. In the intervention, a bilingual (English-Spanish speaking) community
      health worker (CHW) will deliver personalized sessions framed around a Spanish-language
      multi-media health communication tool. The CHW will deliver the intervention over a 16 to 24
      week period.

      Study procedures:

      Participants will be HIV-infected Hispanic immigrants age ≥18 years at risk for inconsistent
      attendance (as measured during study screening). Participants will be recruited via provider
      referral, peer referral, flyers, and social media. Once an individual expresses interest in
      the study, a study staff member will screen that individual to assess eligibility.
      Individuals who are eligible will be invited to enroll through an informed consent process
      and complete a baseline survey. After completion of the baseline survey, study staff will
      randomize participants into a treatment as usual (TAU) group or intervention group. At trial
      exit, all participants, including the TAU group, will complete an in-depth assessment to
      measure their barriers to HIV care and provide feedback about their experience in the study.
