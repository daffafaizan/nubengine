    
      Methods: Double-blinded, four-armed randomised controlled trial with 3.0 g/d of either n-3
      long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFA) or gamma linolenic acid (GLA), resp. the
      combination of 1.5 g/d of each, resp. 3.0 g/d of olive oil over 12 weeks. Outcome parameters
      disease activity score (DAS28), C-reactive protein, concentrations of n-3 LC-PUFA, resp. GLA
      in plasma lipids (PL), cholesterol esters (CE), and erythrocyte membranes (EM), and serum
      concentrations of arachidonic acid (AA). Conventional antirheumatic and immunosuppressive
      therapies could be changed only within defined limits.
