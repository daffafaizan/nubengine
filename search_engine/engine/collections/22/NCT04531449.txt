    
      This observational study has been designed to evaluate the ability of healthcare providers to
      use the Inflammacheck™, an investigational medical device, to measure participants exhaled
      breath condensate (EBC) H2O2. The data will be used to support the CE marking of the
      Inflammacheck™ device.

      A measure of the participants' EBC H2O2 will be measured on the Inflammacheck™ device to
      demonstrate usability and comprehension of the instructions for use.

      There are no control measurements involved in the study, all of the participants' EBC H2O2
      measurements will be performed using Inflammacheck™ only.

      Only healthcare providers naïve to the Inflammacheck™ device will be eligible to take part in
      the assessment of usability. This is to ensure that the usability assessment will not be
      biased by prior knowledge of the device or its instructions. The only training provided will
      be an introductory presentation explaining the Clinical Investigation objectives.

      The total time for participant involvement is one session comprising of:

        -  Information & consent

        -  EBC H2O2 measurement with Inflammacheck™
