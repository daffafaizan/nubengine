      the drug has not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

      Rapamycin, the active part of the drug, inhibits a biological pathway (mTOR) that certain
      cancers use to grow. Rapamycin and similar types of drugs have been used in many other
      tumors, including advanced renal cell carcinoma. A standard mTOR inhibitor used in
      neuroendocrine tumors is everolimus. The human albumin component of ABI-009 may allow
      rapamycin to reach cancer cells more effectively.

      ABI-009 has not been approved for the treatment of advanced, malignant neuroendocrine tumors
      of the lung, gastrointestinal tract and/or pancreas. The information from this study might
      help us identify if ABI-009 is safe and effective in this disease.
