           of demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS). MRI findings suggest that we
           should look at gray matter atrophy as a marker of the disease process in MS.

        -  Avonex is a proven effective disease-modifying treatment, which reduces total brain and
           GM atrophy and should be considered first-line therapy in patients with RRMS and CIS.

        -  The original SET study is an open-label observational study of high risk subjects after
           CIS for development of CDMS that will enroll 220 patients who have started Avonex
           immediately after their first clinical attack in Czech Republic, and are followed with
           clinical and MRI examinations for 4 years at 0, 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 months. The
           clinical and MRI acquisition examinations of this study are conducted in Czech Republic.
