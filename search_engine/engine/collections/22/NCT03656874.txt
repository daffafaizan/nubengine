      number of patients who are referred for tobacco cessation counseling. The study team will
      evaluate the effectiveness of clinical decision support (CDS) to improve dental provider
      delivery of brief tobacco interventions and referrals to tobacco quitlines for further
      tobacco counseling. The CDS will generate personalized, evidence-based recommendations for
      dentists and dental hygienists to actively engage their smoking patients in the course of
      usual dental care. Subsequently, the study team will assess the tobacco cessation actions of
      smokers using patient-centered outcomes.
