    
      Participants and Method:

      Year 6 medical students who attend a one-month full-time course in an Internal Medicine
      Department are eligible.

      Since no consultations in the ambulatory setting are currently structured for medical
      students, the following adjustments have been done within the internal medicine consultation
      department, with the approval of the department director:

        -  the consultation duration has been increased (1 hour instead of 30 minutes)

        -  during the first 30 minutes, consultation is performed by the participant

        -  during the following 30 minutes, the patient is examined by his/her own physician.

        -  The consent of the patient has been obtained by phone (prior to the consultation).
