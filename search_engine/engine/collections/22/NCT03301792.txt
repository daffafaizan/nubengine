      compared to traditional prenatal care, will improve, 1.) glycemic control and, 2.) postpartum
      weight retention in women with type 2 and gestational diabetes. The objective of this
      proposal is to conduct a randomized trial in two phases to determine the effect of Diabetes
      Group Care (GC) on glycemic control in pregnant women with T2DM and GDM (Antepartum Phase)
      and the impact on postpartum weight retention (Postpartum Phase).
