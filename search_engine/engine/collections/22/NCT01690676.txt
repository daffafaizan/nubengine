      study is to test the hypothesis that an orally ingested apple polyphenol extract rich in
      epicatechin and flavan-3-ol oligomers improves brachial artery endothelium-dependent
      vasodilation function (FMD) in volunteer subjects with borderline hypertension. FMD and
      endothelium-independent nitrate-mediated vasodilatation (NMD) of the left brachial artery
      will be investigated with ultrasonography at the start and end of both treatment periods.
      Biomarkers of vascular function and epicatechin (and metabolite) concentrations will be
      determined from blood samples taken at the start and end of both treatment periods. Diet
      diary data will be collected for the evaluation of the possible effects of diet on the study
      results. Adverse events data will be collected throughout the study. Safety laboratory
      determinations will be performed at the last visit of both treatment periods.
