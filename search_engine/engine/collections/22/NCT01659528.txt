      connected to disorders in other organs, as part of genetic syndromes or endocrine disorders.
      Micropenis is a disorder, which is important to diagnose in the womb. Micropenis is defined
      as a penis which is measured 2.5 standard deviation below average. It is also thinner by
      diameter. This finding can also be the first expression of a lethal hormonal deficiency,
      hence the reason for early detection by ultrasound during pregnancy.

      Past prenatal diagnosis ultrasound studies, measured the penis from the scrotum to the tip of
      the penis. Another study evaluated formalin fixated fetuses after pregnancy terminations, in
      which the penis was measured from the abdominal wall to the tip of the penis. To date there
      are no nomograms for penile length, via ultrasound measurement from abdominal wall or for
      penile width. The investigators assume that measuring the penis from the abdominal wall is
      more accurate and standard than from the end of the scrotum, which is a less definitive
      reference point.

      The investigators aim to establish nomograms of penile length throughout the weeks of
      pregnancy. Exceptional penile width can also point out a problem with male genitalia.
      Therefore the investigators wish, as well to establish nomograms of penile width.
