        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gefitinib when administered with docetaxel in
           patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gefitinib.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1 and 2 and docetaxel IV over 1 hour on
      day 3. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gefitinib until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-42 patients will be accrued for this study.
