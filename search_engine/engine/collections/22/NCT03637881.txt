      The initial screening visit will provide subject with the informed consent document and
      determine subject eligibility through anthropometric measurements, vital signs, and
      completion of an eating habits questionnaire.

      If willing and eligible to participate, subjects will be invited to participate in the study
      for 1 Study Day that participants can choose to continue on to after the Screening visit.

      Subject will arrive at the center in fasted for at least 2 hours or longer. During the Study
      Day, each participant will be asked to participate in two activities. In the first activity,
      participants will be presented with eight differently-labeled milk cartons, each accompanied
      by a fixed price label, and asked to answer questions regarding consumption. In the second
      activity, participants will be presented with the same setup from the first activity,
      however, the price labels for each product is varied according to real market prices for each
      product. In this activity, participants will be asked to answer questions regarding
      purchasing. Following these two activities, participants will then be asked to answer a
      questionnaire on consumer choice for dairy and non-dairy milk.
