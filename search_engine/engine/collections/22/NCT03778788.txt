      application (MetS app) vs using booklet for MetS adults living in the community.

      Methods A multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) with three arms, namely, MetS app
      group (Group A), booklet group (Group B), and control group (group C). Three hundred and
      sixty subjects will be recruited from six community centers and randomized into either one
      arm. Inclusion criteria are those MetS adult, able to use a smart phone. Group a participants
      will receive a 30-minute educational session and a MetS app while Group B will receive same
      educational session and a MetS booklet and the control group receive a placebo booklet only.
      The MetS app or booklet, has been well developed by the team with the support of internal
      grant, aims to support MetS individual's self- monitoring and record of health measures (body
      weight, blood pressure, waist circumference) and exercise. The primary outcomes of this study
      include the body weight and total physical exercise (GSLTPAQ). The secondary outcomes include
      cardiometabolic risk factors, cardiovascular endurance, self-efficacy for exercise (SEE) and
      stress level (PSS-10). Data will be collected at baseline (T1), 4 week (T2) and week 12 (T3)
      and week 24 (T4). SPSS and Generalized Estimating equations (GEE) model will be employed for
      data analysis.

      Significance This study will provide empirical evidence and inform about the effective way to
      enhance patient's self-management of MetS, exercise sustainability that will be beneficial to
      clients' health.
