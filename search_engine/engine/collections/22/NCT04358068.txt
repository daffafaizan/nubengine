    
      This Phase IIB study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and
      azithromycin (Azithro) to prevent hospitalization or death in symptomatic adult outpatients
      with COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive active or placebo study treatment. The target
      sample size was 2000 participants, with approximately 1000 in each arm. Stratification was by
      "high" versus "low" risk of progression to severe COVID-19, where "high risk" was defined as
      a person age â‰¥60 years or having at least one of several specified comorbidities.

      Participants were prescribed study treatment for 7 days and were to be followed for an
      additional 24 weeks. Assessments on a subset of participants were planned to include blood
      collection, self-collected nasal swabs, and nasopharyngeal swabs.

      On June 23, 2020, sites were informed that the study was closing to follow-up due to slow
      enrollment and lack of community enthusiasm. Follow-up through week 24 was not completed for
      any participant. Participants were asked to complete the Day 20 visit and then were
      discontinued from the study. Due to the early termination, enrollment into the specimen
      collection subset did not occur, and results associated with those specimens are not
      available. Due to the small number of participants enrolled, some statistical tests were not
      able to be performed and only descriptive results are provided.
