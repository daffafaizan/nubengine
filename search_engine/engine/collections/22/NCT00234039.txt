        -  Determine the 8-12 week efficacy of intravesical gemcitabine, in terms of complete
           response rate, in patients with recurrent superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the
           bladder that have progressed despite prior intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG).

        -  Determine the recurrence-free, worsening-free, progression-free, and overall survival of
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate, preliminarily, expression levels of genes or genetic polymorphisms involved
           in the gemcitabine pathway and angiogenesis with clinical toxicity, response, and
           relapse-free survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive gemcitabine intravesically once a week for 6 weeks
           (weeks 1-6) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
           achieving a complete response proceed to maintenance therapy at week 14.

        -  Maintenance therapy: Patients receive gemcitabine intravesically once in weeks 14, 18,
           22, 26, 30, 34, 38, 42, 46, and 50 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12
      months.
