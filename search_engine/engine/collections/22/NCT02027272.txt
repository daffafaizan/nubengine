      randomized to placebo or steroid. This includes patients with eclampsia encountered
      antepartum prior to 23 weeks gestation, postpartum eclampsia, undelivered patients
      encountered after 33 weeks gestation who would not be candidates for fetal lung maturation
      steroids, or patients not eligible for repeat steroid administration in the 23-34 week
      gestational window. Planned enrollment in this pilot study is up to 30 patients with at least
      12 in each group.
