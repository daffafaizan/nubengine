      affects a patient's physical health, but also adversely affects their mental health.
      Depressed mood is common in MS, and poor mental health in individuals with MS has
      wide-ranging consequences on social relationships and community integration. The
      preponderance of negative emotions and sparsity of positive emotions in MS are attributable
      in part to ineffective emotion regulation strategies. Thus, the clinical trial seeks to
      evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention which instructs individuals on using the social
      regulation of emotion.

      The social regulation of emotion occurs when a one's emotional state benefits from an
      interaction with another person, such as when seeking comfort from a trusted friend. The
      current intervention was designed to leverage existing social relationships for emotional
      support in a manner which should strengthen the perception of social support and also
      reinforce existing relationships. The primary goal of this trial is to examine changes in
      mental well-being after treatment.
