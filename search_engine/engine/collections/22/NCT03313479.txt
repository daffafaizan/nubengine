      postoperative complications including bleeding, wound dehiscence, aspiration pneumonitis, as
      well as fluid and electrolyte imbalances.

      The incidence of PONV after general anesthesia is about 30% in all post-surgical patients but
      up to 80% in high-risk patients despite advances in anesthetics and anesthesia techniques.

      Despite new antiemetic drugs the overall incidences remain high especially in subjects with
      increased patient-related risk-factors such as in female gender, non-smoking status, a
      history of motion sickness or previous PONV, inhalational anesthetics, certain types of
      surgery, and opioid use. Scleral buckling (SB) which is still thought to be the most
      efficacious and cost-effective primary procedure for the treatment of uncomplicated retinal
      detachment is often associated with postoperative pain as well as nausea and vomiting.
      Preoperative injections of local anesthetics via retrobulbar, peribulbar, or subtenon routes
      in patients undergoing vitreoretinal surgery under general anesthesia (GA) have been reported
      to reduce postoperative pain, nausea, and vomiting.

      Topical lidocaine drops have also has been used intraoperatively to decrease the incidence
      and severity of the OCR and to prevent pain and PONV after strabismus surgery and vitrectomy
      without scleral buckling .

      The current study was designed to compare the effect of three different analgesic techniques
      ; IV analgesia , peribulbar block and topical xylocaine jel on the incidence of ponv after
      scleral buckling under general anesthesia.
