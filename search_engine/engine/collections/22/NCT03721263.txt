    
      The plan is to enroll between 38 to 50 subjects at 1 study center.

      The study is divided into 2 parts:

      Part A is designed as a SAD study using intravenous (IV) administration of ASLAN004, as a
      single mg/kg IV dose and will consist of up to 6 IV cohorts.

      Part B is designed as a parallel SAD study using subcutaneous (SC) administration of
      ASLAN004, as a single fixed milligram SC dose and will consist of up to 4 SC cohorts.

      All cohorts will have sentinel dosing with the first subject of each cohort being spaced with
      adequate observation time of 24 to 48 hours before dosing the remaining subjects in the
      cohort.

      All subjects would be follow up for up to 85 days from the last dosing day.
