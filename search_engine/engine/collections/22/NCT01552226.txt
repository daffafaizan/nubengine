      colon and rectal surgery, affecting well being and length of hospital stay. Neuraxial
      anesthetics infused through epidural or spinal catheters have become commonplace pain
      management agents for patients. These techniques, however, are labor-intensive and expensive.
      Alternatively, local analgesics may be administered directly to the surgical wound via silver
      catheters.

      Aim Two standard methods of analgesia for pain control for colon and rectal surgery will be
      evaluated systematically to determine if these two approaches are equivalent in terms of
      patient pain scores and supplemental narcotic use.

      Study Design This is a prospective randomized study of 114 participants undergoing elective
      colon and rectal surgery at an independent academic medical center. The primary outcomes are
      post-operative pain control and supplemental narcotic usage.

      Other variables of interest

        -  Surgical site infections

        -  The post-operative time to return of bowel function

        -  The hospital expenses/cost differences

        -  Quality of life measured with the SF- 36 questionnaire
