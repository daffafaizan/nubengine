      metabolic syndrome and chronic diseases, including, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, obesity,
      and type II diabetes. Current National Institutes of Health statistics estimate that 1 in 6
      Americans have insulin resistance (www.diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/statistics). Insulin
      resistance in humans is associated with glucose intolerance, enhanced oxidative stress,
      inflammation and alterations in lipid profiles. Improvements in glucose tolerance are
      associated with improved insulin sensitivity resulting in improved inflammatory and oxidative
      status. Dietary modification to reduced day-long serum insulin concentration is postulated to
      decrease hepatic cholesterol production through inhibition of HMG CoA reductase, the rate
      limiting enzyme involved in cholesterol synthesis.

      Maintenance of normal blood glucose is dependent on the body's ability to modulate insulin
      secretion in response to the glucose load consumed. Although diet may be an important factor
      in glucose tolerance, the role of nutritive sweeteners has not been clearly defined. Much
      research has been performed on the effect of dietary sugars on chronic disease risk factors,
      including animal studies, and human studies ranging from epidemiologic to controlled feeding
      trials with most of this work focused on the monosaccharides: fructose and glucose or the
      disaccharide, sucrose.

      Little work has been done on the comparative effects of honey and other nutritive sweeteners
      in relation to glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.
