      and violent behavior. Although its etiology is not well understood, risk factors associated
      with the condition include pain and ENT (ear, nose and throat) surgery. Bilateral
      infraorbital and infratrochlear nerve block in patients undergoing septorhinoplasty is
      effective in treating postoperative pain. The investigators have designed this study to
      evaluate the effect of infraorbital and infratrochlear nerve block on emergence agitation in
      patients undergoing septorhinoplasty.
