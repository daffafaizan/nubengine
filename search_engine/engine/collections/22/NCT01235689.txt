      treatment, a 48-week post-randomization treatment period, and a 70 day follow-up phone call
      or clinic visit, for a total duration of up to 69 weeks.

      Participants who met entry criteria were enrolled and initiated an oral prednisone regimen at
      Baseline (Week 0). At the first key visit, participants were randomized into 1 of 2 groups
      (Tight Control group or Clinically Driven group), with stratification according to screening
      smoking status, weight, and disease duration.

      The first key visit was the randomization visit; subsequent key visits occurred every 12
      weeks following the first key visit. Randomization normally took place 9 weeks after
      Baseline. However, participants who fulfilled the early randomization criteria may have been
      randomized as early as the Baseline (Week 0) visit. Therapeutic option changes, if
      appropriate, occurred at key visits based on results from previous success criteria visits.
