      the way it is processed the body changes when it administered with other medications
      (fluconazole or atorvastatin). This study looked at lab results in people who took TAK-385.

      The study enrolled 40 patients. Participants were assigned to one of the two treatment
      groups:

        -  TAK-385 40 mg and fluconazole 400 mg on Day 6 and 200 mg on Days 7 to 14

        -  TAK-385 40 mg and atorvastatin 80 mg on Days 6-14

      Participants in the fluconazole arm were administered TAK-385 on Days 1 and 10 and
      fluconazole on Days 6 through 14. Participants in the atorvastatin arm were administered
      TAK-385 on Days 1 and 10 and atorvastatin on Days 6 through 14.

      This single-center trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was 4 weeks. Participants made multiple visits to the clinic, including one
      16-day period of confinement to the clinic, and a final visit 7 days after last dose of study
      drug for a follow-up assessment.
