      cyanoacrylate injection and BRTO in the treatment of GV with SPSS have different conclusions
      in different studies. Investigators based on that the five-day rebleeding rate of EUS-guided
      coil embolization combined with endoscopic cyanoacrylate injection is 7%, BRTO is 10%. The
      number of people in the two groups are equal, significant level (Î±) is 0.05, and the test
      power is 0.8. Each group requires 35 patients. Because of the 10% loss to follow-up, the
      sample capacity is 39.
