      and heavy VPS impression techniques (Aquasil Putty DECA™ and Aquasil Ultra Light Viscosity
      (LV) Regular Set, Dentsply International Inc, Caulk, USA); to compare two splint materials
      for implants: Primopattern LC gel (Primotec, Bad Homburg, Germany), and Smart Dentin
      Replacement (SDR™, Dentsply International Inc, Caulk, USA); to examine the clinical factors
      affecting the accuracy of implant impressions; to test the tension-free fit of the new
      scanner and software NobelProcera™ (NobelBiocare, AB, Göteborg, Sweden) titanium
      frameworks.The hypothesis to demonstrate is that all impression techniques and used materials
      reduce time for final restoration and improve the accuracy of the impression.
