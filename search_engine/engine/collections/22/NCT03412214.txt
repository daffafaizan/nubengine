      anesthetist with a number of benefits. It is a useful tool to forewarn the clinician of
      possible light planes of anesthesia, allowing for agent dose adjustment. It is a preexisting

      The AEP Monitor/2 (Danmeter A/S, Odense, Denmark), a commercialized system for depth of
      anesthesia monitoring, extracts the middle latency auditory evoked potentials (MLAEP) from
      the EEG-signal by using an autoregressive model with an exogenous input adaptive method
