      aspirin and clopidogrel will be assessed for (1) clinical risks factors for future bleeding
      and ischemic complications, and (2) on-treatment platelet reactivity as measured by the
      VerifyNow P2Y12 assay (Accumetrics, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). These will be considered by
      utilization of a clinical algorithm to determine the dual antiplatelet regimen post-PCI
      (aspirin in combination with 1. clopidogrel, 2. prasugrel 5mg daily, or 3. prasugrel 10mg
      daily).
