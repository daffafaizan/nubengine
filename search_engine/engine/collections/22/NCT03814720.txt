    
      Study Design: This is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the dose,
      safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of VRC-FLUNPF099-00-VP in two regimens. The
      hypotheses are that the vaccine is safe and tolerable and will elicit an immune response. The
      primary objective is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the investigational vaccine
      in healthy adults. Secondary objectives are related to immunogenicity of the investigational
      vaccine and dosing regimen.

      Study Products: The investigational vaccine, VRC-FLUNPF099-00-VP (H1ssF_3928), was developed
      by the Vaccine Research Center (VRC), National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases
      (NIAID) and is composed of Helicobacter pylori non-heme ferritin assembled with influenza
      virus H1 haemagglutinin (HA) insert to form a nanoparticle displaying eight HA stabilized
      stem trimers from A/New Caledonia/20/1999 (H1N1) influenza. The vaccine is supplied in
      single-use vials at a concentration of 180 mcg/mL. H1ssF_3928 will be administered
      intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle via needle and syringe.

      Subjects: Healthy adults between the ages of 18-70 years, inclusive.

      Study Plan: The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of 1 or 2
      doses of the H1ssF_3928 vaccine in a dose-escalation design. In Group 1, five subjects will
      receive a single low dose (20 mcg) of H1ssF_3928 on Day 0. For Group 1, the protocol requires
      1 vaccination visit, about 9 follow-up visits, and a telephone contact after vaccination.

      If the low dose is assessed as safe and well tolerated, enrollment will begin for Group 2A.
      Groups 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D are stratified by age as shown in the vaccination schema. In Group
      2A, subjects will receive a higher dose (60 mcg) of H1ssF_3928 on Day 0. If this higher dose
      is assessed as safe and well tolerated, subjects in Group 2A may receive a second vaccination
      at week 16 and enrollment can begin for Groups 2B, 2C, and 2D. For Groups 2A, 2B, 2C, and 2D,
      the protocol requires 2 vaccination visits, about 11 follow-up visits, and a telephone
      contact after each vaccination.

      For all groups, solicited reactogenicity will be evaluated using a 7-day diary card.
      Assessment of vaccine safety will include clinical observation and monitoring of
      hematological and chemical parameters at clinical visits throughout the study.
