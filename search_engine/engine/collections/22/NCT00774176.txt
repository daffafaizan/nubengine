           might be at higher risk for deadly, debilitating, and costly hospitalizations for
           COPD-and to show that repeat acute exacerbations in high-risk patients can be reduced
           with one simple intervention--access to a 1-800 Temple Call Center phone number where
           patients can get immediate customized advice on managing COPD exacerbations in their
           early stages.

        -  Phase 1: To compare and contrast the influence of race and geographic location in COPD
           exacerbation in relation to severity, comorbidities, treatment patterns, infection rate.
           To identify potential risk factors for COPD exacerbations leading to hospitalization.

        -  Phase 2: To reduce hospitalizations and deaths due to COPD exacerbations and to improve
           patient quality of life, lung function, and everyday activity levels
