      adjuvant chemoradiotherapy improves survival for patients with gastric cancer. This treatment
      is relatively new and there remains debate regarding the optimal chemotherapy regimen and the
      optimal method of radiotherapy delivery. This study will evaluate a new regimen of adjuvant
      chemoradiotherapy for gastric cancer that employs ECF chemotherapy as the systemic component
      given before and after concurrent chemoradiation with continuous infusional 5-fluorouracil.
      Patients receive one cycle of ECF, followed 28 days later by chemoradiotherapy to a radiation
      dose of 45 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks, and then one month later two further cycles of
      ECF are given. All patients are treated using multiple-field conformal radiation techniques.

      The specific objectives of the study are:

        -  To detail the acute toxicity associated with this treatment.

        -  To determine the feasibility of the proposed concurrent chemoradiation regimen.

        -  To determine the feasibility of a standardized technique for radiation treatment
           planning and delivery.

      The study will help to develop a common approach to the adjuvant treatment of gastric cancer,
      which is required before initiating further clinical trials in gastric cancer.
