      of healthy nutrition messages depending on from whom the message is coming. More
      specifically, the researchers aim to examine whether there are differences in how people
      perceive and intend to follow nutrition information that is coming from an unspecified source
      (control), a social media source (health page), a medical source (hospital), and a government
      agency (USDA). The unspecified source will serve as a control, as it is the most neutral
      option (i.e., any other logo would serve as a potential prime for participants' attitudes and
      beliefs). In addition to the manipulation, the researchers will examine whether any personal
      characteristics, such as gender and race, predict trust and perceptions.
