      treatment options for DRE include epileptic surgery and dietary therapy. Classic KD
      (Ketogenic diet) is the most studied dietary therapy but the stringent restrictions and
      practical difficulty makes it difficult to follow. So less restrictive diets like MAD and
      LGIT were introduced. These are reported to have less adverse effects also. But no published
      study has ever been conducted comparing these two diets head to head.
