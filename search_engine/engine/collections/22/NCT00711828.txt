    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess tumor response to R-CyBor-D in patients with relapsed follicular (Gr 1 or 2),
      mantle cell, marginal zone lymphomas, small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL)/chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL) and lymphoplasmacytic (Waldenstrom's macroglobulinemia) lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall survival, progression-free survival, duration of response, and time to
      treatment failure of patients receiving R-CyBor-D.

      II. To describe the adverse event profile (using National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v 3.0) of R-CyBor-D.

      III. To evaluate quality of life for patient reported neurotoxicity using the Gynecologic
      Oncology Group's Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT/GOG) neurotoxicity
      questionnaire, version 4.0.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day 1and cyclophosphamide orally (PO),
      bortezomib IV, and dexamethasone PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for up to 3
      years.
