    
      Catheter ablation is a well-established treatment to treat patients with a wide scope of
      heart arrhythmias.

      The study is an investigator-initiated, retrospective analysis of prospectively collected
      data. The study population consists of patients with right-sided arrhythmias who underwent
      zero-fluoroscopy catheter ablation between the years 2016 and 2018 in 3 centers and a
      propensity score matched patients group of patients who:

        -  underwent conventional fluoroscopy guided catheter ablation without 3D system
           (Ensite/Carto) support

        -  underwent conventional fluoroscopy guided catheter ablation with 3D system
           (Ensite/Carto) support

      Covariates for matching will be:

        -  arrhythmia type

        -  age of a patient

        -  number of diagnostic catheters used during a procedure

        -  type of a diagnostic catheter used during a procedure]
