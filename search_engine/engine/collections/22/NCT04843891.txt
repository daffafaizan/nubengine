      hallmark of many inflammatory diseases and they have diverse roles in tissue responses to
      infection and injury and in tissue repair. As macrophages have a tissue specific and often
      disease stage specific roles, future therapies directed at macrophage subtypes at certain
      points in the course of a disease may be more efficacious and result in less systemic side
      effects, as compared to conventional chemotherapeutics. [64Cu] Macrin is designed to detect
      macrophages by PET imaging. As a result, PET imaging can be used to identify inflammatory
      "hotspots" and quantitate local macrophage density non-invasively. The investigators studies
      in mice showed that [64Cu] Macrin has excellent pharmacological and pharmacokinetic profile
      with high target uptake and low retention in background tissues and organs.

      The investigators wish to first evaluate in healthy human subjects the pharmacological and
      pharmacokinetic profile, and the overall safety of the new radiopharmaceutical [64Cu] Macrin.
      The investigators will then establish the concentration of [64Cu] Macrin in patients
      following myocardial infarct, in sarcoidosis and in cancer patients. In a subset of patients
      where tissue sampling is feasible, we will correlate tracer uptake on imaging to macrophage
      density on histopathology or with additional standard of care imaging studies.
