      the observed improvement in LV ejection performance is due to alterations in intrinsic
      cardiac myocardial contractility and (2) to determine whether changes in LV contractile
      reserve following an infusion of intravenous milrinone can be used to predict a salutary
      response to beta-blockers. The immediate specific objectives of this proposal will be
      addressed in the following two Specific Aims: In Specific Aim 1, we will determine whether
      the observed improvement in LV ejection fraction following treatment with beta-blockers is
      due to changes in intrinsic myocardial contractility, as opposed to changes in LV remodeling
      (i.e. reduction in LV volume) or changes in LV loading conditions. Changes in LV function
      will be evaluated using proven indexes, one an ejection phase index: the relation of
      end-systolic stress (ESS) to the mean velocity of fiber shortening (VCF), considered a
      relatively load independent measure of contractility. Changes in LV structure will be
      evaluated using echocardiography. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine whether the salutary
      response to beta-blockers can be predicted by measuring "contractile reserve", defined as a
      change in contractility determined by the relation of the mean velocity of fiber shortening
      (VCF) to end-systolic stress (ESS) in response to intravenous milrinone infusion at the
      cardiac catheterization lab prior to the institution of beta-blockade. The response to
      treatment with beta-blockers will be assessed by measurement of LV ejection fraction and LV
      end-diastolic volume by echocardiography after 6 months of treatment with beta-blockers, and
      these measurements will be correlated with the respective changes in contractile reserve
      measurement at baseline.
