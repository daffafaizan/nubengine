      gynecology oncologist underscoring the need for increased implementation of telemedicine. In
      consideration of the COVID-19 outbreak, recommendations were made to organize goals of
      therapy by prioritizing curative intent and utilizing telemedicine to manage current
      therapies. Research regarding telemedicine, its benefits, and patient perspectives in other
      specialties has been reported, however there appears to be a dearth of information in the
      field of gynecologic oncology. Our study aims to seek patients' perspective of telemedicine
      and whether implementation for extended office visits, teleconsultations and more are
      feasible and valuable to them.
