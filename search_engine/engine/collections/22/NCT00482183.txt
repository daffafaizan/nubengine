      coronary stenting who were assigned to either the sirolimus-eluting stent group or the
      pioglitazone group. Quantitative coronary angiography will be performed at study entry and at
      six months follow-up to evaluate in-stent late luminal loss and the percentage of the luminal
      diameter and the rate of restenosis. We also analyze major adverse cardiac events at 12
      months.
