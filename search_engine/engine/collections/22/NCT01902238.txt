      clinical practice. Management of pancreatic NET is challenging because most are asymptomatic
      but may have malignant potential, and surgical resection of pancreatic neoplasm is associated
      with substantial morbidity of 20%-40% and a mortality rate of 2%. Management strategy needs
      to be individualized, applying a risk-benefit analysis to each patient. Recently, pancreatic
      tissue ablation by EUS-guided injection of ethanol or other chemotherapeutic agents can be
      performed safely, with few procedure-related complications. Levy et al. demonstrated that
      EUS-guided ethanol ablation for insulinoma was both safe and feasible, and symptomatic
      improvement was achieved in 8 of 8 patients (100%). However, previous study have included
      only a small number of patients and evaluated only short-term outcomes. In addition, lipiodol
      permits the drug to concentrate in the tumor. To obtain an embolic effect and prevent washout
      of the ethanol, ethanol/lipiodol mixture is administered into the tumor. The present study
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of EUS-guided ethanol-lipiodol ablation for the treatment of
      pancreatic NET
