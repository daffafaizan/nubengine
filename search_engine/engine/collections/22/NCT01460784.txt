      to undergo research PET/CT. The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationships
      between Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT), the adiponectin/leptin (A/L) ratio, and components of the
      metabolic syndrome in young adults. This study is part of a larger study aimed at
      understanding the mechanism of brown adipose tissue as a potential protective factor against
      metabolic dysfunction.
