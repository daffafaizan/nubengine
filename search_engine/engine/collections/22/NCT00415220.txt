    
      Context: Operative management of lumbar radiculopathy caused by lumbar disc herniation (LDH)
      in patients refractory to medical management provides rapid and effective symptom relief.
      However, both short and long term benefits of surgery continue to be scrutinized.

      Objective: To compare clinical efficacy of Chiropractic Treatment against Microdiscectomy in
      patients suffering from sciatica secondary to LDH.

      Study Design: Prospective Randomized Controlled Clinical Trial allowing crossover,
      recruitment 2000-2004, 1 year follow-up.

      Setting: Elective primary care physician referrals made directly to neurosurgical spine
      surgeons at the Foothills Hospital and Medical Centre, University of Calgary.

      Patients: Forty consecutive consenting patients with sciatica from LDH refractory to at least
      three months of non-operative care and found appropriate for surgery.

      Interventions: Surgical microdiscectomy or standardized chiropractic treatment. Crossover to
      the alternate treatment allowed after 3 months.

      Main Outcome Measures: McGill Pain Score, Roland Morris Disability Index, Aberdeen Pain
      Scale, and SF-36 General Health Survey before treatment initiation and after 3, 6, 12, 24 and
      52 weeks.
