      evidence-based services. Disruptive behavior problems (DBPs), or conduct problems, in young
      children represent a major public health challenge that is not only highly prevalent but
      also, left untreated, heighten risk for adverse mental health and developmental outcomes in
      adolescence and adulthood. Internet and online technology has considerable potential to help
      achieve such a goal. Building on parenting interventions that have demonstrated impact on
      childhood DBPs, this clinical trial compares an online-delivered intervention to a
      well-validated staff-delivered intervention, holding program content constant. Both
      interventions are based on the Triple P-Positive Parenting Program. The sample includes
      families with a 3-7 year old child who has a pronounced level of DBPs. The study makes use of
      a non-inferiority trial design to determine whether the online-delivered intervention yields
      as good outcomes as the well-established staff-delivered intervention with respect to
      childhood DBPs, parenting, and parent/family stress. The study also includes a value analysis
      comparing the two interventions, accounting for provider and participant expenses as well as
      pre-implementation and implementation phases. This study is intended to shed light on the
      impact and potential benefits of a viable online parenting intervention for childhood
      disruptive behavior problems, but the results from this study are also intended to help the
      mental health field to better understand more broadly the potential advantages and
      disadvantages of online interventions over traditionally delivered interventions,
      particularly in light of expense minimization/effectiveness analysis.
