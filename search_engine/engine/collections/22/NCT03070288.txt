      with no nasal pathologies and respiratory tract infection attending to the outpatient clinic
      of the tertiary referral center. Patient's symptoms were questioned and noted by using Lebel
      Symptom Score Scale. Clinical examination was also done to help diagnose and exclude acute
      respiratory tract infection. All of the patients had positive skin prick test results for at
      least one of the most common aeroallergens. All patients and controls were examined by the
      same 4 mm 0‚Å∞endoscope and light source, and all endoscopic photographs of the septum and both
      inferior turbinates were taken. Each image was marked with standardized points at the
      anterior part of the nasal mucosa on both sides (2 points each right and left sides of the
      anterior septum and 2 points each anterior part of the inferior turbinates). These points
      were numbered 1 and 2 over the right inferior turbinate; 3 and 4 over the right side of the
      anterior septum; 4 and 5 over the left inferior turbinate; 6 and 7 over the left side of the
      anterior septum. Adobe Photoshop Elements 7.0 program was used to measure the numerical
      values of the red-green-blue color components in endoscopic photographs of the nasal mucosa
      on the septum and inferior turbinates.
