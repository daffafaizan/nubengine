      in these patients. Goldmann applanation tonometry is the standard technique to assess the IOP
      but depends on the corneal thickness. Therefore IOP is measured by Goldmann and dynamic
      contour tonometry and corneal thickness is quantified by Orbscan at active uveitis and after
      the keratoprecipitates have disappeared.
