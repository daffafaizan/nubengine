      Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). Eligible subjects were initially enrolled in a 24-week single
      blind (SB) treatment period during which they received XP13512. Subjects who completed the
      initial treatment period and met the responder criteria were then randomized 1:1 to receive
      either XP13512 or placebo during the 12-week double-blind (DB) treatment period. The primary
      study objective was to assess the maintenance of efficacy of XP13512 1200 mg taken once daily
      in the long-term treatment of subjects with primary RLS. The secondary study objectives were
      to assess maintenance of improvements in sleep outcomes and quality of life, and to assess
      the safety and tolerability of XP13512 in the treatment of primary RLS subjects.
