      antibiotics in patients receiving thoracic surgery that results in the placement of a tube
      thoracostomy (chest tube). The rationale for this prophylaxis is that antibiotics directed at
      typical skin flora may reduce the rate of infectious complications, such as surgical site
      infection and empyema.

      Currently, clinicians' approach to post-operative antibiotic prophylaxis in patients
      undergoing tube thoracostomy associated with thoracic and cardio-thoracic surgery varies
      widely. While reducing the infectious complications of thoracic surgery is an important goal,
      it is also important to reduce the use of unnecessary antibiotics. As there is equipoise on
      the benefit of extended antibiotic prophylaxis for tube thoracostomy, our study will examine
      two prevailing clinical practices and attempt to determine if one leads to better patient
      outcomes.
