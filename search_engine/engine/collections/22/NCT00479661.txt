    
      This is a phase III, multi-centre, prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy,
      active comparator study. The study consists of three periods: screening, double-dummy
      treatment and follow-up period.

      All patients admitted to ICU will be pre-screened according to inclusion and exclusion
      criteria prior to informed consent using available clinical data.

      Informed consent, screening and randomisation procedures should be completed within 72 hours
      from the time of admission to ICU and within 48 hours from starting continuous sedation.
      Eligible study subjects requiring light to moderate sedation (Richmond Agitation-Sedation
      Scale [RASS] = 0 to -3) will be randomised to either continue on propofol or switch to
      dexmedetomidine. Patients should not have received any other continuously or regularly
      administered sedative agent than propofol during the last 12 hours except for opioid
      analgesics. Study treatments will be titrated to achieve an individually targeted sedation
      range determined on a daily basis. Rescue treatment (i.e. midazolam boli) may be given if
      needed to achieve the target depth of sedation. Continued need for sedation will be assessed
      at a daily sedation stop, conducted at the same time each day. First sedation stop may be
      12-36 hours from randomisation, depending on the time of day the study subject is randomised.
      The duration of study treatment is limited to a maximum of 14 days from randomisation.
      Following withdrawal of sedation, study subjects will be monitored for 48 hours and contacted
      by telephone 31 and 45 days after randomisation.
