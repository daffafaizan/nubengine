      infusion every 3 weeks. Treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or voluntary withdrawal. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, patients who meet
      criteria for disease progression per RECIST v1.1 while receiving study treatment will be
      permitted to continue the study treatment if they meet all of the following criteria:

        -  Evidence of clinical benefit, as determined by the investigator following a review of
           all available data

        -  Absence of symptoms and signs (including laboratory values, such as new or worsening
           hypercalcemia) indicating unequivocal progression of disease

        -  Absence of decline in ECOG Performance Status that can be attributed to disease
           progression

        -  Absence of tumor progression at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease)
           that cannot be managed by protocol-allowed medical interventions.
