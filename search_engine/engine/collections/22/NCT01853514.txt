      purchasing of fresh produce in the low-income population through a self-report survey
      questionnaire.

      A sample size of 500 subjects is planned. A screening questionnaire will be provided to each
      subject to determine their eligibility to be in the study. The screening questionnaire
      consists of 6 questions related to household income level, grocery shopping frequency,
      employment field, and age. For subjects who are determined to be eligible, they will be asked
      to complete the study survey questionnaire.

      The survey questionnaire consists of 53 questions to assess subject's beliefs and knowledge
      about organic and conventional fresh fruits and vegetables and how their beliefs and
      knowledge affect their purchasing behavior related to organic and conventional fresh produce.
      There are five major categories in the survey to assess different dimensions that influence
      subjects' purchasing decisions regarding fresh produce. The categories are issue awareness,
      purchasing behavior, message framing, credibility, and demographics. Issue awareness is used
      to assess the subjects' previous knowledge, beliefs and attitude towards organic and
      conventional fresh produce. Purchasing behavior is used to understand why subjects purchase
      organic or conventional fresh produce. Message framing is used to determine whether message
      framing has an impact on the self-reported likelihood to purchase organic or conventional
      fresh produce. Credibility is used to find which source subjects trust the most regarding
      fresh produce information. Lastly, demographic information will be obtained to analyze
      characteristic differences.
