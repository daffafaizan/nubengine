      Triage (Control) (62 patients), Group 2; Clinpro XT Varnish/Fuji Triage (Control) (60
      patients), Group 3; Beautifil Flow/Fuji Triage (Control) (60 patients). After clinical
      applications, all samples were evaluated in terms of retention, marginal adaptation, marginal
      discoloration and secondary caries formation using modified USPHS criteria in 6th, 12th and
      18th months. Also samples were evaluated in terms of remineralization effect using the laser
      fluorescence method. Evaluations on occlusal and buccal surfaces were performed separately.
