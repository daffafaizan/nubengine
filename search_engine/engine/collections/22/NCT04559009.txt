    
      The purpose of this registry is to assess the incidence and prevalence of COVID-19 in ALS
      patients, the effect of COVID-19 on ALS disease trajectory, and the impact, if any, of
      edaravone, riluzole and other concomitant medication used in ALS like Albuterol and
      dextromethorphan/quinidine (Nuedexta) on these parameters. COVID-19 incidence and prevalence
      in the ALS population will be assessed through outcomes reporting ranging from recovered
      infections to patient death reported in a patient facing registry.
