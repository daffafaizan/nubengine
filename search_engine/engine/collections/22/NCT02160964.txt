      retrieved. The successful removal of retrievable filters requires diligent patient follow-up
      and interdepartmental cooperation, and even so, successful removal is not always possible.
      American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines for IVCF placement indications
      advocates a close, structured follow-up of retrievable IVCFs to improve filter retrieval
      rates.

      Using a retrieval algorithm and pathway program, a score will trigger a secure email and text
      messages sent to both physician and patient at different timelines, for follow up so as to
      retrieve filter placed.
