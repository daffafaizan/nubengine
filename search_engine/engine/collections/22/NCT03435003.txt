      groups: control vs Nausea specific-intervention group. All subjects will be assessed with a
      nausea specific questionnaire at 1, 4, 12, 24 hours and 3 weeks after surgery. Patient
      satisfaction with recovery will be assessed using specialized questionnaires at baseline, 24
      hrs. and 3 weeks following surgery. Serial assessments of nausea, vomiting, quality of life
      and quality of recovery, will allow the investigators to identify an effect on incidence and
      severity of Post-operative Nausea and Vomiting. Importantly, the investigators will evaluate
      for an impact in patient-reported measures of quality of life.

      The total sample size is 82. This study will provide valuable insight on the epidemiology of
      post-operative nausea and vomiting after hospital discharge following Sleeve gastrectomy,
      which is currently poorly characterized. By allowing the investigators to assess the overall
      incidence of nausea and vomiting at different time points, this study will afford the
      opportunity to identify a time period of high incidence and further adjust our prevention
      efforts accordingly in future studies.
