      including 3D-MRF in differentiating among different brain tumors and differentiating
      recurrent brain tumor (TR) from treatment effects

      Secondary objectives include evaluating the correlation between quantitative MRI imaging with
      histopathological characteristics and genetic markers in pre-therapy setting and with
      treatment response and clinical outcomes in post treatment setting.

      GROUP 1: All patients with newly diagnosed intra-axial brain neoplasms undergo volumetric MRI
      study with contrast for surgical planning or clinical diagnosis. Diffusion, diffusion tensor
      imaging and perfusion imaging are often performed as a part of standard clinical imaging. In
      addition to these acquisitions, the research 3D-MRF acquisition through the entire tumor will
      be acquired. The imaging parameters will be correlated individually and in combination with
      biopsy/ resection outcomes.

      GROUP 2: All patients with brain tumors who present at post therapy follow up with imaging
      progression undergo serial imaging as a part of clinical care. The research 3D-MRF
      acquisitions will be added to these clinical scans. All the quantitative parameters will be
      evaluated individually and in combination to differentiate post treatment changes from tumor
      recurrence.
