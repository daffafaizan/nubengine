      Registry (PE-SCOR). The investigators also wish to determine the incidence of death and
      circulatory and respiratory deterioration, and administration of reperfusion therapy within 5
      days in PE patients. The study will also evaluate the sensitivity, specificity and positive
      and negative predictive values of each RVD assessment option. The investigators will also
      derive a prediction model for PE patients for the primary outcome within five days. Finally,
      investigators will determine the functional outcomes of PE patients 30 days after PE.
