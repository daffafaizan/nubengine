      than avoidance of peanut allergens. There was high unmet medical need for a disease modifying
      treatment for peanut allergy, especially for peanut allergic children, since this age group
      is at highest risk of peanut-related anaphylaxis requiring hospitalization. A chemically
      modified, aluminum hydroxide adsorbed peanut extract (HAL-MPE1) for subcutaneous
      administration has been developed. The safety and tolerability of HAL-MPE1 have been
      established in a First-in-human (FIH) study in adults.
