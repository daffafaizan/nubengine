      levels of selected cytokines involved in cytokine storm of Covid-19 in the Covid-19
      uninfected Jordanian people with vitamin D deficiency. This study was designed to investigate
      whether a high dose of vitamin D3 (50,000 IU) / week for 8 weeks supplementation has a
      potential effect on cytokine storm of Covid-19; such as IL-1 beta, IL-6, and TNF in the
      Covid-19 uninfected Jordanian people with vitamin D deficiency.

      This study aims to assess whether high doses of vitamin D3 may improve immune responses
      against COVID-19 infection in uninfected Jordanian peoples. We hypothesize that Weekly 50,000
      IU vitamin D3 supplements will significantly change immune responses compared with the
      control group.
