      Prior to entering the study, the patient should be informed and provide a written consent. In
      addition, the patient should meet all selection criteria. The Investigator has to check that
      all selection criteria are satisfied. Then the patient undergoes pacemaker implantation,
      receiving a pacemaker model T70 or Selection 9000 (or later version).

      Patients eligible for the study are enrolled and submitted to the evaluation of intra-light
      atrial conduction delay before device implantation. Besides, they are assigned to the group
      with severe RA conduction delay or with normal conduction delay. The randomization of the
      pacing site for both groups depends on the value of right atrial conduction delay, together
      with the associated diseases of the patients, sex and age. After implantation, a
      stabilization phase of 3-5 weeks is required to stabilize the leads: during this period the
      physician can optimize the device parameters. Neither the data regarding AF episodes nor
      cardioversion are collected.

      At the end of the stabilization phase the patient undergoes the 1st study follow-up and
      starts the monitoring period lasting 2 years. Regular follow-ups and data collection are
      scheduled every 6 months.
