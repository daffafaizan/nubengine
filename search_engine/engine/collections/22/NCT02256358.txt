      awakening from anesthesia. A high level of preoperative anxiety is a risk factor for
      emergence agitation using Aono's four-point scale. Midazolam and ketamine was administered to
      the patients to decrease of preoperative anxiety. We aimed to compare the emergence agitation
      between midazolam group and ketamine group.
