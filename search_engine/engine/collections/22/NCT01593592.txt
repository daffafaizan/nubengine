      countries including Egypt with a wide range of morbidity; that requires appropriate
      antimicrobial therapy . However, worldwide the eradication rate following the standard triple
      therapy is declining and this may necessitates introduction of new antimicrobial agents . On
      the sight of bearing in vivo and in vitro activity against H. Pylori, the use of different
      strains of probiotics in treatment of H. Pylori may be thus justifiable, Lactobacillus
      reuteri (L. reuteri) which through different mechanisms including production of reuterin have
      anti H.pylori activity have been tried in improving the eradication rates of H.pylori with
      contradictory results . This study is conducted to test the assumption that addition of L.
      reuteri to the standard triple therapy in treatment of H. Pylori improves the eradication
      rates and clinical aspects in H. Pylori infection.
