      historically underutilized for orthotopic heart transplantation because of the
      post-transplantation risks [1, 2]. The use of HCV antibody-positive (Ab+) donors was
      associated with attenuated survival benefit after heart transplant and increased coronary
      allograft vasculopathy in the era before new highly effective direct-acting antiviral agents
      (DAAs) were developed [3-5]. These DAAs target multiple steps in the HCV replication life
      cycle [6]. Newer, well-tolerated, oral direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) have recently been
      transforming thoracic transplant outcomes after donor-derived HCV transmission. Moreover, now
      that HCV nucleic-acid testing (NAT), a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based approach to
      detecting viral activity, is widely available and used on all US donor organs, transplant
      centers have more relevant information about the donor, allowing better risk assessments.

      As a result, the utilization of HCV NAT+ donor hearts for transplantation is rapidly gaining
      momentum, with the obvious benefits of an enlarged donor pool [7]. Appropriately, clinical
      safety trials are currently underway, including a multicenter effort led by the PI of this
      proposal. Moreover, since the last ~2 years many transplant centers across the nation have
      started transplanting HCV NAT+ donor organs as standard of care. We estimate that the number
      of HCV+ cardiac transplants is quickly outpacing the number of trial participants. Hence, it
      is imperative that safety assessments and risk analyses 'catch up with the real world'.
