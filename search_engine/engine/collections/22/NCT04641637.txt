      transarterial treatment could be crucial in making a significant difference in survival
      outcome (1). Subsegmental chemoembolization (TACE) leading to portal vein visualization is
      associated with a higher chance of complete response (2), and complete response is a robust
      predictor of better overall survival (3). Selective TACE might also help to preserve liver
      function because TACE damages liver parenchyma and repeated TACE could lead to deterioration
      in liver function (4). In a procedure of ultra-selective TACE, each of the arterial tumor
      feeders is supposed to be catheterized for complete treatment of the whole tumor when there
      are multiple tumor feeders (5), it could be time consuming and technically challenging to
      achieve catheterize all the tumor feeders at a sub-subsegmental level when difficult arterial
      anatomy is encountered, even with the guidance of a automated tumor-feeders detection
      software (6). In the angioarchitecture of HCC, arterial tumor feeders lead to tumor sinusoid
      which is an interconnected network of vascular channel within the tumor substance (7). It is
      postulated that all arterial tumor feeders supplying a HCC tumor are interconnected with each
      other through the tumor sinusoid, such that when one of the feeders is catheterized for
      delivery of a liquid embolic agent, the whole tumor sinusoid will be embolized, if the
      arterial blood flow in all the other feeders are stopped temporarily to create a negative
      pressure gradient.
