      clinical outcomes. The objective is to describe how patients with myeloid diseases are
      treated; and to build a knowledge base regarding the effectiveness and safety of first line
      and subsequent treatment regimens in both community and academic settings. Enrolled patients
      will receive treatment and evaluations for their disease according to the standard of care
      and routine clinical practice at each study site. All treatments that patients receive for
      their disease will be recorded, including initial treatment and any subsequent therapy. Data
      on treatment outcomes, including response rates as measured by the treating physician,
      evidence of progression, survival, and patient-reported outcomes will be collected quarterly
      on the electronic CRF.
