      in the General Internal Medicine Offices (GIMO) at Montefiore Hospital. The research will
      enroll patients using the resident clinic, which provides medical care to lower-income
      patients as well as other patients. The study will be limited to new patients or patients
      receiving routine follow-up care.

      Acceptability will be assessed by (i) the proportion of patients completing the screen among
      those approached; (ii) the proportion of screening questions completed; and (iii) the
      proportion of patients willing to complete the screening over the phone (a) by interviewer or
      (b) on via website using Qualtrics.

      The representativeness of the sample will be assessed by comparing the participant sample to
      aggregate clinic demographic characteristics and deidentified Epic EHR indicators using an
      honest broker.

      The survey instrument is the CMS Accountable Care Communities instrument. It includes patient
      indicators (demography) and appraisals of care (e.g., trust) that will allow assessment of
      correlates of social need and acceptability of screening in the clinical setting.
