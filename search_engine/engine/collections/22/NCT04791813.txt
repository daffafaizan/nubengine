      children by the pediatric dental practitioner, evaluation of early treatment results after
      essential surgical repair of cleft lip and palate with respect to arch dimensions is
      fundamental. Although the dental arch dimensions for these children have been evaluated in
      previous studies , few examiners in Egypt handled this issue Due to racial contrasts in
      improvement of the dental arch and growth .The deficiency of data in Egypt tending to this
      insufficient assemble of children presents a gap that prevents the transport of fitting
      dental care to them. This is considered objective to fulfill this gap by spotting the most
      characteristics of dental arch dimensions in surgically repaired UCLP children and compares
      them with those of sound, coordinating, non-cleft.
