    
      During the 2011 German EHEC O104:H4 outbreak, centered in the area of Hamburg, 33 patients
      with EHEC associated hemorrhagic colitis were admitted to the first Department of Medicine of
      the Hamburg University medical centre.

      The first 12 patients were treated symptomatically and received intravenous rehydration up to
      three liters daily.

      Prompted by a good clinical response after whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene
      glycol-solution (PEG)in patient 13 all subsequent admitted patients (n=21) were treated with
      PEG-solution ( 2 liters on admission followed by one liter per day during the clinical
      course).

      During the hospital course blood work was obtained every day and patients were examined for
      clinical symptoms.

      Thrombocytopenia below 100.000/microliter was defined as a threshold for initiating
      therapeutic plasmapheresis to prevent the onset of hemolytic syndrome on an early stage.
