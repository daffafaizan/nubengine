      under three years of age. While a single, short exposure to general anesthesia may not have
      negative effects on behavior or learning, repeated or prolonged anesthetics may affect brain
      development. To that end, minimizing exposure to elective general anesthetics if procedures
      are not clearly indicated in young children appeals to reason.
