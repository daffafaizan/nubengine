      been designed with two primary objectives needed to inform more comprehensive studies at a
      later date. We propose to evaluate the following two primary outcomes: (1) the ability of the
      MolecuLight i:X Imaging Device to predict non healing wounds and wounds at risk or infection
      (control arm) and (2) whether utilization of the MolecuLight i:X Imaging Device in guiding
      clinicians to inspect, sample, debride or further evaluate areas within or around a wound
      where fluorescent bacteria are present (treatment arm) increases wound healing rates relative
      to standard care (control arm) for the treatment of chronic wounds.

      Both arms will receive standard procedures associated with wound care (e.g., sampling,
      debridement, preventative care, infection control, etc.) according to best practice
      guidelines. Patients will be randomly assigned to either the control or treatment arm and be
      followed as per the study protocol every time their wound is cared for over a 12-week period.
      The effectiveness of the MolecuLight i:X Imaging Device will be assessed with evaluation of
      wound surface area reduction rate and infection rates (incidence of infection and time to
      eradicate infection) compared to standard care.

      All subjects randomized will be evaluated for 12 weeks from the date of enrollment and
      treatment initiation. Subjects who may have wound closure within the 12-week study period
      will continue to have scheduled study evaluation visits up to the end of week 12.
