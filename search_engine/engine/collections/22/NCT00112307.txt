      rectal tissues from inadvertent insertion of the interstitial needles used to deliver
      brachytherapy. MR images obtained on the MRT unit should provide clear delineation of the
      bladder and rectum and allow for greater accuracy and avoidance of these normal tissues upon
      interstitial needle insertion. CT images will be obtained following the insertion of needles
      using the MRT unit. The procedure will be considered a failure if CT imaging identifies the
      insertion of needles into the bladder or rectum that was not detected using MR. Secondary
      endpoints include the ability of MR imaging to accurately reconstruct dosimetric plans and to
      construct dose volume histograms after the implantation of interstitial needles as well as
      the ability of MR imaging to accurately determine tumor, bladder and rectal volumes.
      Secondary endpoints will also include the assessment of acute skin, genitourinary and
      gastrointestinal toxicities as well as an assessment of tumor progression or recurrence
      during a 180 day follow-up period.
