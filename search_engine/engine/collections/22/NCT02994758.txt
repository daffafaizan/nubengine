      metastasis, plasma and urine) linked to comprehensive registry and clinical data and
      molecular characterization of the patient material using state-of-the-art technologies (e.g.
      NGS, transcriptomics, imaging, DSRT) will facilitate a more rapid translation of basic
      research innovations into clinical care (diagnostics, imaging, therapeutics) and result in
      improved outcome of patients suffering from urologic cancers ("personalized medicine").

      The principal aim of the project is to establish a framework and infrastructure for the
      systematic collection and interpretation of biological patient samples. Similarly, the
      investigators aim to establish the format how the related clinical and research data can be
      made readily accessible for both clinicians and researchers without compromising patient
      privacy. The key objectives of the project are to facilitate research translation and to
      improve outcome of urologic cancers.
