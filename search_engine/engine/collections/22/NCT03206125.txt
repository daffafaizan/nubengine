      sixth leading cause of cancer death worldwide, just after breast cancer. Esophageal squamous
      cell carcinoma (ESCC) accounts for 89% of all esophageal cancer cases worldwide and many of
      the cases originate in two high risk regions, one in Asia and the other in Africa.

      Smoking tobacco and heavy alcohol consumption do not explain the incidence rates in the
      high-risk regions. It is therefore important to consider a wide range of etiologic factors to
      explain the high rates of cancer in these populations.

      Malawi has the highest incidence rates of ESCC in Africa. Our previous studies in Kenya and
      preliminary studies in Malawi point to a number of potential ESCC risk factors.

      Objectives: Our study aims to enhance our understanding of the causes and outcomes for ESCC
      in Malawi

      Eligibility: All suspected ESCC cases will be eligible for enrollment.

      Design: We will conduct a case-control study of ESCC jointly at Kamuzu Central Hospital and
      St. Gabriel s Hospital, recruiting 300 ESCC cases and 300 controls, to (1) evaluate exposures
      (including consumption of very hot beverages, use of firewood as fuel, tooth loss and animal
      exposure) which may influence risk of ESCC in Malawi and (2) collect biological samples to
      quantify exposures of interest (included in the current proposal) and to study the genetics
      and genomics of ESCC tumors (to be included in a future proposal).
