    
      Design A single-group quasi-experimental design was carried out. The IDWG was the dependent
      variable, expressed as the weight gain in kilograms between dialysis sessions. A base-line
      was established by taking IDWG data for one month; after the nurses training, IDWG data were
      taken for another month. Follow-up was carried out six months later.

      Methods

      Participants 36 patients of a hemodialysis unit in a public hospital were invited to
      participate in the study. All accepted and gave written informed consent. Nurses were two
      women (39 and 37 years old) and one man (30 years old).

      The intervention Training. Two two-hour training modules were designed by two recognized
      solution-focused therapy experts. In each module, participants watched videos that
      illustrated solution-focused communication on fluid adherence, and practiced the skills in
      role-plays.

      Solution-focused communication on IDWG. In the case of IDWG improvement, nurses were trained
      to congratulate the patient and then to explore in detail, from a stance of curiosity, how
      nurses had accomplished the weight reduction. Nurses were trained to invite patients to share
      specific behavioral details and also to describe their own behavior from the perspective of
      significant family members. Nurses were also taught to compliment patients on their
      accomplishments and to invite them to keep track of anything else they might find useful to
      control fluid intake over the next days.

      In the case of IDWG worsening, nurses were encouraged to validate patientsÂ´ difficulties and
      empathize with their predicament.

      A repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Student's t were used to analyze the
      changes in patient's IDWG over time.
