    
      The main aim of the study is to compare the efficacy of biologic therapy (infliximab) as
      induction therapy against current best practice therapy: early introduction of methotrexate
      in combination with steroid induction therapy and dose modification according to predefined
      disease activity measures (as informed by the literature, and based around a pragmatic dose
      escalation protocol).

      Exploratory analyses of imaging findings will be undertaken on a subgroup of patients at
      sites able to perform such assessments.

      The imaging techniques used include

        1. DEXA

        2. US

        3. Peripheral MRI

      End point

      The end points of the study are defined as:

        -  Completion of 78 weeks of therapy in the study

        -  Withdrawal due to any reason including toxicity or inefficacy

        -  Withdrawal due to completion of the dose escalation regime and disease remains active

        -  Withdrawal due to meeting NICE criteria for biologics during the dose escalation regime

      At the end of the study, patients will continue to be followed in the Yorkshire Rheumatology
      clinics as part of their routine care.

      All patients who withdraw will be asked to have a withdrawal visit with X-Rays of hands and
      feet to allow assessment of the primary endpoint.
