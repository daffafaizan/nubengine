    
      This is a randomized clinical trial with three groups. Participants will be found through
      social media announcements. The active interventions of cognitive training will be delivered
      at two groups: one group will receive through hypnosis and the other will receive through
      food inhibition training (a GO NO GO task). The control group will receive a simple GO NO GO
      task as an active placebo. The trial will be exclusively online and it consists of five
      sessions. Participants will complete their tasks on four Zoom sessions. Cognitive, emotional
      and behavioral data will be taken at four times: before the intervention starts, in the
      middle (after two sessions), at the end and at two follow up moments: one month and six
      months after the trial ends.
