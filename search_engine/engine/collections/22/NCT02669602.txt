      than 20,500 people participate. The Project is permanently open to new volunteers, and around
      2,000 new participants are invited each year.

      A new questionnaire is sent to participants every two years. The questionnaires are named
      with the letter "Q," followed by the number of years that have passed since the participant
      first volunteered. The first questionnaire is titled "Q0" and is followed by "Q2","Q4", etc.

      The cohort is "dynamic" thanks to the fact that it is permanently open to new volunteers.
      Although the Project was created by the Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health
      of the University of Navarra, it now counts on the invaluable collaboration of other Spanish
      university centers.

      Thanks to the invaluable collaboration of our participants, the investigators are able to
      research cardiovascular diseases, depression, fertility, arterial hypertension, and car
      accident injuries, among other areas.
