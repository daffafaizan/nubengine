      intraoperative vasoplegic syndrome. If vasoplegic syndrome is identified via SVR lower than
      500 dynes-sec/cm-5, the patients will be randomized to receiving either IV methylene blue or
      hydroxocobalamin (10 patients in each group). The primary end point will examine the efficacy
      of the two medications on treating intraoperative vasoplegic syndrome. The SVR, blood
      pressure, and amount of administered vasopressors at 0, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180
      minutes after the medication administrations will be recorded. .
