      tosilate or midazolam to maintain sufficient sedation, then remifentanil was slowly injected
      for patients' sufficient analgesia during the examination. We aim to use patients' recovery
      time, cognition function and other measurement scales to clarify whether remimazolam tosilate
      is better than midazolam in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy.
