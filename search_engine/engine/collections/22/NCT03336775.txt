      Primary:

      To determine the therapeutic efficacy of acupuncture on radiotherapy-induced dysphagia in
      patients with head and neck cancer.

      Secondary:

        1. To determine whether acupuncture can improve swallow function in these patients.

        2. To determine what extent acupuncture can improve the complications of dysphagia of these
           patients, including the incidence of aspiration pneumonia, malnutrition.

        3. To determine what extent this traditional Chinese therapy can improve quality of life of
           these patients.

        4. To evaluate the safety of acupuncture in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive acupuncture for 30 minutes per day for up to 20 sessions (over 4
      weeks). These patients also received corticosteroid for 4 weeks, methylprednisolone 80mg
      ivdrip. for 3 days, 60mg ivdrip. for 3 days, 40mg ivdrip. for 3 days, 30mg po. for 7 days,
      20mg po. for 7 days, 10mg po. for 5 days and maintain. Patients undergo VFSS before, at end
      of therapy (week 4) and 3 months (week 16) after therapy. Swallowing function, outcomes of
      dysphagia, including incidence of aspiration pneumonia, nutritional status change, and QOL
      change are assessed at baseline, week 4 and week 16.

      Arm â…¡: Patients receive corticosteroid only, and the use of corticosteroid is the same with
      Arm I. Patients undergo VFSS before, at end of therapy (week 4) and 3 months (week 16) after
      therapy. Swallowing function, outcomes of dysphagia, including incidence of aspiration
      pneumonia, nutritional status change, and QOL change are assessed at baseline, week 4 and
      week 16.
