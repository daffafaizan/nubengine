    
      This is a phase 2a, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial conducted
      in Germany at 3-6 sites. Subjects will be randomised to one of two treatment sequences (A and
      B). Each treatment period will last 7 days with a wash-out period of 7 days between
      treatments. Half of the subjects will start with treatment A followed by treatment B while
      the other half will start with treatment B followed by treatment A. A safety follow-up visit
      will be performed 3 days after last dose of the tested medication.

      The main assessment is an urticaria activity score. After a Pulse-controlled ergometry (PCE)
      provocation test subjects will be rated on their number of wheals and their itch severity,
      resulting in a sum score ranging from 0 to 6 points.
