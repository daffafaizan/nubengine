      Clinical Research Center Grant Program focused on the physiology and pathophysiology of
      middle-ear (ME) pressure-regulation in children and adults. These experiments are designed to
      measure the rate of transME mucosal (transMEM) inert gas exchange in adults and determine if
      nasal inflammatory reactions experimentally provoked by intranasal histamine or allergen
      challenge increase the rate transMEM inert gas exchange and if nasal or oral treatment with
      an adrenergic agonist decreases that rate. Four cohorts of 20 otherwise healthy adults will
      be identified and one cohort assigned to each of the four experiments. All subjects will have
      a x-ray in Schuller projection to estimate mastoid volume. The transMEM inert gas exchange
      rate is measured by repeatedly recording ME pressure by tympanometry while the subject
      breathes a mixture of 50%N2O/ 50%O2, and then regressing ME pressure on time and dividing the
      slope of the function by the estimated N2O driving gradient to yield an exchange constant.
      For each experiment, the transMEM N2O exchange rate is measured twice at separate visits
      (active and placebo). The four experimental conditions are: (1) intranasal ragweed and
      placebo challenges; (2) intranasal histamine and placebo challenges; (3) oral pseudoephedrine
      and placebo; (4) intranasal oxymetazoline and placebo. Experiments 2-4 require two visits,
      while Experiment 1 will require an additional visit to obtain blood for RAST testing to
      verify ragweed allergy. The paired exchange constants measured in each experiment will be
      compared for a significant difference using a Student's Paired t test and the results
      interpreted as supporting or refuting the possibility of modulating the transMEM N2O exchange
      rate by the different procedures.
