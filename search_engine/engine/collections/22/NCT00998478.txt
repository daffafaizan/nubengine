      with cardiovascular disease including obesity, blood pressure and blood lipids have been
      shown to track from childhood through to adulthood. The prevalence of overweight and obesity
      for children (4-18 years) in the UK is reported to be 15 % and 4 % respectively. Furthermore,
      in comparison to England (2.9 %) obesity is more prevalent for those living in Scotland (7.6
      %) and Wales (6.5 %). Previous research from two Welsh secondary schools indicate overweight
      and obesity rates for boys and girls aged 12-13 to be even greater at 26 % and 38 %
      respectively. Further to this, 19 % were identified as having elevated total cholesterol
      (â‰¥5.2 mmol/L).

      For many, overweight and obesity is the result of the combined effect of excess energy
      consumption and inadequate physical activity. Previous school-based physical activity
      interventions have demonstrated modest improvements to cardiovascular disease risk factors by
      implementing extra-curricular activities or improving current physical education curriculum.
      Few have attempted to increase physical activity using normally, class-room taught curriculum
      subjects. This study examines the impact of activity knowledge circuits to combat
      cardiovascular disease risk factors in 11-14 year old children.
