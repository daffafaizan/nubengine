      initially to chemotherapy, most of them in time will suffer a relapse. Patients often receive
      multiple lines of chemotherapy for their recurrences, and the choice of chemotherapy depends
      largely on the time interval since the last therapy. Patients whose disease recurs longer
      than 12 months after a platinum containing treatment are considered to be platinum sensitive,
      and are candidates for retreatment with a platinum regimen.

      Patients in whom disease recurs less than 6 months after a platinum containing treatment are
      considered platinum resistant or refractory, and are treated with a non platinum
      chemotherapy. The option of treatment is less clear for patients whose disease recurs between
      6 and 12 months after platinum containing therapy. It is hypothesized that prolonging the
      interval since last platinum treatment by using a non platinum chemotherapy will result in
      better outcomes for these patients.

      This study will evaluate if the experimental sequence of a non platinum based chemotherapy,
      followed at a later progression by a platinum based chemotherapy is superior, in terms of the
      effect on overall survival, to the standard inverse sequence of treatment.
