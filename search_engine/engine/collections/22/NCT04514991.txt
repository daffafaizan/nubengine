      below the roots of teeth previously endodontically treated. Healing is assessed through the
      resolution of signs and symptoms as well as bone regeneration in the area below the root. In
      cases where the bone defect is significant, it is recommended to use a membrane to allow the
      bone to heal without invasion of cells from the gum tissues into the lesion. In small
      lesions, the efficacy of using augmentation material is not determined. Routine root end
      surgery with small lesions is often conducted with or without augmentation material. The
      purpose of this research is to compare periradicular healing after root end surgery in
      endondontic lesions with and without the use of resorbable collagen material.
