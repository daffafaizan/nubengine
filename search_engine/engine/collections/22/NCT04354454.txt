    
      This study is a two-arm randomized controlled pilot study designed to test the feasibility
      and acceptability of using a wearable accelerometer (Fitbit) vs. a wearable accelerometer
      (FItbit) + a game designed to help participants increase physical activity + social support
      improves participants' average daily step counts.

      Eligible Participants will be randomly assigned into 1 of 2 groups

        1. Fitbit (wearable accelerometer) or

        2. Fitbit (wearable accelerometer) + game + help from a self-selected teammate

      The study interventions involved in this research are:

        -  Surveys/Interviews

        -  Fitbits (also known as a wearable accelerometers or fitness trackers)

        -  Actigraph GT9X Link (a research grade accelerometer)

        -  Way to Health Platform

        -  Help from a Teammate (i.e. a friend or family member that participants choose to help
           them reach their goals)

      It is expected that about 50 people will take part in this research study.
