      to induce postoperative chronic pain. The paravertebral block, because of its efficacy and
      less invasive nature than epidural analgesia, is quickly becoming the reference technique for
      pain management of major breast surgery.

      Peripheral regional anesthesia for the breast surgery appeared in the past few years. Among
      these techniques are the PEC block, Serratus block and more recently the pecto-intercostal
      fascial plane block (PIF block).

      Currently in the investigators hospital in every day's practice, an association of the
      serratus block and the PIF block is made, which allows for a complete block of both the
      laterals branches of intercostal nerves (with the serratus block) and of anterior branches of
      intercostal nerves (with the PIF block). Therefore, this association of blocks may lead to a
      complete analgesia of the breast, while the serratus block alone only allows for analgesia of
      the lateral part of the breast.

      This technique was previously described. The authors evoked the possibility of the
      association of serratus and PIF blocks and described this technique with a patient, but to
      the investigators knowledge no evaluation of the efficacy of this procedure was made.

      The objective of the study is to analyze this technique through a collection form that
      evaluates the satisfaction and post-operative morphine consumption of women receiving this
      association of blocks before a general anesthesia for a unilateral mastectomy with
      homolateral total lymphadenectomy.

      This is a purely observational study that assesses a current practice in this type of
      surgery.
