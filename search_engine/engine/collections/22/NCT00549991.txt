      especially common in African Americans, with more than 40% of African Americans diagnosed
      with this condition. High blood pressure usually develops earlier in life and is more severe
      in African Americans than in other racial or ethnic groups. Many factors can cause high blood
      pressure, including stress, diet, diabetes, kidney disease, or obesity. Previous studies have
      also shown that genetic variations on two regions of chromosomes 6 and 21 may predispose some
      people to develop high blood pressure. Admixture mapping is a type of genetic analysis that
      aims to identify disease-causing genetic variations across different populations of people.
      Using admixture mapping, this study will examine previously collected genetic samples from
      African American participants in the Family Blood Pressure Program (FBPP) study and from
      African American, Mexican American, Nigerian, and Jamaican participants enrolled in other
      clinical studies. Study researchers will analyze the samples to identify and characterize
      genetic variations that are associated with an increased risk of high blood pressure in the
      African American population, as well as other racial and ethnic groups.
