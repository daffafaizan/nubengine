      severity score: Expand-CURB. According to the retrospective study results, applicant found
      the changes of pneumonia severity score could reflect the patients'condition and was the
      independent risk factor for 30-day mortality. More specifically, if the patients'Expand-CURB
      score was not improved after 3-5 days of initial treatment, the odds ratio of 30-day
      mortality was 5.571 and 5.249 (95%CI 1.831-15.051, P=0.002) by univariate analysis and
      multivariate analysis (the multivariate was adjusted by the initial severity of pneumonia).

      In addition, the applicant found the changes of serum CRP(C reactive protein ) before and
      after initial treatment also associated the patients'outcomes. If the serum CRP decreased
      less than 40% or not lower than 20mg/dl after the initial treatment, the odds ratio of 30-day
      mortality will be 3.692 and 3.806 (95%CI 1.867-7.756, P<0.001) by univariate analysis and
      multivariate analysis.

      In conclusion, the applicant established three criteria for assessing effectiveness of CAP
      treatment:

        1. Effective treatment by PSI: the PSI score decreased after 3-5 days the initial
           treatment.

        2. Effective treatment by Expand-CURB: the Expand-CURB score decreased after 3-5 days the
           initial treatment.

        3. Effective treatment by serum CRP: the serum CRP decreased more than 40% or lower than
           20mg/dl after 3-5 days the initial treatment.

      Furthermore, the applicant found combined pneumonia severity scores with CRP could predict
      the 30-day mortality more efficiently. The OR for both CRP and PSI treatment failure was
      2.377 (95%CI 1.100-5.136, P=0.028). And the OR for both CRP and Expand-CURB treatment failure
      was 7.332 (95%CI 1.563-34.385, P=0.012). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the
      change of pneumonia severity scores and CRP could reflect the patients'condition and the
      effectiveness of the treatment.

      To validate the feasibility of assessing effectiveness of CAP treatment by using continuous
      pneumonia severity score and changes of CRP, applicant intend to randomly allocate the
      patients into three arms: Comprehensive evaluation group, PSI evaluation group and
      Expand-CURB evaluation group. Patients who did not agree to participate the randomized
      controlled study will be asked whether they agree to provide their clinical data for
      prospective observational studies.

      The primary outcomes will be 30-day mortality and ICU admission. The second outcome is length
      of hospital stay.
