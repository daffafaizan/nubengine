    
      This extension protocol is for those subjects that have completed the allowed duration of
      participation in an Endocyte-sponsored clinical trial of EC145 and have continuing evidence
      of clinical benefit (stable disease or better) at the time that they completed participation
      in that study.

      Following confirmation of eligibility, subjects will receive intravenously-administered EC145
      at a dose of 2.5 mg. Dosing will occur on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday of weeks 1 and 3 of
      each 4-week cycle. No therapy will be administered during weeks 2 and 4. Subjects randomized
      to non-EC145-containing treatment arms of EC145 trials are not eligible for this study.
