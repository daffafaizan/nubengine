    
      The goal of the present open label study is to obtain pilot data to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of KD in adults with intractable epilepsy. Investigators will evaluate the effect of
      KD on seizure frequency and on adverse events. Investigators will also evaluate serum levels
      of the ketone body, Î²hydroxybutyrate (BOH) and of glucose in order to determine whether
      changes in serum levels of these substances correlate with KD-associated changes in seizure
      frequency. The data from the present study will be used to design a large randomized study.

      Laboratory evaluations will include complete blood count (CBC), serum electrolytes, including
      calcium, phosphate and magnesium, renal and liver functions, including total protein and
      albumin, uric acid, fasting serum lipid profile, glucose and b- hydroxybutyrate (BOH) levels,
      serum carnitine level, serum a.m. trough antiepilepsy drugs levels, and urine calcium and
      creatinine level. They will be obtained twice at baseline a month apart and monthly during KD
      treatment.

      Primary outcome measures will include average monthly seizure frequency and adverse events.
      Secondary outcome measures will include treatment compliance, quality of life questionnaire
      (QOLIE-31-P) scores, and Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores.
