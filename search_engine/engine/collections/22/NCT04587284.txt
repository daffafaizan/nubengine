      considerable rise in France. To date, it represents the most common surgical technique for
      radical prostatectomies, compared with standard procedure such as open retropubic radical
      prostatectomy or laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (8000 procedures/year, 40% of surgeries).
      In 2016, the French Health Authority (HAS) published a report on the robot-assisted
      laparoscopic radical prostatectomy practice that highlighted the small amount of available
      convincing data to provide evidence for a significant clinical benefit. There were no
      published data on overall or progression-free survival compared with other surgical
      procedures, with an important organizational and financial impact for healthcare institutions
      and patients. The question of the clinical benefit and the cost-effectiveness ratio of this
      surgical procedure is still relevant taking into account that randomized studies are
      difficult to carry out and that results of prospective registers will be available in many
      years. In this context, the use of the French National Claims Database (SNDS) appears to be
      the best short-term and reduced-cost solution to identify patients who benefited from the
      three surgical procedures since the rise of robotics. It would provide real-life data to
      national institutions in order to conclude on the opportunity to set a specific hospital
      tariff for the robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy. This study aims to assess
      the cost-effectiveness ratio and the clinical benefit (survival, disease recurrence,
      functional results) of the robot-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomy compared with
      other procedures using real-life data from SNDS. The population of patients who benefited
      from robot-assisted surgery will be identified in the SNDS through a practices survey,
      allowing the identification of centres fully converted to robotics.
