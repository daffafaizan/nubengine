      inflammatory bowel disease using the Work Productivity and Activity Index (WPAI), that have
      been validated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.

      Secondary, the predictor of work productivity impairment in patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease and distribution of type and severity of work disability will be identified.

      Third, the investigators will explore the correlation between the quality of life and
      psychosocial aspects (anxiety disorder, depression) of patients with inflammatory bowel
      disease.

      One year later, the same questionnaire will be surveyed repeatedly in the same participants
      under usual care to investigate the changes in patient-reported outcome measures.
