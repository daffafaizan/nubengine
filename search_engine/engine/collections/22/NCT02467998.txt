      to provide comparative effectiveness data on NPWT including different NPWT devices, and
      safety data on NPWT (e.g. the frequency of adverse events experienced by typical NPWT
      patients).

      NPWT promotes wound healing by applying a vacuum through a special sealed dressing. The
      mechanical micro-deformation of the wound bed in response to suction has been shown to
      stimulate and accelerate the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis). The continuous
      vacuum removes fluid and reduces edema, thereby increasing tissue oxygen levels. The vacuum
      may be applied continuously or intermittently, depending on the type of wound being treated
      and the clinical objectives. Depending on the NPWT device, a variety of dressings are placed
      into the wound bed in conjunction with NPWT, and a variety of suction pressures may be
      applied.

      The diversity of NPWT devices and the rate at which they are becoming available for clinical
      use make it impossible to perform randomized controlled trials to compare their effectiveness
      against one another. Effectiveness in real world patients is the best current option to
      understand the role of NPWT in wound healing.

      Hospital based outpatient wound centers participating in the US Wound Registry agree to
      provide data as part of quality initiatives including participation in PQRS, and to meet
      their Stage 2 Meaningful use criteria. The NPWTR is a subset of the USWR (Chronic Disease
      Registry) data. All patient data from all participating outpatient clinics are transmitted to
      the USWR where data are available for benchmarking, PQRS and other initiatives. Data used for
      comparative effectiveness research is HIPAA de-identified.
