    
      A prospective, monocentric, randomized, open-labelled in two parallel groups study that
      evaluates the effectiveness of mechanical stimulation technique compared to massages on pain
      level and functional discomfort (on the mobility of the shoulder) after 6 months in breast
      cancer patients needing physiotherapy, following a total mastectomy and exploratory axillary
      surgery.

      Other objectives of the study include:

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of mechanical stimulation technique compared to massages on pain
           and functional discomfort (on the mobility of the shoulder) 15 days after the end of
           physiotherapy.

        -  Evaluate the impact of mechanical stimulation on the quality of life of patients, in
           comparison to those receiving massages
