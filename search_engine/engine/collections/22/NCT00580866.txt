      comminuted and associated with extensive soft tissue damage and are very difficult to treat.
      The most problematic complication for these fractures is the potential development of a
      cosmetic defect and functional disability due to the loss of 20 degrees to 30 degrees of
      terminal extension of the elbow. It has been found imperative that early motion and physical
      therapy be implemented to help produce the best results in terms of a patient's range of
      motion and decreases secondary surgeries.

      We intend to examine a group of patients with distal humerus and elbow fracture/dislocations
      who use static stretching braces along with physical therapy (PT) within 3 weeks after
      surgery, in contrast to physical therapy treatment alone after surgery. The static stretching
      brace group will have a small electronic circuit attached to the brace that will record
      patient's usage.

      Improvement of patient's overall functional outcome will also be measured by a standard
      functional outcome instrument, the Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) form. The
      DASH Form is a standard functional outcome instrument specific to upper extremity injuries.
      In addition, a more general measure, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS), will be used to assess
      pain.

      The use of the static motion brace may help eliminate the necessity of additional treatments,
      saving both pain and suffering, as well as monetary costs for the patient, while
      simultaneously producing a better long term functional and cosmetic outcome.
