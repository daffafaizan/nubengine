      included a labor-intensive, immune tolerance induction (ITI) regimen administered with
      concomitant bypassing agent (BPA) prophylaxis, either daily recombinant activated factor VII
      (rFVIIa) or at least 3 non-consecutive days of activated prothrombin complex concentrate
      (aPCC) given intravenously (IV) each week.

      The purpose of the aPCC-emicizumab safety study is to prospectively investigate the safety
      and hemostatic efficacy of a personalized dose of aPCC in children and adults with hemophilia
      A and inhibitors on emicizumab prophylaxis during acute bleeding events or prior to
      procedures.
