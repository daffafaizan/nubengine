      Natalizumab has been approved for use in patients with Multiple Sclerosis and Crohn's
      disease. In these diseases, the drug works to inhibit dysfunctional immune cells that are
      responsible for the symptoms seen in these diseases. Acute graft versus host disease is
      caused by a similar dysfunction of immune cells; Natalizumab is thought to inhibit these
      immune cells, similarly to how it does in Multiple Sclerosis and Crohn's disease. In this
      research study,the investigators are looking to see whether Natalizumab provides additional
      benefit to patients receiving standard treatment for acute graft versus host disease of the
      gastrointestinal tract.

      Participants who fulfill eligibility criteria will be entered into the trial to receive
      Natalizumab.

        -  Participant will receive a dose of the natalizumab through intravenous infusion.
           Participants may receive a second dose at Day 28 if they experience a partial response
           or very good partial response.

        -  Scheduled Physical Examination at screening, during the week of first dose and at 28
           days, 56 days, 100 days, 180 days and one year.
