      uncertainty continues as to how best assess impaired hemodynamics.

      Hypotension defined by a low Mean Arterial Blood Pressure (MABP) remains a common issue in
      preterm infants, affecting up to 30% of extremely preterm infants.

      It is common to focus only on MABP thus neglecting the complex and dynamic (patho)physiology
      that may be present in newborn infants. Providing sufficient cellular oxygenation is the
      primary task of the circulatory system and different factors may compromise it. In this
      prospective observational study the investigators will examine various forms of objective
      non-invasive continuous hemodynamic monitoring methods in very preterm infants

        1. For feasibility of non-invasive CO measurement (first 20 patients)

        2. For reproducibility and correlation of this measurement and ECHOcardiography (first 40
           echocardiographic examinations)

        3. For prediction of therapy response.

        4. For correlation with clinical definitions of hypotension/hypoperfusion

        5. For prediction of later clinical problems/complications of prematurity and impaired
           hemodynamic status.
