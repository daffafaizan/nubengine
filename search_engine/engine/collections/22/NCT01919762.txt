    
      This protocol is intended for use by external sites collecting clinical research specimens
      for T2 Biosystems' use in developing the T2Bacterial Assay. Specimens and information on
      patients' medical history, blood properties, medications, and blood culture history/results
      are required from the T2Bacterial Assay's target patient population (i.e., candidates for
      blood culture). Ideally, clinical specimens for use in developing the T2Bacterial Assay will
      be collected from negative blood culture, positive non-bacteria blood culture and positive
      bacteria blood culture patients.
