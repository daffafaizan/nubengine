      function of a damaged and nonfunctioning pulp by stimulation of existing stem and progenitor
      cells present in the root canal and/or the introduction and stimulation of new stem and
      dental pulp progenitor cells into the root canal under conditions that are favorable to their
      differentiation and reestablishment of function. L-PRF has the potential advantage of
      creating a bioactive construct that stimulates the local environment for differentiation and
      proliferation of these stem and progenitor cells. We have designed this confirmatory study to
      test the hypothesis that the use of L-PRF in REP of infected permanent immature teeth will
      accelerate periapical bone healing and stimulate the root maturation.
