      surgery in detecting the borders of the disease, the histopathologic correlation between the
      specimen dyed by methylene blue and also the cavity excision specimen not dyed by methylene
      blue was investigated. The branches that distinctly exceeded the planned dyed excision
      borders will tried to be detected histopathologically, if any.
