      Ferris PainWrap can relieve low back pain more effectively than a placebo wrap. In the United
      States, the prevalence of low back pain of at least 1 month's duration is about 15% and its
      incidence is 5%. It is one of the two most common pain complaints. Low back pain is thus a
      major health problem in this country and worldwide. Treatment that relieves low back pain and
      restores function would be of great benefit to the individual and the community at large,
      particularly if the treatment is convenient and has no significant adverse effects. Ferris
      PainWrap was originally developed as a burn dressing and is commercially available for this
      purpose. The Food and Drug Administration approved the material as Ferris Hydrophilic
      Dressing for marketing in interstate commerce prior to May 28, 1976, the enactment date of
      the Medical Device Amendments. The material is classified as a medical device. It was found
      to relieve pain, inflammation, swelling, and bruising over traumatized areas. Subsequently,
      it appeared to relieve low back pain in informal, open (non-blinded) trials. The proposed
      mechanism for low back pain relief is by alteration of cutaneous A-beta receptor and possibly
      cutaneous A-delta fiber function through shifts in sodium and water concentrations in the
      skin. This study will compare a "no dose" placebo to a "high-dose" back wrap. It is a one
      year pilot study which will be randomized, double-blinded, and controlled, comparing Ferris
      PainWrap to an identical appearing placebo back wrap in individuals with chronic low back
      pain of three months duration or longer.
