      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of UCN-01 and topotecan, in terms of complete and
           partial objective response rates, in patients with recurrent, persistent, or progressive
           advanced ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen, in terms of stable disease rates and
           duration of response, in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free, median, and overall survival of patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the relationship between clinical and pharmacodynamic effects of this regimen
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive UCN-01 IV over 3 hours on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days
      1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-11
      months.
