      levels were measured using a chemiluminescent immunoassay for quantitative determination of
      the hormone .

      The P/F ratio was calculated according to the equation (P(ng/mL)/number of follicles) and was
      defined by the measurements obtained on the day of final oocyte maturation.

      All ultrasounds were performed at our In vitro fertilization center, and we included the
      number of follicles â‰¥14mm on the day of final oocyte maturation in the ratio calculation
      Oocytes were retrieved 36 hours after injection and were subsequently fertilized by In vitro
      fertilization or Intra cytoplasmic sperm injection. On day 2 - 5, all embryos were evaluated
      for cell number and morphology.

      Each embryo transferred was evaluated for blastomere size and fragmentation. Embryos were
      graded as follows. Those with equal blastomere size and no fragmentation were considered
      Grade 1; those with blastomeres of equal size with slight fragmentation (<20 %) were Grade
      2;those with blastomeres of unequal size but no fragmentation were Grade 3; those with
      blastomeres of equal or unequal size and moderate fragmentation (20 %-50 %) were Grade 4; and
      those with unrecognizable blastomeres and severe fragmentation (>50 %) were Grade 5.

      The embryos were transferred on postretrieval day (2 - 5). Pregnancy was defined by Human
      chorionic gonadotropin titers within 11 days following Embryo transfer. Clinical pregnancy
      was defined by the observation of intrauterine embryo heart motion by 7 weeks gestation.
