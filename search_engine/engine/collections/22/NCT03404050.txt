      older adults with dementia living in the community with early to moderate stage dementia.
      This client population commonly experience depression, social withdrawal and cognitive
      difficulties and literature suggests a music and dance movement therapy group could
      potentially make a contribution to both reducing symptoms and improving communication and
      wellbeing. However, there is still lack of clarity on clinically meaningful outcome measures,
      detail regarding the therapeutic process and questions remain regarding the trustworthiness
      of qualitative observations. This mixed method feasibility study aims to test whether the
      interventions translate to a community setting, provide richer insight into the meaningful
      aspect of the therapeutic process and provide some preliminary quantitative findings.
