      bone marrow mononuclear cells and allogeneic human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem
      cells administered to 20 male and female subjects between ages of 18-50 with spinal cord
      injury. These cells will be administered intrathecally and intravenously multiple times over
      the course of one month.

      The primary objective is freedom from treatment-associated adverse events at 3 and 12 months
      post-treatment. Secondary objective will be efficacy at baseline, 3 months and 12 months and
      will be quantified based on the following: American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA)
      classification and the Frankel Scale.
