    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, multicenter international Phase 3 study of CAEL-101
      combined with the standard of care (SoC) for plasma cell dyscrasia (PCD) versus placebo
      combined with standard of care PCD treatment in patients with Mayo stage IIIb AL amyloidosis
      that have not received prior treatment. The minimum planned treatment time for each patient
      will be at least 50 weeks or until the patient's death. It is planned that all patients will
      continue their double-blind treatment until the last patient completes at least 50 weeks of
      treatment.

      Approximately 111 patients will be enrolled using a 2:1 randomization ratio of CAEL-101:
      placebo and will involve approximately 70 investigator sites.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effects of CAEL-101 versus placebo on
      all-cause mortality.
