      secondary endpoints were the difference in pain intensity at 30 minutes (PID30) after FBSF
      administration, subjects' satisfaction, and the percentage of episodes requiring rescue
      medications.

      Pain intensity was determined using an 11-point numeric scale from 0="no pain" to 10="worst
      pain." Patients were assessed with baseline pain as well as pain intensity at 30 minutes
      after dosing. The PID30 was obtained by baseline pain score minus score rated 30 minutes
      after dosing.

      Patient's satisfaction was assessed using a 5-point (poor, fair, good, very good, and
      excellent) categorical scale at 30 minutes after taking FBSF with the following question:
      "What was your overall satisfaction with the medication?" At each episode of BTP, subjects
      recorded whether a rescue medication was taken after administration of FBSF.
