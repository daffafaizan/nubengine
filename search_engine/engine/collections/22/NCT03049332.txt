      Phase 1: The PI conducted a secondary qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews to further
      illuminate the sociocultural and family context of HIV+ Chinese women. The data were obtained
      from three previous projects conducted in China from 2005 to 2011.

      Phase 2: The PI developed and adapted a theory-driven, culturally sensitive and feasible
      intervention to improve the quality of life and clinical outcomes of HIV+ Chinese women and
      their families.

      Phase 3: The PI conducted a feasibility, compliance, and acceptability study for a self- and
      family-management intervention with HIV+ women and of their family members.
