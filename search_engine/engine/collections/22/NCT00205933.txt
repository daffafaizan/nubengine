      identify phenotypes characterized by reliable functional abnormalities. Anhedonia, the lack
      of reactivity to pleasurable stimuli, is considered a trait marker for depression. Using an
      objective behavioral task this project aims to investigate hedonic capacity in subjects
      meeting a DSM-IV diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder.
