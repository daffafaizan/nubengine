    
      The target population consists of patients between 10 and 19 years old, attending the
      Adolescent Clinic in the Dental School of the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), campus
      of Recife. The sample will consist of 184 adolescents, 92 in each group (intervention and
      control). Randomization will be stratified according to sex, age and presence or absence of
      dental anxiety. In the waiting room, before the dental appointment, the adolescents in the
      intervention group (IG) will use the FALE application to answer the questionnaire and assess
      the level of anxiety. Those in the control group (CG) will only record their level of
      anxiety. The undergraduates responsible for attending the IG participants will receive, prior
      to dental care, a report of the answers given by the adolescents through the application.
      During the dental consultation, a psychologist, who will be observing the care, will evaluate
      the adolescents behavior, considering cooperation. After the appointment, the adolescent will
      evaluate how much he/she felt benefited by the use of the app; how he evaluates the
      communication between him/her and the dentist; if he/she thinks that the app contributed with
      this communication; his/her satisfaction with dental treatment; and his/her satisfaction with
      the undergraduate attendance. The undergraduate will also evaluate his/her level of
      satisfaction with the application's use; how he/she evaluates the communication between
      him/her and the adolescent patient; how much the application has helped with this
      communication; and the degree of patient's cooperation during the dental consultation.
      Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis will be performed using appropriate tests
      through the Statistical Package for Social Sciences software version 21 and significance
      level of 5%.
