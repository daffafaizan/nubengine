      northern Uganda to receive either standard HBB with video-debriefing (intervention) or
      standard training alone (control). We hope video-debriefing will improve competence among the
      health workers and promote skills and knowledge retention over time, hence reduction in
      neonatal mortality.

      The result of the study may also contribute to shaping refresher training program policy in
      low-resource settings.
