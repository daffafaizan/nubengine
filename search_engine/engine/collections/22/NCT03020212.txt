    
      A clinical, prospective, randomized controlled trial to determine the effect of prescribing
      oxygen in a group of COPD patients with PaO2 ≥50 and ≤55 mmHg who do not have erythrocytosis
      or pulmonary hypertension on echocardiogram (which are considered manifestations of chronic
      hypoxia). It will be included 220 patients of the Fundación Neumológica Colombiana living in
      Bogotá who accept their participation by signing an informed consent.

      The subjects will be randomly assigned to receive or not LTOT and they will be followed for
      20 to 30 months. At baseline and then at 10, 20 and 30 months, they will be clinically
      evaluated with arterial blood gases, pulse oximetry, echocardiography, spirometry with
      bronchodilator, diffusion capacity, quality of life (SGRQ), neurocognitive performance (MMSE)
      and six minutes walk test. The primary outcome will evaluate the ratio of occurrence of
      erythrocytosis or pulmonary hypertension. Secondary outcomes will be evaluated quality of
      life, lung function, neurocognitive performance and exercise tolerance by comparing the
      groups with and without LTOT.
