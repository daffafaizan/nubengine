      projects are implemented in order to develop these competences. The impact of these
      experiences is rarely evaluated.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the improvement in self-efficacy parenting produced by
      an intervention which consists in sending to every new parents, during the first year of life
      of their son, eight newsletters with advices and recommendations on child care and
      development (project "Baby Newsletter").

      Methods

      Not-randomized controlled study to evaluate a community intervention to promote self-efficacy
      parenting. The treated group will be composed by all newborns resident in S.Ilario d'Enza
      (105 in 2013) where the Baby Newsletter is implemented. Newborns resident in the Health
      District of Montecchio and born in Montecchio Hospital in the same period are the control
      group (278 in 2013). Preterm or hospitalized children are excluded.

      Self-efficacy parenting is evaluated through the TOPSE (Tool to measure Parenting
      Self-Efficacy) questionnaire administered at baseline, in Montecchio Birth Unit or at the
      paediatric clinics, and at the vaccination appointments after 5 and 12 months.
