      I. To evaluate the safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of combined ofatumumab and
      buparlisib in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic
      lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have been exposed to ibrutinib (i.e., ibrutinib pre-treated).

      II. To evaluate the safety and dose limiting toxicities (DLT) of combined ibrutinib and
      buparlisib in patients with previously treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic
      lymphoma (CLL/SLL) who have NOT been exposed to ibrutinib (i.e., ibrutinib na√Øve)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine specific toxicities associated with combined buparlisib and ofatumumab.

      II. Evaluate for efficacy of buparlisib in combination with ofatumumab in ibrutinib
      pre-treated patients with CLL/SLL.

      III. To determine specific toxicities associated with combined buparlisib and ibrutinib.

      IV. To evaluate for efficacy of buparlisib in combination with ibrutinib in ibrutinib naive
      patients with CLL/SLL.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of buparlisib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment cohorts.

      COHORT A (ibrutinib pre-treated): Patients receive buparlisib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on
      days 1-28 and ofatumumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 during of courses 1-2;
      and day 1 of courses 4-7. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT B (ibrutinib naive): Patients receive buparlisib as in Cohort A and ibrutinib PO on
      days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
