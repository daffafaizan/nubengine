      thyroidectomy (TTx) could result in transient hypocalcemia (< 6 months) in 5 - 35% of cases
      or permanent hypocalcemia (> 6 months) in 7% of the patients (1, 2). In both of these
      circumstances, patients would require calcium and active vitamin D supplementation in
      addition to a potentially prolonged hospital stay and/or unplanned hospital readmission
      adding to unnecessary burden and healthcare costs. These complications could be minimized
      with label-free intraoperative PG identification using near infrared autofluorescence (NIRAF)
      detection with a fiber-probe based approach (3 - 5) as utilized in 'PTeye', which is medical
      device that was recently FDA-cleared (6). However, the true impact of this particular
      NIRAF-based approach on patient outcomes is yet to be determined

      The aim of this prospective single blinded randomized study is to compare 2 groups of
      patients: TTx patients operated using NIRAF detection technology with PTeye as adjunct tool
      (NIRAF+) vs. patients operated without the adjunct technology (NIRAF-). The main objective of
      this study is to assess the benefit of intraoperative use of NIRAF detection technology via
      PTeye during TTx procedures with regard to postoperative hypocalcemia, PG identification, PG
      auto-transplantation and inadvertent resection rates compared to standard of care.
