      prospective randomized controlled single-blind parallel-group study. Ureteral stent is always
      placed after flexible URS. Patients are prospectively randomized into two groups with a 1:1
      allocation: group LT receive loop-tail stents (Polaris ™ Loop - Boston Scientific, Natick,
      USA), while group DJ receive conventional double J stents (Vortek ® - Coloplast, Humlebaek,
      DK). Stent removal is planned 4 weeks after the procedure.

      Participants are asked to fill in the Italian validated version of the Ureteral Stent
      Symptoms Questionnaire (USSQ) 2 days and 4 weeks after surgery. The USSQ is further submitted
      4 weeks after stent removal (8 weeks after surgery) and these results are used as baseline
      evaluation, on the assumption that SRS persist for a few days after removal.
