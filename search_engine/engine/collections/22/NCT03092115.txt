      fewer than half of youth who are prescribed antiretroviral therapy (ART) achieve viral
      suppression. Yet few interventions have been developed to address adherence in this
      population with unique developmental/psychosocial needs. Mobile technology, which is
      constantly consumed by youth, has the potential to deliver interventions that provide support
      and feedback in real time as youth go about their daily lives.

      This pilot study will test a theory-driven, patient-centered, mobile phone-based intervention
      (mHealth app) targeting medication adherence among HIV+ youth. It is a three-month
      prospective feasibility trial to test a medication adherence mobile application consisting of
      two study visits: baseline and 3-month follow up.

      Data collection consists of app usage, Computer Assisted Self-Interview (CASI) for
      participant satisfaction with the app, demographics, and mental health and risk behaviors, as
      well as medical chart abstraction of disease biomarkers (CD4, viral load) and pharmacy refill
      data.
