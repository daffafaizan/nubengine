      amount of contrast dye (called gadolinium DTPA) will be added to topotecan before it is
      injected. Pictures will be taken of the tumor with an MRI machine. This will allow the
      investigators to see where in the tumor the topotecan has been injected. Issues related to
      patient selection, coordination with other therapeutic and palliative clinical options, and
      patient quality of life impact will be studied. Except for the infusion of topotecan and
      gadolinium DTPA into the tumor, and MRI imaging of the infusion process, all procedures and
      treatments participants will experience during the care of their brain tumor are
      non-investigational; the types of medical treatments, procedures, and tests they experience
      will be Standard of Care for patients with brain tumors.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To investigate by MR imaging the spatial and temporal distribution of topotecan in tumor
           and tumor-infiltrated brain administered by convection-enhanced delivery (CED) in
           patients with recurrent/progressive WHO grade III or IV (high grade) glioma (HGG) who
           have failed standard therapy comprising surgical biopsy and/or resection and adjuvant
           chemotherapy and radiotherapy

        -  To investigate by MR imaging the influence of the rate and topotecan concentration, on
           the spatial and temporal distribution of topotecan administered by CED in patients with
           recurrent/progressive HGG

        -  To evaluate the spatial and temporal distribution of topotecan, by MR imaging, when
           delivered into enhancing tumor tissue versus non-enhancing tumor tissue (as defined on
           pre-operative conventional MRI imaging with and without intravenous gadolinium)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To investigate the extent to which backflow may be observed on MRI during CED-mediated
           delivery of topotecan

        -  To assess the safety, tolerability and toxicity profile of topotecan administered by CED
           using different doses and infusion rates

        -  To observe evidence of activity of single-agent topotecan administered by CED to
           patients with recurrent/progressive HGG who have failed standard therapy comprising
           surgical biopsy and/or resection and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy
