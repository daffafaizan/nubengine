      I. To estimate the complete remission rate (CRR) by the International Myeloma Working Group
      (IMWG) criteria within 9 months post salvage auto-transplant with daratumumab maintenance
      therapy starting approximately 3 months post salvage auto-transplant in patients with
      relapsed myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To discover the impact of daratumumab on graft function and immune reconstitution.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 60-120 days after transplant, participants receive daratumumab intravenously (IV)
      over 4-8 hours on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of courses 1 and 2 and days 1 and 15 of courses 3-6,
      then on day 1 of subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 28 days for 2 years in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then
      every 4-12 weeks thereafter.
