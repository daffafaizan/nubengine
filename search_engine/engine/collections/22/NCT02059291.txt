    
      This study consists of 3 randomized cohorts (one per condition of colchicine
      resistant/intolerant Familial Mediterranean Fever (crFMF), Hyper Immunoglobulin D Syndrome
      (also known as mevalonate kinase deficiency (HIDS/MKD), and Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor
      Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS), and 4 study epochs:

        1. Epoch 1: a screening epoch to assess participant's eligibility;

        2. Epoch 2: a randomized treatment epoch of 16 weeks where participants are randomized to
           canakinumab 150 mg every 4 weeks (q4w) or to placebo to obtain efficacy and safety data
           in a double-blind placebo controlled parallel-arm setting. This epoch contained 2
           possible escape options :

             1. early blinded escape option for non responders from Day 8 to Day 28 with here an
                add-on dose of 150mg canakinumab followed by blinded uptitration at the next
                scheduled visit (Day 29)

             2. late unblinded escape option for non responders from Day 29 to Day 112; with
                open-label uptitration

        3. Epoch 3: a randomized withdrawal epoch of 24 weeks where canakinumab responders from the
           randomized treatment epoch were re-randomized to canakinumab 150mg q8w or placebo to
           assess the potential for canakinumab to maintain clinical efficacy at a reduced dosing
           frequency;

        4. Epoch 4: an open-label treatment epoch of 72 weeks to collect long-term
