      hemorrhagic stroke directly transferred from an acute hospital to our Institute for inpatient
      rehabilitation. Within admission assessment, patients will be classified according to stroke
      type, stroke localisation and time since stroke. Comorbidities will be recorded and
      associated neurological deficits will be assessed. Post mictional residue will be determined
      in all patients one day after admission. The patients with urinary disorders will be treated
      according to the published official protocol, either using the immediate urination approach
      or the bladder diary approach. Continence will be regularly assessed by the nursing staff.
      Urination-disorder-related complications (pressure ulcers, falls and urinary infections),
      drug therapy and the use of continence aids will also be followed.
