      neuropathy, foot ulcers, or leg amputation. Among them, peripheral arterial disease (PAD) is
      an important expression of systemic atherosclerosis. With the progress of the disease,
      impaired peripheral blood circulation will lead to many symptoms and signs, such as pain,
      paresthesia, and numbness.

      In past studies show that regular exercise with moderate intensity may help to improve
      metabolism and hemodynamic characteristics of the individual. In addition, many studies have
      found that despite substantial organic changes in downstream tissue, exercise training can
      improve walking ability and aerobic capacity in patients with peripheral arterial disease.

      To enhance exercise capacity in patients with PAD may involve redistribution of blood ﬂow
      from vascular beds with lower O 2 exchange rates towards exercising ischemic muscles, an
      increase in nutritive leg muscle blood ﬂow at the expense of regional shunting mechanisms,
      increased peripheral O 2 use during exercise attributable to more optimal distribution of leg
      blood ﬂow, and possible increased muscle capillary density and mitochondrial capacity.

      Therefore, we tried to mimic local (leg) ischemic- reperfusion by systemic exercise, or to
      practice remote preconditioning effect by interval occlusion of the blood vessel in the upper
      arm which acquired ischemic preconditioning effect, and to improve local blood flow.
      Furthermore, the hemagglutination performance in PAD patients may also be used as an
      important indicator of cardiovascular disease
