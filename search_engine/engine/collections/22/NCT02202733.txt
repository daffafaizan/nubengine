    
      Phase I. Conduct 2-4 focus groups with 6-10 caretaker, who report eating foods prepared away
      from home â‰¥3 times per week, per group to gain insight into current eating behaviors of foods
      prepared away from home, current perceptions about a home prepared evening meal, and barriers
      to preparing evening meals at home. Information gathered during Phase I will be used to
      inform intervention development in Phase II.

      Phase II. Develop, refine, and manualize a skill-based cooking intervention for
      overweight/obese caretakers of a child aged 3-10 years. The aim of Phase II is to test the
      feasibility of a skill-based cooking intervention to reduce the consumption of foods prepared
      away from home for the evening meal (e.g., pre-prepared frozen foods, restaurant foods, fast
      food, take-out), energy intake from evening meals, and promote a healthy weight in parents
      and children. Information collected during Phase I will inform the development of the
      skill-based cooking intervention. Once developed, the intervention will be refined with 6
      primary caretakers of a child, who meet criteria for being overweight/obese during a testing
      phase. Conducting the intervention with at least six families will provide the opportunity
      for further refinement of intervention procedures. The results will be important to
      demonstrate feasibility for a future pilot randomized controlled trial that will test the
      impact of a skill-based cooking intervention compared to a standard cooking demonstration
      where recipes are simply provided to families.
