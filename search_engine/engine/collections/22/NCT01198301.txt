    
      1. Metastatic breast cancer tissue is obtained from core needle biopsies pretreatment and
           is flash frozen and stored at -70â„ƒ until processing.

        2. After patients received docetaxel combination thiotepa for two cycles, response is
           assessed using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumor Group (RECIST) guidelines.
           Degree of response is used to divide the cancers into two groups-sensitive and resistant
           tumours.

        3. The gene expression in metastatic breast cancer tissue sample is detected by microarray
           to screen gene markers that are differently expressed between groups

        4. Statistical analysis is performed using unsupervised hierarchical cluster.
