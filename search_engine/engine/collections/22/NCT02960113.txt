      under regional anesthesia and in the postoperative period following cesarean section. These
      side effects are distressing for both the parturient and her family. In addition,
      intraoperative vomiting causes significant challenges for the surgeon, such as increased
      procedure length, increased risk of bleeding, increased risk of gastric content aspiration,
      and potential surgical trauma.

      To combat the nausea and vomiting seen in all above anesthetic modalities, but to a greater
      degree in regional anesthesia, a number of pharmacological interventions are currently used
      with varying degrees of effectiveness in the perioperative period. These medications come
      from a wide range of drug classes including serotonin and dopamine receptor antagonists,
      corticosteroids, antihistamines, sedatives and anticholinergics.

      In our study, we would like to compare the effectiveness of antiemetic agents or technique
      which cause less severe adverse reactions to the mother and her fetus. Out of the available
      pharmacological agents for reduction of intra-cesarean section nausea and vomiting,
      transdermal scopolamine patch is one of the safest medications. We would like to compare the
      effectiveness of the transdermal scopolamine patch with acupressure point P6 stimulation
      versus just transdermal scopolamine patch versus just acupressure point P6 stimulation.
