      is focused on sibling relationships and parenting of siblings as synergistic targets of
      change to promote positive interpersonal family dynamics and parent and youth psychosocial
      and behavioral health and well-being. This translational effort builds on strong theoretical
      and empirical premises including a successful pilot study (ASU SIBS Program). Using a
      rigorous design and measurement, aims are to: (a) test the efficacy of SIBS, delivered via 12
      weekly afterschool sibling sessions and 3 family nights in the familiar elementary school
      setting, versus a contact-equivalent attention control condition. Mexican-origin sibling
      dyads (5th graders and younger siblings; N = 288 dyads) and their parents will be recruited
      from economically disadvantaged elementary schools and randomly assigned within school to
      intervention or contact-equivalent attention control conditions. Assessments will be
      conducted at pre-test, post-test, and 18-month follow-up. Program effects will be tested on
      primary and secondary outcomes, including sibling relationship quality (i.e., warmth and
      negativity), sibling relationship skills, children's efficacy (social, emotional), children's
      internalizing symptoms, parents' stress and depressive symptoms, parent-child warmth and
      conflict, and family cohesion. Findings will advance prevention science by identifying an
      efficacious program that capitalizes on cultural assets to promote positive family dynamics
      and psychosocial well-being among Latinos, including by incorporating daily measurements of
      intervention targets (sibling relationship skills) to identify mechanisms underlying program
      effects.
