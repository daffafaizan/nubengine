      refractive errors. Planned research will be carried out in Public Sector Secondary Schools of
      Islamabad and vision of 1200 students (600 girls and 600 boys) will be tested.Students having
      vision â‰¤ 6/9 will receive cycloplegic auto refraction and prescription of spectacles will be
      given after subjective refraction ( 3 days after cycloplegia ). Follow-up at three months
      after prescribing spectacles will find out compliance towards spectacles. Non-compliant
      students will be given a questionnaire to provide the reasons for non-compliance towards
      spectacles. Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) will be conducted with non-compliant students,
      their teachers and parents to explore reasons of non compliance.

      On the basis of information obtained from FGDs an educational intervention will be planned
      for these students to explain importance of spectacles. Through stratified randomization
      schools will be assigned to intervention and control groups. Educational intervention will be
      given to intervention group Three months after the intervention compliance pre and post
      intervention in intervention group and between two groups will be compared to assess
      effectiveness of intervention.
