      option for patients anatomically and structurally suited to receive a reverse shoulder
      arthroplasty. The aim of the Biomet Comprehensive Reverse Shoulder is to increase shoulder
      function while reducing pain.

      This is a multi-center study. Having several clinical sites will allow for multiple
      investigators to contribute to the results of the study. 175 implants will be included into
      the study. All potential study subjects will be required to participate in the Informed
      Consent Process.
