      pembrolizumab or KEYTRUDA

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied. In the case of this
      trial, the investigators are studying whether pembrolizumab can treat pediatric
      hepatocellular carcinoma.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved pembrolizumab for your
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses in adults. Checkpoint inhibitors are
      in early-phase study in pediatric patients across diagnoses.

      In this research study, the investigators plan to investigate whether pediatric patients with
      hepatocellular carcinoma experience stable disease or response to pembrolizumab. In addition,
      the investigators would like to explore different biological factors of the tumor and immune
      system that might help us predict whether pediatric patients with HCC may benefit from
      treatment with pembrolizumab.
