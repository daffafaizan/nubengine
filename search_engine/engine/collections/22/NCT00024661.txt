      for 8 weeks in patients with advanced malignancies.

      II. Characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics of LErafAON after IV infusion.

      III. Document in vivo inhibition of Raf-1 protein by LErafAON.

      IV. Detect anti-tumor effects of intravenous LErafAON.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a Phase I Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) study for patients with
      recurrent solid tumor malignancies. Study medication will be administered by intravenous
      infusion over at least 60 minutes, once per week, for 8 weeks. In the absence of progression,
      patients may continue on weekly treatment. Pre-medications will be administered prior to each
      dose of study medication. Patients will be followed for one month after receiving the last
      dose of study medication. Patients with Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR), or
      Stable Disease (SD) at the Week 8 disease assessment may continue to receive study medication
      until disease progression (PD).

      Cohorts of at least three patients will be entered at escalating dose-levels. Each cohort
      will be observed for at least ten days after receiving the first dose of treatment before
      additional patients are treated at a higher dose level. Patients will be followed for one
      month after receiving the last dose of study medication. The study will stop when a maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is identified. Dose escalation within a patient will not be allowed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Estimated enrollment is 15-35 patients; 3 per dose level, expanded to 6 if
      DLT occurs.
