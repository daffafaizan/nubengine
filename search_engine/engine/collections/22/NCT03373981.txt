      stimulation (rTMS) for symptom reduction of depression and cognitive loss among patients with
      Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) and other Neurodegenerative Diseases. Behavioral symptoms
      in ALS have been under scrutiny since its earliest descriptions, nearly 30 years ago (1). The
      importance of these symptoms among subjects with ALS has been also been under steady
      scrutiny. Studies have shown that the rates of anxiety and depression are significantly
      higher among subjects with ALS than the general population (1-23). Anxiety symptoms are
      related to depression, quality of life, and satisfaction with life (4, 9, 11, 15, 20, 24-26).
      Depressive symptoms are closely related to the ALS disease process (2).

      rTMS has been shown to be a promising tool in modulating mood, memory, and cognitive
      performance (27). Current approaches to the management of ALS involve addressing
      symptomatology associated with the disease process. Among patients with ALS and other similar
      Neurodegenerative disorders, it is therefore important to understand if rTMS as an
      intervention is capable of:

        1. Symptomatic improvement in mood,

        2. Causing a significant positive change in disease progression or

        3. Helping improve quality of life.
