      cancer, especially in BRCA carriers. Prevention and early detection strategies in these high
      risk women include risk reducing surgery, chemoprevention and close surveillance with
      semiannual clinical breast exams and yearly mammograms starting at age 25-35. Unfortunately,
      screening mammography detects only half the breast cancers in mutation carriers, presumably
      due to higher breast density in the younger women and perhaps due to inherent characteristics
      of their tumors such as rapid growth. In light of these limitations in this high risk group,
      some have suggested incorporation of semiannual mammograms and/or other imaging modalities
      such as ultrasound (US) and MRI.

      In this study, high risk women who have a suspicious mammographic lesion - categorized as
      Breast Imaging Reporting and data System (BI-RADS) 4 will be recruited to undergo a breast
      MRI before to a biopsy of the suspicious abnormality. All women will undergo a biopsy as a
      part of her standard of care. The results of the MRI will not influence our decision on
      whether a biopsy should be performed. The MRI results will be compared with the biopsy
      results with pathology as the gold standard.
