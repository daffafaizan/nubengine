      that accumulates on the brain surface over weeks to months. It predominately affects older
      people and often has a delayed association with a preceding head trauma.

      There has been significant growth in the number of CSDH publications in recent years
      mirroring progress in potential management options but there is wide variation in how and
      when patient outcome is measured amongst studies. Much could be gained by agreeing a minimum
      set of standardized outcomes that should be measured and reported in all CSDH studies, known
      as a Core Outcome Set (COS).

      The overall study design includes a Delphi survey process.This is a process whereby all
      outcomes and data elements from the CSDH literature and expert opinion are presented to a
      large group of patients, carers and HCPR via a survey. Each survey participant has the
      opportunity to rank the elements and outcomes in levels of importance to them, and the survey
      is then repeated including presentation of the results from the first round, in order to
      attempt to gain agreement between participants on what is important. All elements are then
      reviewed at a final "consensus" meeting
