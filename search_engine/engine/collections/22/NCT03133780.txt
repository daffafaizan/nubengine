      However, patients are often reluctant to remain awake during a procedure. Sedation has been
      shown to increase patient satisfaction during regional anesthesia and may be considered as a
      means to increase the patient's acceptance.Therefore, provision of adequate sedation is
      important if the advantages of spinal anesthesia are to be fully appreciated.
