      double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study EP0069, the current open-label
      extension study EP0073 will provide an opportunity to continue UCB0942 treatment after a
      careful evaluation of the individual benefit-risk balance and with close monitoring of
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of long-term study treatment.
