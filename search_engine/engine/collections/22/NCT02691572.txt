      parturients with full-term singleton pregnancy undergoing elective cesarean delivery under
      spinal anesthesia. Patients will receive either ultrasound-guided transversus abdominis plane
      block or wound infiltration at the end of surgery. After delivery, all patients will receive
      standard analgesia (intravenous ketorolac and oral paracetamol) and patient-controlled
      analgesia with intravenous fentanyl. Total fentanyl consumption at 24 h, pain scores at 2, 4,
      6, 12, and 24 h, side effects, and patient satisfaction will be compared between the 2
      groups.
