      advanced, and metastatic biliary tract cancer is better than that compared to best supportive
      care. In general, gemcitabine based combination chemotherapies are considered as the first
      line treatment for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer, but these have some
      limitations of inconvenience of administration and unsatisfactory efficacy.

      S-1 monotherapy and combination with oxaliplatin have shown the objective response rate of
      21-35% and 24.5%, respectively, and irinotecan combined with oxaliplatin has shown the
      response rate of 18-20.5% in patients with advanced metastatic biliary tract cancer. So the
      investigators had conducted the phase I study of three drugs (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, and
      S-1) with modification of dosage and schedule and will conduct a phase II study with
      recommended dose of triple chemotherapy from this phase I study.
