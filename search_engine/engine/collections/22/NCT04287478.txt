      urinary tract infection (UTI). Patients to be enrolled will have urinary tract infections due
      to E. coli and K. pneumoniae. This will include asymptomatic patients with neurogenic bladder
      and symptomatic patients with complicated urinary tract infections who are at risk of UTI
      recurrence. Patients will be followed for bacterial clearance or recurrence of urinary tract
      infection.
