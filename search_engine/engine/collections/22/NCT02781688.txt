      in increasing physical activity among persons with depression. Individuals meeting
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the 12-week intervention. Intervention
      components will include self-monitoring, Active Living counseling, and facility access. Blood
      samples will be collected at baseline. Assessments (anxiety, stress, sleep) and sample
      collection will also occur at 2 time points during the intervention (Weeks 7 and 13). Changes
      in physical activity will be assessed using Fitbits to measure weekly minutes of
      moderate/vigorous activity.
