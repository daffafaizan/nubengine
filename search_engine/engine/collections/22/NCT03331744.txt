      prevalence of 4%-5%. IHs may be presented in any part of body including the visceral organs,
      but are preferentially located on the face, head and neck area. IHs exhibit a characteristic
      life cycle consisting of a rapid proliferating phase within the first year of life followed
      by a slowly involuted phase lasting for up to five years. Although most resolve over time
      without major sequelae, a significant subset can result in severe complications including
      disfiguring and ulceration, some even could impair organ functions and threaten patients'
      life. Risk factors of IHs have been identified including multiple gestation, low birth
      weight, prematurity, white race, eclampsia and placental abnormalities. However, the exact
      occurrence, clinical features and risk factors of IHs is still unknown in Chinese patients
      because of the lack of large scale of prospective studies. In addition, characteristics of
      ulceration of IHs and infantile hepatic hemangiomas (IHHs) are also not well documented.
      Therefore, it's important to perform this prospective study to determine the clinical
      features of Chinese patients with IHs, and this study will also make contributions to the
      prevents, diagnoses and treatments of IHs.
