      intravenously. The major clinical manifestations are pruritus and painï¼Œand the incidence vary
      between 38%-71%. Some patients undergo spontaneous remission, while others develop into
      severe pain or pruritus. Dezocine, a new synthetic opiate agonist-antagonist, has been used
      for the treatment of pain and pruritus, but its role in relieving dexamethasone induced
      perineal irritation has not been studied yet. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      efficacy of dezocine pretreatment on dexamethasone induced perineal irritation.
