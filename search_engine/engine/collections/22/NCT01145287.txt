      categorized in three groups according to symptoms and signs leading to the diagnosis as
      classical symptoms, extraintestinal symptoms and screen-detected, the latest being further
      divided to those presenting with symptoms and those who are totally asymptomatic. Several
      parameters assessing general health and well-being, quality of life and healthcare resource
      utilization are evaluated at baseline and after one and five years on trial. Quality of life
      is compared to that of non-celiac controls.
