      the time the subject enters the operating room to the time the subject go to the recovery
      room are the same as those for the existing spine surgery. Immediately after entering the
      operating room, immediately before going to the recovery room, and at postoperative day 1 and
      2, the patient's systemic skin condition is assessed to determine whether pressure damage has
      occurred. The primary endpoint is the incidence of pressure injury in the subject compared
      with the incidence of pressure injury in previous studies. To identify the risk factors for
      the occurrence of pressure injury, the investigators will statistically analyze the data
      collected with the assumption that this is related.
