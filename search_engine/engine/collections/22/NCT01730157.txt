      I. To estimate the safety and efficacy of sequential hepatic radioembolization and systemic
      ipilimumab in patients with uveal melanoma metastatic to liver.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate effects on regulators of tumor immunity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo radioembolization with yttrium Y 90 glass microspheres via hepatic arterial
      infusion on day 1. Beginning on day 29, patients also receive ipilimumab intravenously (IV)
      over 90 minutes. Treatment with ipilimumab repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
