      (dyads) to the Brenner Families in Training (FIT) group or the Brenner Families in Training
      Mobile (mFIT) group. All youth participants will receive a commercially available activity
      monitor. Caregivers will receive podcasts with a story about a caregiver supporting weight
      loss in a child by providing healthy foods/activities for his/her family, including healthy
      eating and physical activity information. Children will receive animated videos that contain
      healthy eating and physical activity messaging, with an engaging story of a child losing
      weight. All participants will have access to a website and mobile apps where they will track
      weight, diet, and physical activity for themselves (youth) or their child (parents). Based on
      their reports of weight, eating, and physical activity, the messaging received from clinical
      staff by the families will be individually tailored to promote healthy behaviors and overcome
      perceived barriers. The proposed research is innovative in that it explicitly incorporates
      theory into the intervention and evaluation components of the project and builds upon an
      existing literature on mobile health interventions that use mobile technology.
