      3 days) at clinically determined Return to Play (RTP) and 45 days after RTP, for the purpose
      of independently validating the performance of the algorithms developed in prior studies
      (NCT02477943, NCT02661633 and NCTXXXXXX). Data collected under this study will be combined
      with that collected under NCT02957461 for the final analyses of prospective algorithm
      performance in an independent population ages 13-25 years. Subjects will come from the sports
      and other populations of concussed individuals. They will be matched with controls i.e. not
      head injured subjects who will also undergo the same set of tests and the same time intervals
      as the injured subjects. An additional pool of uninjured (not head injured) subjects will be
      collected who will be assessed at a single time point.
