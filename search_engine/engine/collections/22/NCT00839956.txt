      I. Evaluate the toxicity of the use of vorinostat and bortezomib as maintenance therapy after
      autologous transplant.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the median time to disease progression.

      II. Evaluate survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive bortezomib intravenously (IV) on days 2 and 5 and vorinostat orally
      (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 12 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
