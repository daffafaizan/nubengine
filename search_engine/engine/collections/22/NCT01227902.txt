    
      This is an open-label, multi-centre, flexible dose study of retigabine immediate release
      (IR). The study will enroll male and female outpatients (â‰¥ 18 years of age) with
      partial-onset seizures (POS) who are inadequately controlled on their current monotherapy
      Antiepileptic Drug (AED). Following a Screening Period of up to 2 weeks, subjects will enter
      an 8-week Baseline Phase to determine baseline seizure frequency. At the end of the Baseline
      Phase, subjects who meet or exceed the minimum seizure frequency of 4 partial seizures per 56
      days, will enter the Treatment Period (4 weeks Titration, 16 weeks Flexible Dose Evaluation
      Phase). All subjects will receive retigabine IR starting at 150 mg/day and will be titrated
      to 600 mg/day by Week 4. From Week 5 onwards, subjects' doses will be maintained between 300
      to 1200 mg/day using a flexible dosing regimen to optimise response and tolerability. The
      maximum duration of the study is approximately 33 weeks (inclusive of a 3 week
      Taper/Follow-up Phase).
