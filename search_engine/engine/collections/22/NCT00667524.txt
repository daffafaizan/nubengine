    
      Eosinophilic esophagitis (EE) is a chronic, increasingly recognized disease of the esophagus,
      clinico-pathologically characterized by a proton-pump-inhibitor resistant, dense esophageal
      eosinophilia in combination with esophagus-related symptoms. Patients suffer mainly from
      dysphagia, a feared long-term complication is the evolution of esophageal stenoses leading to
      food-bolus impaction that have to be removed endoscopically. Anti-inflammatory therapy with
      systemic or topical corticosteroids have shown to be efficacious in children as well as in
      adults. However, relapses occur in general soon after the cessation of this medication. In
      addition, several studies have demonstrated that in adults with active EE dilation is an
      alternative safe and efficacious therapeutic option. Surprisingly, the symptom-free period
      seems to be much longer after this procedure than after medical treatment. Today, the
      selection of these two procedures depends more on local practices than on evidence based
      data, because robust data are lacking. Furthermore, there are concerns regarding the risk of
      the dilation-procedure (possible esophageal perforations and major bleeding). Furthermore, it
      has not yet been assessed if dilation changes the underlying eosinophilic inflammation. If
      not, investigations should be performed to evaluate if long-term anti-eosinophilic therapy is
      able to change the natural course of the disease and reduce the stricturing complications.
