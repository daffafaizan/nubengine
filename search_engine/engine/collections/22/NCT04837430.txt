      in cases with hypotensive shock, profound shock or whom do not have a response to initial
      crystalloid therapy. Currently, treatment of DSS remains almost supportive, with particular
      emphasis on careful fluid management. However, fluid overload is a common complication of
      this treatment, lead to many difficulties in management of severe Dengue children, accompany
      with morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis of fluid overload mostly based on clinical features
      and chest X-ray or ultrasound. Until now, no biomarker are widely using for diagnosis of
      fluid overload in clinical. NT-proBNP is secreted when stretching the wall of the cardiac
      muscle. This may a suitable biomarker to discover the fluid overload state in children with
      DSS. Troponin I is a biomarker of cardiac muscle damage.
