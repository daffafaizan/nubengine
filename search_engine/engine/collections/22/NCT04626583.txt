    
      The "Safety of Locally Delivered Allogeneic Mesenchymal Stem Cells for Promoting Corneal
      Repair Study" otherwise known as the "MSC Study," is designed to assess the safety of
      allogeneic bone marrow-derived MSC secreted factor on the ocular surface via subconjunctival
      injection of MSC, and also obtain a preliminary observation on the following:

        1. Epithelial Wound Closure.

        2. Development of Scarring.

        3. Final Visual Acuity.

      The objective is to improve clinical outcomes in significant non-healing corneal wounds. To
      achieve these goals, the MSC Study will include a Phase I dose-escalation safety study.
