      emotional disorder will be processed with randomized, patient-assessor blinding, and
      sham-acupuncture controlled study design. Sixty eight subjects would be collected and divided
      into two groups(experimental and placebo, 34 subjects each). Experimental group will undergo
      with real acupuncture treatment(manual acupuncture + electroacupuncture) and placebo group
      will undergo with sham acupuncture treatment (acupuncture without skin penetration +
      electroacupuncture without electrical stimulation) twice a week, for 4 weeks. The effect on
      parameters related with pain and emotional disorder will be assessed at 1(baseline: just
      before the beginning of treatment) and 5(primary end point: 1 week after the end of
      treatment) weeks. Functional magnetic resonance imaging will be also conducted for 52
      subjects(experimental and placebo, 20 among 34 subjects each + normal control 12 subjects) at
      1 and 5 weeks to seek machanism of acupuncture.
