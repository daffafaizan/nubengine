      beneficial effect of cannabis in Crohn's disease. The investigators have also concluded a
      double blind placebo controlled study of Inhaled cannabis in the treatment of Crohn's
      disease. Both studies have shown significant symptomatic improvement of disease. However,
      objective parameters of inflammation were not measured. The question arises as to whether the
      observed improvement is merely symptomatic or due to a real change in inflammation. In
      addition, administration per os is a healthier option than smoking but the efficacy of oral
      cannabis was not investigated.

      The aim of the proposed study in to evaluate the efficacy of drops of cannabis oil in crohn's
      disease patients compared to placebo. Treatment success will be defined as a decrease of at
      least 100 points in CDAI after 8 weeks of treatment.

      Secondary aims:

        1. Remission of disease i.e CDAI of less the 150 points.

        2. Improvement of at least one point in Endoscopic disease activity index

        3. Improvement of CRP and calprotectine

        4. Improvement of blood cytokine levels

        5. Improvement of at least 30 points in quality of life as measured by the SF 36. In
           addition the investigators will monitor side effects by questionnaires addressed to the
           patients and to a significant relative of the patients.
