      for long-term improvement. Anecdotal reports and case studies suggest good outcomes with
      various physical therapy interventions however well-designed research studies examining
      treatments in combination are lacking. The management of lumbar radicular pain often includes
      the combination of physical therapy and therapeutic selective nerve root blocks with the
      rationale that reducing inflammation and pain will permit greater participation in physical
      therapy. The effectiveness of this combination of treatment has not been studied and is the
      purpose of this pilot study.
