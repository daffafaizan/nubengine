      in this survey. As of 04/28, 1567 EGID patients have enrolled in CEGIR CR [EoE=1,217, EG=56,
      EGE=65, EC=52; multiple diseases=177]

      The survey will be conducted through a pre-designed questionnaire. The questionnaire will be
      sent to participants via an introductory email wherein subjects will be informed about the
      purpose of this study. The questionnaire will gather self-reported clinical information (such
      as diagnosis, endoscopic procedures, histological findings in mucosal biopsies, and
      therapeutic plan). Consent will be obtained from participants to contact their physicians and
      allow their physicians to share relevant clinical information from their medical records.

      Physicians identified by participants will be emailed a website link which will take them to
      a questionnaire. This questionnaire is designed to gather relevant information as documented
      in the patient's clinical records. Physicians will be able to submit the information online.
      It is anticipated that responding to this questionnaire would take less than 10 minutes of
      their time.
