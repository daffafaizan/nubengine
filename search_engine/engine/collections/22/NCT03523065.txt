    
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common disorder among neurodegenerative diseases.
      GBA gene variants such as L444P can influence the risk of developing PD and these variants
      have the greatest impact on PD susceptibility among all the PD related gene variants yet
      discovered. The investigators aim to establish a database of PD with GBA variants and
      characterize the clinical manifestation of these patients in mainland China.

      Method:

        1. Peripheral blood from patients has been tested to have GBA gene variants.

        2. Clinical manifestation will be measured by scales and neurological tests. Standard
           scales include: Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale(UPDRS), Hoehn-Yahr stages,
           Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS), mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Parkinson disease
           sleep scales (PDSS), Rapid Eye Movement Sleep Behaviour Disorder Questionnaire(RBDQ-HK),
           Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Rome III functional constipation scale, the Scale for
           Outcomes in PD for Autonomic Symptoms (SCOPA-AUT), Parkinson Fatigue Scale (PFS),
           Cambridge-Hopkins Restless Legs Syndrome questionnaire (CHRLSq), Hyposmia rating
           scale(HRS), Hamilton depression scale, the 39-item Parkinson's Disease
           Questionnaire(PDQ-39), Freezing of gait scale(FOG), dyskinesia related scales,
           Wearing-off scale(WO).

        3. The investigators will also exam the blood biomarkers of PD such as uric acid and
           peripheral inflammatory markers.
