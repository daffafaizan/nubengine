    
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-954. This study will assess the safety,
      tolerability, PK and PD of single ascending TAK-954 higher intravenous doses than those
      previously studied.

      The study will enroll approximately 6 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (By chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment sequences-which will remain
      undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need).

      In each treatment sequence, each participant will receive 2 doses of active drug out of 3
      dose levels (TAK-954 0.5 mg, TAK-954 1 mg, or TAK-954 2 mg) and 1 dose of Placebo. Dose
      escalation will be based on the available safety/tolerability data from the previous period.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 73 days. Participants will make a final visit on
      Day 16 after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
