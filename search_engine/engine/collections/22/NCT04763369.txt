      (UMSCs): The culturing and characterization of UMSCs will be performed as documented by Ali
      and colleagues. Briefly, human umbilical cord tissues along with informed consent forms will
      be collected from COVID-19- and hepatitis B, C virus-negative women with healthy pregnancies
      during the Cesarean Section surgery after completion of gestation period. The umbilical cord
      tissue will be transported in sterile 1x phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing
      penicillin and streptomycin on ice. In the biosafety cabinet, the cord will be washed with
      4-5 changes of sterile 1x PBS and placed in a Petri plate with 15ml PBS. The cord will then
      gently scrap with a surgical blade to remove any dead cells. A 9 cm umbilical cord will be
      cut into three equal pieces and wash thoroughly to remove blood clots, umbilical cord
      arteries, and veins. Segments will be washed three times with PBS and minced. The minced
      pieces will be incubated in 17.5ml of collagenase solution (201 U/ml collagenase type I in
      serum-free DMEM-HG) in a 50ml conical tube for ~3 hrs in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity
      at 37oC. After ~3 hrs, the digested lysate will be passed through strainer and will be
      diluted three times with 1x PBS. Following centrifugation, the cells will be seeded into two
      T-25cm2 flasks and will be placed in an incubator at 5% CO2, 95% humidity at 37o C. The
      flasks will be fed with fresh media (DMEM-HG supplemented with 20% FBS and 1% antibiotic
      solution) every third day. At around day 18, cells will reach up to 85% confluency and will
      be transferred in two T-75cm2 flasks with media replaced at alternate days. UMSCs at P3 will
      be characterized using different specific antibodies. Cells at P3 will be employed for
      injection in RP patients.
