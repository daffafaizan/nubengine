        1. Study visits occurred at baseline; at weeks 4; and at 2, 4, 6,12,18,24,30 months.

        2. Disease activity was measured on the basis of the BVAS/WG and the physician's global
           assessment.

        3. Damage related to disease or treatment was scored according to the Vasculitis Damage
           Index (scores for this index range from 0 to 64, with higher scores in- dicating more
           severe damage).

        4. Health related quality of life was scored with the use of the Med- ical Outcomes Study
           36-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36).Scores on this scale range from 0 to 100, with
           higher scores indicating better health.

        5. Serial serum samples were tested for proteinase 3-ANCA and myeloperoxidase-ANCA by means
           of a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
