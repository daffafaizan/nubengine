      Mother-infant dyads with infants born at 36 weeks or earlier were assessed for eligibility.
      Data collection was conducted after obtaining written consent from the mothers. Mother-infant
      dyads who met the inclusion criteria were randomly allocated to either the intervention or
      the treatment-as-usual control group. Each dyad was assessed at six time points, i.e.,
      baseline, immediately after intervention/TAU, and when the infants were at the
      gestation-corrected ages of 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.
