    
      This is an international, multicentre, parallel-group, event-driven, randomised, double-blind
      study in patients with HFpEF, evaluating the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo,
      given once daily in addition to background regional standard of care therapy, including
      treatments to control co-morbidities, in reducing the composite of CV death and heart failure
      events (hospitalisations for HF or urgent HF visits). Adult patients aged â‰¥40 years with
      HFpEF (LVEF >40% and evidence of structural heart disease) and New York Heart Association
      (NYHA) class II-IV who are eligible according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either dapagliflozin 10 mg or placebo. Both out-patients
      and in-patients hospitalised for heart failure and off intravenous heart failure-therapy for
      24 hours can be randomised. It is estimated that approximately 11000 patients at
      approximately 400-500 sites in 20-25 countries will need to be enrolled to reach the target
      of approximately 6100 randomised patients.
