      than 2.6 mg/dl within the first 3 month post transplant would be eligible for this study of
      the safety of enalapril 5 mg vs placebo. Patients with serum potassium persistently over 5.5
      mEQ/L would be excluded. This is a double-blinded randomized control study. End-points of the
      study are a persistent rise in serum creatinine of >30% from baseline not otherwise explained
      by clinical evaluation, and persistent serum potassium >5.9mEQ/L. Study duration is 6 month.
      At the end of the study patients will be continued on ACEI if clinically stable
