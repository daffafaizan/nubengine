      Up to 27 participants will be enrolled. Each participant will receive the study agent by
      intravitreal injection in one eye on a single occasion. Enrollment will begin with the lowest
      dose and will proceed to higher doses only after review of safety data by a Data and Safety
      Monitoring Committee (DSMC). Participants in the dose escalation phase will be ≥ 18 years of
      age. After the maximum tolerated dose is identified individuals ≥ 6 years of age will be
      enrolled.

      Safety will be measured by the number and proportion of participants experiencing adverse
      events and immune response to RS1. Efficacy will be measured by evaluation of changes in
      visual function and schisis cavity size.
