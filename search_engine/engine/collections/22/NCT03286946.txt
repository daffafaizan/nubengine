      There are potential risks associated with transforaminal epidural block such as infection,
      dural puncture, bleeding, and intravascular injection. Although the risk is low,
      intravascular injection should be carefully monitored because intravascular injection of
      particulate steroids can cause fatal neurologic deficits such as spinal infarction and
      cerebral infarction.

      The incidence of intravascular injection during transforaminal epidural block with real time
      fluoroscopy guidance depends on spinal level. The previous studies using real time
      fluoroscopy demonstrated that the incidence of intravascular injection of cervical
      transforaminal epidural block is higher than that of lumbosacral transforaminal epidural
      block.

      In this study, therefore, the investigators investigate the incidence of intravascular
      injection during cervical transforaminal epidural block using blunt needle, compared to the
      sharp needle.
