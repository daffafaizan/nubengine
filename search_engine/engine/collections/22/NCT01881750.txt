      (PRTG) in targeting language skills in young children with autism. Research has demonstrated
      that behavioral interventions, such as Pivotal Response Training (PRT), lead to improvements
      in the core symptoms of autism. Researchers have begun to develop strategies to investigate
      the effectiveness of teaching parents how to implement PRT in a group format, as opposed to
      an individual format. Preliminary data has demonstrated that teaching PRT in a group format
      has shown to be effective in teaching parents and increasing children's communication skills.
      The purpose of this study is to further examine the effectiveness of teaching pivotal
      response treatment to parents of children with autism in a group format. To determine the
      effectiveness of pivotal response training group (PRTG) it will be compared to another parent
      education group by conducting a randomized controlled 12-week trial. PRTG will aim to teach
      parents pivotal response training strategies, whereas the parent psychoeducational group
      (PEG) will aim to teach parents information with regards to assessment and treatment for
      children with autism. By conducting this research it will improve researchers understanding
      of group treatment options for individuals with autism and allow us to help in the
      development of therapeutic approaches that can meet the increasing service demands for
      families.
