           gender, state of residence, time lived together, birth order), rosacea duration, prior
           rosacea treatment, diet (and similarity of diet to twin), co-morbidities, signs and
           symptoms suggestive of cardiovascular or gastrointestinal disease/disorder.

        2. Subjects will be examined by a board-certified dermatologist and global assessment,
           inflammatory counts and clinician's erythema score will be performed. Eyes will be
           examined for signs of ocular rosacea.

        3. Facial microbiome sampling will be performed on-site utilizing a kit manufactured by
           UBiome. The skin with active rosacea will be swabbed and the swab immediately placed in
           sample medium. The tube is then shipped to the manufacturer for 16s rRNA shotgun
           metagenomics to identify resident bacterial genera and species. (16) This can be
           compared to their extensive library of normal controls, to the other member of the twin
           set and to acne subjects.

        4. Subjects will be given a fecal microbiome kit for home sampling. Feces obtained from
           toilet paper is collected and placed in the sample medium. Subjects can either ship
           directly or return to the study site for shipping.
