      problem. Implantation of a small aortic valve sometimes leads to high residual gradients,
      despite a normally functioning prosthesis. Patients with a small aortic annulus, especially
      those with a large body surface area, are at higher risk of prosthesis-patient mismatch,
      which is associated with worse clinical outcomes and decreased survival. The purpose of this
      study was to compare the hemodynamic performance among the 2 management strategies (standard
      AVR with stented bioprosthesis and Ozaki procedure) in the context of a small aortic annulus
      (<21 mm)
