      expiratory pressure (PEP) is one treatment suggested to improve lung function after surgery,
      but there is a lack of evidence of effect. En passant, we observed that oxygen saturation was
      improved when patients talked postoperative day 1. We aim to test whether speaking and
      singing improve postoperative oxygen saturation and ventilation after abdominal surgery.

      In a cross-over design, 64 subjects will be randomized (1:1) to start with either PEP
      maneuvers, i.e. 3 x 10 deep inspiration followed by expiration in a positive expiratory
      pressure device of 10-15 cm H20 or to start with reading a text loudly during 3 minutes. The
      experiment will end with singing a song. Patients will be monitored using Noxturnal T3, Res
      Med for respiration and pulse oximetry. SenTec Digital Monitoring systems for online
      transcutaneous carbon dioxide partial pressure (PtcCO2) measurements. Main outcome
      measurements include oxygen saturation and PtcPCO2.

      Arterial blood gases and Peak expiratory flow will be taken/measured at study start. Patients
      will be recommended to talk loudly every hour during the rest of the hospital study if the
      are assigned to talking in the first arm, and to use PEP every hour if they were assigned to
      PEP in the first arm. Peak expiratory flow will be measured and blood gases (PaO2, PCO2) will
      be taken the day after the experiment (secondary outcomes).
