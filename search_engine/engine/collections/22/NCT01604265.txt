      seven to ten day baseline period, followed by a four week double blind, randomised, parallel
      group comparison of Sativex, with placebo. The study medication was self-titrated to symptom
      resolution or maximum tolerated or allowed dose. Visits occurred at the end of weeks one and
      four (end of the study) or earlier if they withdrew. A follow-up visit occurred 30 - 40 days
      after completion or withdrawal.
