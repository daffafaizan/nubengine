    
      This will be an observational cohort trial of the pregnancy of women who conceive in RMN
      trials, and of their resulting infants through the first 3 years of life.

      Study specific procedures will include a patient completed log of prescribed and over the
      counter medications taken during a normal pregnancy, a review of their pregnancy, delivery,
      and neonatal records, an exam of the infant within 60 days of birth by a dysmorphologist, and
      yearly review of infant medical records, growth charts, and a yearly parent administered
      developmental questionnaire (Ages and Stages) for the first three years of the infant's life.
