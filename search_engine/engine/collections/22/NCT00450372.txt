      Primary:

        -  Determine the clinical response (complete and partial response) in patients with
           unresectable metastatic melanoma treated with pegylated arginine deiminase.

      Secondary:

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
           this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pegylated arginine deiminase intramuscularly once or twice a week
      in weeks 1-4. Courses repeat every 4 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are acquired at baseline and every 2 weeks thereafter for pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacodynamic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 5 years, and annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study.
