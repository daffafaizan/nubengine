      alternatives to antibiotic treatment of uncomplicated UTIs. Treatment with CLR is a
      nonantibiotic therapy and is compared to an antibiotic treatment. Thus, the trial aim is to
      reduce antibiotics use and moreover to reduce the pressure of developing bacterial resistance
      against antibiotics due to widespread use, which is an additional advantage of the CLR
      therapy.

      The trial results are expected to demonstrate that antibiotic prescriptions in women for
      treatment of lower uUTIs can be reduced by an alternative and safe non-antibiotic treatment.
