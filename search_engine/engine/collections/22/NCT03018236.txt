      important antioxidant agent, and also modulates the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic
      receptor. Glutamate has been associated with the neuroadaptation related to substance use
      disorders, and thus it is considered a potential target for pharmacological interventions
      regarding these disorders. N-acetylcysteine also interacts with the cystine-glutamate
      antiporter on astrocytes hence increasing glutamate release into the extracellular space.

      N-acetylcysteine effects and its implications in the addiction disorders have been studied
      initially with animal models. Glutamate levels normalization through N-acetylcysteine reduced
      compulsive drug self-administration and drug-seeking behavior in mice. In addition, there are
      promising results also with human subjects, showing benefits for cocaine, alcohol and
      cannabis use disorders.

      This study consists of a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial with four arms:
      alcohol users divided into NAC vs Placebo and cocaine users divided into NAC vs Placebo.
