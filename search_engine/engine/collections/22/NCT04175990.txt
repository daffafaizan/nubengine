    
      This is a prospective controlled cohort study conducted at the Department of Medical Assisted
      Conception (MAC) unit of the University Kebangsaan Malaysia Medical Centre (UKMMC). From May
      2018 through May 2019, women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) undergoing
      IVF/intracytoplasmic sperm insemination(ICSI) regimens for the treatment of infertility were
      recruited.

      Patients recruited will then be randomized accordingly using the randomizer software. Group A
      will be the interventional group and group B will be the control group.

      Oocyte retrieval will be performed 34-36 hours following the human chorionic gonadotrophin
      (hCG) trigger. Sperm was obtained on the same day. Mature oocytes will be fertilized with
      sperm via IVF or ICSI. Fertilized embryos were observed via time laps method and the progress
      and cleavage were monitored before planning for embryo transfer. Embryo transfer will be
      performed on day 3 or day 5 after oocyte retrieval.

      All results will be analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences(SPSS) version
      21 software. Descriptive analysis will be done for demographic data and presented in mean Â±
      Standard deviation (SD). Demographic characteristic between the two groups will be compared
      with the use of the Mann-Whitney U test. The categorical data was analysed by using
      Chi-square test for the association of variables. A p-value of 0.05 or less was considered to
      be significant.
