      linagliptin/metformin 2.5/850mg every 12 h + lifestyle modification program, or metformin
      850mg every 12 h + lifestyle modification program during 6 months. Randomization will be
      performed using an electronic random numbers table by a Nutritionist not involved in the
      study. Participants and investigators involved in the patients follow-up and outcome
      measurements will be masked to treatment allocation during the entire study.

      Patients will have a follow-up visit every month. Every appointment is about 30-45 minutes;
      medications tolerance and side effects will be recorded in every patients´ visit. Nutritional
      and physical activity assessment according to the patient´s weight will be performed by a
      Nutritionist every month. Monthly adherence to medications will be evaluated by pill
      counting; nutritional adherence and energy intake will be evaluated at 6 months by a food
      frequency questionnaire, and physical activity at 0 and 6 months. At basal and at 6 months
      patients will have an OGTT. Primary objective is to evaluate at 6 months glucose profile
      during OGTT, insulin secretion and pancreatic β-cell function by the OGTT DI, and regression
      to normoglycemia; T2D will be diagnosed and confirmed by at least two consecutive
      measurements of the same criteria: glycated haemoglobin ≥ 6.5 %, fasting glucose ≥ 126mg/dl,
      or 2 h glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl.
