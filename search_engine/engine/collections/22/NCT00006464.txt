        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of cisplatin when administered with UCN-01 in
           patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Assess the toxicity and potential antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study of cisplatin.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 and UCN-01 IV continuously over 36-72
      hours beginning on day 2. Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2-3 months for at least 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
