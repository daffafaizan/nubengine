      post-procedural cardiac troponin (cTn) elevation. Earlier experiences have shown that
      myocardial damage can be encountered in a percentage of patients that varies from 1.5% to
      17%, depending on the access route (transfemoral and transapical, respectively). The degree
      of rise in cTn after TAVI emerged as an independent predictor of mortality.

      Remote ischaemic preconditioning (RIPC) consists of brief episodes of ischaemia applied to
      remote organs or tissues and has shown to result in a significant reduction in postoperative
      troponin levels in cardiac and non-cardiac surgery patients. Lately, growing evidence
      suggests that post-procedural troponin decreases due to RIPC application protocols protocols
      and is associated with improved outcome.

      The patients will be divided into two Groups. In Group 1, RIPS will be induced with three
      cycles of Inflation of a blood-pressure cuff on the left arm to 200 mmHg for 5 min., followed
      by 5 min. of reperfusion while the cuff is deflated. In controls (Group 2), the cuff will be
      placed around the left arm without being inflated.
