      urinary tract infections in Dutch primary care and also to describe the possibilities for
      improvement and potential cost-efficiency of improved care in the light of preventing renal
      failure.

      The 4 phases of the study contain the following questions:

        -  Phase 1: What is the current clinical management of urinary tract infections in young
           children in primary care?

        -  Phase 2: What are the possibilities for improving the clinical management of urinary
           tract infections and are these improvements practically achievable?

        -  Phase 3: What is the cost-efficiency of the several interventions for improving clinical
           management of urinary tract infections

        -  Phase 4: What is the influence of the intervention on clinical management?
