      of 12-17 who were randomly allocated to two groups. Group 1 (Sealant Group) received sealant
      on the maxillary anterior canines, lateral incisors, and central incisors, with reapplication
      of the sealant every 3 months. Group 2 (Varnish Group) had MI Varnish applied every 4-6
      weeks, without sealant placed on the maxillary anterior teeth. White spot lesion formation
      was evaluated with standardized digital photographs at two timepoints, T1 (initial
      appointment before bonding), and T2 (12 months later, with brackets removed). The brackets
      were removed in order to facilitate an adequate photographic exam. Photographs were analyzed
      side-by-side at the conclusion of the study with the Enamel Decalcification Index (EDI). The
      location of WSLs were recorded by tooth type and by region. Oral hygiene was evaluated at T1
      and T2.
