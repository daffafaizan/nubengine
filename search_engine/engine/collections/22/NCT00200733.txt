      target population in order to accomplish public health goals. In the first paper, a
      discussion of the potential of using narratives from the target population as 1) a direct
      intervention; 2) a form of persuasive communications; and 3) a source of information for
      research into various topics. The main premise is that traditional narrative methods can be
      adapted to the public health context by providing the narrator with the topic of the
      narrative. The second paper examines the patient experience of acupuncture using narrative
      drawn from interviews with and letters from acupuncture patients using a content oriented
      approach. The third paper examines the importance of meaning shift over the course of
      acupuncture treatment and demonstrates the usefulness of patient narratives as a data source
      for examining meaning. Findings include the need for intervention studies comparing authentic
      voice approaches to existing health communication tools for effectiveness in creating
      attitude and behavior change efficiently. Authentic voice approaches also need to be
      researched to understand and systematize concepts such as validity in relation to
      target-group derived narratives. Effectiveness of authentic voice for advocacy and research
      should also be further tested. Concerning acupuncture, the second and third papers show that
      acupuncture patients report a variety of benefits far wider than previously reported in the
      literature. Study designs should consider this wide range of benefits when assessing
      acupuncture outcome. Meaning shift is also reported by acupuncture patients and may play an
      important (but non-specific) role in the healing associated with acupuncture.
