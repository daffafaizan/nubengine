      a helpful tool for detection of macular changes also in presence of opacification of the lens
      before cataract surgery. Using recent high-resolution OCT technology, early stages of
      epiretinal membranes can easily be detected and analysed. Since cataract surgery is one of
      the most frequently performed operations worldwide, this study was aimed to investigate the
      influence of uncomplicated cataract surgery on central retinal thickness and the incidence of
      structural and morphological macular changes after surgery in eyes with asymptomatic
      epiretinal membrane.
