      and open placement of synthetic mesh. Managing postoperative pain and preventing morbidity
      after open mesh hernioplasty remain considerable medical challenges.

      Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic (pain medicine) that has an established safety profile.
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The Xaracoll implant is a thin flat
      sponge made out of collagen that comes from cow tendons and contains bupivacaine. When
      inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and bupivacaine is released at the
      surgical site to provide postoperative pain control.

      This study will assess the pharmacokinetic profile of 2 doses of the XaraColl implant after
      open laparotomy hernioplasty and assess the relative bioavailability of the Xaracoll implant
      compared to a local bupivacaine infiltration.
