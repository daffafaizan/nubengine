    
      The trial is a prospective, randomized, two-arms study with a 2:1 ratio. Subjects meeting the
      inclusion criteria will be randomized either into the bp-MRI group (arm A), or the mp-MRI one
      (arm B). All subjects will perform blood sampling in EDTA tubes before undergoing imaging
      session. Plasma will be isolated within 1 hour from sampling, with a double round
      centrifugation, aliquoted and stored at -80Â°C before undergoing miR analysis.

      MRI will be performed with a 1.5 T using axial T2w and diffusion-weighted imaging for
      subjects in arm A with no endorectal coil and no intravenous contrast agent. Men randomized
      in arm B will undergo MRI with T2w in the three acquisition planes, diffusion-weighted and
      dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging usign endorectal coil.

      Random biopsy will be performed in subjects with no suspicious regions for PCa found on MRI.
      Men with suspicious regions on MRI will be invited to a targeted or in-bore biopsy.
