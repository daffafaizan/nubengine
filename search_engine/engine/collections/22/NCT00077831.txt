      types of single-suture craniosynostosis were recruited: sagittal, metopic, right unilateral
      coronal, and left unilateral coronal. A case-matched "control" group of healthy, normal
      infants was also followed. This study, which is now in its second phase, is following this
      same cohort of children at the age of 7 years.
