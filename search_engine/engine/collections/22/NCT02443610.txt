    
      This is an analytical observational prospective multicenter cohort study , conducted on all
      the maternity hospitals in Finist√®re (Bretagne - France), with a biological collection.

      This protocol allows to study all women at risk of PPH (Postpartum Hemorrhage) and postpartum
      venous thromboembolic disease, including maternity level 1-3 without case selection. The
      prospective nature of the study should provide a more detailed analysis of exposures in this
      particular population of women (risk factors related to the field, childbirth, the postpartum
      events ...).

      The events of interest were PPH and venous thromboembolic disease.
