      unexplained. We hypothesize that these therapies improve vascular endothelial function
      allowing improved actions of insulin in the vasculature, which comprise a significant portion
      of insulin's metabolic action. We therefore propose to measure insulin-mediated glucose
      disposal and insulin-mediated vasodilation before and after 12 weeks' therapy with Losartan
      (an angiotensin receptor blocker) or placebo, in a randomized design. Subjects will include
      28 subjects with impaired glucose tolerance, which is generally accompanied by both insulin
      resistance and impaired vascular function. With this number of participants we have a 90%
      chance of showing a statistically significant and clinically meaningful effect of insulin on
      leg vascular resistance, and an even higher chance of showing a difference in insulin's
      metabolic effects. Exclusion criteria will include frank hypertension, diabetes, or
      hypercholesterolemia, and biochemical or other contraindications to losartan therapy. The
      primary endpoint for statistical analysis will be the invasive measure of insulin-stimulated
      endothelial function. We anticipate an improvement in both vascular and metabolic measures of
      insulin action following Losartan therapy but no change from untreated baseline following
      placebo.
