      any pathology. The investigators hope to learn that in surgery, resurfacing of the sigmoid
      sinus and jugular bulb (acoustic dampening) will eliminate symptoms such as pulsatile
      tinnitus in patients. The knowledge learned will significantly help treat and alleviate
      future patients that have pulsatile tinnitus.

      The purpose of the study is to examine whether surgical resurfacing of the sigmoid sinus and
      jugular bulb will result in elimination of pulsatile tinnitus in human subjects.
