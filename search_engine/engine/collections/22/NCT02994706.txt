      1. Does home monitoring reduce the total number of inpatient hospital days in adults with
      cystic fibrosis (CF) compared to routine clinical care?

      The secondary objectives of this research study are to assess:

        1. The effect of home monitoring on lung function in adults with cystic fibrosis (CF)

        2. The effect of home monitoring on requirement for antibiotics in adults with CF

        3. The effect of home monitoring on nutritional status in adults with CF

        4. The effect of home monitoring on health related quality of life in adults with CF

        5. Costeffectiveness analysis comparing the home monitoring period with the routine
           clinical care period

        6. The patient experience of receiving home monitoring in adults with CF

        7. Whether urine levels of inflammatory markers correlate with symptoms and lung function
           in adults with CF

      The aim of this study is assess whether home monitoring is beneficial for adults with cystic
      fibrosis. Overall, 100 subjects will be recruited at the West Midlands Adult Centre and
