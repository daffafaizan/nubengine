      idopathic sudden sensorineural hearing loss who do not meet the exclusion criteria and do
      meet the inclusion criteria, and who give written informed consent will be enrolled in the
      trial. A standard treatment for ISSNHL (oral methyprednisolone) will be given to half of the
      patients and the other half of the patients will receive the standard treatment plus either a
      placebo or a 7-day course of an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor (a statin). Patients will return
      for follow up, the timing and further treatment of which will be determined by the response
      to the drugs. At each appointment, the patients will see the medical professional, have a
      hearing test, a speech in noise test, and self evaluate for tinnitus. If there is no
      improvement after 2 weeks, patient will be offered up to two intratympanic doses of
      dexamethasone, 10 days apart. This is a randomized, double-blind prospective study.
      Randomization of males will be separate from that of females.
