    
      Ten patients will be randomized prior to surgery to receive levothyroxine in tablet form and
      ten patients will be randomized to receive in gel capsule form. Both forms will be
      encapsulated in order to allow double-blinding of the study.

      The postoperative goal TSH will be between 0.1 and 0.5 mU/L (milli units per litre) in both
      arms.

      Patients will be seen at weeks 6, 12 and 18 postoperatively and have TSH and Free T4
      measured. The primary outcome is the number of patients at each visit that are at goal range
      TSH.

      A secondary analysis will compare the dose changes required between the two groups in order
      to achieve goal TSH.

      Another secondary analysis will investigate the patients' quality of life. Two different
      surveys (see secondary outcomes below) will be performed at both study entry and completion
      to compare the two groups.
