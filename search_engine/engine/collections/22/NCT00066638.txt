      I. To evaluate the safety and efficacy of depsipeptide in patients with refractory or
      relapsed multiple myeloma (MM).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who
      achieve a stable plateau (stable paraprotein levels or urine protein excretion over 3
      consecutive determinations at least 4 weeks apart) may receive maintenance therapy comprising
      FR901228 IV on days 1 and 15, with courses repeating every 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-12.5
      months.
