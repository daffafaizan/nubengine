    
      Observational prospective clinical registry in patients with symptomatic heart failure and
      implanted with the VITARIA System. Assessments will be made during 12 months of
      post-titration chronic stimulation. The registry will collect patient- and device follow-up
      data in clinical routine practice at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months. Clinical routine safety of
      the therapy will be assessed by the incidence of procedure and device-related events.
      Clinical routine efficacy will be assessed by changes in cardiac function and heart failure
      symptoms.
