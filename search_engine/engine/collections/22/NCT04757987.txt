      Participants who report persistent pain at enrolment will be assessed at 0 (baseline), 2, 4,
      and 6 months. Participants who report no pain at enrolment will be assessed at 0 (baseline)
      and 6 months. All participants will also be invited to participate in weekly remote
      assessment of selected self-reported outcomes.
