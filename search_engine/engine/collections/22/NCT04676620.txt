      keratoplasty (CK) and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK). 69 eyes with hyperopia or
      presbyopia were enrolled. 47 eyes of 47 patients underwent CK procedure, 22 eyes underwent
      LASIK. Data were acquired preoperatively, and at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. The total
      Root Mean Square (RMS) of the HOA as well as the individual Zernike polynomials of coma,
      trefoil, and spherical aberration were analyzed. In CK group, the high order RMS showed
      significant elevation at 3 months, but it returned to near preoperative levels at 6 months
      postoperatively. Trefoil (Z33) is the exclusive Zenike pattern to increase significantly
      following CK, peaking at 3 months and then decreasing back to near preoperative level at 6
      months after CK. In the hyperopic LASIK group, coma increased to a peak at 3 month
      postoperatively, and persisted at sixth month after LASIK. Spherical aberration decreased
      significantly at 3 months and persisted till the sixth postoperative month. There was
      significant correlation between ΔSE and Δspherical aberration showed in both groups. The HOA
      and main Zernike polynomials pattern and their natural changes induced by CK is significantly
      different from that induced by LASIK in the hyperopic corrected treatment. The amount of
      achieved hyperopic corrections induced by CK or LASIK is not correlated to the change of HOA
      patterns such as coma and trefoil, but it is correlated to the change of spherical
      aberration.
