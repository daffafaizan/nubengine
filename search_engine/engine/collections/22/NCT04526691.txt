    
      The primary objective of this study will assess safety and treatment activity of datopotamab
      deruxtecan (Dato-DXd) in combination with pembrolizumab with or without 4 cycles of platinum
      chemotherapy in participants with advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have either been
      previously treated or are treatment na√Øve in a metastatic setting.

      Two dose levels of Dato-DXd (4.0 mg/kg and 6.0 mg/kg) will be studied in combination with 200
      mg fixed-dose pembrolizumab in 6 study cohorts. This study will be conducted sequentially and
      dose escalation will occur according to lower dose to higher dose in the same combination
      regimen (4.0 mg/kg to 6.0 mg/kg) and from 2-drug combination (Dato-DXd and pembrolizumab) to
      3-drug combination regimen (Dato-DXd, pembrolizumab, and carboplatin or cisplatin).
