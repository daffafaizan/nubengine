      is just as effective or more so, than the standard of care (cognitive behavioral therapy,
      CBT) for bothersome tinnitus. All eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      the two groups. Depending on group assignment, participants will attend approximately 7-12
      visits over a 7-month period.
