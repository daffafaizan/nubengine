    
      This is a two part study to investigate the safety and anti-tumour effects of standard
      chemotherapy, plus an investigational drug (CDP791), in patients with advanced non small cell
      lung cancer.

      In part one, patients receive carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy together with one of 2
      doses of CDP791. The main aim of this part is to investigate safety and tolerability of
      carboplatin/paclitaxel plus CDP791.

      If part one confirms that the combination of drugs is safe and well tolerated, 156 patients
      will enter part 2. They will be randomized to receive either carboplatin/paclitaxel (C/P)
      alone, or C/P plus one of 2 doses of CDP791. The main aim of this part of the study is to
      compare the anti-tumor effects of CDP791 plus C/T with those of C/T alone. Participants will
      receive up to six cycles of chemotherapy with or without CDP791. Those whose disease
      stabilizes, or responds, will be eligible to continue to receive CDP791. Participants in the
      C/T alone arm whose disease progresses will be eligible to receive CDP791 monotherapy.

      Participants will be followed up longterm, so that survival can be measured.
