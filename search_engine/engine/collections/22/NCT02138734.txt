    
      The study includes a dose escalation phase (phase Ib) and an expansion phase (phase IIb).

      In the phase Ib, patients will be treated with intravesical N-803 in combination with BCG.
      The purpose of the phase Ib portion of the study is to evaluate the safety, identify the
      Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of N-803 and determine the Recommended Dose (RD) level of N-803
      in combination with BCG for the phase IIb expansion.

      In the phase IIb expansion, patients will be randomized to receive either intravesical N-803
      in combination with BCG or BCG alone. Patients will be enrolled into one of two study cohorts
      (Cohort A and Cohort B). These will be two independent study cohorts, evaluated separately
      for treatment efficacy.
