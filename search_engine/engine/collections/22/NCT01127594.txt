           temozolomide administration during Isolated Limb Infusion (ILI) by defining the dose
           limiting toxicities associated with this treatment and to determine the maximum
           tolerated dose of intra-arterial administration of temozolomide during ILI that will be
           used in a phase II efficacy trial.

        2. Population will include patients who have undergone a previous Melphalan based regional
           therapy for which they did not respond optimally and present with persistent,
           progressive, or recurrent disease. Study activities include tumor tissue sampling, blood
           sampling, and subjects will undergo an Isolated Limb Infusion.

        3. To define both response in-field (area of the limb below the tourniquet) and
           out-of-field (any area outside the tourniquet) in patients treated with temozolomide
           based ILI. Response in this trial will be defined by the RECIST criteria (CR, PR, SD, PD
           at 12 weeks post ILI). A CR rate of 20% would be considered as preliminary evidence of a
           promising approach in this group of patients that have had a previous melphalan regional
           treatment. ILI with melphalan has a complete response rate of approximately 35% in na√Øve
           patients and 20% in patients who have previously received melphalan based regional
           therapy.

      To assess if the proposed treatment has any effect on quality of life as measured by the
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Melanoma.
