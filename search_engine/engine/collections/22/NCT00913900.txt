      life-threatening illness. Obstructive PAD can progress to limb-threatening ischemia with rest
      pain, ulcers, and gangrene requiring amputation unless blood flow to the ischemic limb can be
      restored. Surgical revascularization options are often limited by arteries that are too small
      to bypass. Patient co-morbidities also make surgical options risky. Percutaneous
      revascularization techniques are similarly limited by small distal artery caliber, technical
      difficulty and high restenosis rates. Amputation may be the only treatment option for
      non-healing ulcers or gangrene. Direct intramuscular injection of adult stem cells may result
      in improved lower extremity perfusion, symptomatic improvement and limb salvage in patients
      with critical limb ischemia not optimal for conventional revascularization. This study aims
      to demonstrate the safety and feasibility of this therapeutic approach.
