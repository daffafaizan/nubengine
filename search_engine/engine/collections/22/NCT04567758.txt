      gluteal line defined as the lumbar region and sometimes accompanied by radicular symptoms
      spreading to the lower extremity, but it is not considered as a pathology alone. They are
      evaluated and treated on the basis of symptom duration, potential cause, the presence or
      absence of radicular symptoms, and the corresponding anatomical or radiographic
      abnormalities. Exercise is considered an essential element in the management of physical
      therapy and rehabilitation in patients with chronic low back pain. However, it has been found
      in the studies that improvements after physical therapy and rehabilitation applications are
      not preserved in the long term, and recurrence of chronic low back pain is common. In order
      to prevent this, physiotherapists need to follow their patients for a long time and to
      participate in the rehabilitation process. With a more cost-effective treatment model such as
      telerehabilitation, patients can be followed up more efficiently during home exercise. The
      aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of the home exercise program, which is
      integrated into 8-week remote asynchronous video telerehabilitation sessions, on clinical
      status in terms of pain, functionality, quality of life parameters, as well as patient
      expectation, motivation, and satisfaction levels.
