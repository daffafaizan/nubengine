      treatment. The goal of the proposed study is to address this hypothesis and demonstrate that
      the strength of the type I IFN signature in psoriatic skin is the major determinant of the
      clinical response to anti-TNF treatment.

      Purpose: Determine the strength of the type I interferon and TNF signal in psoriatic skin
      prior to and during treatment with etanercept and correlate with degree of clinical
      improvement.

      Study Population: up to 50 subjects, men or women over the age of 18 with clinically stable
      plaque psoriasis, who meet the wash out requirements and other exclusion criteria

      Psoriatic patients will receive 100 mg etanercept per week (2 separate single-use pre-filled
      50 mg subcutaneous injections taken on two separate days) for 3 months.

      Procedures: Urine pregnancy test, TB test, photography, Physical Examinations, Skin
      Examinations, Study Drug, Peripheral blood and biopsies

      Anticipated Results: We expect that patients with strong IFN-α signature in psoriatic skin
      along with weak TNF-α signature will have minimal response to anti-TNF treatment, while
      patients with the opposite pattern, weak IFN and strong TNF signature, will have significant
      clinical improvement.
