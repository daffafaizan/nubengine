      adherence at 12 months post the 3-week supervised exercise program. There is no randomization
      of individuals to conditions. Exercise adherence will be measured using self-report physical
      activity (using the Godin leisure time exercise questionnaire) and a subsample will also wear
      tri-axial accelerometers to measure total time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical
      activity assessed over 7 days. Secondary outcomes include physical fitness, haemoglobin A1C,
      quality of life, self-regulatory efficacy, anthropometrics, diet and exercise-related
      cognitive errors.

      The 3-week lifestyle program includes six sessions with a lifestyle coach and exercise
      sessions performed at home. These sessions will focus on regular healthy lifestyle that
      includes walking (or exercise of any kind) at least three times per week and will highlight
      simple dietary strategies that are linked to reduced risk of T2D. The 3-week supervised
      exercise program includes brief exercise counseling sessions that teach participants
      self-regulatory skills to promote independence and long-term adherence to exercise and a
      healthy diet. At the conclusion of the three-week program, participants will be asked to
      continue exercising a minimum of three times per week for twelve months on their own.
