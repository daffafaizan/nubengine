    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, active-controlled, 3-arm study
      with an 8 week treatment period. This study will compare the efficacy of Dexlansoprazole MR
      (60 mg and 90 mg) with that of Lansoprazole (30 mg) when administered orally as a single
      daily dose in the morning, before breakfast. The study is designed to evaluate healing of
      erosive esophagitis and the effect of the therapy on relieving gastroesophageal reflux
      disease related symptoms. The study consists of two periods, a screening period (maximum 21
      days) and a treatment period, which will last up to 8 weeks.
