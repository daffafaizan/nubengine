    
      350 Crohn's disease patients will be included in the study, targeting 300 evaluable patients.
      An interim analysis will be performed after 50% of the evaluable patients are recruited.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the relation between non-invasive biomarkers (host
      immunological variables and metagenomic analysis in stools) and AIEC detection in biopsies
      taken during an endoscopy, in order to develop a predictive algorithm of AIEC carriage.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  Validation of the AIEC detection algorithm using qPCR technology.

        -  Assessment of the correlation between the presence of AIEC and the endoscopic and
           clinical evaluations of the disease (CDEIS, SES-CD, Harvey-Bradshaw Index and Crohn's
           Disease Activity Index).

        -  Development and validation of a non-invasive qPCR based diagnostic of Mucosal Healing in
           CD patients.

        -  Collection of biological samples associated with all clinical and biological data from
           CD patients.
