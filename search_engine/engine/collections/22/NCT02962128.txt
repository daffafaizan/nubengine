      dietary fat (25-30% of daily calories) to be consumed. All study-supplied foods will be
      prepared by or acquired by the Wake Forest University Health Sciences (WFUHS) Clinical
      Research Unit (CRU) Metabolic Kitchen and distributed by the same. These foods will include
      smoothies (containing flaxseed oil common to both arms), and arm-dependent oil-based
      condiments (salad dressing, mayonnaise, and margarine) and prepared snack foods, each made
      with the arm-specific oil, as well as several packaged snacks and food items. Participants
      will be provided meal plans and recipes for home preparation of meals that will allow them to
      adhere to the target fatty acid contents of the two dietary arms. The goal of the dietary
      intervention is to provide participants with the daily fat content of their diet (25-30% of
      the daily calories) and to educate the participant to select and consume the balance of
      nutrients (60-75% of daily calories) derived from non-fat/low-fat containing foods.
