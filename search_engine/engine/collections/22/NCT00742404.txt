      Primary

        -  To determine the response rate (i.e., complete response, very good partial response ,
           partial response, and minimal response) in patients with newly diagnosed multiple
           myeloma treated with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride, bortezomib, and
           dexamethasone.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  To determine the time to disease progression, time to response, duration of response,
           progression-free survival, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive pegylated liposomal doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 30-90
      minutes, dexamethasone IV, and bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and urine samples are collected at baseline and periodically during study for M-protein
      analysis by electrophoresis and immunofixation.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
