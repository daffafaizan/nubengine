      choline kinase alpha (ChoKÎ±), involved in the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine, which
      constitutes the major phospholipid in eukaryotic cell membranes and has been described as a
      potent oncogen when overexpressed in human cells. TCD-717 will be evaluated in this Phase I,
      open-label, single arm study to be performed at multiple centers. TCD-717 will be
      administered as a 4 hour infusion on two separate days per 7-day period per 28-day cycle (8
      administrations per cycle). Eligible patients must have confirmed, metastatic or
      recurrent/refractory solid tumors.
