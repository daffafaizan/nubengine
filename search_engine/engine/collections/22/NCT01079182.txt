      controlled, moderate to severe, active AS who were eligible for adalimumab therapy.
      Participants started treatment with adalimumab under normal clinical settings in Germany.
      Enrolled participants were followed during adalimumab therapy . Participants were assessed
      during regular clinic visits for up to 24 months and 359 clinicians
      (rheumatologists/orthopedists/general practitioners/internist) participated in the study.
      Since this was an observational trial, not all doctors followed the stated age limitations
      and some participants under the age of 18 were enrolled.
