      external beam radiation or local plaque therapy to the eye. An early manifestation of
      radiation retinopathy is macular edema, which represents fluid within the retina that affects
      central vision. There is currently no approved treatment for this disease, although there
      have been anecdotal reports of benefit with laser photocoagulation, intravitreal anti-VEGF
      agents, or intravitreal steroid use. This is a phase 1 study to evaluate aflibercept for the
      treatment of macular edema associated with retinopathy secondary to previous radiation
      treatment.
