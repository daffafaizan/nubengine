      refractory epithelial carcinoma. II. Characterize the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these
      patients. III. Assess the overall toxicity and safety of this drug in these patients. IV.
      Determine the rate of objective response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive KSA-interleukin-2
      (KSA-IL-2) IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of KSA-IL-2 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which more than 33% of the
      patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12
      months.
