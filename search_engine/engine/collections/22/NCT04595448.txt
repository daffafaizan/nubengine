      moderate tricuspid valve regurgitation compared to healthy age and gender-matched controls.

      Subjects will be examined at one occasion using t2-weighted MRIs to evaluated lymphatic
      anatomy and Near-infrared fluorescence imaging for evaluation of superficial peripheral
      lymphatic function. Finally, the capillary filtration rate will be estimated using
      plethysmography.
