      validated fluoroquinolone class of drugs. This drug was rationally designed to target a
      G-quadruplex (QPLX) DNA structure and disrupt protein-DNA interactions essential to cancer
      cells. The QPLX targeted by quarfloxin forms within ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and the QPLX is
      bound by the nucleolin protein.This Phase 1 study of CX-3543 is designed to test the safety,
      tolerability and highest safe dose level of this drug in patients with advanced solid tumor
      cancers.
