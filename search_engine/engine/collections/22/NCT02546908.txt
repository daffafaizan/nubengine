      research study), prospective (observation of a population for a sufficient number of persons
      over a sufficient number of years to generate incidence or mortality rates subsequent to the
      selection of the study group), longitudinal, observational registry (clinical study in which
      participants may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other types of interventions, but the
      investigator does not assign participants to specific interventions [as in an interventional
      study])of PC participants. The following 3 participant cohorts will be enrolled: high-risk
      localized PC, non-metastatic biochemically recurrent PC, and metastatic PC. This is an
      observational study and treatment decisions and clinical management of participants will
      follow routine clinical practice. Medical care given to participants will not be influenced
      by participation in the study. Enrolled participants will be prospectively followed
      throughout their course of treatment, during which data on PC treatment, clinical
      progression, and outcomes (including death) will be collected. At the end of registry medical
      resource utilization (MRU) will also be collected. The maximum observational period will be 5
      years. Safety will be monitored throughout the study for participants being treated with JNJ
      products.
