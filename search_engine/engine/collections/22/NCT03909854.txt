    
      Over the course of 6 weeks, a before-and-after trial design of adaptive pressure control and
      assist volume control will be conducted.

      Pre-trial planning phase: study protocols will be reviewed with key stakeholders (respiratory
      therapy providers and medical teams)

      Weeks 1-2: data will be collected on our current adaptive pressure control ventilator
      protocol.

      Week 3: The investigators will implement an assist volume control protocol. . Patients
      already on mechanical ventilation will be converted to assist volume control; however, these
      patients will not be included in the primary analysis.In accordance with the Consolidated
      Framework For Implementation Research (CFIR) approach, after 1 week of assist volume control
      the investigators will engage in quantitative and qualitative feedback with care providers to
      identify facilitators and barriers of assist volume control implementation.

      Week 4-6: If the investigators identify substantial barriers, the investigators will pause
      and alter the protocol. If not, the investigators will continue assist volume control for an
      additional 2 weeks.
