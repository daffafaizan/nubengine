      for patients with advanced biliary tract cancer (BTC). Investigators have evaluated the
      efficacy and safety of gemcitabine/cisplatin/S-1 combination therapy (GCS) for patients with
      advanced BTC and observed the promising efficacy. In this randomized phase â…¢ study,
      investigators aimed to compare GCS with GC in patients with advanced BTC.
