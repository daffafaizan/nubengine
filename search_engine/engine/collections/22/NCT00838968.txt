      with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). P48 is a predictive marker for outcome of postoperative
      interferon-alpha treatment in patients with HCC. Our study is to identify the Efficiency of
      Postoperative IFN-Alpha Treatment in p48 Positive Patients With HCC.

      METHODS: An immunohistochemical study of P48 was performed on specimens that were collected
      from patients who underwent a curative resection of HCC. These patient with p48 Positive were
      randomized divided into a treatment group who received postoperative IFN-alpha therapy and a
      comparison group who not received. Besides the side effect, the overall survival rate and the
      disease-free survival rate will be observed.

      Anticipated RESULTS: IFN alpha treatment improved the overall survival of p48 Positive
      patients with HCC after curative resection, probably by postponing recurrence.
