      moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis. Two cohorts, a Simponi-exposed cohort and a comparator
      cohort treated with thiopurines, will be enrolled in study. Approximately 6,000 participants
      are planned for enrollment, with 3,000 participants in the Simponi-exposed cohort and 3,000
      participants in the comparator cohort. Participants will receive treatments in a routine
      clinical setting as prescribed by their physician. After enrollment, during the 10-year
      follow-up period, a participant may stop his or her ulcerative colitis treatment regimen and
      switch to a new treatment regimen. Lymphoma incidence will be primarily assessed by a
      questionnaire that will be sent to the investigator to obtain complete medical information
      about each case. An expert panel of medical specialists with extensive experience in lymphoma
      will be convened to validate cases of lymphoma. Besides assessing the incidence of lymphoma,
      long-term safety will be evaluated by capturing other adverse events of interest and serious
      adverse events.
