      lymphocyte infusion required to obtain a rate of 30-60% graft versus host disease in patients
      with hematologic malignancies relapsed after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose de-escalation study. Patients receive etoposide IV continuously on
      days 1-3; cyclophosphamide IV on day 8; donor lymphocyte infusion IV on day 10; and
      filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV beginning on day 10 and continuing until blood counts
      recover. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive six de-escalating levels of chemotherapy until the
      minimum amount of chemotherapy in combination with donor lymphocyte infusion required to
      obtain a rate of 30-60% graft versus host disease (GVHD) is determined. The target dose level
      is defined as the level at which 2 of 6 patients develop GVHD, and the next lower dose level
      has no more than 1 patient experiencing GVHD. Patients are followed every 3 months for the
      first year, every 6 months for the second year, and yearly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-21 patients will be accrued over 2 years.
