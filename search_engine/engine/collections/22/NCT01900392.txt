      loss program (Weight Watchers), who have lost at least 5kg during the 4-6 months prior to
      enrolling in the study. Among these participants, the following will be assessed: 1. The
      effectiveness of a daily lottery-based financial incentive, relative to the control group, on
      weight loss and weight maintenance; 2. The effectiveness of a direct payment incentive,
      relative to the control group, on maintenance of weight loss; 3. Assess the comparative
      effectiveness of lottery-based and direct payment financial incentives on weight loss and
      maintenance; 4. The degree to which weight loss is maintained in the intervention groups
      relative to usual care during the 6 months following cessation of the intervention will also
      be determined.

      During Phase I, incentives will be provided to some study participants (direct payment and
      lottery arm) for the first 6 months and subjects will be followed for 6 more months to
      examine effects following cessation of incentives.
