      antidepressant medication for the treatment of MDD with or without comorbid generalized
      anxiety disorder. Patients who are currently experiencing a depressive episode that has not
      responded to an adequate trial of an antidepressant will be eligible to participate. During
      the course of augmentation treatment with Seroquel XR, each subject will regularly enter
      information on symptom severity and functional impairment into their handheld computer, and
      this information will be wirelessly transmitted to a central database.
