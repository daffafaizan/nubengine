      smoking cessation interventions have been developed for these individuals. Bupropion is an
      antidepressant medication commonly used to treat smoking in smokers without psychiatric
      disorder. This study compares how smokers with schizophrenia and smokers without psychiatric
      illness respond to bupropion (0, 300 mg/day).

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either bupropion or placebo. Study visits
      will occur after one-week treatment with placebo or bupropion. During study sessions,
      participants will come to the laboratory at 9 am and will remain abstinent in the laboratory
      for 5 hrs. Participants will then be assessed for craving and withdrawal symptoms after
      viewing and handling neutral cues and smoking cues. After that, participants will have a
      90-min period to smoke, and smoking topography will be measured.
