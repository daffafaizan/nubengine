      effects of caudal dexmedetomidine on EA in children undergoing lower abdominal operations
      under general sevoflurane anesthesia. In addition, characteristics of anesthesia recovery and
      incidence of adverse effects will be compare. A total of (48) children aged 1-5 years old,
      The American society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification system between
      I-II of both sex who will be enrolled from April 2016 to April 2017 undergoing for lower
      abdominal surgeries will be included in the study. Patients will be randomized by
      computer-generated random numbers in a double blinded fashion to get enrolled into 2 equal
      groups: Group BD patients (n = 24) will be received single dose caudal epidural analgesia
      using dexmedetomidine with bupivacaine, whereas Group B patients (n = 24) will be received
      single dose caudal epidural analgesia with bupivacaine only. The dexmedetomidine used for
      this study will be prepared in a 1 ml syringe wrapped in aluminum foil by an investigator who
      will not be involved in the anesthesia process and another 1 ml syringe filled with saline
      will be prepared too.
