      origin. However, not all allergic patients have asthma. In this study, we will enroll
      allergic adults to undergo bronchoscopic segmental allergen challenge in order to identify
      differences in the airway immune response to allergen in those with asthma compared to those
      without asthma. After a discussion about the study and potential risks, subjects giving
      written informed consent will undergo two bronchoscopies. During the first procedure, samples
      will be collected from the left lung and allergen will be administered to a small segment of
      the right lung. The second procedure will be performed 24 hours later, with collection of
      samples from the allergen-challenged lung segment.
