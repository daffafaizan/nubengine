      combined mechanical thrombectomy will be used to clear the iliac thrombi in experimental
      group. The immediate, mid- and long-term outcomes will be recorded. Quantitative data wiil be
      expressed as mean Â± SD, and will be compared with independent-sample t-test or paired-sample
      t-test. Count data will be expressed as a ratio (or percentage), and the chi-square test or
      the fisher's exact test will be used for comparisons. A difference with P < 0.05 will be
      considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses will be performed using IBM
      SPSS, version 22.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).
