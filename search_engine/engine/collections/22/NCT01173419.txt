      States. While most persons seek treatment because varicose veins are unsightly, most will
      also experience symptoms such as aching pain, night cramps, leg fatigue, leg heaviness or leg
      restlessness. If left untreated, nearly 50% of patients with significant superficial venous
      insufficiency will experience chronic venous insufficiency characterized by lower extremity
      swelling, eczema, pigmentation, hemorrhage and ulceration.

      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized study in subjects with symptomatic venous
      insufficiency of the great saphenous vein. Subjects evaluated for participation will be those
      who, prior to the first visit, have elected to receive invasive treatment for the GSV
      insufficiency and have already received conservative treatment (i.e. use of compression
      hose).

      Subjects will be randomized to receive one of two methods of treatment. VenaCure EVLT
      NeverTouch method of treatment or the RF ClosureFAST method of treatment.

      Follow up visits will take place at 2, 7, 14 and 30 days post treatment where questionnaires
      (SF-36, CIVI Q2, Visual Analogue Scale), evaluation of GSV closure via duplex ultrasound (7
      day and 30 day only), evaluation of ecchymosis, physician (or their designee) evaluation of
      venous disease (CEAP assessment and VCSS assessment), assessments of adverse events and
      review of concomitant medications (use of analgesics and other medications)will take place.
      These same evaluations with the exception of the use of the Visual Analogue Scale and the
      Ecchymosis evaluation will also take place at the 6 month and 12 month follow up visit
      timepoints.
