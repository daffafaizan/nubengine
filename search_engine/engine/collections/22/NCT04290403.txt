      people living with dementia (PLWD). For many, incontinence is managed with toileting
      assistance containment products, regardless of other potential treatments. As toileting
      becomes more difficult and incontinence more likely, a containment product which mimics
      normal underwear, which is familiar to the PLWD may be an attractive option to preserve
      successful toileting and self management of continence with containment products and
      toileting for as long as possible. This study is designed to explore the relative benefits or
      disadvantages of containment with either briefs with tapes or pull ups in the self management
      of continence by containment products and toileting in PLWD.

      Primary objective

      To examine the benefits and disadvantages of self-management of urinary incontinence by pulls
      compared to style briefs with tapes in PLWD.

      Research Method/Procedures

      This study will comprise a three-phase design

      A small sample, exploratory study to ascertain the feasibility of recruitment, trial design
      and conduct and to enable calculation of an effect size for the trial primary outcome
      including care partner interviews and exploration of qualitative factors in use not captured
      elsewhere, economic variables and costs.

      A crossover study with an interval washout (pre-trial care) period. Each participant will
      undergo a 3-day assessment of incontinence severity to ensure eligibility and then, in random
      order, a four-week period of use of one investigational product, a two week return to their
      usual care (the care methods undertaken prior to trial commencement) and then a four-week
      period of use of the comparative investigational product.

      A post-treatment phase, qualitative semi-structured interview with PLWD and their care
      partners to discuss the impressions of the use of each investigational product.
