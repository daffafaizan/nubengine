    
      Urinary catheterization is a common practice during labor following placement of an epidural
      for pain control, as this form of anesthesia is known to inhibit normal bladder emptying.
      There is insufficient evidence to guide clinicians in selection of an indwelling catheter
      versus intermittent straight catheterization during the course of labor.

      The goal of this randomized control trial is to compare two clinically-relevant bladder
      drainage techniques.
