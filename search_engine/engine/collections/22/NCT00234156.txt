    
      Fifteen hemodialysis patients and 15 healthy volunteers will be studied.

      Outpatient screening visit(s): consent, fasting blood and urine analysis, a physical exam, an
      EKG and a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test to screen for diabetes.

      Inpatient admission:

        -  Standardized diet that follows the guidelines for hemodialysis patients and healthy
           volunteers to maintain a stable weight.

        -  Blood and urine sampling. The total amount of blood drawn is less than 1 cup.

        -  To measure the production of fat from fructose, a trace amount of a non-radioactive
           labeled precursor of fat (13C-acetate) will be infused through a venous catheter for 22
           hours.

      At the end of the infusion, a sweet drink (fructose in 1 ounce of water) will be given orally
      every half hour for 6 hours.

      â€¢ Two small samples of fat taken right below the skin will be obtained after injection of a
      small amount of numbing medicine into the abdominal and gluteal regions.

      Dialysis patients will receive their usual dialysis at The Rogosin Institute Manhattan,
      Brooklyn or Queens Dialysis Units.
