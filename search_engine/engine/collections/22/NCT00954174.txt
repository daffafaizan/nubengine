      I. To determine if treatment with combination paclitaxel and carboplatin (TC) chemotherapy
      does not result in an inferior death rate when compared to ifosfamide, mesna, and paclitaxel
      chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if treatment with combination paclitaxel and carboplatin (TC) chemotherapy
      does not result in an inferior progression-free survival when compared to ifosfamide, mesna,
      and paclitaxel chemotherapy.

      II. To determine if acute toxicity, specifically physician-assessed neurotoxicity and
      infection, associated with combination paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy is reduced
      compared to that of ifosfamide, mesna, and paclitaxel chemotherapy.

      III. To determine if treatment with combination paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy is
      associated with superior patient-reported quality of life and neurotoxicity scores compared
      to that of ifosfamide, mesna, and paclitaxel chemotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue and deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) extracted from whole blood for future research.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV
      over 30-60 minutes on day 1.

      ARM II: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 followed by paclitaxel as in
      Arm I.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 21 days for 6-10 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
