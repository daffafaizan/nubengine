      anti-mesothelin-CAR-T(meso-CAR-T) cells safety and efficacy in treating patients with
      advanced pancreatic carcinoma.The investigators constructed a 2nd CAR, using mesothelin as
      target, using 4-1BB as co-stimulator. The source of T cells used to prepare CAR-T should be
      autologous. The infusion dose is (1-10)Ã—106 meso-CAR positive T cells/kg, and the specific
      cells numbers depends on the situation of individual CAR-T cells preparation. The infusion
      way is vascular interventional mediated, which would undergo cannula--DSA radiography--CAR-T
      cells perfusion. The cells perfusion process would lasts 15min to 2 h, and the specific time
      depends on patent's tumor-burdened state.
