      determine the effect of inhaled MMI-0100 compared to placebo on inflammatory markers
      following 5 days once daily (qd) dose of MMI-0100 or placebo administered by inhalation. On
      Day 5 of each treatment period, subjects will be challenged with inhaled LPS.
      Pharmacokinetics and biomarkers will be conducted at selected timepoints.
