        -  Compare the incidence of chronic neurotoxicity in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens. (phase III closed to
           accrual as of 12/31/05)

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age
      (60 and under vs over 60) and time since induction therapy (90 days or less vs 91-180 days vs
      181-240 days). Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) once daily 5 days a week.
           Treatment continues for 2 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo PCI once daily 5 days a week. Treatment continues for 2.6 weeks
           in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm III: Patients undergo PCI twice daily 5 days a week. Treatment continues for 3.4
           weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually for 3
      years.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 1 year and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 264 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years.
