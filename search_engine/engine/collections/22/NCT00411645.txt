      transplants that are associated with strong immunosuppressive therapy. Maribavir is a new
      oral anti-CMV drug with a novel mechanism of action compared to currently available anti-CMV
      drugs. This study will test the safety and efficacy of maribavir for the prevention of CMV
      disease when given as prophylaxis for up to 12 weeks following allogeneic stem cell
      transplant.
