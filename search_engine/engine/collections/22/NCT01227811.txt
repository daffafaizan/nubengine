    
      Darifenacin is a muscarinic receptor antagonist drug used to treat overactive bladder. There
      is a new formulation of darifenacin extended release developed by an argentinian
      pharmaceutical company and, according to regional regulations, a bioequivalence study should
      be performed to put it in the market.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the relative bioavailability and pharmacokinetic
      profiling of a brand generic formulation of darifenacin [Darisec(R) 15 mg] vs. the innovator
      [Enablex(R) 15 mg] in 24 healthy uruguayan volunteers after a high fat breakfast of 1000
      calories (50% fat, 35% carbohydrates (sugar, flour, etc.) and 15& proteins) to establish
      their average bioequivalence.

      The bioequivalence will be evaluated using outcome measures that will be described later.

      The pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drugs will be described calculating:

        -  the time to Cmax (Tmax)

        -  the elimination constant (Ke),

        -  the elimination half-life (t1/2e)and,

        -  the systemic clearance (Cls.

      Safety will be evaluated recording:

        -  vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature)

        -  adverse events,

        -  laboratory analysis (hemogram, hepatic enzymes, creatinine, sugar in blood,etc.).

        -  EKG and chest XRays.

      Bioequivalence will be claimed if the drugs comply with local and FDA regulatory requirement,
      eg.:

        -  mean AUCt/AUCr and 90% confidence interval within 0.80-1.25

        -  mean Cmaxt/Cmaxr and 90% confidence interval within 0.80-1.25.

      Safety will be evaluated comparing incidences of adverse events/adverse effects for both
      products.
