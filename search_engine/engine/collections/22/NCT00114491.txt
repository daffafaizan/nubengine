      progression of aortic stenosis. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of
      Rosuvastatin on hemodynamic progression of aortic stenosis by treating patients with aortic
      stenosis and elevated LDL-cholesterol for 18 months.

      Methods: We performed an open-label, prospective study evaluating 121 consecutive patients
      with asymptomatic moderate to severe aortic stenosis (AVA≥ 1.0 cm2), (mean age 73.7±8.9
      years; 57 men and 64 women), treated with and without Rosuvastatin according to the
      NCEP-ATPIII guidelines. Echocardiographic, serum lipid, and inflammatory markers were
      measured at baseline and every 6 months for 18 months.
