      will be recorded, both the peak maximum grip force and the mean value of the ten-second
      sustained grip for the right hand Kinematics: An optoelectronic system is used for the
      three-dimensional motion analysis. This system includes an advanced optoelectronic camera
      system that produces clean and accurate 3D data. Ball shaped markers are positioned on the
      body, and reflect infrared light from camera flashes. Data analysis itself is performed with
      special software. The drinking task test is performed with the person sitting in a
      standardized manner ARAT (Action research Arm Test) is a performance test for UE function and
      dexterity.

      VR The user observes a 3D image displayed above the tabletop using stereographic shuttered
      glasses. The user is able to reach into a virtual space and interact with 3-dimensional
      objects, with a haptic device, which creates the illusion of manipulating virtual objects.

      Tool to assess self perceived function and activity ABILHAND is a questionnaire aiming to
      measure manual ability in chronic stroke. It is interview based and focused on perceived
      difficulty in everyday activities and contains unimanual and bimanual activities.

      Stroke Impact Scale (SIS) is a scale where the person replies on perceptions regarding life
      after the stroke..

      Impact on participation and autonomy (IPA-E); is an instrument where the person estimates
      perceived handicap and autonomy for persons living in the community
