    
      Hysterectomy is one of the most common gynecologic procedures performed in clinical practice.
      In this study we focused on non menopausal patients under 52 years having hysterectomies for
      benign disease : uterine leiomyomas, adenomyosis, endometriosis, dysfunctional uterine
      bleeding, genital prolapse, cervical dysplasia... with failure of conservative treatment.

      the standard procedure during hysterectomy with conservation of the ovaries has been the
      preservation of fallopian tubes with the clamps placed as close to the uterine corpus as
      possible. this is suggested to decrease interference with the vascular structures in the
      mesosalpinx and mesovarium. however it is unclear whether tubal conservation at the time of
      hysterectomy has any influence on ovarian blood flow or ovarian reserve. another point to be
      considered is the occurrence of post-hysterectomy carcinoma in the preserved fallopian tube,
      theoretically, these cases could be prevented if tubal excision is performed during
      hysterectomy The study compares the effect of bilateral salpingectomy associated with
      conservative hysterectomy on ovarian function to the standard hysterectomy with conservation
      of both ovaries and tubes in terms of hormone assays, ovarian ultrasound evaluation,
      complications, quality of life.

      impact of treatments on ovarian reserve are tested by measuring AMH at baseline and 3 days, 6
      weeks and 6, 12 months after surgeries.

      quality of life is also assessed at these time points, with a questionnaire (Women Health
      Questionnaire WHQ).
