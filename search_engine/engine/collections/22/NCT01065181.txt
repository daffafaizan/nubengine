      glenohumeral ligament which can lead to injuries such as superior labral tears. We show that
      instruction on stretching can favorably alter progression of posterior contractures.

      Methods: 1261 male baseball players ages 7-15 completed a questionnaire and shoulder
      examinations. Measurements of rotation of both shoulders were made with the subjects in the
      supine position with the scapula stabilized. Glenohumeral internal rotation deficit (GIRD)
      was calculated. Pitch type and player position, among other variables, were recorded. The
      prospective cohort was 175 players who were examined twice a year apart. Players with
      excessive GIRD (exGIRD) were given stretching instruction, and the control group was those
      without exGIRD who were not given instruction. Change in GIRD as a result of this
      intervention was documented.
