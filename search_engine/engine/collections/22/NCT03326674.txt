    
      CONTESSA is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study of tesetaxel plus a
      reduced dose of capecitabine versus the approved dose of capecitabine alone in patients with
      HER2 negative, HR positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (LA/MBC) previously
      treated with a taxane in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. 685 patients were enrolled,
      including 674 who received treatment.

      Patients randomly assigned to Arm A (tesetaxel plus a reduced dose of capecitabine) are
      administered:

        -  Tesetaxel (27 mg/m2) orally once every 21 days on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle; and

        -  Capecitabine (825 mg/m2) orally twice daily (in the morning and evening after a meal,
           for a total daily dose of 1,650 mg/m2) beginning with the evening dose on Day 1 through
           the morning dose on Day 15 of each 21-day cycle.

      Patients randomly assigned to Arm B (approved dose of capecitabine alone) are administered:

        -  Capecitabine (1,250 mg/m2) orally twice daily (in the morning and evening after a meal,
           for a total daily dose of 2,500 mg/m2) beginning with the evening dose on Day 1 through
           the morning dose on Day 15 of each 21-day cycle

      Dose modifications for tesetaxel and/or capecitabine are described in the study protocol.

      Patients are treated until documentation of progressive disease (PD), evidence of
      unacceptable toxicity or other decision to discontinue treatment. Capecitabine is an oral
      chemotherapy agent that is considered a standard-of-care treatment in LA/MBC. The primary
      efficacy endpoint is PFS as assessed by the IRC. The secondary efficacy endpoints are overall
      survival (OS), objective response rate (ORR) as assessed by the IRC and disease control rate
      (DCR) as assessed by the IRC.
