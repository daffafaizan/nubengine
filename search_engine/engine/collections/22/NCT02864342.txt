      morbidity and mortality. COPD is the third leading cause of death in the US and claimed
      133,965 US lives in 2009. In 2011 12.7 million US adults were estimated to have COPD.
      However, approximately 24 million US adults have evidence of impaired lung function,
      indicating an under diagnosis of COPD. COPD also has a potentially harmful economic impact.
      In 2010, COPD resulted in over 10 million office visits, nearly 1.5 million emergency
      department visits, 700,000 hospitalizations, and 133,575 deaths in the US. In 2010, US total
      medical treatment costs attributed solely to COPD (i.e., excluding comorbidities) were
      estimated to be $32.1 billion with an additional $3.9 billion in COPD costs resulting from
      worker absenteeism. Even in industrialized countries such as the US, where anti-smoking
      initiatives have been relatively successful, the legacy of past smoking behavior in aging
      populations ensures that the COPD burden will unavoidably continue to climb over the next 20
      to 30 years. Adherence rates for inhaled combination therapy is poor (average 3.9 refills per
      year). COPD patients with lower adherence tend to have higher overall healthcare costs, as
      demonstrated in a 24 month study of 33,816 patients in the US, which found: Patients
      continuing therapy had lower costs of care by $3764 compared with patients who had ceased to
      take their maintenance therapy. COPD patients with higher adherence to prescribed regimens
      experienced fewer hospitalizations and lower Medicare costs (-$2185) than those who exhibited
      lower adherence behaviors. Given the poor adherence with inhaled combination therapy seen in
      patients with COPD, and associated morbidity/mortality and economic costs, the present study
      is being conducted to see if medication reminders can be used to improve adherence in this
      population.
