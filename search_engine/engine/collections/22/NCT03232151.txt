      novel software for the rapid assessment of time-resolved CTA and CT perfusion in the setting
      of ischemic cerebrovascular events. As a leading center for the treatment of cerebrovascular
      disease in the Midwest as well as being one of the first Comprehensive Stroke Centers in the
      United States we have a large potential patient group to assess. Our pilot plan is to compare
      conventional CT/CTA/CTP acquired during the clinical work up with C-arm CBCT/CTA/CTP acquired
      in the angiography suite at initiation of therapy. The C-arm CBCT acquisition provides whole
      brain coverage (compared to only 8 cm brain coverage with conventional CT) with less
      radiation and higher resolution; the CT perfusion maps obtained using C-arm CBCT and new
      reconstruction algorithms provides better perfusion maps.
