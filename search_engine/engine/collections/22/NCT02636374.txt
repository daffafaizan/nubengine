      study. Students will participate in four, 15 minute guided imagery sessions over about a 4-6
      week period. They will complete a pregnancy specific stress questionnaire before beginning
      and after completion of the guided imagery protocol. The students will also complete a short
      9-question stress measure before and after each of the individual guided imagery sessions.

      The specific aims are:

        1. to evaluate whether a guided imagery intervention reduces perceived stress in pregnant
           adolescents; and

        2. to evaluate whether a guided imagery intervention enhances well-being in pregnant
           adolescents.

      The hypotheses are that the intervention will reduce perceived stress and enhance well-being
      in these subjects. The purpose of this study is to assess whether employing a guided imagery
      intervention with pregnant teens and education will reduce perceived stress levels and
      improve well-being.
