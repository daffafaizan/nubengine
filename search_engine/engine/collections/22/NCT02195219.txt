      girdle. They represent the 40-50% of the sport related shoulder injuries.

      There are different grades of dislocations being classified by Altman- Rockwood in 6 types.
      There is consensus for non operative treatment in types 1 and 2 and for surgical treatment in
      types 4, 5 and 6.

      For type 3 both therapeutic techniques are accepted with no high scientific evidence studies
      supporting either of them.

      During de 70's, surgical treatment was recommended for all these lesions but in the early
      90´s surgeons´s preferences changed into the non-operative treatment. Now a day, treatment is
      decided according to the surgeon experience and the functional demands of the patient.

      The aim of this study is to compare the results of non-operative treatment and open reduction
      and internal fixation with a coracoclavicular reconstruction device (MINAR-STORZ) in grade
      III acromioclavicular dislocations.
