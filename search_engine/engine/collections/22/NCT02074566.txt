      (paroxysmal) atrial fibrillation. However, with the rapid evolution in cryoablation technique
      and its increased effectiveness, the risk of complications increases. Therefore it is of
      utmost importance to define the optimal duration of cryoballoon ablation time.

      Objective To assess the optimal ablation duration using the second generation cryoballoon for
      isolation of pulmonary veins in the treatment of atrial fibrillation.

      Study design The study is designed as a prospective multicentre randomized efficacy study.

      Study population Patients 18-70 years of age with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation eligible for
      pulmonary vein isolation according to current international guidelines.

      Intervention Patients will be randomized to 2 cycles of 1, 2 or 3 minutes of cryoballoon
      ablation after reaching the temperature "plateau phase".

      Main study parameters/endpoints Acute success of pulmonary vein isolation.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      No additional risk is present as the procedure is common clinical practice, current
      cryoballoon application time is 3 minutes Shorter application times are not expected to add
      to the risk.
