    
      This study is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. To date, there is a scarcity of
      randomized controlled trials looking at pathway-based, patient-centered healthcare versus
      usual care in several high-risk or high volume diagnoses that account for the vast majority
      of hospitalizations in medical settings.

      In this study, the pathway care intervention is a collaborative effort that involves
      healthcare professionals from multiple departments, including pharmacists, health educators,
      nurses, social workers, nutritionists, and quality management.

      For patients allocated to the usual care, these healthcare professionals will deliver
      standardized care when consulted. For pathway care patients, this collaborative healthcare
      will be default.
