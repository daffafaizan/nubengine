      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 12-weeks treatment with
      the brain active alpha-1 adrenoreceptor (AR) antagonist prazosin for disruptive agitation in
      approximately 186 Alzheimer's disease (AD) residents in a long-term care (LTC) setting or
      living at home with full-time caregiving.

      Distruptive agitation defined as having one or more of the following behaviors nearly daily
      during the previous week and at least intermittently for four weeks prior to screening: a)
      irritability, b) physically and/or verbally aggressive behavior, c) physically resistive to
      necessary care, d) and/or pressured motor activity (e.g., pressured pacing).

      LTC is defined as assisted living or skilled nursing facility. Home dwelling participants
      require full-time caregiving defined as having continuous daily caregiving and a Study
      Partner who will assist in providing protocol specific information to the study team.

      A previous single site pilot study addressing disruptive agitation in 22 predominantly
      LTC-residing AD participants demonstrated efficacy of prazosin on all three primary outcome
      measures.1 The current multicenter study is funded by the National Institute on Aging (NIA),
      and coordinated through the NIA-funded Alzheimer's Disease Cooperative Study (ADCS).
