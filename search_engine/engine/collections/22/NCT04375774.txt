      rapid consumption and shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE), especially high-level
      filtration respirator masks. Respirators used by HCPs are mainly single use face filtering
      pieces with at least level P2 protection for single shift use following European EN 149
      standards defining protection level against hazardous particles.

      In response to the risk of shortage we propose a novel reusable do-it-yourself (DIY)
      respirator assembled with already widely available components in hospital stocks: a standard
      breathing filter plugged in an anaesthesia facial mask held in place with a hook ring
      strapped to a silicone head harness. As reports of a modified full-face snorkelling (MFS)
      mask used for non-invasive ventilation in infected patients emerged in Italy, we reckon that
      it could also be used as PPE with a modified valve and breathing filter.
