      and effectiveness of an investigational intervention to learn whether the intervention works
      in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the intervention is being
      studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved FMT for this use.

      After HCT, the body's microbiome (the natural existence of various bacteria and organisms) in
      the intestinal tract may be affected, in that the number and types of good bacteria is
      reduced (also called a reduction in microbial flora diversity). Studies have shown that the
      number and types of good bacteria in the gut can impact whether or not a person develop a
      disease called graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). GVHD occurs when donated bone marrow cells
      attack the body with an immune response. Researchers believe that more microbial flora
      diversity in the gut is linked to a lower risk of developing GVHD.

      FMT is a process utilizing microbial components which are the good, healthy bacteria that
      would otherwise naturally occur in the body. Since the participant may have decreased
      microbial flora diversity after HCT, these microbial components are taken from a 3rd party
      donor. They are extracted from fecal matter (stool) and put into a capsule which the
      participant then ingest.

      Researchers believe that FMT administration may play a role in restoring higher microbial
      flora diversity in the gut. Therefore, FMT administration may play a role in decreasing the
      likelihood of developing GVHD.

      In this research study, the investigators are...

        -  Examining the microbial flora diversity of your gut after FMT administration

        -  Looking for incidence rate of GVHD and other post-HCT complications
