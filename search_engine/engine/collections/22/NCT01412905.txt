      retinopathy conducted by a trained screener using a digital camera, a mobile medical unit and
      a centralized image-storing software in underserved, ethnically diverse neighborhood
      community health centers Methods and Research Design: Retinal screening exams using
      telemedicine technology were offered at 8 community health centers for 1229 individuals, ages
      16-80 years with diabetes throughout San Diego County over 18 months. Images were
      electronically captured, transferred to EyePACs1 image software and read independently by a
      trained technician and retinal specialist. Statistical analysis was conducted to evaluate
      prevalence of disease and accuracy and validity of readings. Snellen eye test and glaucoma
      testing using tonometry will also be conducted.

      Results: Will evaluate demographics that include age, gender, ethnicity, duration of
      diabetes, type of diabetes and need for dilation. Severity of disease will be captured.
      Statistical analysis will be conducted for technician accuracy of grading the readings.

      Conclusions: To demonstrate that telemedicine retinal screening utilizing a mobile medical
      unit with a trained technician in high-risk, ethnically diverse populations can accurately
      detect positive and negative screens. This may be a model to increase access to retinal
      examination in order to meet ADA and HEDIS guidelines and can allow more efficient use of the
      retinal specialist to evaluate and treat disease leading to a more cost efficient method of
      care.
