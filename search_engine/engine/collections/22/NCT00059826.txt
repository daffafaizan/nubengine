        -  Determine the disease-free and overall survival of patients with resected pancreatic
           adenocarcinoma treated with adjuvant chemoradiotherapy comprising fluorouracil,
           cisplatin, and interferon alfa.

        -  Determine the rate and severity of acute and late toxic effects in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine the local-regional disease control and distant disease control in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy (CRT): Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-38;
           cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36; and interferon alfa
           subcutaneously on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22, 24, 26, 29, 31, 33, 36, and
           38. Patients also undergo radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and
           36-38.

        -  Post-CRT chemotherapy: Beginning 4-6 weeks after the completion of CRT, patients receive
           fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-42. Treatment repeats every 56 days for a total
           of two courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months
      for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.
