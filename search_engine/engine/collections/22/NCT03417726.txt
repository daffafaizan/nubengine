      which is attributed to non-progressive disturbances in the developing fetus or infant brain.
      In CP, motor and sensory disorders are often accompanied by poor balance control. Impaired
      balance control leads to increased risk of falling, which is a major kinesiologic problem in
      children who are ambulatory without an assistive device.

      Functional balance in children is defined as the ability to maintain the center of gravity
      according to the base of support during typical childhood activities of daily living, school
      and play. The Pediatric Balance Scale, a modification of the Berg Balance Scale, was
      developed as a functional balance measure for children, easily administered without
      specialized equipment in a relatively short time.

      Balance MasterÂ® (Neurocom International Clackmas, Oregon, USA) is a device consisting of a
      system that processes signals from an 18x60 inch plaque that transmits the vertical forces
      exerted through patient's feet to measure center of gravity position and postural control
      through a software program.

      The aim of this study is to compare PBS results with quantitative balance and gait parameters
      obtained from Balance Master in spastic CP patients who are independently ambulatory. The
      level of correlation between these measurement methods will be examined and superiority to
      each other in assessing balance problems in this patient group will be evaluated.
