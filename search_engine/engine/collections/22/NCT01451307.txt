      The primary objective of this study is to compare differences in the score of Bayley Scales
      of Infant Development II Assessment (consisting of cognitive, verbal, nonverbal, motor
      development levels) between children with gastrointestinal malformations and early postnatal
      surgery at the age of 2 years and a control group.

      The secondary objective is to measure the growth of the patients compared to healthy children
      in the control group, to capture post-traumatic stress situations in families, and to capture
      the children's psycho-emotional competence.

      Study design:

      The study is designed as a cross-sectional single center study. The study patients are
      children of 2 years of age who underwent neonatal surgery in our clinic since June 2008 due
      to a gastrointestinal malformation.

      The control group consists of matched pairs concerning gestational age, weight and gender.

      The study consists of five parts:

        -  Introductory interview including the medical history

        -  Bayley Scales of Infant Development II Assessment

        -  Pediatric examination with anthropometry

        -  Questionnaire survey of post-traumatic stress situation

        -  Final conversation with the parents about the results

      The neurodevelopmental testing is performed by the child psychologist and the pediatric
      examination by the pediatrician.

      Study population:

      The study is purely exploratory and based on the number of patients born in our hospital with
      the malformations mentioned above (approximately 40).

      Each patient is compared against a healthy child of the same gestational age, weight class
      and gender (control group).
