      dream-enactment during sleep which affects millions of individuals in the United States,
      however therapies for RBD are limited and cause significant side effects. As a result,
      despite using a combination of drugs, a large number of patients with RBD continue to act out
      violent dreams causing severe self-injuries or injuries to their bed partners. Prior studies
      and our experience have shown that sodium oxybate can be effective in these cases of
      treatment-resistant RBD. This study would therefore evaluate the efficacy and tolerance of
      sodium oxybate in this patient population.

      This study is an 8-week trial comparing sodium oxybate versus placebo randomly assigned to
      patients with treatment-resistant RBD, i.e. individuals who have insufficiently responded or
      tolerated melatonin and clonazepam. The study uses a double-blind design (participants,
      staff, and investigators will not know which drug between active drug and placebo is given to
      participants), and will measure treatment efficacy based on patients, partners and clinicians
      report, and objective outcomes based on in-home actigraphy and in-lab polysomnography before
      and after intervention.
