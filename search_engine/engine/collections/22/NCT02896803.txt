      advanced pancreatic carcinoma. However, due to excessive toxicity dose reductions and
      interruptions in the treatment toxicity are frequent. So, for those not eligible patients (PS
      2 or 3, hyperbilirubinemia, among other causes), alternative schemes as gemcitabine alone are
      the standard approach .

      This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the mFLOX regimen (fluorouracil bolus
      and oxaliplatin) as first-line regimen for advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma not eligible
      for FOLFIRINOX.

      The primary endpoint is to assess the objective response rate according to RECIST criteria
      (version 1.1) and the secondary endpoints are time until clinical or radiological
      progression, overall survival, toxicity profile.

      It has been estimated an n=34 for a response rate of 20%, compared to the historical control
      of 7% with gemcitabine alone (Von Hoff et al.), with an alpha error of 5% and power of 80%.
      Considering a rate of 10% of dropout, our sample will be 37 patients.
