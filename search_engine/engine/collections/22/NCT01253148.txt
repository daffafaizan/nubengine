      directly to the tumor with less risk of toxic effects from radiation to other parts of the
      body or to healthy liver tissue when compared with currently available treatments.

      The standard treatment for cholangiocarcinoma is surgery (if possible), external beam
      radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy. External beam radiation therapy to the liver may
      reduce symptoms, but only 20% of patients experience significant tumor shrinkage.
      Chemotherapy has response rates ranging from 6-19%. More recently, a new approach has been
      developed, called TheraSphere. Based on the results of earlier studies with TheraSphere, the
      study doctors at Moffitt feel this is a reasonable alternative to the standard treatment for
      this disease.

      TheraSphere has restricted approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for the treatment of hepatocellular liver cancer; but it has not yet been approved for the
      treatment of cholangiocarcinoma. TheraSphere is a medical device containing yttrium-90
      (Y-90), a radioactive material that has been used previously in the treatment of liver
      tumors. Y-90 is incorporated into very tiny glass beads called microspheres and is injected
      into the liver through the blood vessels supplying the liver.
