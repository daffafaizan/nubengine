      whether NBI could predict histology through microvascular architecture,we measured lesion
      microvessels by immunohistochemistry.On the other hand,we applied immunohistochemistry of
      matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) to validate the capability of NBI for estimating invasion
      depth.MMP-7 is directly involved in the processes of growth, invasion, and metastasis of
      colorectal cancer.Our target was to clarify the diagnostic accuracy of magnifying NBI in
      early colorectal lesions,combined with the verification of microvessel count and MMP-7
      expression.
