      replication are predictive of disease development. HTLV-1 exhibits lower levels of variation
      than HIV-1, suggesting that drug resistance is less likely to occur. Raltegravir was shown to
      inhibit HTLV-1 integration and replication in culture using concentrations achievable with
      the approved dose used in HIV-1 infected patients. Currently, no treatment is recommended for
      asymptomatic infected individuals.
