      efficacy of vigabatrin compared to placebo. We will follow NIAAA's COMBINE Medical Management
      (MM) manual in weekly dispensing medications, safety checks and medication adherence. The
      psychosocial treatment will be Cognitive Behavioral Coping Skills Therapy (CBT). Subjects
      will be 60 men and women with current DSM-IV diagnoses of both cocaine and alcohol dependence
      who will be randomized to vigabatrin or placebo (30 subjects per group). All subjects will
      receive weekly sessions of CBT. The study length for each subject is comprised of a1-3 weeks
      of screening and baseline evaluations, an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial with
      CBT (medication phase), and one follow-up visit 12 weeks after starting study medication.

      Study medication will be initiated in Week 2. The research physician will explain the dosing
      regimen and subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either vigabatrin or identical
      placebo tablets. Subjects will receive 1 gram of vigabatrin or identical placebo tablets on
      medication days 1-3 then 1.5 grams or identical placebo tablets on days 4-7. The dose ids
      increased to 2 grams in week 2, 3 grams in weeks 4-7 and then reduced to 2 grams days 50-53,
      and to 1 gram on days 54-56
