      many migraine patients have neck symptoms, despite they apparently do not have any neck
      disorders.Furthermore the response to treatment differs between patients. Differences in
      symptomatology, QST parameters and muscle stiffness can be used to subdivide and phenotype
      migraine patients.

      The investigators are examining migraine patients with:

      A semistructured interview, Quantitative sensory testing (cold pain threshold, heat pain
      threshold and Pin Prick), Muscle tenderness (total tenderness score, local tenderness score
      and stimulus response curve), and muscle hardness with ultrasound elastography. All tests are
      performed the same day
