      recovery is poorly understood. This lack of knowledge is a key impediment to the development
      of novel strategies to improve outcomes and is one of the main reasons that prognostication
      of recovery of consciousness and functional outcomes is inaccurate. One-fifth of clinically
      unconscious patients with acute brain injury are able to follow commands using a simple,
      bedside EEG motor imagery test that directly measures brain activity associated with the
      attempt to move. This state is called cognitive motor dissociation (CMD). Pilot data indicate
      that CMD patients are more likely to clinically recover consciousness and have better
      longterm functional outcomes than non-CMD patients. To integrate these findings into clinical
      practice, there is a need to better understand the trajectory of CMD. This will only be
      possible in a tightly-controlled study with a homogenous patient cohort that is well
      characterized early after the injury and captures long-term outcomes.

      RECONFIG is a multicenter, prospective, cross-sectional observational study in patients who
      have a clinical diagnosis of intracerebral hemorrhage and that are unresponsive at the time
      of enrollment. One hundred and fifty subjects will be recruited over 4 years at 2 sites.
      Subjects will be assessed with behavioral measures and MRI during the acute hospitalization.
      Patients will be followed for 6 months to determine the functional outcome (primary outcome
      measure). Additionally, the investigator will study conscious intracerebral hemorrhage
      patients with intracerebral hemorrhage and aphasia to determine the impact of aphasia.
