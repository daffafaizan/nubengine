      intervention designed to address these barriers-the Screening for Hesitancy to Optimize Talk
      (SHOT) intervention-in improving provider-parent vaccine discussions and increasing vaccine
      acceptance. The SHOT intervention involves administering a validated parent-report measure to
      parents and communicating their score and item-specific responses to their child's provider
      before their child's 2 and 6 month health supervision visits. The survey contains 15
      questions regarding Health Belief Model concepts that influence parent vaccination behavior
      and has been shown to predict under-immunization.

      Our specific aims are to (1) evaluate the impact of the SHOT intervention on a child's
      immunization status using a matched-pair, cluster randomized controlled trial design; (2)
      assess how parents' ratings of their vaccine discussions with their child's provider change
      as a function of the SHOT intervention; and (3) compare pre- and post-study perceptions of
      barriers to quality vaccine discussions with parents between providers in the SHOT and
      control arm.
