      Hip, implanted using a manual or navigated technique, using radiostereometric analysis (RSA).
      The study was also intended to provide the clinical data necessary to demonstrate conformance
      with the essential requirements of the Medical Device Directive. Secondary objectives were to
      determine the efficacy of the Silentâ„¢ Hip femoral prosthesis from a clinical and radiological
      prospective, to assess the safety of the device and to evaluate the impact of the procedure
      on the Subjects' Quality of Life.
