    
      Compound 1278863A is a novel small molecule agent, which stimulates erythropoiesis through
      inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-prolyl hydroxylases (EGLNs). This compound is
      being developed for the treatment of anemia. This study, PHI112843, will be the first
      administration of 1278863A to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and/or
      pharmacodynamics of single oral doses of 50 mg and 150 mg in pre-dialysis subjects with
      moderate or severe renal impairment and 150 mg in hemodialysis-dependent subjects. Four to
      eight subjects will complete each dose cohort. Multiple blood samples for pharmacokinetic
      and/or pharmacodynamic analyses will be obtained post-dose in each cohort. Safety will be
      assessed by measurement of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, collection of adverse event
      assessments and laboratory safety tests.
