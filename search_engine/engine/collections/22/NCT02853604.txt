    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized study of ADXS11 001 administered in the
      adjuvant setting after completion of cisplatin-based CCRT in subjects with locally advanced
      cervical cancer at higher risk for recurrence (HRLACC), or death. All eligible subjects will
      have received CCRT administered with curative intent according to institutional/national
      guidelines as well as meeting the minimum standards defined in the protocol. Subjects must
      initiate the Screening period within 10 weeks after the completion of CCRT. Baseline
      radiographic assessments and clinical laboratory assessments must be completed no longer than
      28 days prior to and 3 days prior to the first study treatment infusion, respectively.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized 1:2 to receive either placebo or ADXS11-001. Subjects
      will receive 1 infusion of study treatment administered every 3 weeks for 3 doses for the
      first 3 months. Thereafter, subjects will receive study treatment every 8 weeks for a total
      of 5 doses or until disease recurrence. Subjects will receive a 7-day course of an oral
      antibiotic or placebo starting 72 hours following the completion of study treatment
      administration.

      An interim analysis will be performed when there is at least one-half the number of DFS
      events required for full maturity of the study.
