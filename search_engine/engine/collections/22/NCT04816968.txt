      the study is a reduction in hospitalization days. The study population is divided into 4
      treatment arms: assuming that the average length of hospitalization for the standard
      treatment of a severe infection, for each of the types of antibiotic studied, is 14 days,
      with the treatment envisaged by the study it is assumed to reduce this duration,for all 4
      treatment arms, to a number equal to or less than 12 days. With these premises, applying the
      One sample t-test design method, assuming α = 0.05 and β = 0.1, the number of patients
      expected is 9 for each treatment arm. Considering a 30% dropout, the total population to be
      enrolled for each type of antibiotic is 12 patients. In total, the study will enroll 48
      patients. The study provides for an observation period of 30 days from enrollment. During
      this period, efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetic data will be collected for each treatment
      arm.
