      Patients will be randomised to ambroxol with proven effect on the lysosomal and
      glucocerebrosidase pathology in DLB or placebo. The randomization will be stratified based on
      APOE e4 and on the concentration of A-beta in CSF. The frequency of GBA genotypes in the
      active treatment and placebo groups will be calculated at study end. The blinded phase will
      last for 18 months and an open extension with ambroxol will be offered to all participants
      for one additional year. The primary outcomes will be cognition, global function, disease
      stage, progression, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. Secondary outcomes will be on sleep
      disturbances, falls, fluctuations and parkinsonism, and exploratory outcomes will be impact
      on the potential biomarkers for drug effects defined as qEEG, DaTSCAN, MRI and Î±-synuclein in
      CSF. One hundred seventy-two participants will be recruited in total. Each participant will
      orally self-administer or administer by a caregiver ambroxol or placebo at 5
      intra-participant dose escalations at 60 mg TID (day 1-7), 120 mg TID (day 8- 14), 315 BID
      (day 15-21), 315 mg TID (day 22-28) and 420 mg TID (day 29-550)).Participants will be
      subjected to clinical and laboratory assessments to assess the safety, tolerability effects
      of ambroxol on blood biomarkers and MRI, DaTSCAN, ECG, EEG and lumbar puncture. Each
      participant will undergo 8 hospital visits and 16 telephone visits for the blinded phase of
      the study during the first 18 months. Hospital visits will additionally include 1 or 2
      screening appointments within 60 days of Day 1 hospital visit (at which participants will
      receive the first dose of ambroxol), followed by visits at week 4, week 8, week 24, week 36,
      week 52, month 15 and month 18. Participants will receive a telephone call 3 days after
      lumbar puncture to record any complaints. Participants will receive 16 telephone calls to
      record any drug related adverse events in between hospital visits, between 1-3 days before
      and after each dose escalation (day 1, 8, 15, 22 and 29, week 12,16, 20, 28, 32, 40, 44, 48
      and month 13, 14, 16 and 17). All participants will be offered treatment with the IMP for 12
      additional months from month 18 - month 30.
