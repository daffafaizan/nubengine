      diagnosis adjudication. Phase Two is biomarker testing.

      Phase One

      Approximately 850 adults admitted to general ICUs will be enrolled within 12 hours of receipt
      of ICU admission orders. Study specific whole blood and urine specimens will be collected.

      There is an Adjudication Committee for this study. This committee is comprised of qualified,
      board-certified nephrologists.

      Phase Two

      During Phase Two, the plasma specimens will be divided amongst three clinical sites
      representative of the intended end users of this assay, and tested under a separate testing
      protocol.
