      University of Kentucky. Participants will be pre-screened by the department for entry into
      the study. The investigator will determine if the participant meets study eligibility
      requirements.

      The purpose of this research is to gather information on how safe and effective of Envarsus®
      is when compared to twice-daily tacrolimus. The results of this study will be shared with the
      company providing financial support for the study, the Food and Drug Administration and other
      federal agencies, if required.

      All participants that successfully meeting inclusion criteria will be randomized (like the
      flipping of coin) to Envarsus vs. Tacrolimus at the time of transplant.

      Participants will be randomized to one of two treatment arms. Treatment begins on post-op day
      1.

        -  Treatment: Envarsus® 0.07-0.14 mg/kg/day every morning

        -  Control: Generic tacrolimus 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/day in 2 divided doses given every 12 hours

      The total amount of time a person will be asked to volunteer for this study is 9-18 hours
      over the next 6 months.

      Participants will need to complete 9 study visits each of these visits will take
      approximately 1-2 hours to complete. Participants will be given medication dosing diaries to
      complete throughout the study and will undergo 2 kidney biopsies.

      Participants will be screened for HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C viruses.
