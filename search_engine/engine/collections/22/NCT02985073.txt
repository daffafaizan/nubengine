      present with very few randomized controlled studies.

      This study aims to compare a biological mesh (Veritas速) compared to a non biological mesh
      (TIGR速) in patients with hereditary increased risk of developing breast cancer operated with
      bilateral immediate breast reconstruction regarding implant loss rate,infections,total
      complication rate,aesthetic outcome, HQOL (health related quality of Life) and economics.

      The patients will be enrolled to the study and sign an informed consent. At the operating
      theater the patient is randomized either to be reconstructed with Veritas速 in one breast and
      TIGR速 in the other breast..

      The patients will be followed up according to a specified schedule until one year
      postoperatively as above.
