      97.5%CI for the difference in proportion of patients reaching the primary endpoint is not
      lower than -12%. For this purpose, a sample size of 52 per arm would provide 80% power at
      alpha 0.025 to establish non-inferiority of DTG monotherapy compared with cART when the
      primary endpoint success rate is 95% in both treatment arms.
