      of a new class of cancer immunotherapy that could restore an adequate immunosurveillance
      against the neoplasm and enhance T-cell-mediated anticancer immune responses. However,
      elimination of cancer by T cells is only one step in the cancer-immunity cycle, which enable
      providing several therapeutic targets and tailoring of combinations of immune therapies.
      SHR2150 is a small molecule agonist of toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7 designed to activate
      antigen-presenting cells and functions as mucosal immunoadjuvants in pre-clinical studies.
      This study is a first-in-man, Phase I/II, dose escalation/expansion study of a combined
      regimen of SHR2150 in combination with chemotherapy plus PD-1 or CD47 antibody in subjects
      with unresectable/ metastatic solid tumors. This study is designed to assess the safety,
      tolerability, RP2D and clinical efficacy of this regimen.
