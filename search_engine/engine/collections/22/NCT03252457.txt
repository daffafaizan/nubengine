      controlled trial of 200 ITP adult patients from 19 medical centers in China. One part of the
      participants are randomly selected to receive dexamethasone (given 40mg/d for 4 consecutive
      days as a cycle , If platelet count remained below 30 × 109/L or there were bleeding symptoms
      by day 10, an additional cycle of dexamethasone was given) combining with decitabine (given
      intravenously at a dose of 3.5mg/m2/d for 4 consecutive days as a cycle and repeated every 2
      weeks for 3 cycles), the others are selected to receive dexamethasone therapy(given 40mg/d
      for 4 consecutive days as a cycle, If platelet count remained below 30 × 109/L or there were
      bleeding symptoms by day 10, an additional cycle of dexamethasone was given). Platelet count,
      bleeding and other symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment, adverse events are
      also recorded throughout the study in order to report the efficacy and safety of the
      combination therapy compared to dexemathasone alone therapy for the treatment of adults with
