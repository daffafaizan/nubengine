      that they have great potential for use as both surveillance and prognostic markers in cancer
      treatment, as well as potential targets for cancer therapy. Recent research has identified
      several miRNA markers which appear to be potential markers for head and neck squamous cell
      carcinoma, and these have been tested in both mouse and human banked tumor samples. These
      investigators hypothesize that these markers may also be present in other tissues, including
      fine needle aspiration biopsy, blood, and saliva specimens, and will be sensitive and
      specific to patients with known head and neck cancer.
