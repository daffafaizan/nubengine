    
      A Small-Scale Study to Explore the Safety and Feasibility of Allogeneic Young Plasma Infusion
      in Older Adults Experiencing Disability Across the Spectrum of Frailty Syndrome

      Plasma (PF24) will be transfused into enrolled male and female geriatric patients aged 65-80
      who have a diagnosis of frailty (Fried Frailty score of 3 or greater) or HFpEF. The
      experimental dosing will consist of once weekly administration of PF24 over a period of 8
      consecutive weeks (8 total doses over 56 days). Primary and secondary endpoints will measure
      safety and feasibility of infusing PF24 in this study population. Tertiary endpoints will
      include measurement of the Fried Frailty score, various cognitive testing, measurement of
      VO2max, and blood biomarkers associated with aging. We will measure change from baseline 1
      week after the 8th infusion of PF24. Test of durability will occur 5 weeks after the 8th
      infusion of plasma.
