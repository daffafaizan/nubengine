      partial or full thickness wounds, evaluated using the Bates Jensen Wound Assessment Tool
      (BWAT).

      The secondary objectives are comparison of the proportion of subjects with wound closure by
      day 22, comparison of pain assessed using a visual analog scale (VAS), and evaluation of
      moist wound environment as per the BWAT.
