      and physiology studies, as well as translational modeling and engineering development. In
      order to be successful, Closed Loop Control (CLC) in T1DM must adapt to individual
      physiologic characteristics and to the behavioral profile of each person. Here, we have laid
      the foundation by testing an educational tool that aims at providing feedback to patients
      with the goal of optimizing patient's glucose control under conventional insulin therapy.
      This educational tool is based on collecting data from patients that are processed by
      algorithms giving insight into the relationship between glucose control and psychobehavioral
      characteristics of the individual. This information will eventually inform a CLC system,
      which will be initialized for each individual based on relevant behavioral and physiologic
      characteristics, and will include algorithmic observers of patients' behavior and metabolic
      state.
