      bioactive compound, on skin health in humans in vivo despite considerable evidence for
      protective effects in experimental studies. Vitamin C is essential for skin health and
      stabilises catechins in the gut lumen. Ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in sunlight is a key
      environmental stressor impacting on skin health. Effects include acute inflammation and
      longer term photodamage.

      OBJECTIVE: To examine the protective effect of catechin and vitamin C on UVR-induced
      inflammation.

      STUDY DESIGN

      (1) A double-blind randomised controlled nutritional study in 50 healthy volunteers.
      Volunteers will receive 3 months dietary supplement with high dose bioactive (n=25),or
      placebo (n=25).

      The aim is to quantify the influence of catechin/vitamin C on:

        1. UVR-induced inflammation

        2. Leukocyte infiltration

        3. Inflammatory mediators

        4. Markers of photoageing

        5. DNA damage

        6. Bioavailability will also be assessed

      (2) Bioavailability of catechin and vitamin C in skin and blood. Volunteers will receive
      active dietary supplement. Blood and urine samples will be taken over a period of 6 hours to
      determine blood bioavailability. Skin biopsies will also be taken to assess skin
      bioavailability. Volunteers will then receive 3 months of active dietary supplement followed
      by repeated sampling.
