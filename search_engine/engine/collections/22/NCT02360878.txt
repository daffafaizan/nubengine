      initial clinical outcomes suggest that this minimally invasive endoscopic technique
      potentially has beneficial effects on type 2 diabetes also. However, the mechanisms behind
      the antidiabetic effects of the procedure remain unknown. We want to elucidate how the DJBS
      might change postprandial secretion of gut and pancreatic hormones.
