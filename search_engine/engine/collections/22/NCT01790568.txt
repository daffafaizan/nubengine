      disease (GVHD) prophylaxis after unrelated donor allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplantation (HCT). A major limitation of the increased utilization of allogeneic HCT
      (Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation) is the inferior outcomes when donors other than HLA
      (HumanLeukocyte Antigen)-matched siblings are used. Compared to matched related donors,
      recipients of matched unrelated donor transplants are at a significantly increased risk of
      death and transplant-related mortality (TRM). Acute GVHD remains a significant contributor to
      TRM, which develops in approximately 50-70% of recipients receiving these type of grafts
      despite standard immunosuppressive prophylaxis. Thus, novel GVHD prophylaxis strategies which
      successfully attenuate acute GVHD-related complications without increasing other causes of
      TRM or relapse are needed.

      The historical experience of day 100 grade 2-4 acute GVHD in 154 comparable patients treated
      at the University of Michigan (2005 - 2011) receiving standard GVHD prophylaxis after
      unrelated donor allogeneic transplant is 48%. At Washington University, the cumulative
      incidence of acute grade 2-4 GVHD in patients following unrelated donor transplant is 62%.

      Research data collectively suggests, that reducing lethal acute GVHD should improve long-term
      survival for patients undergoing unrelated donor transplant.
