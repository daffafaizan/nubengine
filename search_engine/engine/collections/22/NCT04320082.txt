      data to evaluate the role of the age-dependent blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in
      general anesthesia and its meaning in POD pathophysiology following protocol will be
      followed:

        1. On the day of the surgery the 21 DC-EEG sintered Ag/AgCl (silver chloride) electrodes
           will be placed before the start of anesthesia following the 10-20-system.

        2. The first blood sample will be collected via the routinely placed intravenous catheter.

        3. During the induction of anesthesia special care will be given to the exact time of loss
           of consciousness (LOC), defined with the suppression of the lid closure reflex.

        4. Markers will be set at important time points of the anesthetic care (Baseline, start of
           analgesia/anesthesia, LOC, intubation, beginning of surgical procedure, end of
           anesthesia, regain of consciousness, extubation, admission recovery room).

        5. Shortly after consciousness has vanished (5-10 minutes), a second blood sample will be
           drawn.

        6. The DC-EEG recording will last until one hour after arrival at the recovery room, during
           which NuDesc score will be assessed every 15 minutes.

        7. A third blood sample is to be collected in the recovery room. In the five days following
           surgery patients will be visited in the morning and in the evening to screen delirious
           symptoms with the help of standardized scores (NuDesc, DSM V, DDS). If patients are
           staying on the intensive care unit the CAM-ICU will be used.

      Blood sample analysis will include blood cells count, electrolytes, inflammatory markers,
      cholesterols, proteins, structural BBB markers and markers of neuronal damage.
