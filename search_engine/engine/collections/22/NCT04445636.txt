      Group A patients (n =25) will receive caudal epidural analgesia using dexmedetomidine with
      bupivacaine, whereas Group B patients (n = 25) will receive caudal epidural analgesia using
      morphine with bupivacaine.

      Randomization will be achieved by using an online random number generator. Patient codes will
      be placed into sequentially numbered sealed opaque envelopes by a research assistant who is
      not involved in the study. An anesthesia resident not involved in patient management will be
      responsible for opening the envelope. The anesthesia resident will prepare the study drug
      according to the instructions contained within each envelope and give it to the
      anesthesiologist.
