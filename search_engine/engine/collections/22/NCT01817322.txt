      comparative, longitudinal, and investigator-initiated study. Patients with end-stage renal
      disease will be assessed for the eligibility, and then be randomized using random number
      table into one of two groups prior to kidney transplantation.

      Immunosuppression consisted of Cyclosporine(Neoral®), Methylprednisolone OR prednisone OR
      deflazacort(Brand name is not designated) and Enteric-Coated Mycophenolate Sodium(Myfortic®).
      Basilixumab(Simulect®) will be given just prior to transplant and 4 days after
      transplantation. The Enteric-Coated Mycophenolate Sodium will be given orally at the dose of
      720 mg BID for Group A (investigational) or 360 mg BID for Group B (comparator), starting at
      two days after transplantation, as shown in the figure below. Cyclosporine will be given
      orally at a dose of 10 mg/Kg/day starting at a day before transplantation. Within a month
      after transplantation, the dose of the drug will be individually adjusted with goal trough
      blood level between 100 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL for Group A or between 200 ng/mL and 300 ng/mL
      for Group B, as displayed in the table below. From a month to 2 months post-transplantation,
      the target blood trough levels of cyclosporine will be reduced to between 75 ng/mL and 150
      ng/mL for Group A or between 150 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL for Group B. From 2 months to 4 months
      post-transplantation, it will be further reduced to between 50 ng/mL and 125 ng/mL for Group
      A or between 125 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL for Group B. After 4 months post-transplantation, it
      will be further reduced to between 50 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL for Group A or between 100 ng/mL
      and 200 ng/mL for Group B.
