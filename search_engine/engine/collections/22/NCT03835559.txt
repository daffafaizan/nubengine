      varicose veins, and 6% have more advanced chronic venous disease, including skin changes and
      healed or active venous ulcers. There are several modalities to treat varicose veins. Open
      surgical treatment with ligation and stripping of the saphenous vein, combined with excision
      of large varicosities, has been the standard of care for many years. Endovenous thermal
      ablation by radiofrequency ablation (RFA) or endovenous laser ablation (EVLA) has been shown
      to be a safe and effective alternatives with high long-term target vein closure rates.
      Although both techniques have gained broad acceptance in many countries, one major
      disadvantage of these techniques is the requirement for use of tumescent anesthesia to avoid
      the thermal injury of the surrounding structures. Cyanoacrylate closure for varicose veins
      has recently been introduced for treatment of the incompetent saphenous vein.
