      cardiac surgery. The most commeon practice is to give Trasylol in high doses immediately
      before surgery, during the operation, and during the first postoperative hours. However, it
      has also been shown that there is a hemostatic effect of the drug when given in a lower dose
      postoperatively, but this remains unclear.
