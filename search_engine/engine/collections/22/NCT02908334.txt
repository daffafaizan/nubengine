      activity against cryptococcal meningitis in clinical trials. Disseminated and meningeal
      coccidiodes infections require lifelong treatment, have poor outcomes, and new treatment
      options are needed. In this study the investigators will determine safety and tolerability of
      adjunctive sertraline (grade 4-5 adverse reactions) compared to standard coccidioidomycosis
      therapy alone.
