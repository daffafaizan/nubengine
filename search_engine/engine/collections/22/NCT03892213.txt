      disease. Thus, an in vivo interaction study in healthy volunteers may be justified as the two
      drugs are intended to be administered concomitantly in patients and no in vivo nor in vitro
      data are available.

      In addition both interactions (potential for benznidazole to interact on the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) of E1224 and potential for E1224 on the PK of benznidazole should be studied.

      Benznidazole t1/2 is quite short (12 h) whereas E1224 t1/2 is very long (more than 200 h).
      Therefore it was chosen to study the interaction of E1224 at steady-state while interaction
      of benznidazole after single dose appears more appropriate instead of a classical randomized
      cross-over design.
