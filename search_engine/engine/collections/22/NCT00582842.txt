      for localized prostate cancer with 1 of 6 established management alternatives: external
      (XRT)or interstitial radiotherapy (IRT), open radical prostatectomy (RP), laparoscopic
      radical prostatectomy (LRP), combined radiotherapy and brachytherapy (Combined RT) or
      watchful waiting (WW). HRQOL is an important aspect of any treatment for prostate cancer due
      to the beliefs by many that cancer control rates are similar across common modalities and
      HRQOL reduction from treatment is substantial (1-5). Therefore, HRQOL appears to occupy a
      central role in the decision making process related to treatment selection.
