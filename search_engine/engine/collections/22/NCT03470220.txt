    
      Patients admitted to Stockholm South General Hospital's Surgery Department, with a confirmed
      diagnosis of acute cholecystitis (according to the Tokyo Guidelines 2013) will be considered
      eligible for the study and asked to participate. Informed consent will be obtained from all
      participants. Participants will be examined with ultrasound of the gallbladder daily, while
      receiving regular care for acute cholecystitis, which means either waiting for acute surgery
      or being treated conservatively for as long as inpatient care is needed.

      The ultrasound examinations will be performed by a radiologist or a specialised certified
      ultrasound trained nurse as well as by an ultrasound trained surgeon. Measures of gallbladder
      volume (measured in cm3), gallbladder wall thickness (measured in mm:s) and presence of
      oedema in the gallbladder wall (noted as a binomial variable 'yes/no') are recorded in a case
      report form (no.1) together with body temperature, labs and information about onset of
      symptoms.

      The operating surgeon (a specialist in surgery) will evaluate the operation and grade it from
      easy to difficult and fill in a case report form (no.2).

      Data will be collected from the forms and analysed using a regression model (generalised
      estimated equation or a mixed model).
