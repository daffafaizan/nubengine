      change in its composition, therefore causing dry mouth.It can cause severe decline in quality
      of life and up to date, there have been few effective treatments for xerostomia.

      The purpose of the current trial is to investigate the effect of herbal extract granule named
      Yukmijihwang-tang (YMT) on dry mouth. The trial is a randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled, 2-arm, 2-centered study. Ninety-six patients with xerostomia will be
      randomly assigned to one of the 2 groups consisting of YMT or placebo. The assigned
      treatments will last for 8 weeks and the follow-up period will be 2 weeks.

      The primary outcomes are Visual analogue scale (VAS) for xerostomia.

      The present study is designed to examine the safety and efficacy of YMT on xerostomia. Our
      study provides the clinical evidence of a new therapeutic strategy for xerostomia.
