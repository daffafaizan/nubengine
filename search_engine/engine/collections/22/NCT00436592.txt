      safety and feasibility of the NeuroFlo device in acute ischemic stroke patients whose last
      known time symptom-free is between 8-24 hours.

      A maximum of 25 patients at 5 US sites and 25 patients at 10 Canadian & European sites may be
      enrolled in this initial study phase. An independent data safety and monitoring board will
      assess the safety of the treatment on a routine basis.
