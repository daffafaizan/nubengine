      evaluate the satiating properties of the encapsulated flavours in different gummies in a
      group of healthy overweight subjects.

      The investigators included 12 participants (6 men and 6 women) between 18 and 55 years (BMI
      â‰¥25 and <30 kg / m2). All volunteers will be randomized into 3 study groups, and participants
      will receive the 3 different study products in order during the 3 experimental phases.
