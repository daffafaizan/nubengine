      body composition, bone health and metabolic and hormonal variables, and compare it with other
      types of classic aerobic training, such as running, for example .

      Soccer is a high popularity team sport, with more than 400 million active practitioners in
      the world, and due to various motivational and social factors of this activity we can
      consider it as a great tool potential in promoting the health of sedentary individuals, but
      football fans. Thus, we believe that the combined use of exercises that make up the soccer
      training, such as running, walking, sprints, acceleration, deceleration, jumps, side court,
      dribbling, etc., can result in significant adaptive changes in the physiological system,
      contributing improvements in cardiovascular function, bone mineralization in muscle strength,
      physical performance and metabolism of lipids and glucose.

      Therefore we aimed to investigate in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 the impact of a
      soccer training program with 12 weeks:

        -  body composition, by examining DXA, assessing the content of lean mass and fat mass;

        -  the concentration of muscle and visceral fat by means of nuclear magnetic resonance
           spectroscopy;

        -  the bone markers for the quantification of osteocalcin hormone, carboxy terminal
           telopeptides (CTX), propeptide amino-terminal of procollagen type I (P1NP), parathyroid
           hormone (PTH) and 25-hydroxy vitamin D, growth factor insulin-like-1 free ( IGF1-free);

      As a secondary objective, we intend to evaluate the impact of soccer training and classic
      aerobic exercise on metabolic and hormonal variables of type 2 diabetic patients:

        -  the parameters of cardiovascular disease, for investigating blood pressure and
           quantification of lipid fractions (total cholesterol and fractions, triglycerides) and
           C-reactive protein;

        -  physical performance, evaluating the physical capacity by examining ergospirometry;

        -  and the metabolic variables, enzymatic and hormonal following: blood glucose, glycated
           hemoglobin (HbA1c), tolerance test oral glucose (OGTT), blood lactate, free fatty acids,
           blood count, insulin, proinsulin, leptin, adiponectin, and enzymes AST, ALT, CK and DHL.
