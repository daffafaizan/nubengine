      Retrospective Biospecimen Retention: Samples With DNA Biospecimen Description: Tissue Study
      Population Description: Children's Oncology Group Sampling Method: Non-Probability Sample

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether methylation status predicts response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
      samples from children and young adults with osteosarcoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (good vs
      poor).

      DNA and RNA extracted from biopsy samples are analyzed for methylation changes and
      transcription changes by ligation-mediated PCR and mass-array genotyping.
