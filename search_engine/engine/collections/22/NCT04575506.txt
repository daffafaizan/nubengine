      the hepatic steatosis and intestinal and salivary microbiota in children grouped as
      non-overweight, obese-non-hepatic steatosis, and obese-hepatic steatosis. Then, an
      intervention study (Study II) will be developed for those children with obesity (i.e.,
      obese-non-hepatic steatosis, and obese-hepatic steatosis groups).

      Methodology: A total of 60 children, 8-12 years-old, will be assigned to control
      (non-overweight children, N= 20), obese-non-hepatic steatosis (children with obesity, but
      without hepatic steatosis, N=20), and obese-hepatic steatosis (children with obesity and
      hepatic steatosis, N= 20) groups (Study I: case-control study). The obesity and obesity +
      hepatic steatosis groups will attend to a 12-weeks healthy lifestyle education program (2
      days/month) and home-based exercise program (minimum 3 days/week) (Study II: intervention
      study).

      The combined intervention program for the Study II will include: i) healthy lifestyle
      education program focused on dietary and lifestyle guidelines for both children and parents
      (2 days/month, 60 min), and ii) exercise program based on high-intensity interval training
      which combines aerobic and resistance training (at least 3 days/week, from 38 to 44 min).

      Measurements: In the Study I (i.e., case-control study), all participants will be evaluated
      at baseline. For the Study II (i.e., intervention study), only those participants that
      belongs to obese-non-hepatic steatosis and obese-hepatic steatosis groups, will be
      additionally evaluated after the intervention program (12-week). The following outcomes will
      be measured: hepatic fat fraction and abdominal adiposity (magnetic resonance imaging),
      intestinal and salivary microbiota, body composition (bioimpedance), cardiometabolic risk
      factors, liver enzymes, physical fitness (field-fitness tests), physical activity
      (accelerometry), sleep (accelerometry), dietary habits (24h recalls, and food frequency
      questionnaires), and pubertal development and sociodemographic characteristics will be
      measured.
