      University division of dermatology", recently developed a novel 6-hour method to study IL-17A
      (Interleukin) and IL-22 from fresh biopsies of psoriatic patients. This reproducible
      experimental approach combines enzymatic digestion and mechanical dissociation for skin cell
      isolation. This is followed by a multi-color flow cytometry analysis in the absence of in
      vitro expansion and re-stimulation. Using this method, we examined the cellular source of
      IL-17A and IL-22 on a small number (20x10Â³) of viable CD45+ (Cluster of Differentiation
      Antigen 45) cells that are freshly isolated from 4 mm punch skin biopsies (n=22 patients with
      psoriasis). The method was used for the study on "Persistence of IL-17A+ T lymphocytes and
      IL-17A expression in psoriatic plaques refractory to ustekinumab therapy" presented during
      the 72nd annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology in Denver. A detailed
      presentation of this method will be done during the upcoming annual meeting of the Society
      for Investigative Dermatology in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

      We would like to investigate and adapt this method for other dermatological conditions such
      as Atopic Dermatitis, Acne Rosacea and Acne Vulgaris.
