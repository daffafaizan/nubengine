    
      Patients having completed the week 34 assessment in the C87077 (NCT00580840) study or having
      met the pre-defined criteria for flare (defined as patients that have randomized at Week 18
      and experienced at 2 consecutive visits between Week 18 and Week 34 inclusive an equal to
      Baseline (W0) or worst swollen and tender joints counts), will be given the option to enroll
      in C87084 and receive certolizumab pegol [400 mg at Entry, Week 2, and Week 4 followed by 200
      mg every two weeks (Q2W)] in combination with MTX until the drug is commercially available
      for the indication of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) in the patient's country or region or until
      further notice from UCB.

      All patients will continue their MTX treatment at the same stable dose as during the C87077
      (NCT00580840) study, unless there is a need to reduce the dose for reasons for toxicity.
