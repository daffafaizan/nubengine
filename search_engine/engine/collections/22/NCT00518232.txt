      including 6-week titration phase and 4-week maintenance phase. After an initial baseline
      evaluation, patients currently receiving IR-Methylphenidate (IR-MPH) therapy will switch to
      receiving OROS-methylphenidate once daily. Patients receiving IR-MPH =15 mg per day will
      switch to receive 18 mg once daily OROS-methylphenidate. For patients on IR-MPH daily dosage
      >15 mg and =30 mg, the initial dose of OROS-methylphenidate will be 36 mg once daily. Other
      patients receiving IR-MPH higher than 30 mg per day, will switch to receive 54 mg once daily
      OROS-methylphenidate. During the 6-week titration phase, those patients who do not achieve
      the criteria of "Optimal Response" will be titrated by biweekly increase to next dose level
      (36 mg per day, and then 54 mg per day). The maximum dose of OROS-methylphenidate per day is
      54 mg as package insert indicates. However, dose decreases are allowed if clinically
      intolerable adverse events emerge. At the end of 6-week titration phase, the final titration
      dose should be maintained for the last 4 weeks of the trial regardless of the optimal
      response. In summary, all patients will attend bi-weekly clinic visits for the first 6 weeks
      (visit 2 to 4) and monthly clinic visits for the subsequent 4 weeks (visit 5). Patients will
      receive 18 mg or 36mg or 54 mg once daily OROS-methylphenidate for 10 weeks.
