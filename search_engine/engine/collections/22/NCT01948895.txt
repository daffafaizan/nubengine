      desvenlafaxine monotherapy in dysthymic subjects.

      Secondary objectives: To evaluate the efficacy of desvenlafaxine on clinical measures
      relating to improvement of depressive symptoms, quality of life and occupational functioning.

      symptoms after 8 weeks of treatment with desvenlafaxine. There will be significant
      improvement in measures of quality of life and stress coping at end of treatment, compared to
      Baseline. There will also be significant improvement in measures of occupational functioning
