      general anesthesia were randomized in a double-blinded method to receive one of three
      different concentration study solutions in 8 ml of volume after the induction of anesthesia:
      0.75% ropivacaine (60 mg), 0.375% ropivacaine (30 mg), or 0.2% ropivacane (16 mg).

      In each group, the patients were divided into two subgroups at the age of 60 to perform age
      based analysis. The acquired hemodynamic data after administration of epidural loading dose
      were compared and analyzed between young and elderly groups in each group.
