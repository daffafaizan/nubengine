      unfavorable effects on patient's recovery and procedure's outcome. Administration of opioid
      analgesics is routinely practiced but is limited with dose-related adverse effects.[1] Within
      this concept, combining an opioid with different analgesics acting by different mechanisms as
      multimodal analgesia is recommended for effective post-operative pain control Dexketoprofen
      trometamol is a newly developed, centrally acting NSAID with potency similar to that of
      μ-opioid agonists.[4] In a number of studies in different pain models, it has been proven to
      have a good analgesic efficacy and tolerability.

      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2 adrenoceptor agonist that provides sedation,
      analgesia, and sympatholysis. These characteristics make dexmedetomidine useful anesthetic
      adjunct during operation. Previous studies report that intravenous has a definitive role in
      postoperative analgesia through the reduction of opioid consumption The aim of this
      prospective randomized, double-blind study is to evaluate the analgesic efficacy and opioid
      sparing effects of preemptive single dose of dexketoprofen trometamol in comparison with
      dexmedetomidine in the patients abdominal hysterectomy , over a 24-hour (h) investigation
      period.

      After institutional approval and informed consent had been obtained, 60 patients scheduled
      for abdominal hysterectomy randomly allocated into two equal groups. Patients received ıv
      dexketoprofen 50 mg (Group I), ıv dexmedetomidine 1mcg/kg (Group II) after anesthesia
      induction and 10 minutes (min) before surgical incision. Patient controlled analgesia was
      supplied postoperatively using morphine. Hemodynamics, visual analogue scale (VAS), sedation
      score, morphine consumption, and side effects were recorded every and at 2, 6, 12 and 24 h
      after surgery.
