    
      This study is designed as a Phase I, blinded, randomized, four-arm clinical trial.
      Participants will be randomized to one of the four interventions: Biest transdermal cream 2.0
      mg/0.5 g daily, Biest 2.5 mg/0.5 g daily, Biest 3.0 mg/0.5 g daily or Vivelle-Dot patch 0.05
      mg/24 hours changed biweekly. Serum levels of E1, E2, E3 and progesterone will be obtained at
      baseline before starting the intervention and then multiple times on days 1 15 and 16 of
      study, as outlined in the table below (Table 3.1). The peak and steady state concentrations
      of E1, E2 and E3, along with time to reach the peak levels, and area under the curve will be
      calculated. Baseline and steady state levels of progesterone will also be compared between
      the compounded and micronized progesterone groups. If there are abnormalities in estrogen
      levels or symptoms suggesting such, a vaginal ultrasound would be done to exclude possible
      ovarian activity as a source.
