      stem cell transplantation with regulatory and conventional T cell adoptive immunotherapy will
      be proposed to eligible High and Very-High risk MDS patients. Intermediate risk MDS patients
      will be assessed for risk modification every six months and moved to transplant in case of
      increased risk. Intermediate risk MDS patients will be also evaluated for the presence of
      molecular alterations (TP53, ASXL1, RUNX1). Overall survival of the entire cohort will be
      assessed as primary endpoint. Incidence of Treatment Related Mortality, acute Graft versus
      Host Disease, chronic Graft versus Host Disease, Relapse will be also assessed.
