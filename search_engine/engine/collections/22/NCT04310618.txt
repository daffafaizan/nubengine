    
      Prospective cross-sectional study of repeated measurements. The recruitment will be performed
      in 3 different cities of Spain: Zaragoza, Barcelona and Murcia.

      Subjects will be asked to repeatedly collect spontaneous and induced sputum samples in both
      stable and exacerbated conditions. All samples will be collected autonomously by patients in
      their homes after they have been instructed and supervised. Hypertonic saline nebulization
      will be used for sputum induction.
