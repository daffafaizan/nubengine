      infection in one centre attending thousands of COVID-19 patients, and with shorteness of
      personal protective equipments. Our hypothesis is that this relatively low number of infected
      HCW could be secondary to:

        1. Differences in susceptibility to infection mediated by changes in viral receptors. Thus,
           it is important to characterize and genotyping the main receptor for SARS-CoV-2, ACE2,
           and other related receptor, such as CD26.

        2. Increased cellular immune response, offering cross-immunity against SARS CoV-2 infection
           by previous exposure to other coronavirus or respiratory pathogens. A specific CD4/CD8 T
           cell response to viral peptides could respond this question

        3. Specific KIR phenotypes (Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptors): Natural killer cells
           (NK) response to alterations of class I HLA molecules presented in infected cells. An
           increase in class I HLA expression could lead to an increase in NK activation by
           increasing its ability to produce IFN-gamma.
