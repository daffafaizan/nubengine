    
      This research study will involve the use of a placebo vaginal film. Investigators want to
      evaluate the safety of the film and understand the acceptability and length of time for the
      film to dissolve once inserted into the vagina. In future studies, this film may have
      medication added to it to deliver medication over an extended period of time (i.e. extended
      release).

      All of the eligible women will be randomized (distributed by chance, like rolling a dice) at
      the Enrollment Visit to one of four study groups. The groups will specify what day Visit 3
      will be performed.

      Participants will have an equal likelihood of being in any one of the four groups. Neither
      the participant nor the study staff can choose the group or can change the group the
      participant has been placed into. Regardless of which group the participant is in she will
      only use the film once during the study. Women in all of the study groups will have the same
      study visit schedule except for the timing of Visit 3.
