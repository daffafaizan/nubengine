      and functional performance are affected by the level of footwear suitability. Particularly in
      elderly who have generally balance disorders and falling, footwear suitability is very
      important. Thus this study was designed to investigate the effects of footwear suitability on
      functional performance level and balance in elderly. The Footwear Assessment Score was used
      to assess parameters such as the design materials for footwear (upper and base), bending
      point, width, height of the toe box, getting out of the foot when walking, heel height,
      footwear style, wearing of the heel, and the distance between the longest toe and the end of
      the footwear. Thus, footwear was evaluated in many parameters.

      In the literature, there are studies in which footwear was evaluated in only parameter such
      as height of heel.
