      number of factors conspire to cause a high rate of wound breakdown and other complications in
      this patient group. Reported rates of wound healing complications vary in the literature, but
      tend to affect > 40% of patients.

      A new negative pressure wound therapy device is recommended for use in clean, closed surgical
      wounds (PICO™ system, Smith & Nephew Healthcare, UK). Patients will be randomised to receive
      either PICO™ system for up to seven days, or conventional dressings, and then assessed for
      wound healing and other outcome measures.
