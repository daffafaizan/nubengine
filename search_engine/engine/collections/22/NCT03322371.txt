      polysomnography (PSG) is the gold standard measure, but impractical for critical care. The
      relative influence of environment, illness and interventions on sleep in critically ill
      patients is therefore essentially unknown. Interventions to improve sleep have been pragmatic
      and outcomes subjective or indirect, and uninformed. When it is done, formal PSG in critical
      illness demonstrates fragmented, shortened, interrupted and non-circadian sleep, with
      environmental noise, light, and frequent physical stimulation causing arousals.
