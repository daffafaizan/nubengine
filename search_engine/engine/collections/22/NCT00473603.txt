      metabolic disturbances in obesity and type 2 diabetes. In addition, FFAs seems to have a
      stimulatory effect on adrenal androgen precursors in men. However, the effect of FFAs on
      androgen precursors and androgens in women is yet unknown.

      Therefore the effect of increased FFAs on adrenal androgens and androgen precursors should be
      investigated in a randomized controlled cross-over trial.
