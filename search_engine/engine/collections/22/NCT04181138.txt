    
      Pediatric primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) is a rare autoimmune biliary fibrosing disease
      that leads to significant morbidity, the need for liver transplantation in ~50% of patients,
      and an increased risk for biliary and colorectal cancers in adulthood. The progression of the
      biliary disease in children is variable and risk factors associated with a more rapid
      progression of disease have not been adequately studied. Importantly, pediatric hepatologists
      have never previously collaborated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) specialists to
      rigorously explore interactions between colonic inflammation and liver disease. New
      non-invasive imaging modalities to measure fibrosis have not been explored in pediatric PSC.
      Furthermore, the impact that PSC has on the global functioning of children is not well
      understood, and likely underappreciated.

      The natural history of pediatric PSC is poorly understood. This study aims to determine risk
      factors, including activity of co-existent IBD, associated with more rapid progression of
      disease, characterize the impact of PSC on global functioning, define the spectrum and
      prognostic value of biliary tract disease and liver fibrosis based on novel imaging
      techniques, and establish a biobank of specimens for future mechanistic studies aimed at
      discovering biomarkers pertaining to etiology and severity of PSC and novel mechanisms of
      immunopathogenesis of disease. This comprehensive observational and longitudinal study will
      delineate unique aspects of the natural history and severity of pediatric PSC and of
      associated IBD and provide necessary data for future therapeutic trials. It aims to provide a
      platform to discover and validate circulating and imaging biomarkers, which may serve as
      surrogate endpoints in future interventional studies.
