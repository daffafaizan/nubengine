      Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is an autosomal recessive motor neuron disease that is caused
      by mutations in the survival motor neuron gene, SMN1. The objective of this study is to
      determine the SMN copy number distribution in the Malian population and to compare this to
      published data obtained elsewhere. It is anticipated that this study will help to refine the
      knowledge of SMA by assessing the distribution of SMN copy number, and the SMA carrier
      frequency in a sub-Saharan nation, thus expanding the information base available to
      clinicians and patients considering SMA carrier testing.

      Study Population

      The study population will include 1400 adult (18 years of age and older) volunteers only.

      Design

      Blood samples from volunteers will be collected from students at the School of Medicine,
      Pharmacy, and Dentistry (FMPOS) at the University of Bamako, which consists of an ethnically
      diverse population representative of the Malian ethnicities. No therapy will be provided to
      study participants.

      Outcome Measures

      Outcome measure for phase 1 is DNA extraction yield of sufficient quantity and quality for
      SMN genotyping by LabCorp in at least 90% of samples. Outcome measures for phase 2 are the
      frequency of SMA carriers (SMN1 deletion heterozygotes) and the SMN1 and SMN2 copy number
      distribution in Mali.
