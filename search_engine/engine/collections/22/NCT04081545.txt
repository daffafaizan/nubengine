      the effect of an opioid-free general anesthetic versus a traditional anesthetic with a
      restricted quantity of opioid on postoperative opioid consumption following laparoscopic
      bariatric surgery. The study population will be composed of 196 subjects undergoing
      laparoscopic bariatric surgery at Virginia Mason Medical center randomized into two groups.
      The control group will receive a traditional opioid restrictive general anesthetic. The study
      group will receive an opioid-free anesthetic technique.
