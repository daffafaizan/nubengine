    
      XT-150 has been safe and well tolerated in clinical studies of intra-articular knee
      injections for osteoarthritis.

      This is the initial study of XT-150 for treatment of neuropathic pain. For this indication
      XT-150 must be administered by intrathecal injection. Doses used in the osteoarthritis
      studies will be studied for neuropathic pain.

      Upon safety reviews, doses will be increased by cohorts.

      The study is placebo controlled and blinded.
