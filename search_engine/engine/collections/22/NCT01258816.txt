    
      Elacytarabine is an investigational drug which is not commercially available. It consists of
      a fatty acid that is connected to cytarabine which is commonly used in treatment of AML. Due
      to the connection to a fatty acid, elacytarabine might have an increased uptake in blast
      cells and thereby increased efficacy.

      The characterisation of the pharmacokinetics of an investigational drug, as well as the
      cardiac safety are essential. The PK of both elacytarabine and its metabolites will be
      assessed at defined timepoints before, during and after infusion. The cardiac safety of
      elacytarabine will be evaluated by triplicate ECG recordings at the same time points as the
      PK assessments.

      Elacytarabine will be given as a continuous infusion for 5 days. The patients may continue
      with further courses of elacytarabine as long as the patient benefits from treatment with
      elacytarabine.
