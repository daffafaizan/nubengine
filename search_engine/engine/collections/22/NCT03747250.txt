      the tip of the laryngoscope blade can visualize also structures that canÂ´t be seen on direct
      laryngoscopy, co the operator can obtain superior view of aditus laryngis during intubation.
      Currently videolaryngoscopy is not routinely used for intubation and it is reserved for
      patients with difficult airway. The aim of the trial is to compare the elective use of
      videolaryngoscopy versus direct laryngoscopy for elective airway management (tracheal
      intubation). Patients after informed consent approval will be randomized to the
      interventional group (videolaryngoscopy) and control group (laryngoscopy). The randomization
      will be managed by the Institute of Biostatistics and Analyses by the Faculty of medicine,
      Masaryk university. The primary aim will be the first intubation attempt success rate, the
      secondary aims will be time to successful intubation (time to first ETCO2 wave), overall
      success rate, number of intubation attempts, incidence of aspiration, desaturation and
      incidence of overall complications in all operators, in trainees, residents (5-10 years of
      practice), consultants (10-15 years of clinical practice) and consultants with over 15 years
      of clinical practice.
