      successful bilateral cataract surgery. Subjects will be assessed pre-operatively, operatively
      and at 1 day, 1 month and 3 months post-operatively. Clinical evaluations will include
      administration of a spectacle independence questionnaire, as well as measurement of bilateral
      visual acuity and manifest refraction.
