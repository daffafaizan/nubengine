      this clinical trial uses immediately available off-the-shelf induced pluripotent stem cell
      (iPSC) derived NK cells already being used to treat cancer patients.

      FT516 is an off-the-shelf cryopreserved NK cell product derived from an iPSC that was
      transduced with a high affinity, ADAM17 non-cleavable CD16 (Fc receptor) that maintains CD16
      on the cell surface, which remains fully functional after NK cell activation. The
      investigators expect that natural developing anti-COVID IgG (early data suggest that some
      develop in 7-10 days after diagnosis) will enhance targeting of FT516 to infected cells.
