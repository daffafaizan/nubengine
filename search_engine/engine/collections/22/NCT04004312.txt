      between the prostate and the rectum. This procedure is done with the use of a transrectal
      ultrasound, similarly to the prostate biopsy the patient had. A local anesthetic will be
      applied to numb the skin and to the underneath tissue where the injection will be performed.
      The procedure itself will take approximately 20 minutes and after a short observation time,
      the patient returns home.

      The next visit (approximately after 7 days after the insertion of the gel), a CT scan and
      MRI-scan will be done. Prior to the scans, a urinary catheter will be inserted in the bladder
      through the penis, and removed once the scans are done. Using these images, the doctor and
      the team involved will perform an individualized planning study to establish the safest way
      the radiation will enter your body. When the treatment plan is ready, patient is called to
      receive the single treatment.

      A urinary catheter again will be inserted in the bladder and the patient will be directed to
      the room where your treatment will be delivered. The treatment should last approximately 30
      minutes. After the treatment, the urinary catheter will be removed.
