      assigned to receive either dexamethasone 0.1%/povidone-iodine 0.4% or artificial tears.
      Sealed, randomly numbered opaque manila envelopes containing unlabeled bottles of either
      dexamethasone 0.1%/povidone-iodine 0.4% or artificial tears were given to the patient.
      Patients were instructed to put one drop into each symptomatic eye four times daily for 7
      days. The identity of the drops was masked to both the investigators and patients until the
      study was closed. At the end of the study, the code for the randomization scheme was
      obtained. This study was approved by an ethics committee linked to the Institution of origin,
      and written informed consent was obtained from all patients.

      Patients were evaluated at baseline and were asked to return either 5, 10 and 30 days later
      for a follow-up evaluation. The principal efficacy variables were six symptoms of viral
      conjunctivitis: overall discomfort, itching, foreign body sensation, tearing, redness, and
      lid swelling. Four signs of viral conjunctivitis were also evaluated: conjunctival injection,
      conjunctival chemosis, conjunctival mucus, and lid edema.

      Each of the symptoms was rated by the patient at presentation and at follow-up on a 4 point
      scale: none (0), mild (1), moderate (2), or severe (3). In addition, each patient was asked
      to report their opinion on the usefulness of the treatment in relieving their symptoms on a
      4-point scale: did not help (0), unsure (1), think it helped (2), and sure it helped (3).
