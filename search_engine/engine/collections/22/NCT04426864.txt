      fibromyalgia syndrome on the pain, quality of life, depression, and body composition through
      a comparative study of three types of exercise intervention.

      Methods: Eighty-four patients women with fibromyalgia syndrome were assigned to three groups:
      supervised aerobic plus stretching exercises group (group I, n:28), supervised resistance
      plus stretching exercises group (group II, n:28) and home-based stretching exercises group
      (group III, n:28). The target heart rate (HR) corresponding to values of 50-70 %
      ergospirometric VO2max were determined by the submaximal treadmill test. Group I was
      instructed walking at their target HR on a treadmill. Exercise intensity in group II was
      determined by one-repetition maximum (1RM) measurements. Group III was instructed to exercise
      at home. All participants were instructed to perform stretching exercises. Before and after a
      12-week exercise program, participants were evaluated by weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), total
      body fat and muscle percentage, Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire
      (FIQ), Short Form-36 (SF-36) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI).
