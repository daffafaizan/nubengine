    
      BDB001-201 is a multi-center, open-label, multi-arm Phase II study evaluating an experimental
      immunotherapy drug called BDB001. BDB001 is a Toll-like receptor 7/8 (TLR7/8) agonist
      delivered intravenously to systemically activate the innate and adaptive immunity in the
      treatment of various tumors.

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      intravenous BDB001 administered as monotherapy in subjects with histologically-confirmed
      unresectable or metastatic solid tumors that have progressed on anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 mAb
      treatment either as monotherapy or in combination with other therapies.

      The following tumor types may be included in the trial: Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC);
      Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma (cSCC); Head and Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma (HNSCC);
      Melanoma; Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC); Renal Cell Carcinoma (RCC); Urothelial Carcinoma;
      other types of solid tumors at the discretion of the Sponsor. Each tumor type will be
      analyzed independently
