    
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious complication in patients admitted to ICU. A
      core element of critical care is resuscitation with crystalloid solutions. In many cases
      fluid accumulates and patients become fluid overloaded (positive fluid balance > 10% of
      bodyweight). This is especially true in patients with AKI, since they often have impaired
      ability to excrete salt and water. Most observational suggests harm with increased positive
      fluid balance.

      Objectives: To assess feasibility of forced fluid removal with diuretics and/or CRRT in ICU
      patients with AKI and severe fluid overload, compared to current clinical practice.

      Design: Multicentre, parallel group, randomized, assessor blinded pilot-trial with adequate
      generation of allocation sequence, and allocation concealment.

      Trial Size: The pilot study is planned to include 50 patients. Inclusion is expected to start
      in August 2015.
