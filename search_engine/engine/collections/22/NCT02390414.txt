    
      MDS is a hematologic malignancy characterized by cytopenias, bone marrow failure, and a risk
      of transformation to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). HSCT is the only curative therapy for MDS.
      Despite its increasing use among older patients (age greater than 60), more data are needed
      to assess outcomes of HSCT in older adults compared to other therapies.

      In this observational study, patients with MDS presenting at the study institutions are
      screened for disease characteristics that indicate that they are potentially appropriate for
      HSCT (both high-risk disease and fit for the procedure). Patients who meet inclusion and
      exclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study are entered into a clinical database
      and followed for overall survival. Patients also complete quality of life (QoL) assessments
      at enrollment and two years afterward, with the goal of investigating potential relationships
      between QoL and MDS treatment (HSCT vs. non-HSCT strategies).
