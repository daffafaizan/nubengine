    
      WATCH-Rhythm is a prospective, randomized, multi-center, investigation to collect safety and
      effectiveness data on combining conventional AF ablation with LAA electric isolation and
      occlusion within a single procedure.

      The primary objective is to test the effectiveness of adding LAA electrical isolation and
      closure to conventional atrial fibrillation versus conventional atrial fibrillation alone in
      treating patient with persistent atrial fibrillation from a single procedure.

      This study will be conducted at up to 10 global sites in the European Union (United Kingdom,
      Spain, Germany, or others). The maximum enrollment ceiling for the Watch-Rhythm study is 278
      subjects. Included in the enrollment ceiling are up to 20 roll-in subjects and a maximum of
      258 randomized subjects.

      The duration of the study is expected to last approximately 4 years. Enrollment is expected
      to take approximately 24 months. The duration of individual subject participation is expected
      to last approximately 2 years but may vary per subject.
