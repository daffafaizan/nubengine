    
      Patients with type 2 diabetes and nephropathy, especially patients with impaired kidney
      function, frequently encounter hyperkalemia as an adverse effect of RAAS blocking treatment.
      Consequently, RAAS blocking treatment is reduced or discontinued, which in turn impairs
      prognosis in terms of long-term renal and cardiovascular outcome. Not only can hyperkalemia
      as an adverse event lead to changes in RAAS blocking treatment, the presence of persistent
      potassium levels in the upper part of the normal range can impair the efficacy of the RAAS
      blocking treatment, another reason to expect a beneficial effect of Lokelma treatment.

      The study is a multicentre (3 sites in Sweden (TBD), 2 sites in Denmark (Steno Diabetes
      Center Copenhagen and Zealand University Hospital, Roskilde), double-blind, randomized
      placebo-controlled, parallel study. The study drug is compared to matching placebo that
      cannot be distinguished from active drug. The treatment period is 12 weeks.
