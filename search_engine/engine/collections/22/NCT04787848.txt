      immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) includes regional and widespread musculoskeletal pain of
      neuropathic and inflammatory nature. HIV-related CWP leads to 10x greater odds of functional
      impairment. However, the specific mechanisms that contribute to CWP in HIV are not
      understood. Thus, pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches to mitigate CWP have had
      minimal benefits, contributing to an overreliance on opioids and alarming rise in addiction
      and overdose. The overall objective of this study is to address the gap in the knowledge of
      the pathogenesis of HIV-related CWP. Specifically, the role of impaired endogenous opioid
      synthesis/release from leukocytes in people with HIV (PWH) who self-report CWP will be
      explored. Leukocytes (neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, and lymphocytes) are a rich source
      of opioid peptides (Met-enkephalin, dynorphin A, Î²-endorphin) that inhibit nociception by
      binding to peripheral opioid receptors. Therefore, to establish whether decreased peripheral
      opioid peptides correlate with experimental pain measures in PWH with self-reported CWP,
      quantitative sensory testing (QST) will be completed before and after administration of
      methylnaltrexone bromide (RELISTOR), a clinically available, peripherally acting opioid
      receptor antagonist.
