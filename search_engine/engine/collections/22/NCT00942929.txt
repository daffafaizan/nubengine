      cardiovascular, central nervous, endocrine, bone and gastrointestinal systems. There is
      paucity of information regarding the adverse effects of this tenacious illness on the lungs
      of adolescents at the hypocaloric stage of their illness. Based on previous clinical
      observations we postulate that lung function tests would be adversely effected by the
      hypocaloric nutrition of adolescents with anorexia nervosa and that they may improve during
      short refeeding in an inpatient setting of a general pediatric ward. To examine our
      hypothesis we would check lung function by various parameters of adolescents suffering from
      AN and a control group of adolescents.
