      pattern is reactive and suggests that the fetus is doing well. When the pattern is different
      from reactive, it is difficult to say if the fetus is doing well or not. Previous
      investigators have shown that even with the most worrisome fetal heart rate pattern, only
      2/1000 cases would require immediate delivery. Currently, we use invasive procedures like
      taking a drop of blood from fetal head to further assess how the fetus is doing or just
      proceed with the fastest way of delivery (which could increase the risk associated with
      surgery). In this research project we want to figure out whether ultrasound (a non-invasive
      method) can be used to assess how the fetus is doing during labor.
