      delivery, in both the mother and the fetus (elevated prostaglandins level), can be quantified
      using ultrasound of the fetal ductus arteriosus.

      Whether or not the ductus arteriosus plays an active physiological role in the initiation of
      parturition is unknown. Since prostaglandins are physiologically highly expressed within the
      fetal ductus arteriosus and also linked to some critical steps throughout parturition, it is
      hypothesized that structural and doppler flow pattern variations of the ductus arteriosus
      exist in the period surrounding the birth. These changes might occur before or after the
      intrinsic rise of prostaglandins and could be quantified using prenatal ultrasound of the
      fetal ductus arteriosus.

      Identifying new physiological based variables that can assist in predicting the onset of
      labour, especially surrounding preterm birth, as the one suggested in the current study, is
      thus of great importance and may provide invaluable information into the overall future care
      and decision making during pregnancy, especially around the time of delivery. It may assist
      in creating future recommendations for pregnant women and improved healthcare standards
      during the delivery process.
