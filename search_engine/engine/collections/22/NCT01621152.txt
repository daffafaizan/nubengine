      are detected by the use of AKI sniffer. The investigators will randomize consecutive patients
      who were detected to have AKI by AKI sniffer into two groups. In one group (control group),
      patients will receive standard clinical care by the primary ICU physicians. The primary
      physicians who take care of the control subjects will be kept blinded of the results of the
      AKI sniffer. All the ICU physicians will receive a copy of KDIGO (March 2012) guidelines for
      management of AKI prior to the initiation of the patient accrual. In the intervention group,
      the research team will inform the primary care team about the occurrence of the AKI and
      provides a copy of KDIGO guidelines for management of AKI to the clinicians. Each subject
      will be followed until hospital discharge or for a maximum of 3 months, for clinical and
      laboratory data including peak serum creatinine, creatinine at the end of follow up, peak
      AKIN stage, along with other secondary outcomes. The investigators will exclude the prevalent
      cases (AKI patients who have had AKI documented in their medical records by clinicians prior
      to the ICU admission).
