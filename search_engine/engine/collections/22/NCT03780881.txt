      negative expectations even if they have positive experiences that contradict their
      expectations. By contrast, healthy people change their expectations after unexpectedly
      positive experiences. In this experimental study, the authors will now examine whether there
      are also differences between healthy people and people with depressive symptoms in processing
      unexpectedly negative experiences. It is hypothesized that people with depressive symptoms
      change their expectations in a negative direction after unexpectedly negative experiences,
      while healthy people continue to hold on to an optimistic view.
