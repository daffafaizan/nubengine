      spinal disease with the ultimate goal of better guiding and assessing therapeutic
      intervention. Researchers will collect complications and safety following cervical and lumbar
      surgeries to determine best options for patients. Prospective reports will be collected on
      patients undergoing lumbar or cervical spinal surgery. Patients will be enrolled in registry
      after signing informed consent. Data will be collected at various time points. The registry
      will serve as a database of cervical and lumbar surgeries in which retrospective analysis and
      exploratory analysis of specific research questions can be answered.
