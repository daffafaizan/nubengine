      greater need for evaluation of the postoperative pain experience after discharge from the
      hospital. Pain is one of the most significant factors affecting the postoperative experience
      in adults, and also be true in the pediatric population. Control of postoperative pain in
      children after discharge from the hospital poses particular challenges due to dependence on
      parental or caretaker ability to properly evaluate the child's pain, their understanding of
      appropriate dosing of pain medications, and their willingness to administer enough
      medications until sufficient relief is achieved.

      The investigators aim to assess the differences in reported pain between groups who receive
      additional face-to-face education versus the current standard of care at a major US teaching
      hospital. The study will assess pain management after surgery using parental reports and
      questionnaires to assess their child's pain at multiple time points during the study.
      Additionally, this study will also assess baseline behavioral attributes of children and will
      compare behavioral changes at 24-48 hours, 7-10 days, and 2-4 weeks postoperatively as these
      behavior changes may also affect overall postoperative experience.

      This study is divided into phase I and phase II. Phase I is the initial assessment of the
      investigators' institution's pain management in healthy pediatric patients undergoing
      ambulatory surgical procedures. Phase II consists of randomized trial which includes a
      randomized intervention group and control group. The group selected randomly for intervention
      will receive additional teaching regarding what to expect in terms of postoperative pain and
      how to properly identify pain in children.
