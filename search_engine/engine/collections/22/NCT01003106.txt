      ranibizumab injections in patients with macular edema due to retinal vein occlusion between
      baseline and month 6. At week 24, patients will be re-randomized to receive pro re nata (prn)
      ranibizumab+laser photocoagulation versus ranibizumab alone and the efficacy of both
      treatment options will be compared. Treatment efficacy will be assessed by comparing changes
      in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central subfiled thickness (CST) between the
      treatment groups.
