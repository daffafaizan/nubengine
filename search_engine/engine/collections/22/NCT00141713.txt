      tacrolimus or cyclosporine. Previous work has shown that less than 50% of patients respond
      fully to GVHD. Without a good response, patients often have a prolonged treatment for this
      disease, often involving hospitalization and sometimes even death.

      Etanercept is a drug that blocks a chemical called Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) from causing
      damage to tissue. Etanercept (Enbrel) will be added to help improve the response to standard
      treatment for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      This is an experimental research project. It is not known whether the etanercept will
      actually improve the body's response to graft-versus-host disease. This treatment is meant to
      determine if etanercept will improve your response to treatment of GVHD.
