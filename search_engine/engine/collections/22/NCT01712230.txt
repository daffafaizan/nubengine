      menstrual cycles. Participants will be randomized to receive monthly injections of placebo or
      a study drug that reduces sex hormones (GnRH agonist) for 24 weeks. Women who receive GnRH
      agonist will be further randomized to no exercise or a supervised exercise program. Thus, the
      3 treatment groups are: placebo, GnRH agonist, GnRH agonist+exercise. The investigators will
      measure changes in calories burned during physical activity, sleep, rest, and after a meal
      after 3 and 6 months of hormone suppression using doubly-labeled water and room calorimetry.
      Other measures include food intake estimated from food records; body composition measured by
      dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); glucose and insulin responses to an oral glucose
      tolerance test; and markers of inflammation in the blood.
