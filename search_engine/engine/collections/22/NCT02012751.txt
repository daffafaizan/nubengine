      first assessed clinically by the GP and afterwards photographed. A clinical photograph as
      well as a dermatoscopic photograph is taken, the latter using a dermatoscope attached to the
      lens of the camera. The dermatoscopic image is then processed by the computer program. The
      performance of "Nevus doctor" is compared with the GPs' assessment. A dermatologist reviews
      all cases based on the clinical and dermatoscopic photographs and this assessment serves as
      the reference standard.
