      fifty patients will be studied to determine:

        -  The values and limitations of ECGI in identifying atrial fibrillation (AF) triggers, AF
           initiators and AF perpetuators as targets sites for catheter ablations in patients with
           persistent AF.

        -  The mechanisms of residual atrial tachycardia/flutter (Res-AT/AFl) after AF substrate
           ablations by targeting complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE).

        -  If there is a relationship between primary CFAE sites and driver sites or other distinct
           patterns from the ECGI mapping system.

        -  The rate of AF termination to sinus rhythm after ablation at target sites identified by
           ECGI
