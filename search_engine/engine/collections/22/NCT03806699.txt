      legal representative also agree their children participate in the study), subjects will be
      screened by required assessments per protocol. Eligible subjects who meet the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to Group 1, Group 2 or
      Control Group, receiving either ID93+GLA-SE or saline placebo on Days 0, 28 and 56. The
      investigator will evaluate the safety, immunogenicity of the Investigational Product in the
      subjects through-out the study.

      For safety assessment, subjects will be instructed to record any adverse events in the
      Subject diary after each vaccination. Subject's safety will be reported to the investigators
      after 7 days from each vaccination via site visit or a phone call. Solicited AEs will be
      collected up to 7 days after the final vaccination with the Investigational Product and
      unsolicited AEs will be collected up to 28 days after the final vaccination with the
      Investigational Product. For long-term safety assessment of the Investigational Product,
      serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest will be monitored up to 12
      months after the final vaccination with the Investigational Product.

      For immunogenicity assessment, blood samples will be collected and analyzed before and after
      each vaccination. QFT-Gold Plus testing will be performed after 1 month and 12 months from
      the final vaccination with the Investigational Product.
