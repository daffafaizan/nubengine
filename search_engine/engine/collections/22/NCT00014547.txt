      sensitive or refractory metastatic small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the duration of
      response and time to progression in patients treated with this drug. III. Determine the
      overall survival of patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the incidence and severity
      of toxic effects of this drug in this patient population. V. Determine the pharmacokinetics
      of this drug in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to disease
      (refractory vs sensitive). Patients receive BBR 3464 IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete or partial response or stable disease may
      receive up to 6 courses of therapy. Patients without progressive disease after 6 courses may
      continue treatment at the investigator's discretion. Patients are followed every 9 weeks for
      3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-74 patients (12-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
