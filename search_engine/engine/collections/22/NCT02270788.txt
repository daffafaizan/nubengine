      the combination of crenolanib with sorafenib. Patients may receive subsequent courses (up to
      a total of 365 days) if there is no disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In Day 1 of Course 1, crenolanib is given once in the morning followed by characterization of
      the pharmacokinetic profile over the following 24-hour period. Starting with day 2 of Course
      1, crenolanib will be given 3 times per day through day 28. On Days 8 to 28 of Course 1,
      sorafenib will be given once per day. Inter-patient dose escalation or de-escalation of
      crenolanib will be performed based on tolerability and toxicity.

      Response will be assessed on days 8 and at end of course. If disease progresses prior to day
      8, then sorafenib can be given before day 8.

      In subsequent courses (up to 365 days), crenolanib and sorafenib are given on days 1 through
      28. The treating physician may increase or decrease the sorafenib dose and frequency of
      administration per the trial's dosing table on the basis of effects and tolerability. If
      necessary, the crenolanib dose can be decreased per protocol.

      Maintenance therapy must start no sooner than 30 days and no later than 120 days after
      hematopoietic stem cell therapy (HSCT). Single agent crenolanib will start at the last dose
      tolerated prior to HSCT. Crenolanib maintenance can be given for up to 365 days and
      additional therapy can be provided after discussion after discussion with the PI, in patients
      who continue to benefit after 1 year.
