      positive airway pressure (CPAP) which is a form of Non-Invasive Ventilation (NIV). Some
      patients find the temperature of the breathing gas difficult to tolerate. The aim of this
      study is to compare comfort of healthy volunteer participants while being given CPAP at
      different temperatures. Healthy volunteers will be given two different levels humidity and
      temperature and asked about preference.
