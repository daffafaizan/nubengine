      injury also increases. And the most frequently occurring and debilitating knee injury in
      sports is rupture of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). Patients who aim to return to
      their preinjury sports should undergo anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction (ACLR) in
      order to maximize knee stability. The overall incidence rate of a second ACL injury within 24
      months after ACLR was nearly 6 times greater than that in healthy participants. Although many
      studies have showed about biomechanical and neuromuscular risk factors during jump landing
      which were thought to associate with the secondary injury after ACLR, these studies all
      focused on the motion of lower extremity. But actually, people often use their upper limbs to
      catch or throw a ball during jump landing in playground. Whether the upper limbs motion will
      affect the muscle coordination of lower extremity during jump landing is still unknown.
      Therefore, the purpose of our study is to investigate the effect of upper limbs motion during
      single-leg jump landing after ACLR.
