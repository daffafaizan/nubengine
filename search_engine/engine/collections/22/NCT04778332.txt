    
      All patients over the age of 16 years with traumatic injuries due to an accident related to
      the use of an electric scooter were included in the study.

      Upon admission to the Emergency Department, patients over 16 years of age who accepted were
      included in the study. The objectives of the study were firstly to describe the context and
      incidence of scooter accidents, and secondly to understand the epidemiology, complications
      and treatment of injuries associated with this means of transport and finally, to estimate
      the economic impact assessed by the number of days of post-traumatic work disability, the
      need for access to more specialised and therefore more expensive care (operating theatre
      interventions, scanner-type radiological examinations or hospitalisation in intensive care
      units).

      The data analyzed were based on :

      1) the time and day of the accident, 2) the time of presentation at the hospital (same day or
      after the accident), 3) the mechanism of the accident, whether there were one or two people
      on the scooter, 4) the use or non-use of the protective helmet, 5) the influence of alcohol ;
      6) the mode of arrival at the emergency room (type of ambulance or by one's own means); 7)
      the injury assessment, paraclinical examinations; 8) treatments; 9) hospitalization or not;
      10) temporary work interruptions .
