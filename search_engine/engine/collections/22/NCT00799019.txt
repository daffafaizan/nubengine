      of anti-Erythropoiesis and anti-EPO antibodies mediated PRCA attributed to a specific product
      presentation divided by the person-year (PY) of s.c. exposure. Incidence rates will be
      adjusted for duration of exposure by stratification. Sensitivity analyses with varying
      assumptions on the latency from exposure with Erythropoiesis product to onset of PRCA will be
      employed in general and will be evaluated specifically if subjects switch therapy, have mixed
      exposure to multiple ESA products by the s.c. route of administration, or discontinue therapy
      and remain under observation. Confidence intervals for rate estimates will be calculated
      using the Poisson distribution for rare events.
