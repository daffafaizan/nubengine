      can stimulate the immune system (the cells and substances that protect the body from
      infection and foreign matter) of people with certain kinds of cancer. It is believed that the
      body's immune system can attack tumor cells and kill them. It is thought that immune cells
      recognize special proteins on the surface of tumors as a signal to fight the cancer. One of
      these proteins is called human chorionic gonadotropin-beta (hCG-Î²) and is found on several
      types of cancers including breast, colorectal, pancreatic, bladder and ovarian. The study
      drug, CDX-1307, is given as an intravenous infusion (administered in a vein in the arm or
      through a port-a-catheter). In addition, the study includes combination therapies which are
      thought to stimulate the immune response against tumor cells. In addition, the study includes
      combination therapies which are thought to stimulate the immune response against tumor cells.
