    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded study to assess the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of CNTO 136. In a randomized trial, study medication (CNTO 136 or placebo)
      is assigned by chance. Double-blinded means that neither the investigator nor the volunteer
      know which of the study medication they have been assigned to receive. Pharmacokinetics is
      the study of levels of CNTO 136 circulating in your blood over time. The study population
      will all be male and consist of 30 Japanese and 30 Caucasian volunteers. Three dose levels of
      study agent will be assessed. Participants will be required to stay at the research center
      after study agent administration for the inpatient portion of the study and then required to
      return for out-patient visits. One of 3 dose levels of CNTO 136 will be given just under the
      skin (subcutaneous (SC)). The length of this study will be about 20 weeks.
