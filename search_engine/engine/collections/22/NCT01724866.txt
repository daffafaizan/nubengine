    
      This is an open label, multicenter, dose ranging study, sequentially enrolled by study dose,
      with a non-inferiority design to compare the effectiveness of HM10460A relative to a fixed
      dose of pegfilgrastim as a concurrent active control to each dose of HM10460A in patients
      with breast cancer. The study will include 4 arms: 3 dose levels of HM10460A versus
      pegfilgrastim. The start of study treatment is defined as the initiation of HM10460A or
      pegfilgrastim. The duration of treatment consists of a maximum of 4 cycles, which begin on
      Day 1 with chemotherapy administration and continue through Day 21.

      The planned number of patients is a total of 144 based on 36 enrolled into each of 4
      treatment arms. The target population are patients with breast cancer who are candidates for
      neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with TC chemotherapy. All patients who receive at least 1
      dose of either HM10460A or pegfilgrastim will be followed for safety through 20 (Â± 2) days
      after their last dose of study treatment or until all treatment-related AEs have resolved or
      returned to baseline/Grade 1, whichever is longer, or until it is determined that the outcome
      will not change with further follow-up.
