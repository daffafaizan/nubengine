    
      This study is designed to evaluate genetic mechanisms of lung disease by surveying
      polymorphic genes involved in respiratory function and examining gene expression in the lung
      cells of individuals with pulmonary disease (e.g., alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, asthma,
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, sarcoidosis, history of infection,
      and genetic mutations consistent with lung pathology). Emphasis will be on defining the
      distribution of allelic variants of nitric oxide synthase, alpha 1-antitrypsin, and the
      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator genes in patients and in age- and
      sex-matched healthy individuals in a control population.
