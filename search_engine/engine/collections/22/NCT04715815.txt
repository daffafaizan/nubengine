      What are the effects of the COVID-19 on chronic pain patients in terms of pain and pain
      management?

      Conceptual framework

      The COVID-19 is a novel emerging infectious disease which has unimaginable and unbelievable
      large scale distressing effects worldwide.

      Up to date, there is no study which aims to evaluate the effects of the COVID-19 on chronic
      pain patients in terms of pain and pain management. The previous survey in patients focused
      on the worrisome of them for getting this infection and their confidence in their government
      to control the COVID-19 situation in the US.

      Materials and methods

      This study is an in-depth interview. The in-depth interview is the principal method to
      collect qualitative data by setting up open-ended questions beforehand. Patients who are
      interviewed, can express their attitudes freely. This method is flexible which words,
      sentences and questions can be adjusted to suit each interviewee (participant). The process
      consists of active and intentional listening as well as ask on an in-depth basis. All
      conversations during the in-depth interview are tape-recorded.
