    
      Approximately 40 eligible subjects who have been diagnosed with intermediate Non-Exudative
      AMD, that require treatment will be enrolled and randomized (1.7:1) to one of 2 treatment
      groups:

      Treatment Group 1: 25 Non-Exudative AMD subjects with BCVA of 20/40 - 20/200 will be injected
      intravitreally with 1.0mg of Luminate® Treatment Group 2: 15 Non-Exudative AMD subjects with
      BCVA of 20/40 - 20/200 will be treated with a sham injection

      At the 16-week visit, the study will be unmasked to the sponsor and injecting investigator
      (observing investigators will remain masked). Subjects in the treatment group will receive a
      2nd dose of Luminate®. Subjects in the control group will be offered the opportunity to
      crossover to treatment with a single dose of Luminate®.
