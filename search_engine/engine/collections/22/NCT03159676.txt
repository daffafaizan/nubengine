      evaluated according to standard of care medical practices. The evaluation includes history
      and examination, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood testing, and review of the prior
      prostate biopsy pathology report; radiology scans (for example, computed tomography [CT],
      magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], radionuclide bone scan) may be done also; recently
      completed testing may not need to be repeated. Small markers will be placed in the prostate
      to guide the proton beam stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) treatments, and a
      hydrogel spacer may also be placed between the prostate and the rectum to push the rectum
      away from the prostate; the hydrogel spacer will dissolve a few months later. Participants
      will receive five (5) proton SABR treatments over a two (2) week time period. The study will
      have participants complete a quality-of life questionnaire and be evaluated for side-effects
      before starting SABR, at the end of SABR, at three (3), six (6) and 12 months after SABR, and
      then yearly for five (5) years. Evaluation of the cancer status will follow standard of care
      practices for at least ten (10) years.
