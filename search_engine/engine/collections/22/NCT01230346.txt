      I. To conduct a randomized trial of a culturally-informed pre-genetic cancer risk assessment
      (GCRA) telephone intervention.

      II. To evaluate the effect of the pre-GCRA intervention versus a time and attention control
      versus standard scheduling procedure alone (usual care) on levels of anxiety, perceived
      personal control and cancer genetics knowledge.

      III. To explore patients' experiences with the pre-GCRA intervention through
      post-intervention telephone interviews.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore patients' perceived barriers to GCRA through no-show telephone interviews.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive a culturally-informed adapted motivational interviewing telephone
      call.

      ARM II: Patients participate in a controlled condition comprising a health habits
      intervention group.

      ARM III: Patients receive usual care comprising a standard scheduling phone call and proceed
      with normal GCRA process. All patients are mailed standard new patient packets containing
      questionnaires on demographics and personal health history, and a family history form. All
      patients then undergo genetic cancer risk assessment.
