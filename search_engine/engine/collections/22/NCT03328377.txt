      develop delirium during their course of critical illness. Samples of feces/rectal swaps will
      be taken at admission and again either when the patients become CAM-ICU positive,
      alternatively after 5 days admssion/at discharge in patients that remain CAM-ICU negative.

      Samples are then sent to analyses for purification of bacterial DNA and metagenomic analysis.
