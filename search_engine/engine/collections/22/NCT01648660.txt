      supplementation in randomized, placebo- controlled, double blind study (LUTEGA 1), the
      treatment arms are unblind to cross over the different dosage groups.

      The measurement of optical density of macular pigment (MPOD) uses the 1- wavelength
      reflection method recording reflection images at 480 nm by a fundus camera. The patients are
      followed up over two years in eight more visits (every three months) In addition to the MPOD-
      measurement each examination includes standardized visual acuity test (ETDRS), amsler- grid,
      slit lamp biomicroscopy, fundus photography (color and autofluorescence) and a blood sample
      (every six months).
