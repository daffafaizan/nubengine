      comparing the proportion of ulcers completely healed by use of allogenic dermal graft versus
      the standard protocol of wound care in diabetic patients with a diabetic foot ulcer with
      adequate arterial perfusion, for wound healing to the affected limb. The primary objective of
      this study is to compare the proportion of ulcers completely healed by the allogenic dermal
      graft protocol of care to the standard protocol of care in the management of indolent
      diabetic ulcers at 6 weeks. The secondary objectives of this study are to compare the
      proportion of healing at 4 weeks, 12 weeks and, the mean time to healing. Patient after
      signing IRB approve informed consent, upon meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      randomized into one of two group. One group receiving standard of care protocol, with an
      offloading boot, and one group received human allogenic dermis application, with compressive
      dressing and offloading boot. Patients will be seen weekly or until complete healing occurs.
      Measurements will be taken of the diabetic ulcers using the a centimeter ruler measuring
      length by width.
