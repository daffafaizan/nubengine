      Diaphragm eventration is not an uncommon problem, it may be asymptomatic, but most of the
      patients suffer from dyspnoea and deterioration of their sports activities. General
      practitioners are not aware of the surgical benefit, especially diaphragmatic plication.

      Methods:

      A retrospective analysis of all patients who underwent surgical diaphragmatic plication (SDP)
      at our both centres in the last 5 years (Jan. 2014-Dec. 2018). The data of all patients were
      obtained from hospital patients records, family doctors and personal patients contact. All
      patients underwent routine preoperative workup and besides chest X-ray, chest computed
      tomography, chest sonography, fluoroscopy and spirometry with the assessment of FEV1, FVC
      (forced vital capacity ), FEV1/FVC, as well as a clinical dyspnoea evaluation according to
      MRC (medical research council) score. These investigations were done preoperatively as a
      baseline, one month and 6 months postoperatively. The data were compared and the statistical
      analysis was done using multivariate analysis.
