      absence of a hematological event defined as episodes of febrile neutropenia and treatment
      discontinuation due to neutropenia. A completion rate of 80% is considered of clinical
      relevance as to benefit breast cancer patients who are at a higher risk of having ethnic
      neutropenia where as a completion rate of 60% is considered poor and to justify additional
      safety studies. A two stage design with a total of 35 patients is used to test if the
      completion rate is at least 80% versus if it is below 60% with 80% power at a significance
      level of 5%.

      An exact confidence interval of the completion rate will be calculated. Investigators
      estimate there will be no more than a 10% rate of febrile neutropenia. Due to the small
      sample size, the analysis of secondary endpoints will be descriptive and will not include
      specific hypothesis testing.
