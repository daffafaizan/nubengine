      of neuroleptics. In addition, preliminary evidence suggests that it has additional mood
      stabilizing properties as compared with neuroleptics. We are examining the effect of
      risperidone alone for the treatment of psychotic depression. After providing written informed
      consent, subjects with major depression and psychosis will undergo a routine medical and
      neurological evaluation. If subjects qualify they will undergo a 3 to 7 day washout. Subjects
      will be randomly assigned under double-blind conditions to risperidone plus placebo;
      risperidone plus sertraline; or haloperidol (HPDL) plus sertraline in a prospective parallel
      design for a 6 week trial. Outcome measures include the Hamilton Rating Depression Scale, The
      Positive and Negative Symptom Scale and the Clinician Administered Ratings Scale for Mania
      and Simpson Angus Scale. Rating will be conducted on a weekly basis throughout the study.
