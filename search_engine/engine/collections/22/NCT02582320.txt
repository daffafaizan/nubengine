    
      Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common leukemia in adults. The disease is
      characterized by the progressive accumulation of phenotypically mature malignant B
      lymphocytes, primarily in the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and lymph nodes. Over the last
      10-15 years several biological prognostic markers have been identified, starting from the
      immunoglobulin gene mutational analysis to CD38, ZAP70, CD49d expression, and many others.
      The very recent discovery of several new genes that carry point mutations in CLL, including
      NOTCH1, SF3B1 and BIRC3, has added more markers that seem to correlate with resistance to
      treatment and with transformation into Richter syndrome. A large number of chemoimmunotherapy
      regimens are currently considered for the treatment of CLL patients.

      NPP program The Named Patient Program (NPP) is a program intended to provide early access to
      ibrutinib in Italy. This program is specifically for patients who have relapsed or refractory
      chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL)/small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL), mantle cell lymphoma.

      Rationale In patients with CLL Ibrutinib, given as single agent has shown marked activity and
      a good safety profile. Data from patients treated with ibrutinib outside a controlled
      clinical trial within a National Patient Program (NPP) could give additional information
      about the clinical use, treatment duration, efficacy, and toxicity of ibrutinib given to CLL
      patients in a real life context.
