      control groups was done. Qualitative variables were expressed as percentages, and
      quantitative variables were summarised as the median and interquartile range.

      Shapiro-Wilk tests indicated that the dependent variables were not normally distributed (p <
      .05), so non-parametric statistical analyses were subsequently performed. The difference
      between the medians of the two patient groups was examined with the Mann-Whitney U test.
      Qualitative variables were compared with the chi-squared or Fisher's exact test, as
      appropriate.
