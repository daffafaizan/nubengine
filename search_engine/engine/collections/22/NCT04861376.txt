      of China classifies the Pueraria as Pueraria lobata and Pueraria thomsonii according to the
      different sources of the plant, both of them is sweet, pungent and cool in nature, and has
      the effects of relieving fever, quenching thirst, penetrating rashes, raising the Yang to
      stop diarrhea, activating the meridians and detoxifying alcohol. As early as in the Han
      Dynasty, Zhongjing Zhang's "Treatise on Febrile Diseases" described the famous formula
      "Pueraria Tang", which is still an important formula for relieving exterior syndromes.

      In clinical practice, the preparations of Pueraria lobata and Pueraria thomsonii are widely
      used to treat headache, dizziness, hypertension, coronary heart disease, angina pectoris,
      myocardial infarction and other diseases. For example, the puerarin injection has the effects
      of dilating blood vessels, slowing down heart rate, reducing myocardial oxygen consumption
      and improving blood circulation in the heart and brain.

      Although the puerarin has been shown to be effective in a variety of cardiovascular diseases,
      as of now, it is unclear whether Pueraria lobata and Pueraria thomsonii can be used as part
      of the daily diet to regulate blood lipids and improve dyslipidemia. Therefore, the aim of
      this study is to conduct a randomized, double-blind controlled trial that includes patients
      with mildly elevated lipids to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Pueraria lobata and
      Pueraria thomsonii for dyslipidemia.
