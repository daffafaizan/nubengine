      of this research is to replicate the previous observations and extend research in four ways:
      1) start to determine which substance in cocoa responsible for the effect by including
      several comparison groups, 2) focus on individuals with average or below average symptoms of
      mental energy and who are not high consumers of fruits, vegetables and other products
      containing high amounts of flavonoids in order to learn whether people with low energy accrue
      a greater benefit, and 3) include additional measures of mental energy plausibly influenced
      by cocoa to better understand the health consequences of cocoa.
