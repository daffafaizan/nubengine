      contains clofarabine 40 mg/m2 (1 hr infusion) days 1-5 followed 3 hours after the end of
      infusion by intermediate dose cytarabine 1 g/m2 (2 hrs infusion) days 1-5. Patients with
      moderate early response (reduced marrow blast count but â‰¥10% at day 15) or patients with
      progressive disease during delayed hematologic recovery (beyond day 42) may receive
      re-induction therapy similar to the first cycle induction therapy.

      Study treatment comprises up to two cycles of induction therapy and one to two cycles of
      consolidation chemotherapy for patients without a donor. Consolidation therapy is reduced by
      25% and consists of clofarabine 40 mg/m2 (1 hr infusion) days 1-4 followed 3 hours after the
      end of infusion by intermediate dose cytarabine 1 g/m2 (2 hrs infusion) days 1-4.

      Patients for whom a donor can be identified may proceed to allogeneic HCT after CLARA I
      adopting the concept of allogeneic HCT in aplasia. Patients for whom donor search is more
      time consuming should proceed to allogeneic HCT once a donor has been identified.

      Patients who have achieved a response after the last cycle of CLARA will receive clofarabine
      as part of the conditioning regimen. Clofarabine and melphalan may only be given as
      conditioning therapy to patients with HLA-compatible donors with a maximum of one mismatch
      refering to the HLA-loci A, -B, -C and -DRB1. Conditioning therapy then contains clofarabine
      30 mg/m2 (1 hr IV infusion) days -6 to -3 and melphalan 140 mg/m2 (1 hour IV infusion) on day
      -2.
