      (NGT) matched for maternal and gestational age were enrolled in the study. All the subjects
      underwent antepartum screening in the First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University.
      Blood samples were obtained after overnight fasting at the time of oral glucose tolerance
      test (OGTT). Serum FGF19 and FGF21 levels were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent
      assay (ELISA) and were correlated with anthropometric, metabolic, and endocrine parameters.
      Homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) index was calculated and analysed.

      Second, samples for measurement were obtained from 30 women with GDM and 35 healthy pregnant
      controls undergoing caesarean sections at term. mRNA and protein expression levels of
      FGF19/FGF21 and their co-receptor βKlotho（KLB）in placenta, rectus muscle and subcutaneous fat
      tissues were investigated with real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR),
      western-blot and immunohistochemistry (IHC), respectively. Clinical data were collected and
      analysed.

      Data were analyzed by SPSS 20.0 database. The results were expressed as mean ± standard
      deviations or median with interquartile range. Differences between groups were assessed by
      Student's unpaired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Chi-square test as appropriate.
      Correlation analysis was performed using the Spearman rank correlation method. To identify
      independent relationships and adjust the effects of covariates, multiple linear regression
      analyses were performed. P values of <0.05 were considered significant.
