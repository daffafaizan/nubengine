      HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) are among the highest priorities for
      research and development. Advantage 24 is a contraceptive gel containing nonoxynol-9 (N-9).
      This study provides information on the safety of N-9 in a bioadhesive gel formulated for use
      by MSM during anal intercourse. Safety is assessed for both HIV-positive and HIV-negative men
      because HIV-positive men may be at increased risk for toxicity due to other HIV-related
      conditions.

      Participants are divided into 4 cohorts depending on their serostatus and whether they are
      the insertive or receptive partner. Participants apply Advantage 24 once or twice a day for 5
      weeks and 4 times a day for the sixth week. Check-in visits, which include a genital exam,
      are performed at Weeks 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7. More complete physical evaluations, including
      anoscopy for receptive partners and blood tests, are performed at Weeks 3, 6, and 8.
