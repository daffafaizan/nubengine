      including periods of hospitalisation and the prescription of drugs.

      The mucociliary clearance mechanism is impaired in these patients, and chest physiotherapy
      has been recommended for patients with bronchiectasis and chronic productive cough and/or
      evidence of mucus plugging on HRCT.

      However, to date, there is insufficient evidence of benefits of chest physiotherapy through
      randomised controlled trials. Furthermore it rests unclear the most effective technique, the
      frequency and optimum duration of the RP and the most suitable variables to monitor.

      A multicenter clinical trial into the efficacy of one chest physiotherapy technique in airway
      clearance will fill this important "gap" in the scientific evidence.
