      primary data collection period of the trial. This is a prospective, randomized, open-label
      phase II study comparing cognitive outcomes between men with metastatic or non-metastatic
      CRPC (mCRPC or M0CRPC) treated with darolutamide or enzalutamide. This will be a multicenter
      trial conducted at 12 sites across the US.

      The primary endpoint will be the percent change in the maximally changed cognitive domain by
      24 weeks in each study arm. Patients will be stratified by age (<65, 65-80, > 80). Patients
      will be allowed to cross over from either treatment to the opposite treatment arm at 12 and
      24 weeks if they meet any of the cross-over criteria as described in the protocol.

      Cognitive assessments will be performed using Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated
      Battery (CANTAB), an internationally recognized software for assessing cognitive function and
      impairment. Tests available in the CANTAB battery include tests of learning and executive
      function; working memory; visual, verbal and episodic memory; and attention, information and
      processing time. The maximally changed cognitive domain is defined as the domain most changed
      from baseline in each individual.

      Blood samples will be collected for exploratory genomic analyses (AR CAG repeat length, PHS,
      exosome analysis).

      Patients will have the option to opt into an additional separate MRI sub-study. A subset of
      40 patients (20 per arm) will undergo fMRI to measure percent signal change in the HP PFC
      circuit at baseline, 24 and 52 weeks or/and cross-over/end of treatment visit (if
      applicable).
