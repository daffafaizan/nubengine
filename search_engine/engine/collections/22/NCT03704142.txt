    
      Speech understanding will be measured both unaided and aided with three different models of
      Personal Amplification devices (PSAPs). Sentences will be played to the participant from a
      loudspeaker located in front. Different types of background sounds (noise and other
      sentences) will be played from loudspeakers located to the right and left of the participant.
      Participants will be instructed to repeat back the sentence coming from the front. They also
      will rate subjective effort at the end of each block of trials.
