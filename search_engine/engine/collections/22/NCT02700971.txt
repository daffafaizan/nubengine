      or metastatic cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions. The biopsies will be stabilized on site in
      RNAlater and shipped to ATAGC by courier at ambient temperature. RNA will be extracted using
      Trizol-chloroform method and purified using RNAEasy micro kit (Qiagen). RNA samples passing
      the quality control test (Agilent Bioanalyzer) will be labeled, hybridized to PrimeView
      Affymetrix microarrays and scanned according to the manufacturer's protocol. Resulting ".CEL"
      files will be used for the analysis of the global gene expression.

      Pathogenesis Based Transcript (PBT) sets that represent molecular signatures of inflammation
      will be assessed in core biopsies from melanoma patients. Each PBT set gets a "score" - a
      summarized expression of all members of a set. PBT scores allow an estimate of pre and
      post-treatment immunological activity in each tumor e.g. TCMR activity or macrophage burden.
      PBT scores will be correlated with clinical outcome to determine the utility of this
      technology as a prognostic and predictive biomarker. Finally a molecular classifier
      predicting the response to therapy will be built.
