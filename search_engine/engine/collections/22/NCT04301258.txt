    
      This multi-center, observational registry will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of
      ProChondrix CR in patients who undergo treatment for an articular cartilage defect in the
      knee, ankle, foot or hip.

      This registry will be performed at up to 30 clinical sites across the United States.

      Patient follow-up will occur following an articular cartilage repair procedure in which the
      patient receives ProChondrix CR. During this follow-up period, each patient will be evaluated
      at least four (4) times at: 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgical intervention and will
      continue annually for as long as patients are willing to fill out questionnaires and outcomes
      assessments up to 10 years post operatively.
