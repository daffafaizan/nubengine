      (CHRMT) between 2007 and 2014. CHRMT is a 2000-bed hospital in which 160 000 short
      hospitalizations are performed. To analyze the strategies and decisions related to the
      appropriate use of antibiotics for this center, some Semi-Directive Interviews (SDI) are
      realized on the study period with all concerned actors of the Good Use of antibiotics. An
      interviewing plan and tree interview guidelines were created. All SDI are processed by the
      same person.
