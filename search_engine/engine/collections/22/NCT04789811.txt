      the nighttime, most often in the calf muscles, that gradually lessens. Its etiology is not
      clear. It can be seen in electrolyte disturbances, drug side effects, neuromuscular diseases,
      diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular pathologies. It has been mentioned in the literature
      that myofascial trigger points in the gastrocnemius muscle may be associated with nocturnal
      calf cramps. Our aim in this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the combination of
      stretching exercises and dry needling therapy on cramp duration, cramp intensity, cramp
      frequency, sleep quality, and algometer measurement in patients with nocturnal calf cramps
      and whose had myofascial trigger point in the gastrocnemius muscle.
