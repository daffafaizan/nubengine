    
      Transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is a promising effective method for postoperative
      pain control after major abdominal surgery. TAP block provides analgesia by inhibiting nerve
      conduction from the anterior abdominal wall arising from the intercostal nerves, subcostal
      nerves, and first lumbar nerve (T6-L1). Using a landmark technique, it is easily performed,
      but its popularity has decreased because of reduced efficacy due to inaccurate injection and
      the potential for intra-peritoneal organ damage. Ultrasound-guided TAP block provides better
      results and fewer complications, but it requires experienced operators. Surgically
      administered TAP (sTAP) block guided by the video camera of the laparoscope is a simple
      technique and may cause no complications. Also, under laparoscopic guidance, block of
      ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genitofemoral nerves can be possible with anesthetic
      injection in the plane between psoas major and the fasciae covering its anterior aspects
      [laparoscopic-assisted psoas (LAP) blockade].
