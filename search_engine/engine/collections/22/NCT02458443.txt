      participants aged 40-70 years who are either pre- or mild hypertensive; either un-medicated
      or taking medication to control their blood pressure. Our secondary aims are to examine
      whether the size of blood pressure change is different in those people taking or not taking
      anti-hypertensive medication, to determine the anti-hypertensive mechanism to IRT, and to
      establish rate of de-training effects after participants have ceased IRT.
