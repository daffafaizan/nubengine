    
      This is a multi-center (conducted in more than one center) study, consisting of two periods:
      Period 1 is open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), non-comparative
      dose titration phase and Period 2 is double blind (neither physician nor participant knows
      the treatment that the participant receives), positive control (fentanyl 3-day application
      transdermal patch is used as control drug) phase. In Period 1, fentanyl 1-day application
      transdermal patch 12.5 microgram per hour (mcg/hr) will be applied to chest, abdomen, upper
      arm or thigh and will be maintained for 2 days to ensure the safety of participants. Dose
      escalation or reduction will be allowed based on participant's condition from Day 3 to Day 11
      and thereafter dose will be maintained from Day 11 to Day 13 with a maximum application dose
      of 100 mcg/hr. The total duration of Period 1 is 14 days (a total of 13 applications;
      including the day of final patch removal). Participants who met the predefined criteria at
      the end of dose titration phase will enter the double blind phase. In double blind phase,
      participants will receive either fentanyl 1-day application transdermal patch and placebo
      matched to fentanyl 3-day application transdermal patch or fentanyl 3-day application
      transdermal patch and placebo matched to fentanyl 1-day application transdermal patch at the
      same dose as used at the completion of Period 1. The duration of Period 2 is 10 days.
      Efficacy will primarily be evaluated by percentage of participants achieving dose titration
      success and change in mean visual analog scale (VAS) score. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
