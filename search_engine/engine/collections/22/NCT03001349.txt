    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To substitute 68Ga-DOTATOC for 111In-pentetreotide on an expanded access basis, in tumor
      imaging for study subjects, where the care provider believes that somatostatin imaging is
      clinically indicated, until such time as 68Ga-DOTATOC becomes commercially available.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To gain experience in the utility of 68Ga-DOTATOC in the management of neuroendocrine
      tumors at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC).

      II. To acquire proficiency in generating 68Ga-DOTATOC for human use at MDACC.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive gallium Ga 68-edotreotide intravenously. After 1 hour, participants
      undergo PET/CT scan over 60 minutes.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 24 hours or within 72 hours, and
      at 30 days.
