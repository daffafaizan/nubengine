      stimulation spinal sites and oral Buspirone in facilitating nonweight-bearing (gravity
      neutral device, GND) and weight-bearing (treadmill) stepping in individuals with chronic
      motor complete paralysis.

      Aim 1.1: Define the relative effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical stimulation at
      multiple spinal sites to facilitate non-weight-bearing (GND) and weight-bearing (treadmill)
      stepping in spinal cord injury subjects.

      Aim 1.2: Define the relative effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical stimulation at
      multiple spinal sites plus oral Buspirone to facilitate nonweight-bearing (gravity neutral
      device, GND) and weight-bearing (treadmill) stepping in spinal cord injury subjects.

      Aim 2: Determine the relative effectiveness of Ekso-technology combined with transcutaneous
      electrical stimulation and/or oral Buspirone in lowering the robotic assistance and enhancing
      the ability to step self-assisted in a rolling walker during over-ground stepping in
      individuals with a chronic, severe (AIS A/B) spinal injury.

      Aim 3: Determine the relative effectiveness of Ekso-technology combined with transcutaneous
      electrical stimulation and/or oral Buspirone in lowering the robotic assistance and enhancing
      the ability to step self-assisted in a rolling walker during over-ground stepping in
      individuals with motor incomplete (AIS C) paralysis.
