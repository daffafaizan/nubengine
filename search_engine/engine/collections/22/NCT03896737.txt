    
      INDUCTION AND CONSOLIDATION REGIMEN:

      Arm Dara-VCd:

      Daratumumab: 16 mg/Kg given by IV infusion on days 1, 8, 15, 22, on cycles 1-2 and on days 1,
      15 on cycles 3-4.

      Bortezomib: 1.3 mg/m2 given subcutaneous (SC) injection on days 1, 8,15, 22;
      Cyclophosphamide: 300 mg/ m2 given orally or by IV infusion on days 1, 8, 15, 22;
      Dexamethasone: 40 mg given orally or by IV infusion on days 1, 8, 15, 22 Repeat for four
      4-week induction cycles. After induction all patients will be given Cyclophosphamide at the
      dose of 3 g/m2, followed by Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) for stem cell
      collection. Cyclophosphamide will start 4-6 weeks after start of the fourth cycle of therapy.

      Stem cell collection will be performed as soon as CD34+ cells are present in peripheral
      blood, which is usually between 9-14 days after first day of Cyclophosphamide. Stem cells
      will be harvested at a minimum of 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg and cryopreserved. In case
      insufficient stem cells are collected the procedure may be repeated or alternatively bone
      marrow stem cell collection may be performed or Plerixafor may be used.

      4-6 weeks after cyclophosphamide patients will be treated with High Dose Melphalan followed
      by autologous stem cell reinfusion according to the schedule below:

        -  Melphalan 200 mg/ m² day - 2 i.v. rapid infusion

        -  Stem cell infusion Minimum of 2 x 10^6CD34+cells/kg day 0 90-120 days after Melphalan
           administration consolidation treatment will be administered: Daratumumab: 16 mg/Kg given
           by IV infusion on days 1, 15; Bortezomib: 1.3 mg/m2 given by SC injection on days 1, 8,
           15, 22; Cyclophosphamide: 300 mg/ m2 given orally or by IV infusion on days 1, 8, 15,
           22; Dexamethasone: 40 mg given orally or by IV infusion on days 1, 8, 15, 22. Repeat for
           2 4-week consolidation cycles.

      Arm VTd:

      Bortezomib: 1.3 mg/m2 given by SC injection on days 1, 4, 8, 11 of 28-day cycle; Thalidomide:
      100 mg given orally on days 1-28. Dexamethasone: 20 mg given orally or by IV injection on
      days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 of every 28-day cycle.

      Repeat for 4 4-week induction cycles. After induction all patients will be given
      Cyclophosphamide at the dose of 3 g/m2, followed by G-CSF for stem cell collection.
      Cyclophosphamide will start 4-6 weeks after start of the fourth cycle of therapy.

      Stem cell collection will be performed as soon as cluster of differentiation 34 (CD34)+ cells
      are present in peripheral blood, which is usually between 9-14 days after first day of
      Cyclophosphamide. Stem cells will be harvested at a minimum of 4 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg and
      cryopreserved. In case insufficient stem cells are collected the procedure may be repeated by
      using also Plerixafor or alternatively bone marrow stem cell collection may be performed.

      4-6 weeks after cyclophosphamide patients will be treated with High Dose Melphalan followed
      by autologous stem cell reinfusion according to the schedule below:

        -  Melphalan 200 mg/ m² day -2 i.v. rapid infusion

        -  Stem cell infusion Minimum of 2 x 10^6CD34+cells/kg day 0 90-120 days after Melphalan
           administration consolidation treatment will be administered: Bortezomib: 1.3 mg/m2 given
           by SC injection on days 1, 4, 8, 11 of 28-day cycle; Thalidomide: 100 mg given orally on
           days 1-28; Dexamethasone: 20 mg given orally or by IV injection on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 8,
           9, 10 and 11 of every 28-day cycle.

      Repeat for 2 4-week consolidation cycles.

      MAINTENANCE TREATMENT:

      All patients in ≥ PR after consolidation will be randomized to receive:

      Arm I Ixazomib 3 mg on days 1, 8, 15 of cycle 1-4, followed by ixazomib 4 mg on days 1, 8, 15
      cycles from cycle 5*.

      Repeat each cycle every 28 days. Patients will receive treatment until any sign of
      progression or intolerance, up to 24 months.

      Arm II Ixazomib 3 mg on days 1, 8, 15 of cycle 1-4, followed by ixazomib 4 mg on days 1, 8,
      15 cycles from cycle 5*.

      Daratumumab 16 mg/kg on day 1. Repeat each cycle every 28 days. Patients will receive
      treatment until any sign of progression or intolerance, up to 24 months.

      *The dose escalation is admitted only in case there have been no non-hematologic Adverse
      Events (AEs) ≥ Grade 2 related to study drug and no dose interruptions related to study drug
      toxicities.

      Patients in the first randomization will be stratified according to fluorescent in situ
      hybridization (FISH) (standard/missing vs high risk, defined as del17, t 4;14, t 14;16) and
      International Staging System (ISS) (I vs II and III) Patients randomized to maintenance
      treatment will be stratified according to induction treatment and Minimal Residual Disease
      (MRD) status by nerve growth factor (NGF) (positive and not evaluable vs negative).

      STATISTICAL DESIGN A total of 400 patients will be needed, in according to the study design,
      to provide a power of at least 85% to the statistical analysis with a two sided alpha error
      of 0.05 (see study protocol for details).

      The statistical analysis will be performed in according to the intention to treat principle
      and will include summary of descriptive statistics (arithmetic mean and standard deviation,
      minimum and maximum, median with the interquartile range as appropriate) for continuous
      variables, absolute frequencies and percentages will be reported for qualitative variables.
      95% Confidence intervals will be provided for variables subjected to statistical inference.

      Proportions will be compared between treatment groups by use of the chi-square test or
      Fisher's exact test.

      Kaplan-Meier method will be used for survival analyses to estimate and compare survival
      outcomes.

      The log-rank test will be adopted to compare survival curves. Multivariable analysis, using
      semi parametric Cox proportional hazard regression model, will be performed to assess factors
      significantly affecting the progression free survival.

      The safety analysis will include all patients randomized who will receive at least one dose
      of study treatment and the toxicity will be compared between treatment groups with
      chi-squared test.

      All tests will be considered significant with p values less than 0.05.
