      RH-PAT was measured in women with chest pain prior to CAG. Coronary spasm was diagnosed by
      intra-coronary acetylcholine (ACh) provocation test. Using Flow-Wire, we assessed coronary
      endothelial function by coronary blood flow increase in response to ACh (ACh-CBF) and
      coronary flow reserve was assessed by adenosine (Ad-CFR).
