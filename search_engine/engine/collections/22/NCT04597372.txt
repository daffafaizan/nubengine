      retention following pelvic reconstructive surgery in women. Duration of catheterization via
      indwelling foley or clean intermittent self-catheterization (CISC), measured in days, will be
      compared between women receiving Tamsulosin versus placebo after diagnosis of postoperative
      urinary retention via standardized voiding trial. It is hypothesized that women receiving
      Tamsulosin will have a shorter duration of urinary retention, fewer urinary tract infections,
      and improved quality of life as compared with placebo. The Euroqol-5D (EQ-5D) will be used to
      compare physical, emotional, functional, and social/family well-being between women receiving
      Tamsulosin and placebo.

      Upon diagnosis of POUR, women will be offered participation in the study. Once consent is
      obtained, women will be randomized to tamsulosin 0.4 mg or matching placebo capsules to be
      used daily until resolution of POUR or a 10 day course, whichever occurs first.
