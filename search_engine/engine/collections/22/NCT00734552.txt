      status, incidence of peritonitis, and quality of life in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients.
      Therefore, RRF is an important determinant of mortality and morbidity in PD patients.

      Previous studies have suggested that dietary protein restriction supplemented with compound
      keto/amino acids may slow the loss of RRF in chronic kidney disease patients. However, there
      is very few reports to address the effect of compound keto/amino acid supplementation in RRF
      in PD patients.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the protective effect of compound α-Keto Acid plus low
      protein diet in RRF in PD Patients.This is a randomized, open-label, prospective study. 100
      patients who meet Inclusion/Exclusion criteria will be randomized into α-Keto Acid group or
      control group at the ratio of 1:1. α-Keto Acid group will use compound α-Keto Acid plus low
      protein diet, while control group will use normal protein diet.Compound α-Keto Acid dosage is
      0.1/kg/d daily. The effect of compound α-Keto Acid plus low protein diet in RRF will be
      evaluated after 1 year treatment.
