        -  Shortly after the introduction of allogeneic HSCT in clinical practice, it was
           recognized that standard pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are sensitive enough to detect
           HSCT-related respiratory complications [PMID: 2661259; PIMD: 8823260]. Accordingly, the
           finding of a progressive obstructive abnormality of new onset was considered as the
           functional hallmark of obliterative bronchiolitis (OB) [PMID: 16338616; PMID: 19896545].
           As a result, routinely performed spirometry has been proposed as a non-invasive tool to
           monitor the risk of OB in HSCT population [PMID: 17470622]. Yet, due to a peripheral
           airway involvement in OB, the sensitivity of conventional PFTs for early detection of OB
           is low [PMID: 2298060]. For instance, it does not exceed 75% in lung-transplanted
           population as the decrease of forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) may occur at a
           stage when the process is already irreversible and potentially life-threatening [PMID:
           9246138].

      2.0 EXPERIMENTAL HYPOTHESIS

        -  Because the branching pattern of the bronchial tree results in an increasingly large
           number of small airways with a luminal diameter of less than 2 mm in peripheral
           generations, these airways contribute little to total pulmonary resistance [PMID:
           5442364; PMID: 651978]. Intuitively, a large proportion of small airways may be damaged
           or obliterated without impairing any of the conventional PFTs. In this regard, a
           previous study [PMID: 12186817] pointed out that indexes of ventilation distribution may
           provide an early evidence of OB after lung transplantation. In particular, some authors
           [PMID: 12186817] have found that tests of ventilation distribution invariably
           deteriorated about 1 yr before a 20% decrease in FEV1 was apparent. Previous studies
           [PMID: 970731; PMID: 507525] showed that total respiratory input impedance (Zrs),
           measured by a forced oscillation technique (FOT) during spontaneous breathing, may be
           particularly sensitive to small changes in lung mechanics observed in the early stages
           of smoking-related airflow obstruction. Subsequently, it was developed a modified FOT to
           identify within-breath differences in Zrs, with values of Zrs representing the sum of
           respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs), the latter being the imaginary
           part of the former [PMID: 14979497; PMID: 19164347]. This method allows the assessment
           of more breaths and adds a potential quantitative evaluation of instantaneous
           inspiratory and expiratory Rrs and Xrs before and after external interventions such as a
           deep inspiration, bronchodilator drugs, etc. Although these effects can be identified
           when within-breath analysis is performed [PMID: 14979497], most published reports of
           oscillatory mechanics on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) only report total
           respiratory cycle data [PMID: 1519830; PMID: 10489847].

      3.0 STUDY RATIONALE

        -  The aim of the present study will be to test the hypotheses that:

             1. post-HSCT changes in within-breath Rrs and Xrs may provide an earlier evidence of
                OB than standard PFTs. Indeed, the obliteration of terminal bronchioles, observed
                in up to 48% of OB patients following HSCT [PMID: 17470622], could make the real
                part of Zrs abnormally high [PMID: 5653219] and ventilation more heterogeneous;

             2. post-HSCT changes of airway responsiveness to acute bronchoactive interventions
                such as a deep inspiration to total lung capacity and/or a bronchodilator drug
                (i.e., albuterol) may be detected by our modified FOT. We speculate that these
                changes may represent an early sign of OB. Although a previous study from our group
                failed to find an increase in airway responsiveness after HSCT without pulmonary
                complications [PMID: 18684842], we have recently shown that airway smooth muscle
                tone may play an active role in the airflow obstruction of OB [PMID: 20724742].

      4.0 STUDY DESIGN

        -  Before and at regular intervals (2-4 wk onward) after HSCT, patients will attend our
           laboratory and perform all PFTs measurements in the same order. Firstly, the patient
           will breathe spontaneously through the modified FOT system for 5 min and then, without
           disconnecting from the apparatus, perform an inspiratory capacity maneuver and soon
           after resume spontaneous breathing for the next 2 min. Subsequently, spirometry,
           transmural total body plethysmography and CO diffusing capacity of the lung (standard
           PFTs) will be taken in triplicate. Thirty minutes after inhaling four separate doses of
           100 Î¼g of albuterol, the modified FOT measurements and standard PFTs will be repeated
           anew.
