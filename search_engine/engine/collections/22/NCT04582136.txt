      clinical trial to assess the safety and efficacy of sirolimus in patients with active
      systemic lupus erythematosus despite receiving standard background therapy.

      Six large rheumatological referring centers across from China will participate in the study.

      The study is divided into two phases. The first phase is a 24-week randomized,
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, from which the primary end point will be generated,
      and the second phase is a 24-week open-labeled extension trial.

      The study enrolls SLE patients between 18~65 years old who have SLEDAI-2K score â‰¥4 (not
      including scores for anti-dsDNA antibody and hypocomplementemia), despite conventional
      treatment (e.g., immunosuppressants, antimalarial drugs, glucocorticoids, NSAIDs,
      anti-hypertensive drugs, and/or topical medications). In addition, subjects must be
      serologically active (positive anti-dsDNA antibody and/or hypocomplementemia.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned by 1:1 ratio to receive sirolimus (1.5mg/day) or placebo
      for the first 24-week phase. In the second 24-week open-labeled phase, sirolimus patients
      receive the same dose of sirolimus, and placebo group are switched to receive sirolimus at
      1.5mg/day
