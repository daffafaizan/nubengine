      and this will, in turn, allow for the accurate design and planning of a definitive randomized
      controlled trial. The following outcomes will be evaluated:

        1. Important Clinical Outcomes:

             -  Successful conversion,

             -  Resuscitation to one hour,

             -  Survival to hospital discharge,

             -  Neurological function, and

             -  Quality of life.

        2. Process Outcomes:

             -  Number of shocks required,

             -  Recurrences of VF, and

             -  Responsiveness to varying periods of pulselessness.

        3. Adverse Outcomes:

             -  Myocardial damage.
