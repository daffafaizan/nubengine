      improving glycemic control in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. However, it is unknown,
      whether different training strategies have different effects on the preferential visceral
      adipose tissue reduction and changes in resting energy expenditure in a population with
      abdominal obesity. We will therefore compare ST and ET (two to three times a week, 60 minutes
      per training session) in addition to a restricted energy intake of 1500kcal per day for women
      and 1800kcal per day for men in a prospective study of 200 individuals with abdominal obesity
      defined by a waist circumference > 102 cm for males and > 88 cm for females and a BMI > 35
      kg/mÂ² with regard to:

        1. Abdominal visceral adipose tissue area dynamic (MRI studies)

        2. Abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue area dynamic (MRI studies)

        3. Total body fat mass changes (bioelectrical impedance analysis)

        4. Changes in resting energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry)

        5. Changes in parameters of glucose metabolism, insulin sensitivity and lipid profile

        6. Changes in circulating adipokines and markers of inflammation In addition, we will
           search for novel serum parameters, which predict the individual training response by a
           serum metabolomics/ proteomics approach.
