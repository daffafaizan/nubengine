      shifts student travel behavior to campus over one year, and in turn if these shifts in travel
      behavior result in improved academic performance.

      Specific objectives of the cRCT include evaluating whether the intervention results in
      relatively:

        1. Greater utilization of travel modes alternative to single-occupant vehicle travel
           (transit, biking, walking, bike-sharing, electric scooters, and carpooling)

        2. Lower rates of car ownership

        3. Superior college performance--higher grade point averages (GPAs)

        4. More credit hours completed

        5. Higher retention rates
