      rapidly increased as a result of industrialization. Thus, a new wave of quests for the
      treatment and prevention of AD has pushed forward. For the randomized, double-blinded, and
      placebo-controlled study this study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics in
      the treatment of AD. SCORAD positivity index of decline rates decline rates of the probiotic
      group of patients after treatment and skin prick tests were higher than that of the control
      group. While serum levels of IL-2-4-5-6-10, TNF-α, IFN-γ, ECP decreased in the probiotic
      group, only levels of IL-2-4-5, TNF-α decreased in the control group. The IgE decrease rate,
      the skin prick test, the serum total and specific of the probiotic group showed no difference
      from those of the control group. Probiotics in AD patients were effective in reducing SCORAD
      index levels, but not effective in skin prick test positivity, serum IL-2-4-5-6-10, TNF-α,
      IFN-γ, ECP, and serum total and specific IgE levels.
