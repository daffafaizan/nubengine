      (HC-BPPV) is likely due to otolithic debris in the anterior arm of the canal (canalithiasis)
      or the debris attached to the cupula (cupulolithiasis). It is important to seek the method to
      convert treatment-resistant apogeotropic form to the more treatment-responsive geotropic form
      in HC-BPPV. Recent randomized trials demonstrated that head shaking maneuver was more
      effective than the modified Semont maneuver and the Gufoni and head shaking maneuvers showed
      similar efficacy in treating apogeotropic HC-BPPV. Moreover, new repositioning maneuver using
      mastoid vibration showed good efficacies in patients with apogeotropic HC-BPPV in recent
      study. So we tried to compare the short term therapeutic efficacies of Gufoni maneuver and
      mastoid oscillation in apogeotropic HC-BPPV with a randomized, prospective, sham-controlled
      study.
