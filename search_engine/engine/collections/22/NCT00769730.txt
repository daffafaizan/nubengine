      hepatitis B infection is the common etiology for the development of HCC. Transcatheter
      arterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the traditional method for the palliative management of
      patients with HCC. Few previous studies had demonstrated that the serum level of anticancer
      drug from patients treated by TACE was similar to those treated by systemic chemotherapy.
      Since systemic chemotherapy may have the possibility to influence patient's general defense
      ability, hepatitis B virus may reactivate after chemotherapy. There is no study to
      investigate the possibility of TACE in the reactivation of hepatitis B virus. This project
      will collect 20 patients with HCC caused by hepatitis B who are planned to be treated by
      TACE. Quantitative determination of viral load in blood will be performed before TACE, the
      first and the third month after TACE to investigate the influence of TACE on hepatitis B
      virus replication. This study will not influence the doctor's decision in the management of
      HCC and the procedure of TACE. The serum used for HBV DNA examination is concomitantly
      obtained during regular blood sampling for TACE preparation and follow-up of patient. The
      amount of blood needed for each time HBV DNA examination is less than 10 ml.
