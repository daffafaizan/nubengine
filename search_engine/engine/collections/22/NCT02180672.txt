      treatment of childhood OSAS. However, these studies have been limited by factors such as
      small size, lack of randomization and blinding, short-term follow-up, involvement of children
      with only very mild OSAS, and/or lack of stratifying for the presence of atopy. Therefore,
      investigators will plan a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of
      NCS vs placebo in children with mild to moderate OSAS. The overall hypothesis is that NCS
      will be safe and efficacious in the treatment of mild to moderate childhood OSAS,
      particularly in children with asthma/atopy, but will require ongoing maintenance therapy.
