      Cochrane meta-analysis. None have shown efficacy on asthma control and there are not
      recommended. The purpose is to evaluate the efficacy of a new commercialized system, Acar'Up
      (a spray pulverized on a technical textile that traps the dust mite) to decrease dust mite
      load and to assess its impact on the possibility to perform inhaled corticosteroids step down
      in stable asthmatics.
