      stroke prevention trial in China to determine whether the addition of folic acid and vitamin
      supplements will reduce recurrent stroke events and other combined incidence of recurrent
      vascular events and vascular death in patients with recent stroke or transient ischemic
      attack (TIA). All patients presenting to one of the participating neurologists or general
      physicians within one months of stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or TIA (eye or brain) are
      eligible for this trial. Eligible patients will be randomized in a double-blinded fashion to
      receive multi-vitamins or placebo. The primary outcome event is the composite event "stroke,
      myocardial infarction, or death from any vascular cause", whichever occurs first. Our target
      is to recruit a total of 8,000 patients over the two years with a median follow-up of 3
      years. Recruitment to the trial began in July 2011 and is planned to continue until December
      2013. The investigators aim to complete final follow-up by the end of 2016.
