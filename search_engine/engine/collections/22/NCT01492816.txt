      community mobilization model entails: determining a geographic area and population of focus
      for the coalitions to prioritize their planning and action (accomplished in an earlier phase
      of C2P); coalitions establishing a shared vision and mission; development of a strategic plan
      focused on structural changes to reduce risks associated with HIV; process documentation; and
      feedback as technical assistance to the coalitions. The National Coordinating Center (NCC),
      operating under the direction of the Protocol Chair, provides guidance, training, technical
      assistance and feedback to coalitions.

      This protocol continues the C2P mobilization effort and includes enhanced strategic planning
      activities to assist the coalitions in identifying necessary and relevant structural changes.
      The evaluation of C2P includes both process evaluation (i.e., documentation of coalition
      actions and achievements of structural changes; and outcome evaluation to qualitatively
      assess (via Key Informant (KI) interviews) if and how C2P efforts, including completed
      structural changes, have influenced the risk environment within each community. In addition,
      local health surveillance data and HIV testing data will be used to evaluate changes in HIV
      testing patterns and HIV/Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) morbidity among youth.
