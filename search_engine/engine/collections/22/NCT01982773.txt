      (VHB) smartphone app on suicidal ideation in veterans undergoing clinical therapy who have
      recently had suicidal ideation or behavior. We propose to conduct this study in two phases:

      Phase 1: Modifying the current VHB-Î² version of the app to accommodate feedback from pilot
      study participants. The result will be the VHB V1.0 to be tested in phase 2. This component
      of the study will be conducted by the T2 group located at Joint Base Lewis-McChord.

      Phase 2: Implementing a randomized controlled trial comparing the VHB intervention with
      enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) in clinical practice. This component of the study will be
      conducted at the Portland VA Medical Center.

      This research project seeks to answer several essential questions:

        1. Can a smartphone app containing the essential components of a hope box and associated
           elements of CT/DBT (Dialectical Behavioral Therapy) reduce severity of suicidal
           ideation, and increase perceptions of reasons for living and ability to cope, in a
           clinical sample of veterans?

        2. Is a smartphone VHB app more effective in reducing severity of suicidal ideation, and
           increasing perceptions of reasons for living and ability to cope, compared to enhanced
           treatment as usual (ETAU)? In addition, we will gather important information about
           implementing and integrating VHB as a treatment component in mental health treatment
