      The telemonitoring system will involve respiratory physicians, home care providers and
      include regular assessments of oximetry, CPAP compliance, side effects and residual events.

      Secured data transmission to medical staff computers and secured websites will allow easy
      telemonitoring. Automatic algorithms have been built-up for early adjustment of CPAP
      treatment in case of side effects, leaks and persistent residual events.

      An interim analysis will be performed when 200 patients will be included.
