      changing the knowledge-attitudes previously found to be associated with poor prescribing of
      antibiotics in the case of physicians and propensity to dispense antibiotics without medical
      prescription in the case of pharmacists.. An observational cohort study of a sample of 1100
      primary care physicians and 1200 community pharmacists will be carried out to identify
      knowledge-attitudes associated with inappropriate prescribing of antibiotics. The independent
      variables (knowledge-attitudes) will be assessed by a self-administered postal questionnaire
      and dependent variables are some quantity and quality indicators of the prescribing
      antibiotics, and consumption data.
