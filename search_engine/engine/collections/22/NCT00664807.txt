      leading to sudden cardiac death (SCD) and the potential utility of genetic markers in risk
      stratification of patients to receive an implantable cardiac defibrillator (ICD). The
      successful accomplishment of this goal would serve as the basis for future work on a specific
      diagnostic test that can be used to assess risks of threatening arrhythmias in order to
      quality patients for implantation of an ICD.

        -  to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can be used to identify
           individuals in need of an ICD.

      The secondary objectives involve more detailed analysis to search for potentially
      unidentified genetic markers of risk for SCD.

        1. to identify genes associated with SCD susceptibility.

        2. to identify risk factors associated with SCD as found in the case report form (CRF).

        3. to correlate SNPs with co-morbidities in the subjects as found in the CRF information.

        4. to study the association between parameters derived from Holter recordings and
           predictors of life-threatening arrhythmias.
