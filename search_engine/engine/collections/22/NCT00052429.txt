      toxicity.

      Phase I

        -  Radiotherapy: Patients receive radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 6 weeks
           beginning on day 1.

        -  Concurrent chemotherapy: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 20-30 minutes on days 1-5
           and 22-26.

        -  Adjuvant chemotherapy: Approximately 2-5 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy,
           patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-4 and cisplatin IV over 20-30
           minutes on days 1-5 and 22-26. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In the absence of dose-limiting toxicity in 1 whole cohort of patients, study proceeds to
      phase II.

      Phase II

        -  Patients are treated as in phase I. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year,
           every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
