    
      To assess the diagnostic validity and cost-effectiveness of a APNiA device, a home
      respiratory polygraphy (HRP), performed at home compared with the standard polysomnography
      (PSG) in adults with clinically suspected Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

      METHODOLOGY: DESIGN: Randomized, prospective, multicenter, and crossover trial. The study
      will include 240 adults, both sexes, with clinical suspicion of obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA). MEASUREMENTS: To all patients with clinical suspected OSA and referred to the sleep
      units, the following questionnaires and measurements will be performed: a) clinical history;
      b) Anthropometric variables: weight, height, body mass index, neck circumference and
      percentile; c)Epworth sleepiness scale; OSA questionnaire, quality of life and clinical
      questionnaires and comorbidity; d) PSG in the sleep laboratory; e) HRP at home; f)
      Cost-effectiveness variables.

      ANALYSIS: Data from HRP and from full PSG will be compared as follows: 1) Agreement of
      results according to the different apnea-hypopnea index by using the Receiver Operating
      Characteristic (ROC) curve; 2) The concordance of the diagnosis and treatment decisions when
      using clinical findings and data from PSG or HRP at home; 3) All data will be analyzed
      independently; 4) A cost-effectiveness analysis of the different diagnostic and therapeutic
      procedures will be performed.
