      more reliably and comprehensively with a longer test duration and to reveal the relationship
      between balance parameters and joint health score in children with hemophilia. The
      investigator's hypothesis was that in children with hemophilia (CwH), postural balance was
      correlated with joint health status and had poor static postural balance compared to healthy
      peers.

      Twenty-one CwH aged 6 to 18 years who developed hemophilic arthropathy in at least one of the
      lower limb joints due to severe hemophilia and twenty-one healthy peers were included in the
      study.

      The Hemophilia Joint Health Score (HJHS), a valid and reliable test, was used to measure the
      joint health in CwH. Muscle strengths were measured with digital dynamometer. The kinetic
      devices most commonly used to evaluate in the laboratory evaluation of postural balance are
      the force platform and are considered the gold standard method. In the postural balance
      evaluation, changes in the X and Y axis were used. The amplitude of these changes, the
      standard deviation of the displacement, and the velocity were evaluated. In addition, the
      ellipse area and perimeter were measured.
