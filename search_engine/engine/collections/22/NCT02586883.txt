      respiratory failure. More than one case over two remains of undetermined cause. If the
      prototype is the cystic fibrosis, other abnormalities of ionic transport may be the cause of
      a failure of mucociliary clearance and enhance the idiopathic dilations of the bronchi.

      The purpose of this study is to identify the abnormalities of bronchial trans-epithelial
      transport of chloride, sodium and bicarbonate in patients with idiopathic dilations of the
      bronchi, in comparison to two others groups of patients (without abnormality of ionic
      transport/with typical cystic fibrosis).
