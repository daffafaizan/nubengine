      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention or CABG Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting) will be collected
      in this prospective study. Information regarding revascularization strategy will be collected
      as detailed information concerning PCI procedure. In case of PCI with other than BVS stent
      implantation (BMS or/and metallic DES) information collected in the study will contain at
      least:

        -  Reason why BVS was not implanted

        -  Final result of baseline treatment

        -  Acute and long-term outcome of treatment (12 month clinical observation); NB. 5-year
           clinical follow-up is also expected.

      The enrollment phase of the registry is not expected to last longer than 12 months.
