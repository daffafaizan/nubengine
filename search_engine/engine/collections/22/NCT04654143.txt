      placebo-controlled, single and multiple ascending oral dose study in healthy volunteers.The
      study will be divided into two parts that will be conducted sequentially. Part A is a SAD
      study to determine the safety, tolerability and PK of single oral doses of BVL-GSK098 in
      healthy volunteers. In addition, the last cohort of Part A will investigate the effect of
      food on the PK of BVL-GSK098. Part B is a MAD study to determine the safety, tolerability and
      PK of BVL-GSK098 following multiple daily oral doses in healthy volunteers.
