      Participants are children with cerebral palsy having a single event multi level surgery. They
      are involving in a rehabilitation protocol in the same rehab center.

      Two groups are formed:

        -  control group: classic rehab+children have treadmill gait protocol during 4 weeks

        -  test group : classic rehab+children have gait training with the ARROW CP serious game.

      ARROW CP game is developed for augmented reality headset (Microsoft Hololens). It delivers
      feedback in real time and with delay on participant gait performance. This game has been
      developed by researchers (Fondation Ellen Poidatz, France).

      The aims of this study are:

        1. . To determine the impact on spatiotemporal gait parameters of intensive gait
           rehabilitation involving the use of a serious AR game in children and adolescents with
           cerebral palsy.

        2. To explore the effects of playing a serious game on functional abilities

        3. To assess motivation, satisfaction and adherence to treatment
