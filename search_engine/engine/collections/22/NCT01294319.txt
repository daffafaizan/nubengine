      stimulation by corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) and negative feedback inhibition by
      cortisol, resulting in a circadian rhythm of cortisol. Recent evidence suggests that older
      men, and younger men who are endurance-trained athletes, both have reduced sensitivity to
      negative feedback, and perhaps increased basal levels of cortisol and ACTH. To investigate
      these possibilities, we propose to examine multiple aspects of the
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in younger endurance trained and sedentary men, and in
      older sedentary men.

      Subjects will collect saliva during two evenings before additional testing, and will on the
      same evening collect urine for twelve hours, both for cortisol measurements. Blood samples
      will be collected to evaluate the response to dexamethasone. We also will assess ACTH and
      cortisol responses to medications that reduce negative inhibition of ACTH. This testing will
      occur in the evening and will include administration of the glucocorticoid antagonist
      mifepristone, the mineralocorticoid antagonist spironolactone, and/or a look-alike tablet, on
      four occasions.
