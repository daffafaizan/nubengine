    
      The square-wave bolus (for meals rich in fat and/or protein) is evenly delivered over several
      hours as programmed by the patient. The required insulin dose will be calculated based on
      patient's insulin-exchange ratio. Pure protein meal will be given 3 hours after a first
      breakfast.

      To provide the minimal impact of the previous breakfast, all patients will receive up to 120
      kcal of carbohydrates and <100 kcal from protein and fat for the first breakfast (without any
      extended bolus) Patients receive a standardized pure protein meal at a second breakfast time.
      Meal insulin will be given as a square bolus or no meal -insulin will be given at all. The 5h
      post-meal glucose excursions will be recorded by self-blood glucose measurements (SMBG)
      (every 30 minutes) and continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS). The intervention is
      taking part under in-patient clinical conditions.
