      I. To assess the safety of in vivo in host drug sensitivity testing in patients with breast
      cancer and patients with lymphoma (nodal, extranodal or cutaneous lesions).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility of in vivo in host drug sensitivity testing in this patient
      population.

      II. To identify targeted therapies with potential activity in relapsed lymphoma and
      metastatic breast cancer.

      III. To evaluate the adverse event profile within each patient population.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess for apoptosis in response to intratumoral injection using known biomarkers
      (e.g., by morphology, Ki-67, caspace-3 assay as a marker of early apoptosis).

      II. To evaluate intratumoral biomarkers, intratumoral cell populations, and distribution,
      identify potential biomarkers that correlate with response to therapy based on individual
      therapies.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo FDG-PET and receive saline intralesionally on day 1. Patients also receive
      up to five additional injections of gemcitabine hydrochloride, romidepsin, belinostat,
      carfilzomib, nivolumab, trastuzumab, daratumumab, obinutuzumab, pembrolizumab, or rituximab
      intralesionally per investigator on day 1. Beginning 5 days later, patients with nodal
      disease undergo restaging FDG-PET and biopsy (if clinically feasible). Within 3-7 days,
      patients with cutaneous disease undergo restaging FDG-PET, photography, and biopsy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 months.
