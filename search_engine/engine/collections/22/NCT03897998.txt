      because crucial information necessary to build up expectations of analgesia can be acquired
      through observation of a therapeutic benefit in others. Placebo analgesic effects following
      the observation of a benefit in another person are similar in magnitude to those induced by
      directly experiencing an analgesic benefit. These observations emphasize that contextual cues
      substantially modulate the individual placebo analgesic effects.

      In this project, the investigators propose a compelling research agenda to explore the neural
      mechanisms of hypoalgesia driven by observation as a foundation for future development of
      novel nonpharmacological pain therapies using pharmacological functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and combined EEG/fMRI. It builds on a decade of
      experience in placebo research in PI Colloca's lab and with University of Maryland
      collaborators experienced in brain mapping and pain research. In Aim 1, the investigators
      will determine the role of endogenous opioids on the neural mechanisms of
      observationally-induced hypoalgesia by using the opioid antagonist naloxone in a functional
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) setting. In Aim 2, the investigators will identify the
      impact of empathy by exploring how being in the immersive environment can enhance
      observationally-induced analgesia. In Aim 3, the investigators will leverage the EEG/fMRI to
      determine the neural EEG/fMRI transient changes that could co-occur when socially-induced
      expectations are violated.
