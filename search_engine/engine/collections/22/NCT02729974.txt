      complications are common in patients with placenta accreta, including hemorrhage, transfusion
      of blood products, abdominal organ injury, bladder surgery, and ICU admission. Hemorrhage, or
      excessive blood loss, is the most common complication and often results in impaired ability
      for the body to form blood clots normally.

      The development of rapid testing of hematocrit and clotting function may allow for earlier
      identification of patients who have severe blood loss and development of clotting
      abnormalities. The investigators are testing whether use of this technology in patients
      undergoing surgery for placenta accreta, with earlier identification of patients with severe
      blood loss or clotting abnormality, will result in a lower need for transfusion and fewer
      complications.
