      be evaluated for this study. After informed consent baseline measurements are performed
      preoperative. Baseline measurements involve blood and stool samples, LiMAx, FibroScan and
      ultrasound. During the operation a liver, a subcutaneous and visceral fat sample are taken to
      analyse liver histology and inflammation as well as fatty tissue signaling. After the
      operation patients are observed 24 month. Further blood samples are taken on the first
      postoperative day, 2 and 4 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month after the operation. Stool
      samples are taken 2 and 4 weeks, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month after the intervention. The LiMAx
      test, a test analysing the liver function, is performed 4 weeks, 6, 12 and 24 month after the
      operation. The morphologic liver structure is evaluated by FibroScan and ultrasound 4 weeks,
      6, 12 and 24 month postoperative.
