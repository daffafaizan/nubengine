      increases in volume flow rates in the feeding artery and afferent vein and structural
      alterations of the vascular wall. The understanding of these procedures and the factors
      involved in promoting maturation is limited. In this context, one of the major areas
      requiring investigation is the identification of clinically useful pre-operative predictors
      of access outcome.

      Traditionally, the selection of vascular access and the eligibility for native arteriovenous
      fistula construction was mainly determined by findings of clinical examination. However, in
      addition to a complete history and physical examination, National Kidney Foundation/Dialysis
      Outcome Quality Initiative (NFK/DOQI) recommended that routine pre-operative color Doppler
      ultrasonographic vascular mapping should be performed in all hemodialysis patients who are
      candidates for access formation. This concerns the routine implementation of a non-invasive,
      safe and cost-effective method that permits the identification of vessels that are suitable
      for arteriovenous fistula (AVF) construction, acknowledging that supporting Level I evidence
      is still lacking. Indeed, available data supporting the significance of mapping on access
      maturation and patency rates are limited and conflicting.

      The aim of the present study is to compare the type of preoperative assessment, physical
      examination alone to combined CDUS vascular mapping and physical examination, to outcomes of
      performed vascular access procedures with respect to type selection and long-term patency at
      12 months in hemodialysis patients.
