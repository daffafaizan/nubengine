      I. To determine the proportion of patients who achieve a 50% decline in prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) levels within 20 weeks of sulforaphane treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the percentage change in PSA from baseline to the final measured value at the
      end of study as well as the maximal PSA decline that occurs while on study for each subject.

      II. To determine the proportion of patients whose PSA has not doubled after full 20 weeks of
      sulforaphane treatment.

      III. To determine the safety profile of sulforaphane. IV. To determine the pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of sulforaphane and its metabolites in blood.

      V. To determine the effect of sulforaphane supplementation on target pharmacodynamic (PD)
      modulation in peripheral blood cells.

      VI. To assess the effect of Glutathione-S-Transferase Mu 1 (GSTM1) genotype on sulforaphane
      PK, PD.

      VII. To collect frozen serum for future analysis of correlative biomarkers.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sulforaphane orally (PO) once daily for 20 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 14-30 days and every 6
      months for 12 months.
