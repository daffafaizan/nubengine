    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      This is an open-label, randomized, Phase II clinical trial designed to evaluate the
      anti-tumor effects of OGX-427 and continuing abiraterone acetate and prednisone versus
      continuing abiraterone acetate and prednisone alone in men with MCRPC who have evidence of
      PSA progression but no evidence of symptomatic or radiographic progression that would require
      alternative therapy (e.g., needing radiation therapy for pain or significant progression of
      visceral metastases).

      Patients on the control arm will be allowed to cross-over to receive OGX-427 following
      documented disease progression. Patients will be randomized with equal probability to one of
      the following arms:

      EXPERIMENTAL ARM (Arm A):

      OGX-427 Starting within 7 days of randomization, three loading doses of 600 mg intravenously
      (IV) within Week 1 if possible (up to 10 days of initiating treatment), followed by weekly
      doses of 800 mg IV

      Continuation of standard therapy with abiraterone acetate 1000 mg by mouth (PO) daily and
      prednisone 10-20 mg PO daily

      CONTROL ARM (Arm B):

      Continuation of standard therapy with abiraterone acetate 1000 mg PO daily and prednisone
      10-20 mg PO daily

      After documented disease progression, patients on Arm B may opt to receive OGX-427 treatment
      (according to the Arm A schedule) following a screening evaluation (i.e., all inclusion and
      exclusion criteria have been met)

      Both Arms:

      Evaluations at 4 week-intervals. Disease assessments required at the milestone Day 60
      assessment (expected to occur after 8 weeks of treatment and prior to Day 1, Week 9) and at
      16, 24, 32, 40, and 48 weeks (if applicable) or until documented disease progression.
      Patients who are withdrawn from the study for a reason other than documented disease
      progression or patient withdrawal of consent will be followed every 4 weeks in the
      Off-Treatment Follow-up Period until documented disease progression.

           transaminase (SGOT) aspartate transaminase (AST) ≤ 3.0 x ULN

      Renal:

        -  Creatinine ≤ 1.3 x ULN

      Cardiac:

        -  Known left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) <50% or New York Heart Association
           (NYHA) Functional Classification Class III or IV heart failure

      Other:
