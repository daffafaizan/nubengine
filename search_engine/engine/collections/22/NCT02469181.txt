           function and flow in patients with Fabry's cardiomyopathy using diastolic stress
           echocardiography, LV vortex flow and CMR.

        2. Primary / Secondary Endpoint 1) Primary endpoint

             -  Changes of peak exercise E/E' by diastolic stress echocardiography (RECAP-F STRESS
                trial) and LV vortex flow parameters (RECAP-F FLOW trial) at 1 year follow up.

                2) Secondary endpoint

             -  Changes of extracellular volume by CMR(T1 mapping) at 1 year follow up (RECAP-F
                trial) ② Evaluation of the degree of the resting LV diastolic function ③ Other
                echo-parameters; LV mass index at baseline, 1 year follow up, reduction of peak
                exercise E/E prime at 1 year follow up

                  -  Changes of quality of life using questionnaire ⑤ Change of peak VO2, exercise
                     time, AT by diastolic stress echocardiography at 1 year follow up ⑥ Change in
                     T1 baseline(myo, ms) & T1 baseline(blood, ms) T1 postcontrast(myo, ms) & T1
                     baseline(blood, ms) by CMR

        3. Study Methods 1) Study Design : 28 patients with newly diagnosed genetically confirmed
           Anderson-Fabry's disease will undergo diastolic stress echocardiography, LV vortex flow
           analysis, and cardiac MRI before enzyme replacement therapy(ERT) (baseline study) and
           after 1 year of treatment with agalsidese beta at the dose of 1mg/kg (follow-up study).

      2) Study procedures : Examinations as described below will be done before ERT and 1 year
      later
