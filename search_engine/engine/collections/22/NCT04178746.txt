    
      The purpose of this prospective, single center, single arm registry is to assess technical
      feasibility, peri-procedural complications, post-procedure imaging outcomes, and 30-day
      safety outcomes in subjects with intracerebral hemorrhages utilizing the Artemis Neuro
      Evacuation Device in the hyper-acute phase.

      The Artemis Neuro Evacuation Device is used for the controlled aspiration of tissue and/or
      fluid during surgery of the Ventricular System or Cerebrum in conjunction with a Penumbra
      Aspiration Pump.

      The Penumbra Aspiration Pump is indicated as a vacuum source for the Penumbra Aspiration
      Systems.

      The enrollment period will end once 20 evaluable subjects have been enrolled in the registry.
      Each subject will be in the registry for approximately 1 month.
