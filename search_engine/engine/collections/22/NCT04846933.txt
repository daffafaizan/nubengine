        -  Develop tools and methods for personalized medicine approaches to cancer patients.

        -  Develop open-source visualization and interpretation software that facilitate clinical
           decision making via data integration and interpretation of multilevel data from cancer
           patients.

        -  Rapidly identify HGSOC patients who are likely to respond poorly to current therapies
           combining information on digitalized histopathology samples, genomic and clinical data
           with AI methods.

        -  Deploy validated personalized medicine treatment options using longitudinal measurement
           and ex vivo cultures from cancer patients in clinical care.
