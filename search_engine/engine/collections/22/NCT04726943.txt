      alternative and effective approach for stroke prophylaxis in AF patients, especially those
      with OAC contra-indications. Despite mounting evidence of their safety and efficacy in
      comparison with standard oral therapy, device-related thrombus and incomplete LAA closure
      resulting in residual, significant leak may occur, potentially hindering an effective stroke
      prevention. Radiofrequency energy has been adopted in several settings (e.g., vascular,
      orthopedic, aesthetic surgery) to achieve thermal-induced tissue retraction.
