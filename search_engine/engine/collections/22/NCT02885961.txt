    
      Patients with IPF who meet all the inclusion criteria (and none of the exclusion criteria)
      will be assessed and invite to participate.

      They will undergo baseline assessment with lung function, 6 minute walk test and health
      quality assessments.

      Blood tests will assess the pro-coagulant state of these individuals. They will undergo a
      baseline FDG PET scan followed by manipulation of the coagulation cascade with 24 days (+/- 3
      days) dabigatran. They will then complete a second FDG PET, health quality assessments and
      blood tests to demonstrate target engagement.
