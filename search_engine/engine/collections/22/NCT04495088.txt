      capecitabine-based chemo-radiotherapy (CRT) and total mesorectal excision (TME) surgery in
      order to decrease the rate of local failure. In patients with low risk for local failure in
      the middle third of the rectum (cT3a/b, N-) as determined with quality controlled MRI, the
      German S3 guidelines and the ESMO clinical practice guidelines state that neoadjuvant
      radiotherapy may be omitted. However, distant failure rate is still substantial in the range
      of 20-25% in these patients highlighting the need for more effective systemic treatment.

      The hereby proposed ACO/ARO/AIO-18.2 randomized trial incorporates three novel aspects: (1)
      patient selection relies on strict and quality controlled MRI features and therefore
      identifies a cohort without imminent need for radiotherapy, (2) the sequence of chemotherapy
      and surgery is changed in a way that chemotherapy is administered preoperatively to increase
      the rate of patients treated with chemotherapy, and (3) three months of neoadjuvant FOLFOX or
      XELOX (instead of up to 6 months adjuvant chemotherapy) are used as a sole perioperative
      treatment in order to administer effective doses of the presumably most effective
      perioperative treatment at an early time point during the course of disease.

      Thus, patients with locally advanced rectal cancer but low risk for local failure (cT1/2N+ in
      all thirds of the rectum, cT3a/b N- in the middle third, and cT3-4 Nany in the upper third)
      will be included and randomized between three months of neoadjuvant FOLFOX/XELOX in Arm A and
      primary resection of the tumor followed by risk (i.e. stage) adapted chemotherapy in Arm B.
