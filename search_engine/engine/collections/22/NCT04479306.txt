      I. Determine the safety and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of osimertinib plus alisertib
      II. Determine the safety and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of osimertinib plus
      sapanisertib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective response rate (ORR) to the study combinations
      (osimertinib+alisertib and osimertinib+sapanisertib) in osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      II. Determine the progression free survival of the study combinations (osimertinib+alisertib
      and osimertinib+sapanisertib) in osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant NSCLC.

      III. Determine the disease control rate (DCR) of the study combinations
      (osimertinib+alisertib and osimertinib+sapanisertib) in osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant
      NSCLC.

      IV. Explore biomarkers associated with response/resistance of the study combinations
      (osimertinib+aliertib and osimertinib+sapanisertib) in osimertinib-resistant EGFR mutant
      NSCLC.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib or sapanisertib in combination with
      osimertinib, followed by a dose expansion study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive osimertinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and alisertib PO
      QD on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop progressive disease may crossover to Arm B.

      ARM B: Patients receive osimertinib PO QD on days 1-28 and sapanisertib PO QD on days 1-28.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients who develop progressive disease may crossover to Arm A.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
