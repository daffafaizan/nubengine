      with COVID-19:

      Hospitalized patients admitted for COVID-19 will sign an informed consent form, and be
      randomized to receive either active (Glycine plus N-acetylcysteine) or a placebo (alanine)
      supplementation for 2-weeks. On day-0, the participants will have a single blood draw to
      measure measure oxidative stress, Glutathione levels, inflammatory cytokines, endothelial
      dysfunction, mitochondrial dysfunction, immune dysfunction, and complete questionnaires to
      assess fatigue, activity and cognition. Additional clinical and lab information will be
      obtained from the hospital electronic medical records. These measurements will be repeated
      1-week and 2-weeks after starting supplementation, and at 4-weeks and 8-weeks after stopping
      supplementation.
