    
      The overarching aim of this research is to develop and evaluate a patient-reported Symptom
      Index (SI) for individuals with NMIBC (the NMIBC-SI) that is acceptable to patients,
      reliable, valid and responsive, and fit for purpose in clinical trials and clinical practice.

      Specific clinical aims:

        -  Assess and compare key Patient-Reported Outcomes (PROs) across the full range of
           contemporary treatments for NMIBC, and over the disease trajectory including acute
           treatment and 1year survivorship;

        -  Compare PROs between patients with low, intermediate, and high risk NMIBC.

      In field test 1, 200 participants will complete one questionnaire either in hard copy (pencil
      and paper) or online, at a time that is convenient for the participant. The questionnaire may
      take up to 20 minutes to complete.

      In field test 2, 250 participants will complete quality of life questionnaires at four
      different time points; 1) before tumour resection, 2) 1 week after resection, 3) 8 weeks
      after resection, and 4) 1 year after resection. The questionnaires can be completed in the
      clinic or at home, either in hard copy (pencil and paper) or online, at a time that is
      convenient for the participant but still within the relevant time point. The questionnaires
      may take up to 30 minutes to complete.
