      added to the Therapeutic Lifestyle Change diet on blood pressure, lipids, inflammation and
      menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal hypertensive and normotensive women in a randomized
      crossover trial during an 8-week period. We sought to determine whether dietary soy had an
      additional benefit to the currently recommended heart healthy diet.
