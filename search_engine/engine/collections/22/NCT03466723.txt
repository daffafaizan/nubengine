    
      Hypothesis and Significance:

      The project intends to identify novel biomarkers for PD and clinical parameters related to
      the PD etiology. To do that circulating miRNA profiling through a next-generation sequencing
      will be performed using a single sample approach in the case-control study cohort and
      identified miRNAs will be validated by qRT-PCR and functional analyses. In addition, the
      project will contribute expanding the knowledge of the genetic architecture of PD taking
      advantage of genetic characterization of the study sample. miRNA genes and target genes will
      be used to prioritize genetic variants to be tested for association with PD to detect novel
      genes and functional variants that confer disease risk.

      Specific Aim 1:

      Profile of circulating miRNAs in the serum of PD patients and controls by next-generation
      sequencing in individual samples. Correlation between identified miRNAs and PD-related
      parameters and validation in independent cohorts

      Specific Aim 2:

      Bioinformatics prediction of target genes and miRNA functional validation

      Specific Aim 3:

      Identification of genes/genetic variants in miRNA pathways predisposing to PD

      Expected outcomes:

      The study will allow to discover novel circulating miRNAs as biomarkers for Parkinson's
      disease. As the deep phenotype characterization of the study sample, the project expects to
      find new associations of identified miRNAs with disease-related parameters and define the
      role of miRNAs in the physiological pathways in which those parameters are involved and in
      the etiology of PD. Also, the understanding of the genetics of the disease will open avenues
      for novel therapeutic strategies.
