    
      Pre Radiation Period:

        -  Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) on days -14 and 0, or

        -  Tarceva (100 mg) daily from -14-0, or

        -  Bevacizumab (10 mg/kg) on days -14 and 0; Tarceva (100 mg) daily from -14-0

      Chemoradiation Period:

        -  Radiotherapy may be delivered via conventional 2-D, conformal 3-D, or intensity
           modulated (IMRT) technique as is clinically indicated. Radiotherapy and CDDP doses will
           be delivered uniformly to all treatment cohorts:

             -  RT: 1.25 Gy BID M-F with a 6 hour interfraction interval

             -  Treatment break during week 4. Total dose 70 Gy/7 weeks

             -  CDDP: 33 mg/m2 M-W on weeks 1 and 5 of RT with standard DUMC hydration and
                anti-emetic regimens

        -  Bevacizumab (10mg/kg): Monday of weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 of RT

        -  Tarceva (100 mg): Daily for weeks 1-7 of treatment, except for days receiving CDDP

      Safety Assessments:

        -  Baseline and then weekly assessments of blood pressure and urine protein : creatinine
           ratios during lead in and chemoRT phases of treatment

        -  Baseline carotid Doppler ultrasound evaluation

        -  Carotid Doppler ultrasound evaluation 1 month post-chemoRT

      Efficacy Assessments:

        -  MR Imaging/Spectroscopy to be done at baseline, end of lead-in phase, end of week 1 of
           chemoRT, and end of chemoRT

        -  Angiogenic and EGFR related cytokines. Specifically, blood samples will be obtained to
           assay levels of VEGF, b-FGF, IL-8, D-dimer, EGF, TGF. These samples will be obtained on
           the same dates as the MR studies with an additional set of samples obtained at the
           midpoint of the lead in phase of treatment (day -7).

      Clinical Assessments:

        -  All patients will undergo a minimum of once weekly interval history and physical
           examination including fiberoptic pharyngoscopy/laryngoscopy when indicated in the
           Department of Radiation Oncology to monitor for side effects and response to treatment
           as per standard routine for the care of patients with head and neck cancer.

        -  Patient compliance with Tarceva administration monitored via diary MRI/MRS (Magnetic
           Resonance Spectroscopy) DE-MRI
