      are a unique type of stem cell identified from human cord blood, distinct from other stem
      cell types including hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The
      stem cells and harnessed some of their unique properties with Stem Cell Educator therapy by
      using CB-SCs in a closed-loop system that circulates a patient's blood through a blood cell
      separator, briefly co-cultures the patient's lymphocytes with adherent CB-SCs in vitro, and
      returns the "educated" lymphocytes (but not the CB-SCs) to the patient's circulation . This
      treatment leads to global immune modulations and immune balance as demonstrated by clinical
      data and animal studies. The Stem Cell Educator therapy may revolutionize the clinical
      treatment of diabetes and other immune-related diseases through CB-SCs' immune education and
      induction of immune balance, without the safety and ethical concerns associated with
      conventional stem cell-based approaches
