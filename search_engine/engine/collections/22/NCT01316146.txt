      receptor-activated T cells. The dose level of cells that they will receive will not be based
      on a medical determination of what is best for the patient, instead the dose is based on the
      order in which the patient enrolled on the study relative to other participants. Subjects
      enrolled earlier in the study will receive a lower dose of cells than those enrolled later in
      the study. The risks of harm and discomfort from the study treatment may bear some
      relationship to the dose level. The potential for direct benefit, if any, may also vary with
      the dose level.

      The patient will be given an injection of CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cells into the
      vein through an IV line at the assigned dose. The injection will take 1-10 minutes.
      Investigators will follow the subject in the clinic after the injection for up to 4 hours.

      To learn more about the way the CD30 chimeric receptor-activated T cells are working and how
      long they last in the body, extra blood will be drawn.

      If the patient has stable disease (the lymphoma did not grow) or there is a reduction in the
      size of the lymphoma on imaging studies after the T-cell infusion, s/he can receive up to six
      additional doses of the T cells at 8 to 12 weeks intervals if s/he wishes. After each T-cell
      infusion, s/he will be monitored as described above.
