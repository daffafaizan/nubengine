      single-blinded, two-arm, parallel group, pilot trial at a single center. A total of 200
      subjects may be screened to identify 110 participants to be enrolled and randomized. These
      participants will be â‰¥ 18 years old, have been receiving antiretroviral therapy for at least
      one year with an HIV viral load < 75 copies/mL at screening, and have major depression using
      the PHQ-9 questionnaire. These participants will be randomized 1:1 to either depression
      treatment with the Beating-the-Blues cognitive behavioral therapy program (N=55) or usual
      care (N=55).
