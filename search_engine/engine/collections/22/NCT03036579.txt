      identified as requiring at least one crown on a posterior tooth. A maximum of two crowns per
      patient will be completed. All the crowns will be made from the same high strength ceramic
      material (Celtra Duo/Dentsply Sirona). The two groups of crowns will be made using two
      different processes to create the surface texture and finish for the crown. One group of
      Celtra Duo crowns (Group 1) will be glaze-fired in a porcelain oven and the second group
      (Group 2) will be hand-polished. All the crowns will be cemented using two adhesive
      techniques. All of the oven-fired, glazed crowns will be cemented using the self-etching,
      self-adhesive resin cement technique (Calibra Universal Cement/Dentsply). All of the hand
      polished crowns will be cemented using an adhesive bonding technique using Prime & Bond Elect
      (Dentsply) with a dual cured resin cement (Calibra Ceram/Dentsply). The crowns are planned to
      be evaluated at 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, and if funding permits, 4 years, and 5
      years. At each appointment an examination of the crown will be completed as well as clinical
      photographs, an intraoral digital scan, and impression of the crown.
