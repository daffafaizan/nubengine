    
      All patients aged above 60 years undergoing planned spinal surgery in the prone position in
      the duration of 1-3 hours under general anesthesia will be included in the study. In group L
      (liberal), the value of blood pressure will be corrected with the change of mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) ± 25% patient's mean arterial pressure, and group R (restrictive) with the
      change of MAP ± 10%. Cognitive dysfunction tests will be executed on the day before the
      surgery, two hours after the surgery and on the third postoperative day. Anesthesia will be
      managed according to the standardised protocol. Concentration of desflurane will be adjusted
      according to entropy values (target 40-50). Analgetics will be applied according to surgical
      pleth index (SPI) values. Sufentanil will not be applied in the last 15 minutes. Extubation
      will be performed at the operating theatre when meeting all extubation criteria including
      train of four ratio (TOFR) above 92%. Neither syntophyllin, nor pharmacological
      decurarization (syntostigmin) will be applied to the patients.
