      affected patients from ventilation as soon as possible is a crucial point. In this context
      automated computerized systems have become a torchbearer. These systems are expected to
      expedite the weaning process, reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU length of
      stay of a given patient in comparison to conventional physician-directed weaning. A
      multicenter randomized trial by Lellouche et al supported these theories, using a
      computer-driven system to regulate Pressure Support Ventilation (PSV). This system is now
      commercially available as SmartCare/PS (Draeger Medical AG & Co. KG, Luebeck, Germany).

      The purpose of the study on hand was to find out whether the results reported before could be
      repeated in a broad, surgical ICU patient group. Study design was chosen similar. In addition
      we investigated the workload for physicians and nurses in both study arms which has not been
      conducted before.
