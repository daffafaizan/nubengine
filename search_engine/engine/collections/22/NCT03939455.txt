    
      Our randomized trial will evaluate HIV test rates among participants who complete a
      tablet-based intervention, the Mobile Augmented Screening tool (MAS), compared to
      participants in a treatment as usual (TAU) condition.

      Research staff will approach 350 emergency department (ED) patients aged 13 - 24 years.
      Participants will be randomized into the intervention or TAU condition. Participants will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or TAU condition, stratified by patient age
      (13-17 and 18-24). Within each of these age strata, permuted blocks randomization with
      varying block sizes will be employed to ensure balance and concealment of allocations prior
      to randomization.

      Participants who are randomized into the intervention condition will watch a 5-minute video
      on a tablet computer, and the tablet will ask intervention participants if they would like an
      HIV test. Possible responses will be "Yes" or "No". Participants who are randomized into TAU
      will be offered HIV tests by research staff. All participants in both conditions who agree to
      HIV testing will be tested by hospital staff in the location where they are receiving
      treatment. All participants who test will receive their results in person from ED staff
      before discharge.

      The primary trial outcome will be percentages of patients, by treatment group, who test for
      HIV.
