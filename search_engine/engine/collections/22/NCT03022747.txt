      for acute lymphoblastic leukemia on Nordic protocols and with wild type thiopurine
      methyltransferase (TPMT) are eligible for the study. They will first receive a 12 week phase
      with normal MT during which time repeated sampling of 6-mercaptopurine (6MP) metabolite
      levels and other laboratory parameters will be performed. After 12 weeks, allopurinol at a
      dose of 50 mg/sqm is added (simultaneously reducing the dose of 6MP by 50%) and during the
      next 12 weeks patients are monitored closely for toxicity and samples for determination of
      metabolite levels and hematological and liver toxicity are obtained regularly. If, after 4
      weeks of allopurinol treatment, the levels of 6-thioguanine are below 200 nmol/mmol
      hemoglobin, the dose of allopurinol will be increased to 100 mg/sqm. Allopurinol treatment is
      continued for 12 weeks after which the patients switch to their original maintenance therapy.
