      relapsed/refractory DLBCL plan to be enrolled in about 10 study sites of the study. It is
      planned that at least 50% (~30 patients) will have the GCB subtype of DLBCL. Enrolled
      patients will be treated with a fixed dose, 60 mg of ATG-010, orally, twice weekly, each 4
      week (28-day) a cycle. Patients should remain on the study treatment of ATG-010, until either
      PD or occurrence of unacceptable toxicity.
