    
      Before conducting ovarian stimulation, all couples must conduct preoperative routine
      examination such as routine blood test, blood group examination and infectious disease
      examination. We collected 2ml remaining blood from the examination by use of sodium heparin,
      which then conducted 1,25(OH)2D3 assay by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

      All patients underwent a standardized ovarian stimulation regimen, oocyte retrieval, and
      fertilization, followed by a planned fresh or frozen embryo transfer.Normal fertilization
      rate was defined as the presence of two pronuclei (2PN) at the time of fertilization
      assessment, 16-19 h after ICSI or conventional insemination. The percentage of top quality
      embryos was defined as the percentage of top quality embryos among the total number of 2PN
      embryos. Blastocyst forming rate was calculated as number of formed blastocysts devided by
      number of cultured blastocysts.
