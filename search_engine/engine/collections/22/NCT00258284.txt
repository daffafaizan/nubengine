      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with androgen-independent metastatic
           adenocarcinoma of the prostate treated with capecitabine and docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and overall survival
           of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral capecitabine
      twice daily on days 5-18. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive 2 additional
      courses of therapy beyond CR

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study.
