      non-obese (BMI>30kg/m2) males with moderate to severe COPD under optimized medication. The
      participants will be randomly assigned (computer-generated) into either Elastic Tape Group
      (ETG) or Control Group (CG). Both groups will be evaluated in 4 meetings (1st: baseline
      measurements and randomization; 2nd: intervention 1; 3rd: intervention 2; 4th: revaluation),
      however only ETG group will be submitted to the ET. The intervention will last 2 consecutive
      weeks and the patients will need to return (3rd meet) to replace the tapes. Before and after
      the intervention, dyspnea, physical activity, psychosocial symptoms, health related quality
      of life, health status, and barriers to physical activity will be assessed. Data about
      diagnosis, medications, comorbidities and spirometric values will be collected from the
      medical records. The data normality will be analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov. Two-way ANOVA
      with repeated measures with appropriate post hoc of Bonferroni or Kruskal-Wallis test follow
      by pos hoc of Dunn will be used to compare inter and intra-groups differences, according to
      data normality. The significance level will be set to 5% for all tests.
