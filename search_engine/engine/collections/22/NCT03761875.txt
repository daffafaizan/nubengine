      multi-parametric flow cytometry phenotypic, cytokine and signaling molecules that are altered
      in NK cells from CHB patients during the inactive phase. Phenotypic changes observed include
      the downregulation of CD160, NKp30, CD16 and Tim-3. The expansion of 'adaptive' NK cells
      (FCεRg- NKG2C+ or CD57hi), and the upregulation of CD107a (steady state), NKG2D and 41BB.
      Functional changes include the decrease in the levels of IFNγ, TNFα and MIP1β. Cellular
      metabolism is now recognized to regulate functional properties of immune cells such as T or
      NK cells. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase is a key regulator of cellular
      metabolism, integrating environmental cues to control downstream metabolic pathways. mTOR is
      the catalytic subunit of two different complexes: mTORC1 and mTORC2, the activity of which
      can be measured by measuring the level of phosphorylation of the proteins S6 and Akt
      respectively. The lab has previously shown that the mTOR pathway regulates NK cell
      development and activation 2. The investigators have observed that pS6 and pAkt are also
      decreased in CHB patients.
