    
      Research question: To what extent does an on-site aerobic exercise screening and prescription
      clinic effect uptake of aerobic exercise and patient outcomes in in-patient stroke
      rehabilitation?

      Design: Pre-post cohort design to explore real-world application and feasibility

      Aim 1. Establish an aerobic exercise screening and prescription clinic (herein 'Aerobics
      Clinic') at the NSRC.

      Aim 2. Assess the potential impact of the Aerobics Clinic on the self-efficacy of
      physiotherapists at NSRC regarding clinical utilization of aerobic exercise in in-patient
      stroke rehabilitation.

      Method: An assessment of the physiotherapy participants' self-efficacy regarding the clinical
      utilization of aerobic exercise post-stroke will be conducted prior to, and after,
      implementation of the Clinic.

      Aim 3: Assess the potential impact of the Aerobics Clinic on prescription and treatment
      practices regarding aerobic exercise among patients in stroke rehabilitation at the NSRC.

      Method: Prior to, and after, implementation of the Clinic the actual utilization of aerobic
      exercise in the practices of the physiotherapy participants will be assessed using heart rate
      monitoring, activity monitoring, and health record review.
