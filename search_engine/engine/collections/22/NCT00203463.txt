    
      This is a twelve-week randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of topiramate for 40
      patients with PTSD. Diagnoses are made by Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID).
      Symptom severity is measured with the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS), Davidson
      Trauma Scale (DTS), Treatment Outcome PTSD (TOP-8), Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), and
      the Hamilton Rating Scales for Depression and Anxiety (HAM-D and HAM-A). The Clinician
      Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is the primary outcome measure. Subjects will read and sign
      informed consent prior to beginning any study procedures. Subjects who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 (Topiramate : placebo) to study
      medication. Study medication is initiated at one tablet daily (25mg topiramate or placebo)
      and medication will be increased by 25-100mg (1 tablet) increments every 7 days, as
      tolerated, until a maximum benefit is achieved, not to exceed 400mg/day. Patients will be
      seen every week up until Visit 4, and then will be seen every two weeks for the remainder of
      the study for assessment of efficacy and side effects.
