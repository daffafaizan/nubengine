        -  To evaluate tumor response rate and safety of nitroglycerin as a potentiator of
           anticancer combination therapy comprising paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with
           previously untreated stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized, controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of
      2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive nitroglycerin, paclitaxel, and carboplatin.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel and carboplatin. In both arms, treatment continues
           for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
