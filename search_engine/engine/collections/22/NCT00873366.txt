    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To assess the operating characteristics of the ¹³C-dextromethorphan (^13 C-DM) breath
           test in identifying women with breast cancer (or at high risk) who are CYP2D6-genotypic
           poor metabolizers.

        -  To examine the correlation between CYP2D6 enzyme activity (as measured by the breath
           test) and plasma endoxifen (and 4-hydroxyTAM) levels in patients who carry one or more
           CYP2D6 functional alleles.

        -  To examine the change in CYP2D6 enzyme activity (as measured by the ¹³C-DM breath test),
           in patients who start a CYP2D6 inhibitor while taking tamoxifen.

        -  To determine whether CYP2D6 enzyme activity (as measured by the breath test) changes
           over time (either as a consequence of drug-induced inhibition or other).

        -  To measure genetic variation in additional genes that are later identified to affect the
           metabolism, uptake, or distribution of tamoxifen (e.g., SULT1A1, UGT).

      OUTLINE: Patients receive tamoxifen citrate for 6 months. ^13C-dextromethorphan breath tests
      are conducted at baseline and periodically during the 6 months.

      13C-dextromethorphan breath test: Patients receive oral Alka-Seltzer® Gold (ASG; citric acid,
      potassium bicarbonate, and sodium bicarbonate) in water, then, 15 minutes later, another ASG
      dose and oral ¹³C-dextromethorphan. Patients breathe into a bag 1-2 times, and the is bag
      sealed. ¹³CO_2 levels in the bags are measured.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically for pharmacogenetic and
      pharmacokinetic studies by reverse phase HPLC with fluorescence detection.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed annually for 5 years.
