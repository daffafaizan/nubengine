    
      The aim of this protocol is to allow genetic-related evaluations for patients with a variety
      of known or suspected genetic disorders, supplement and offer an additional opportunity for
      training in clinical genetics, dysmorphology and metabolic genetics in the National Institute
      of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) and other Institutes of the National Institutes
      of Health (NIH). If not eligible for a specific NICHD research protocol, patients with
      genetic-related conditions may be evaluated under the auspices of this protocol to advance
      the clinical skills of physicians participating in NICHD clinical research and training
      programs, and to provide stimuli for new clinical research initiatives. Standard
      medically-indicated laboratory or radiological studies may be performed to confirm a
      diagnosis or to aid in the management of the patient. In some cases, the subjects may receive
      medical or surgical treatment for their disorder at the NIH CC according to current clinical
      practice. The overall purpose of genetic evaluations under this protocol is to support our
      clinical training and research missions. Family members of subjects evaluated on this
      protocol (who have informative meiotic inheritance relationships to the proband or index
      case) may also be enrolled.
