    
      This study is intended to demonstrate the diagnostic performance of the image-derived
      physiology model using the invasive physiological measures as the reference standard.

      Specific objectives include the following:

      i) Demonstrate the sensitivity and specificity of image-derived iFR and FFR results for
      identifying functionally significant lesions as determined by the corresponding invasive
      measures; ii) Demonstrate the diagnostic agreement of image-derived iFR and FFR estimates
      with the corresponding invasive measures; iii) Demonstrate the diagnostic performance of
      image derived physiology estimate (iFR/FFR) is superior to visual angiographic assessment for
      the identification of functionally significant stenoses as determined by the corresponding
      invasive physiology measures; iv) Demonstrate reproducibility of the image-derived estimate
      for a given operator and across multiple operators for a given lesion.
