    
      This is a Phase 2 trial in China to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the combination of
      nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine administered in patients diagnosed with metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. This study is designed to be a Chinese bridging study to complement the
      Global pivotal study (CA-046).

      The study consists of three parts: (1) Dose evaluation; (2) Single arm to evaluate efficacy
      following an optimal Simon two-stage design; and (3) Randomized 2-arm to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine versus gemcitabine alone. These 3
      parts will be carried out sequentially. The Part 3 randomized 2-arm portion will only be
      carried out if deemed necessary per protocol.
