      reduce the complications and to improve the quality of life. After abdominal surgery, two
      factors can be modified: early mobilisation, thanks to optimal pain control, and return to a
      normal feeding, permitted by transit recovery. Opioids, which are usually used for pain
      control, delay the intestinal transit and can be responsible for side effects like
      drowsiness, nausea, urine retention.

      Lidocaine is a local anaesthetic, which means that it can stop the pain if it is
      administrated around the nerves. It can also be used intravenously. In this way, it is
      supposed to decrease opioid consumption, accelerate intestinal transit and even decrease
      inflammation. Side effects of lidocaine appear at higher plasma concentrations than those
      considered in the study.

      After randomisation, the patient will receive either intravenous lidocaine during the surgery
      and 24 hours after the surgery, or physiological serum (like placebo). Every patient will
      dispose of patient-controlled-analgesia with morphine and of a standardised care management.
      Data will be collected concerning pain level, morphine consumption, psychomotor performances,
      duration of ileus, speed of activity recovery, quality of recovery, and side effects.
      Biological evaluation of lidocaine concentration and inflammation will also be done.
