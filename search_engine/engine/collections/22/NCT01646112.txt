      to the significance of unclassified genetic variants (UV) or variants of unknown significance
      (VUS). As the field of medical genetics moves toward whole genome sequencing (WGS), these
      challenges will inevitably become more frequent. VUS represent ambiguous and uncertain data,
      for which pathogenicity has not been demonstrated or excluded in published literature,
      mutation databases or on the basis of other clinical findings. Such variants present a
      clinical interpretation challenge and also evoke new counseling dilemmas for the
      understanding and psychosocial impact of uncertain genetic test results. This exploratory
      study aims to seek insight into the psychological impact of receiving a VUS through
      semi-structured interviews with 30 to 40 individuals who have received a VUS test result for
      one of the Lynch Syndrome/Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) mismatch repair
      genes. The interviews will focus on the experience of receiving this result and any
      cognitive, affective or behavioral effects related to the uncertainty of the result.
      Interviews will be transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis to identify themes running
      through the interviews. Understanding the impact of receiving a VUS may identify areas for
      future intervention studies to minimize negative effects of these events. Additionally, these
      data may contribute to the formulation of guidelines surrounding the consent for and
      disclosure of VUS s for other diseases and ultimately for WGS.
