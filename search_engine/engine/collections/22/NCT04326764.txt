      outcome of poor-risk AML and MDS in both younger and older patients. Reduced-intensity
      conditioning (RIC) regimen have partially abrogated the problem of regimen-related toxicity.
      However, graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) remains a major cause of non-relapse morbidity and
      mortality. Despite a strong graft versus leukemia (GvL) effect after allogeneic HSCT, the
      relapse rate after transplantation in poor-risk leukemia patients is still too high,
      necessitating new approaches to exploit GvL in a more optimized way. In addition, minimizing
      the GvHD reaction remains an important goal. One attractive strategy may be the
      administration of epigenetic therapy early after HSCT in order to optimize the GvL effect, to
      provide a direct anti-leukemic effect, and to control GvHD. Two preceding phase I/II studies
      have suggested that post-transplant administration of the histone deacetylase (HDAC)
      inhibitor panobinostat may be associated with a reduced relapse rate, while allowing for
      control of GvHD. Based on these two studies, the hypothesis of the present trial is that
      panobinostat can be an effective drug in preventing relapse by optimizing GvL in MDS and AML
      patients with high-risk features after HSCT, while at the same time reducing GvHD. It has
      been designed to test this hypothesis in a prospective randomized trial comparing maintenance
      with panobinostat interspersed with donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) versus the standard
      approach of pre-emptive DLI alone in patients with poor-risk AML/MDS having favorably
      received an allogeneic HSCT followed by engraftment, donor chimerism and hematopoietic
      reconstitution.
