      growing blood supply. Tumor cells have been shown to produce substances that stimulate the
      abnormal growth of new blood vessels that allow the tumor to grow. In adults, blood vessel
      cells normally divide very rapidly. It is thought that PTK787/ZK222584 may interfere with the
      growth of new blood vessels. A drug that interferes with the growth of new blood vessels
      might stop tumor growth, and possibly shrink the tumor by keeping it from receiving nutrients
      and oxygen supplied by the blood vessels. Since normal blood vessel cells divide very
      rapidly, it might be possible to stop tumor growth without harming normal tissues.

      The purpose of this study is to find out if an investigational drug, PTK787/ZK 222584 is safe
      and effective in treating relapsed or refractory diffuse large cell lymphoma.
