      healthcare. Home mechanical ventilation has been shown to improve morbidity and mortality in
      patients with chronic respiratory failure of different aetiologies. A French survey suggests
      an increase of 12% of cases per year. With the prospect of a substantial increase of
      ventilated patients at home, facilities and resources have not been proportionally growing,
      so new approaches should be investigated and addressed to absorb this constant flux of
      patients.

      Telemedicine is defined as the broad use of electronic and communications technologies to
      provide and support remote monitoring of health status. It has been shown to be an effective
      alternative model of care for managing chronic diseases. It as also been shown to reduce
      healthcare costs and is a major topic on the agendas of health and social care policies in
      Europe.

      Home telemonitoring of respiratory conditions results in early identification of
      deteriorations in patient condition and symptom control.

      However, evidence on the magnitude of clinical and structural effects remains preliminary,
      with variations in study approaches and an absence of robust study designs and formal
      evaluations.

      The objective is gathering data that can be help to establish guidelines for non invasive
      home mechanical ventilation initiation and quality control.
