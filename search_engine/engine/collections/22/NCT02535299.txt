    
      160 Type 2 diabetes in our hospital will divide into 4 groups: group A (40 healthy
      volunteers), group B (40 patients who give basal and insulin treatment, group C（40 patients
      who give basal and Liraglutide treatment),group D（40 patients who give basal and metformin
      treatment). The age, height, weight, blood glucose, glycosylated hemoglobin
      A1c（HbA1c）,homeostasis model assessment(HOMA-IR), lipid, blood pressure, course of disease,
      telomere length,telomerase activity will record respectively. And High-sensitive C-reactive
      protein (HsCRP), Par-4, GST,SOD,GSH-PX,ATF-6,CHOP,XBP-1 and Tumor necrosis factor-α（TNF-α）
      will detect as Baseline. After each group's treatment, Change from baseline of all indexes
      will record, Multifactor logistic regression will be analyzed the correlations between each
      positive indexes.
