      a universally accepted definition, incomplete understanding of its pathophysiology, and lack
      of evidence based guidelines.

      The majority of patients appear to respond well to initial therapies consisting of loop
      diuretics and vasoactive agents. however, this treatments failed to decrease post-discharge
      mortality and readmission rates which represent the most important goal in AHFS.

      In the last few years, many drugs has been tested in AHFS setting trying to adress this
      issue, however results has been disappointing in term of efficacy and / or safety.

      Although evidence supports the beneficial effects of digoxin on hemodynamic, neurohormonal,
      and electrophysiological parameters in patients with CHF, recent publications has rose
      concerns about its safety profile and therefore decreasing its use.

      The effects of digoxin alone or in combination with other vasodilators are seen within few
      hours of its administration and result in increased cardiac output, decreased pulmonary wedge
      pressure, increased ejection fraction, and improved neurohormonal profile without changes in
      blood pressure.

      All this findings made us rose the question of whether digoxin is effective or not in short
      term treatment of acute heart failure ?
