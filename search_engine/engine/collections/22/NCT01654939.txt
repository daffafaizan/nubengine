      evolution. There has never been a concerted effort to prevent the progression of liver
      disease in these patients. To date, the only treatment is initiation of antiretroviral
      therapy. Rifaximin could be an easy and well tolerated way to improve the outcome of liver
      disease in HIV-infected patients. We hypothesize that it could help to slow down the
      progression of liver disease at any stage in these patients. This is a pilot study. A total
      of twenty patients placed on rifaximin by their physician for a mild hepatic encephalopathy
      will be monitored over a period of one year. The evaluation of the fibrosis will be done
      through transient elastography every 3 months. Bacterial translocation will be evaluated
      through the dosing of soluble CD14. The safety of the prolonged use of rifaximin in patients
      will also be assessed.
