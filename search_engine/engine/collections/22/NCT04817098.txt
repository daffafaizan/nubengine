      leverage global partnerships to generate, synthesize, and use evidence to improve program
      implementation in low and middle-income countries, the proposed study will examine the impact
      and implementation of the Journey of Life (JoL) intervention in a humanitarian setting. The
      JoL intervention aims to provide psychosocial support to adults and galvanize caregivers to
      develop action plans for child protection in their communities. The proposed research will
      involve an analysis of effect sizes for mental health, functioning, social support, child
      protection behaviors, parenting attitudes and behaviors, and experiences of intimate partner
      violence. The research also aims to interrogate implementation strategies that are useful
      within humanitarian contexts through qualitative key informant interviews and focus group
      discussions. Assessments include baseline and follow up data collection to measure effect
      sizes and assess implementation strategy components. The study aims are to: (1) assess the
      impact of JoL on child protection indicators, (2) examine the effects of JoL on behavioral
      health functioning (i.e. mental health, social support, and functioning)
