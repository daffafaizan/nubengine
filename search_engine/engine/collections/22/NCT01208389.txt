    
      The study is a follow-on to a Phase 1 dose-escalation and safety study (closed to enrollment
      as of June 2009). Up to twelve adults and children with a molecular diagnosis of biallelic
      RPE65 mutations, who have participated in the earlier Phase 1 study, and who meet all study
      eligibility criteria, will receive AAV2-hRPE65v2 vector in the previously uninjected,
      contralateral eye to evaluate the safety of bilateral, sequential subretinal administration
      of AAV2-hRPE65v2.
