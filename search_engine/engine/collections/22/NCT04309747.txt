      nanosecond knife can achieve the effectiveness and safety of liver cancer ablation treatment.
      Four hospitals with national medical clinical trial institution qualifications are selected
      as clinical trial centers. This clinical trial requires 190 subjects. Qualified participants
      will receive nanosecond pulse ablation therapy according to the routine procedures. The
      results will be recorded according to the requirements of the primary outcome (the effective
      rate of nanosecond knife ablation for liver cancer) and secondary outcomes (partial response
      rate, secondary ablation rate, progression-free survival, overall survival rate, quality of
      life score, alpha-fetoprotein levels, technical success rate, local control rate,
      complication rate, device Use satisfaction of nanosecond knife ablation for liver cancer).
      The first 2-month follow-up after the operation, CT, MR, CEUS, liver function, tumor markers
      were reviewed monthly to observe the lesion necrosis and tumor marker changes. After that,
      tumor markers, CEUS, or three-phase CT/MRI of liver were examined every 2 to 3 months. After
      two years, tumor markers, CEUS, or three-phase CT/MRI of liver were examined every 3 to 6
      months. After then, statistical comparisons of effectiveness and safety of the product will
      be made according to groups.
