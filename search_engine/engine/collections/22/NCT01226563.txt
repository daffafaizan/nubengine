      studies, left ventricular (LV) remodeling contributes independently to heart failure
      progression. Prevention and reversal of LV remodeling are correlated with decreased risk of
      death and heart failure events. IK-5001 is an implantable device to be used in subjects with
      recent myocardial infarction (MI). The IK-5001 device has been shown to directly halt the
      remodeling process that occurs following acute MI. IK-5001 replaces the damaged extracellular
      matrix (ECM) that has degraded during infarction, supports the damaged myocardial tissue,
      prevents local dyskinesis, and decreases wall stress. Because of its minimal interaction with
      the myocardium, its mechanism of action, its lack of specific pharmacologic activity and its
      elimination behavior, IK-5001 is a medical device in concurrence with the Global
      Harmonization Task Force's harmonized definition for medical devices.
