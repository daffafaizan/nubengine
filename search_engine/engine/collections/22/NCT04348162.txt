      of both on markers of cardiovascular health and cognition.

      Healthy volunteers are recruited to participate in a parallel study (n 30 per group) for 10
      to 12 weeks. Markers of cardiovascular health (FMD, markers of inflammation and fatty acid
      metabolism) and cognition (neuropsychological tests and plasma neurotrophins) are being
      measured before and after intervention.
