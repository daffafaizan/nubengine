      cavo-pulmonary connection surgery in children. Investigators hypothesized that compared with
      placebo, patients assigned to receive nesiritide will improve early postoperative outcomes.
      Study design: The study is a a single-center, randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled,
      two-arm parallel-group clinical trial, patients undergoing total cavo-pulmonary connection
      surgery are assigned to receive nesiritide or placebo. A standard dose of study drug was
      administered by a continuous infusion for ≥24 hours and ≤7 days after cardiac intensive care
      unit admission. The primary outcome is days of chest drainage. Secondary outcomes included
      days of hospitalization measures of cardiovascular function, renal function, and adverse
      events and neurohumoral. The eligible participants will be allocated into intervention and
      control groups in a 1:1 ratio randomly. The intervention group will receive study drug. All
      the participants will be followed up during hospitalization .

      Statistical analysis: Evaluation will be carried out on an intention-to-treat basis. Values
      of analyzed endpoints between intervention group and control group will be compared according
      to the analysis plan.
