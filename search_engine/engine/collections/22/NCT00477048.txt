    
      Primary objective:

      To determine whether a switch to a SQV can cause improvements in renal function in patients
      with chronic IDV associated nephrotoxicity without improvement after IDV dose reduction.

      Secondary objective:

        1. To describe the pathophysiology of chronic IDV associated renal impairment through renal
           biopsies at baseline and week 48

        2. To describe the pathophysiology of chronic IDV associated renal impairment through renal
           tubular function at baseline and week 48

        3. To determine whether a switch to an SQV can cause improvements in renal pathophysiology
           in patients with chronic IDV associated nephrotoxicity through renal biopsies performed
           at baseline and at weeks 48

        4. To determine whether a switch to an SQV results in improvements in hypertension, lipid
           profiles and cutaneous side effects
