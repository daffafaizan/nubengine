      will receive Toripalimab 240mg + Albumin-bound paclitaxel 260mg/m2 + Carboplatin AUC5 for 3
      cycles every 21 days (+/-3 days) as neoadjuvant treatment followed by surgery 3-4 weeks after
      the last dose of chemo-immunotherapy.

      The primary objective is major pathologic response (MPR), defined as less than 10% tumor
      cells in the pathologically resected specimen. Patient accrual is expected to be completed
      within 18 months excluding a run-in-phase of 3 months. Patients will be followed 3 years
      after surgery. The study will end once survival follow-up has concluded.
