      deficits which affect gait, or walking ability. These manifest as decreased walking speed,
      and further, as stroke affects only one side of the body, there are resulting asymmetries in
      time, spatial and force parameters during walking. Robotic-based therapies have been used to
      increase walking speed and reduce asymmetry in a population of individuals after stroke,
      however these therapies have demonstrated results similar to that of non-robotic, or
      conventional training. This is possibly due to the control strategies used in robotic
      training, which strategies limit participant involvement and reduce learning effect. The
      Tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD) is a robotic device that uses motorized tethers attached
      to a belt at the user's pelvis to guide the pelvis along a pre-set movement trajectory. These
      tethers can be configured in an infinite array of possibilities, and most recently have been
      used to facilitate a body weight shift onto the paretic limb in a population of individuals
      after stroke. Other robotic devices constrain the limb through the entire movement trajectory
      and constrict the participants ability to participate in motor planning and movement
      execution. The TPAD promotes weight shifting, but allows an individual to freely move the
      limb and to navigate leg movement and foot placement independently, without constraints.
      Further, if coupled with overground training to promote transfer of improvements to walking
      over ground, this device maybe useful at improving symmetry in individuals after stroke.
