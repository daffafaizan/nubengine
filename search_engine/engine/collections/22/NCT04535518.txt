    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, blind-end, randomized controlled trial at 5 hospitals in
      Shanghai, China. The KD children diagnosed within 14 days of onset according to the
      diagnostic criteria for KD released by American Heart Association (AHA) in 2017 will be
      considered for participants in the trial. The patients meeting eligibility criteria will be
      randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the control group (receiving 2 g/kg*1 IVIG and 30 mg/kg/d
      aspirin) or intervention group (receiving 2 g/kg*1 IVIG, 30 mg/kg/d aspirin and additional 5
      mg/kg*1 infliximab) based on the randomly block design (block sizes 4). Baseline
      characteristics of each participant will be collected, including sex, age of onset, height,
      body weight, subtype of KD, fever days before initial IVIG, other clinical manifestations,
      echocardiographic findings at enrolment, and a series of pre-IVIG laboratory tests.
      Two-dimensional echocardiography will be performed at least 7 timepoints: at admission, 2
      weeks, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 12 months after onset of KD to assess the
      coronary artery lesions.
