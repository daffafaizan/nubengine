      rehabilitation treatments on QoL of PD patients, in this study we translated and then
      validated the Belastungsfragebogen Parkinson kurzversion (BELA-P-k). This tool allows
      evaluating separately two crucial aspects: i) the loss of personal autonomy in activities of
      daily life and ii) the psychological and psychosocial impact of the disease.

      The BELA-P-k was translated from Dutch into Italian. Subsequently 102 patients with PD filled
      out the questionnaire. PD patients were also evaluated by using the Parkinson Disease
      Questionnaire -39 (PDQ39), the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), the Mini
      Mental State Examination (MMSE) and the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB) The internal
      consistency of the questionnaire was assessed by means of Cronbach's alpha coefficient.

      The discriminant validity was assessed by testing for differences between mean values for
      patients grouped according to Hoehn and Yahr stages. This analysis was carried out by a
      one-way analysis of variance.

      Finally, the construct validity was determined by assessing the relationship (Spearman rank
      correlation coefficient) between Bela-P-k and the PDQ39
