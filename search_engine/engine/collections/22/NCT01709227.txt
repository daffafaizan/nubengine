      surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Multiple studies have demonstrated that patients
      with AKI have worse clinical outcomes, such as longer ventilation times and increased length
      of stay, which is thought to be secondary to associated oliguria and subsequent fluid
      overload. Studies suggest that early renal replacement therapy (RRT) via peritoneal dialysis
      (PD) may prevent fluid overload and therefore be a superior management to diuretic (i.e.
      furosemide) administration. However, there is no published evidence to suggest superiority or
      laboratory data available to guide decision making.

      Objective: Our primary objective is to determine if early institution of PD improves clinical
      outcomes compared to administration of furosemide in post-operative cardiac infants with
      acute kidney injury. We hypothesize that early initiation of PD will improve clinical
      outcomes. We will determine if these clinical outcomes will be better among good responders
      of furosemide compared to poor responders. We will determine if postoperative NGAL
      concentrations are predictive of poor response to furosemide.

      Design / Methods: The study will be a single-center randomized clinical trial among neonates
      undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB with planned placement of a PD catheter due to risk of
      AKI. If patients demonstrate oliguria within the first postoperative day, they will be
      randomized to early PD or trial of furosemide. Clinical and laboratory data will be collected
      and compared between groups.
