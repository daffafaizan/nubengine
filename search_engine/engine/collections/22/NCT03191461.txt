      perfusion reserve index (MPRI) in cancer survivors treated with anthracycline chemotherapy
      relative to similarly aged healthy comparators without a history of cancer treatment.
      Hypothesis: Cancer survivors treated with anthracycline chemotherapy will have a lower MPRI
      than similarly aged healthy comparators without a history of cancer treatment.The secondary
      objective of this cross-sectional pilot study is to determine if MPRI is associated with
      myocardial fibrosis measured non-invasively with cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging.
      Hypothesis: MPRI will be inversely associated with fibrosis burden

      Study participants will be consented with pre-study data collection recorded. No
      randomization will occur as this is a cross-sectional study. Participants in both the cancer
      survivor and control groups will complete one study visit. No follow-up will be completed.
