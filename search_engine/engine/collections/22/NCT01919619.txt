      I. To assess the safety of lenalidomide in combination with ipilimumab in autologous and
      allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate. II. Overall survival, progression-free survival. III. Cumulative
      incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) with the competing risk of
      relapse in allogeneic transplant patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 of courses 1, 3, 5 and
      7. Beginning 1-3 days after the last dose of lenalidomide patients receive one dose of
      ipilimumab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes of courses 2, 4, 6 and 8. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36
      months.
