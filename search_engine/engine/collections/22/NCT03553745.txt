      emotional health over the past 25 years. Exposure to such stress can have profound
      longitudinal effects on well being, influencing risk for disease later in life. Physical
      exercise is linked to benefits across a variety of physical and psychological domains. While
      the affective and physiological consequences of exercise are well-documented, how they work
      to improve subjective well-being is unclear. It has been suggested that exercise promotes
      well-being by increasing interoception. The integrity of interoceptive networks is linked to
      resilience against depressive symptoms, whereas degradation of these networks is linked to
      apathy and deficits in emotion processing. The goal of this study is to compare two major
      styles of yoga and cardiovascular exercise through a 10-week training program to promote
      interoceptive awareness. The researchers hypothesize that improvement in affective
      symptomatology will be correlated with better interoceptive development. Changes in mood
      related symptoms and interoception will be assessed at baseline, week 12 and week 14, in a
      cohort of adults aged 18-55.
