      prior conducting the study. Subjects were given informed consent before enrolling the study
      and randomized into two groups (Vapocoolant spray group and eutectic mixture local
      anesthetics (EMLA) group). Intravenous (IV) cannulae with Ringer Acetate fluid, non-invasive
      blood pressure monitor, and pulse-oxymetry were set on the subjects in the operation room.
      Vital signs were recorded. Patients were positioned in sitting position and were instructed
      to flex their head and bend their back. Identification of intervertebral space L4-5 were
      performed. Asepsis and antisepsis procedure were performed. The Vapocoolant spray group
      received vapocoolant spray at a distance of 10 cm for 2 seconds and we waited for 10 seconds.
      The EMLA group received EMLA cream which consisted of 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5 % prilocaine in
      2 ml of water/oil emulsion and then they received tegaderm as the dressing for 45-60 minutes
      before the cream was wiped off. Spinal injection using 27G needle were performed after the
      intervention to each groups. Needle bevels were aligned parallel to dura fibres. Patients'
      visual analog score (VAS) and movements were recorded. Evaluation was only done in the first
      injection attempt, and was followed until the depth of the needle was around 5 mm. After the
      injection was successfully performed, patients' position were changed into supine position.
      Evaluation and recording were performed by person who was blinded from the intervention.
      Vital signs were recorded for every 3 minutes in the first 15 minutes, and then every 5
      minutes until the end of the procedure.
