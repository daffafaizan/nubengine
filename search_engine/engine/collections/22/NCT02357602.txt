      This study will consist of approximately 24 premenopausal healthy volunteer women between
      18-49 years of age with an intact cervix, uterus, and gastrointestinal tract. Women will be
      enrolled in the study within 42 days of screening depending on the timing of their menstrual
      cycle in comparison to the screening visit, and then will be on study for 14 days, with
      follow-up 1-14 days after the end of study sampling. All study visits will be conducted in
      the North Carolina Translational and Clinical Sciences (NCTraCS) Clinical Translational
      Research Center (CTRC) at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

      Procedures (methods):This is a Phase 1, single center, open-label, dose-ranging
      pharmacokinetic study of TFV and TFV-DP mucosal tissue concentrations measured after a single
      dose of GS-7340. Each arm is divided into three dosing groups: 5, 10, or 25mg. Participants
      will take a single dose of study drug within 7-14 days following the end of the subjects'
      menstrual period. Participants will be sequentially assigned to one of the three TAF doses
      and four biopsy schedules. Two women from each of the dosing groups will be assigned to one
      of four biopsy schedules for a total of 8 women per dosing group. Samples of blood plasma,
      cervicovaginal fluid (CVF), cervical tissue, vaginal tissue, and rectal tissue will be
      collected from participants at varying time points over the 14 days post-dose. Subjects will
      return to clinic within 14 days after the last sampling to complete a follow-up safety visit.
