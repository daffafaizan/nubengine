      recommend 6 to 12 months of INH for PPD (purified protein derivative)-positive individuals.
      Although the effectiveness of this treatment is not known for HIV-infected individuals,
      several studies using INH to prevent tuberculosis in presumably normal hosts have shown 60 to
      80 percent effectiveness. Problems with this treatment include compliance, adverse reaction,
      and the possibility of not preventing disease due to tuberculosis organisms being resistant
      to INH. A two-month preventive treatment plan should help in increasing compliance. In
      addition, the use of two drugs (rifampin / pyrazinamide) may help overcome problems with drug
      resistance. If this study shows equal or greater effectiveness of the two-month rifampin /
      pyrazinamide treatment, it could alter the approach to tuberculosis prevention for both
      HIV-positive and HIV-negative individuals.

      Patients are chosen by a random selection process to either the INH or the rifampin /
      pyrazinamide arm of the dose. Patients on the INH arm receive INH plus vitamin B6 (pyridoxine
      hydrochloride ) daily for 12 months. Patients on the other arm receive rifampin plus
      pyrazinamide for 60 days. Dosage of rifampin and pyrazinamide depends on weight of patient.
