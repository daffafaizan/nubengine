      extension study. For these patients, the final study visit in Study 3103 was visit 1 for this
      study (also referred to as the titration or adjustment baseline visit, depending on whether
      the patient was enrolled under the original or amended protocol, respectively). The original
      protocol was amended after 26 patients had been enrolled in the study. Those who were
      enrolled under the original protocol participated in a double-blind titration period of up to
      approximately 4 weeks followed by an open-label treatment period of 22 weeks. Those patients
      who were enrolled under the amended protocol participated in an open-label adjustment period
      of up to approximately 3 weeks followed by an open-label treatment period of 22 weeks.
