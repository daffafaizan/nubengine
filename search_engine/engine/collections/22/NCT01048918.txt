      be delivered to the Bruce Laboratory (Palo Alto Research Center) for immunolabeling and FAST
      scanning. The FAST scanning will utilize CK+, CD45-and DAPI+ labeling as well as cell
      morphology confirmed by collaborating pathologists to select for CTC with the technology
      allowing for assessment of up to four additional protein expressions on the surface of CTC's.
      Additional samples at the proposed time points will be placed on ice and sent over to the
      Wang Laboratory for the purpose of extracting RNA/microRNA and proteins from CTC's for
      profiling and further analysis. Benefits are only to society, not the individual. Knowledge
      obtained from applying the two technologies may help with better selection of therapy, early
      detection of progression, possibly better diagnosis and development of targeted therapeutic
      agents in the future.
