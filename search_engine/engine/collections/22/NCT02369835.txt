      I. To determine the proportion of patients who develop grade 3 radiation dermatitis (as
      defined by the Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System) as an adverse effect of
      radiation therapy or chemoradiation therapy for a head and neck cancer when initiating the
      use of prophylactic hypochlorite (HOCl) (modified Dakin's solution) at the start of therapy
      (experimental arm) compared to placebo (control arm).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (EXPERIMENTAL): Participants apply modified Dakin's solution (0.005% to 0.010%)
      topically to the skin of the arm up to 3 hours in advance of each radiation treatment.

      ARM II (CONTROL): Participants apply placebo solution (saline) topically to the skin of the
      arm up to 3 hours in advance of each radiation treatment.

      At the time that Stanford Radiation Dermatitis Scoring System (SRDSS) Grade E radiation
      dermatitis develops, the participant will transition to standard management for radiation
      dermatitis. SRDSS, by grade, is as follows.

        -  A. No skin change

        -  B. Faint, barely detectable erythema

        -  C. Follicular rash, hyperpigmentation, evolving erythema

        -  D. Dry desquamation, brisk erythema

        -  E. Moist desquamation

        -  F. Bleeding, ulceration, and/or infection

      SRDSS Grade E is roughly equivalent to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (CTCAE) Version 4.03 Grade 3 radiation dermatitis, "Moist desquamation in areas other than
      skin folds and creases; bleeding induced by minor trauma or abrasion."

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6 to 10 weeks.
