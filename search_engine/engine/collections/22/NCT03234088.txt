    
      This study will consist of: Specific Aim 1, Perform a pilot study to evaluate the initial
      performance of the wireless scale and symptom monitoring system on a select number of
      presumed normal volunteers (five). The purpose of this will be to determine design and
      process changes prior to the use of the device in subjects with chronic heart failure (HF).
      The investigators will have each normal volunteer (all part of the key research team) perform
      scenarios to test the performance of the system. Specific Aim 2 will incorporate changes into
      the prototype system adapting both the technology as well as the clinical workflows
      surrounding its use based on the information collected in Specific Aim 1. Specific Aim 3 will
      evaluate the revised system enrolling 40 volunteer subjects that have provided written
      voluntary consent with the documented primary diagnosis of HF (systolic or diastolic) to
      participate in the intervention over a 4-month period with the primary outcome measure being
      reduction in HF related ER visit or hospitalization.

      The objective of this study is to pilot test and refine a new home-based telemedicine health
      monitoring system that provides wireless, low cost measurement of body weight as well as
      self-reported responses, including symptoms and medication compliance for the purpose of
      managing chronic heart failure (HF) within the home. This pilot will test the functionality
      of the research infrastructure first on 5 healthy volunteers and then on 40 patients with
      heart failure over 4 months, testing the receipt of accurate input from the wireless scale
      and then assessing the effectiveness of the scale intervention in reducing ER visits and
      hospitalizations.
