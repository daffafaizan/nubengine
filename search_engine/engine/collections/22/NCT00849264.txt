      results in the formation of portal vein tumor thrombus (PVTT), which is a crucial factor that
      can worsen the prognosis of patients with PLC.

      In clinical, various treatments have been applied to improve this short-term prognosis, but
      there was no identical indication for treatment of PLC patients with different PVTT.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the surgical comprehensive treatment for different
      types of tumor thrombi in the portal vein for hepatocellular carcinoma patients, to establish
      a standardized, unified, effective therapeutic program.
