    
      This is a prospective, stratified, randomized, comparative, parallel group, Multi-center
      clinical trial comparing the proportion of ulcers completely healed by use of amniotic
      membrane graft (Amnioband)versus the standard protocol of wound care in diabetic patients
      with a diabetic foot ulcer with adequate arterial perfusion, for wound healing to the
      affected limb. The investigators will compare the proportion of ulcers completely healed by
      the amniotic membrane graft protocol of care to the standard protocol of care in the
      management of indolent diabetic ulcers at 6 weeks. In addition the investigators will compare
      the proportion of healing at 4 weeks, 12 weeks and, the mean time to healing, and the cost
      effectiveness of the two protocols of care. Mean time to healing will be measured by wound
      tracings.
