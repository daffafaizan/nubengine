    
      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label study to test the feasibility and
      acceptability (primary outcomes) and preliminary efficacy (secondary outcome) of a
      multi-component smoking-cessation intervention delivered by a tobacco treatment specialist
      (TTS) integrated in the multidisciplinary CF care team.

      The intervention will be tested in a two-group design with a 2:1 allocation. Participants
      (dyads of caregiver/CF child) will be randomized to either intervention or control group. The
      intervention group (N=24) will receive the multi-component intervention (intake assessment,
      follow-up, help with obtaining nicotine replacement therapy, and CF-specific smoke exposure
      education). The control group (N=12) will receive usual care plus CF-specific smoke exposure
      education.
