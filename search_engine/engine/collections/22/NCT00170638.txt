      accounting for 8 million cases and 3 million deaths annually. The impact of TB on children is
      particularly devastating in that children are more likely than adults to develop active TB
      following exposure to the bacterium, M. tuberculosis (Mtb) and once infected, children are
      much more likely than adults to develop disseminated disease, including miliary disease, bone
      and joint disease, and meningitis. These clinical differences likely reflect fundamental
      differences of the immune system of children and adults. The first specific aim of this study
      is to determine if severity of disease following Mtb infection in young children is
      associated with TH2-type immunity; and conversely, if absence of disease following Mtb
      infection is associated with TH1-type immunity by comparison of the magnitude and phenotype
      of Mtb-specific T cell responses in children less than or equal to 10 years old with:
      disseminated TB including miliary disease and meningitis; localized disease as defined by
      disease contained in the thoracic cavity (pulmonary, pleural, and cardiac), extrapulmonary
      lymph nodes (lymphadenitis), gastrointestinal tract, or bone (osteomyelitis); and latent Mtb
      infection (LTBI) defined as individuals with a positive Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) and
      without radiographic or clinical evidence of active tuberculosis. The second specific aim of
      this study is to determine if immunologic immaturity is associated with the development of
      TH2-type immunity following Mtb infection, and conversely if immunologic maturity is
      associated with the development of TH1-type immunity following Mtb infection by
      characterizing the magnitude and phenotype of Mtb-specific T cell responses in individuals
      with: localized disease; comparing 0-1 year olds, 2-4 year olds, 5-10 year olds, and adults;
      and LTBI; comparing 0-1 year olds, 2-4 year olds, 5-10 year olds, and adults. The data
      obtained from the present study may contribute to an improved understanding of TB immunity in
      children, which in turn may help in the development of a more effective TB vaccine for
      infants and young children. The number of participants is estimated to be 260 subjects to be
      enrolled over the course of 5 years.
