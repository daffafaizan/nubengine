      strabismus surgery in patients with both amblyopia and partially refractive esotropia (PAET).

      Material-Method: Amblyopic patients with PAET were enrolled. Non-amblyopic patients with full
      refractive accommodative esotropia (RAET) were included in the study as a control group.
      Preoperative and postoperative best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), spherical equivalent
      (SE), astigmatism, stereoacuity and deviations at near and distance were evaluated and
      statistically compared in the patient group. The mean BCVA, SE, astigmatism were compared
      between the patient and the control groups.
