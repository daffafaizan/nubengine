      Suspension delivered by the VR647 Inhalation System (AKITA JET) with either a mouthpiece or a
      facemask. Similarly, for all parts of the study, subjects in the comparator group will
      receive approved doses of budesonide (Pulmicort Respules®) delivered by a conventional jet
      nebulizer (PARI VIOS) with either a mouthpiece or a facemask.

      Part 1:

      Subjects who fulfill the enrollment criteria will progress to a comparative single dose,
      6-treatment, 6-period crossover trial. Subjects will receive 4 dose levels of VR647
      Inhalation Suspension delivered by the VR647 Inhalation System (AKITA JET) (5, 10, 15 and 25
      breaths, with targeted doses of 30, 60, 120 and 240 µg) and 2 dose levels of budesonide
      delivered by a conventional jet nebulizer (PARI VIOS) (0.5 and 1 mg). There will be a Washout
      Period between each dose of approximately 48 hours. Each subject will be randomized to
      treatment.

      Part 2:

      Following an approximate 7-day washout, the same cohort of subjects from Part 1 will progress
      to a comparative single dose, 6-treatment, 6-period crossover trial. There will be a Washout
      Period between each dose of approximately 48 hours. Each subject will be randomized to
      treatment in a 6-way crossover.

      Part 3:

      Subjects with mild asthma who fulfill the enrollment criteria (including those criteria
      specific to Part 3) will progress to a comparative single dose, 4-treatment, 4-period
      crossover trial conducted at a separate clinic from Parts 1 and 2. There will be a Washout
      Period between each dose of approximately 48 hours. This part of the trial can start before
      completion of Parts 1 and 2.
