      open-label (patients will know the identity of study treatments), multiple-dose,
      intra-patient sequential dose-escalation study with a planned enrollment of approximately 10
      patients. This study will consist of a screening period and a treatment period. Due to the
      intra-patient dose escalation, there will be multiple treatment periods consisting of 8 days
      each. A rest period of at least 7 days will separate each treatment period. Eligible patients
      will take study-defined replacement doses of hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. Abiraterone
      acetate oral suspension will be administered in daily escalating doses from 100 mg to 500 mg.
      Patients will proceed to the next higher dose level when the majority of the treated patients
      have a reduction in the androstenedione level. Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what the body
      does to a drug) and pharmacodynamic (study of the effects of a drug on the body) samples will
      be collected at each treatment period as detailed in the protocol. All patients who receive
      at least 1 dose of abiraterone acetate will be analyzed for safety.
