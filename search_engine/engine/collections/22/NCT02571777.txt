      design. A total of 3092 asthma patients were randomized into the 5 treatment groups with a
      randomization ratio of 1:1:1:1:1 (approximately 617 patients per treatment group): QVM149
      150/50/80 μg once daily (o.d.), QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d., QMF149 150/160 μg o.d. and QMF149
      150/320 μg o.d., all delivered via the Concept1 device, and salmeterol/fluticasone 50/500 μg
      twice daily (b.i.d.) delivered via Accuhaler. The 52 week treatment period was followed by a
      30-day Follow-up.

      The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate superiority of either QVM149 150/50/80
      μg o.d. to QMF149 150/160 μg o.d. or QVM149 150/50/160 μg o.d. to QMF149 150/320 μg o.d in
      terms of trough Forced Expiratory Volume in One Second (Trough FEV1) (FEV1) at Week 26, all
      delivered via Concept1.
