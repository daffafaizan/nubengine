      negative symptoms with once-weekly D-cycloserine treatment. In addition, investigators found
      significant improvement of memory consolidation following the first dose; however, the effect
      on memory consolidation was lost after several weeks. The "practice effect" of weekly
      measurement of memory consolidation using repeated administration of the Logical Memory Test
      may have resulted in a "ceiling effect" which would obscure drug/placebo differences. In the
      current study, investigators propose to administer the Logical Memory Test at four-week
      intervals (weeks 1, 4 and 8) to avoid the ceiling effect. Additionally a measurement will be
      added of negative symptoms at week 4 to better characterize the time course of negative
      symptom improvement.

      Hypotheses:

        1. Assess the effects of a single dose of D-cycloserine 50 mg on memory consolidation as
           measured by the Logical Memory Test compared to placebo.

        2. Assess the persistence of once-weekly D-cycloserine effects on memory consolidation
           measured at weeks 4 & 8.

        3. Assess the effects of repeated weekly dosing of D-cycloserine on performance on a
           standard cognitive battery at week 8 compared to placebo.

        4. Assess effects of weekly D-cycloserine dosing on negative symptoms at weeks 4 & 8
           compared to placebo.

        5. Assess tolerability and side effects of weekly D-cycloserine compared to placebo.
