    
      1. To establish a demographic database to evaluate the efficacy of medical interventions in
           patients and relatives who carry BRCA1 and 2 mutations and to compare these outcomes to
           patients who do not carry a BRCA1 or 2 mutation.

        2. To obtain blood samples from patients who undergo genetic testing to a) evaluate the
           incidence of genetic modifier polymorphisms involved in the development of cancer in
           BRCA1 and 2 mutation carriers and to compare this incidence to non-BRCA 1 and 2
           carriers. b) to understand the interaction of genetic modifiers and BRCA1 and 2 in the
           development of cancer. c) to determine the effect of environmental influences on the
           incidence of polymorphisms in genetic modifiers and on the penetrance of BRCA1 and 2
           mutations by linking information from our demographic database to blood samples and

        3. To obtain tumor tissue from BRCA1 and 2 carriers to utilize for gene expression studies.

        4. To establish a cohort of sporadic breast cancer patients, or women with no family
           history of cancer in a first degree relative, to serve as a comparison group to women
           with strong family history of breast cancer.

        5. To establish a cohort of healthy volunteers without personal or family history of cancer
           to serve as a comparison group to women with sporadic and familial breast cancer.
