      Achalasia is presumed to be due to neuronal dysfunction (active), however there are other
      variables such as muscle layer fibrosis (passive) that may contribute, particularly in milder
      or earlier achalasia variants. A new technology, impedance planimetry, may be able to measure
      active vs passive features of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).

      The prospective clinical trial will study muscle fibrosis in relation to LES measurements on
      Functional Lumen Imaging Probe (FLIP) Topography (the novel technology that utilizes
      impedance planimetry) after pharmacologic challenge designed to augment and remove the active
      component (edrophonium and atropine administration respectively) of LES tone. A better
      understanding of achalasia will allow intervention at an earlier stage, potentially with
      anti-fibrosis agents or anti-inflammatory agents and improve treatment outcomes.
