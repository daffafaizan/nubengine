      SARS-CoV-2 associated micro clotting results into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
      and death. This micro-clotting cascade supports the potential role of anticoagulants like
      aspirin, heparin in the clinical management of COVID-19 patients. Other areas that could be
      considered for potential treatment of COVID-19 include drugs and analogues of drugs that have
      demonstrated potential in-vitro and or in-vivo activity against SARS-CoV-2 like
      hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin, lopinavir/ritonavir and remdesivir and ivermectin.
      Ivermectin has demonstrated broad-spectrum anti-viral activity and inhibition of the
      causative virus (SARS-CoV-2) with ability to cause a 5000-fold reduction in viral RNA within
      48hrs.

      Although aspirin and ivermectin do not exhibit any synergistic or potentiation at cellular
      level, a clinical additive effect resulting from combination therapy with low dose aspirin
      and ivermectin is plausible. There is no documented drug-drug interactions or other
      biological basis that contra-indicate co-administration of low dose aspirin and ivermectin.

      We therefore propose, to explore the clinical use of combination anticoagulant: lower dose
      aspirin and the FDA-approved anti-parasitic drug: ivermectin, in treatment of COVID-19
      patients in an exploratory randomized trial.
