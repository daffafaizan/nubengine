      proprioception, strength and functional motor performance. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate long-term effects of foam rolling with healthy participants. Study group will
      receive foam rolling exercise actively by themselves on elbow.

      Foam rolling exercise will be applied 10 times each for 1 minute. These exercises will be
      performed as 2 sets. After each set will be a resting period for 30 seconds.A total of 12
      sessions of exercise will be performed three times a week. Second evaluation will be
      performed after 4 weeks. Then the follow up evaluation (third evaluation) will be performed 4
      weeks later. Control group will receive no foam rolling exercise. They will be handed a
      brochure about the proprioception and its role in injury prevention and foam rolling. Control
      group will be evaluated for the first time. Afterwards, second evaluation will be performed
      after 4 weeks and follow up after 4 more weeks.
