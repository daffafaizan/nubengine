      participants diagnosed with knee OA grades II and III, aged 40 and 65 years and BMI <30 kg /
      m2 were randomly divided into two groups: participants underwent training (trained group -
      TG) and not subjected to training ( untrained group - NTG). The participants trained group
      will undergo a periodized CT protocol of 14 weeks load progression, 3 times a week, with
      sessions last 15 minutes in the first weeks and will arrive 35 minutes in final weeks, and
      added 10 minutes between heating and cooling down. All subjects will conduct pre and post CT
      variables: IMAT thigh (computed tomography); body composition (Dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry - DXA), inflammatory biomarker concentrations: IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, TNF-α,
      leptin and adiponectin and joint degradation biomarkers (uCTX-II and sCOMP), performance
      tests functional (six-minute walk, 30 seconds chair stand test and stair climb test), muscle
      strength (maximum voluntary isometric contraction - MVIC), WOMAC and KOOS questionnaires, and
      catastrophizing pain scale. During the training protocol, uCTX-II variables, sCOMP and MVIC
      will also be evaluated. To compare the groups will be applied the unpaired t-test. When found
      significant main effects, the Bonferroni test will be used to identify the statistically
      significant differences. To compare the collections times (pre, during and post TC) for
      uCTX-II variables, sCOMP and MVIC will be held repeated measures ANOVA with post hoc
      Bonferroni, and the WOMAC variables, KOOS, DXA, IMAT, functional testing and inflammatory
      cytokines (pre and post CT) will be held the paired t test. A significance level of 5% (p ≤
      0.05) will be adopted.
