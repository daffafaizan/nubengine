      routine part of the anesthesia for elective Cesarean section. Ephedrine is a medication that
      is widely used in labor and in vaginal and operative (Cesarean section) deliveries to help
      maintain a woman's blood pressure within its normal range, especially after spinal and
      epidural anesthesia has been administered. The purpose of this study is to determine if
      ephedrine, when given intramuscularly (<IM> as a shot in the muscle), at the time of spinal
      anesthesia administration, can help to decrease the incidence of nausea and vomiting subjects
      experience during and after a Cesarean section. This study will compare women who receive
      ephedrine to a similar group of women who receive a normal saline placebo. In addition to
      looking at the difference in the incidence of nausea and vomiting perioperatively, this study
      will also evaluate if the administration of IM ephedrine helps the baby to receive more blood
      from the placenta after anesthesia has been administered to the mother. This will be
      evaluated by performing a simple blood test, drawn from the umbilical cord, after the baby is
      born.
