      in our Diabetes in Pregnancy Program (DIPP). Perinatologists managing the patient in DIPP
      determine when patients need further treatment with medical therapy. Patients undergoing care
      at DIPP may require medical intervention in the following clinical scenarios: failure of diet
      alone to control glycemic indices and grossly abnormal glucose tolerance screening test
      results suggesting disease of such severity that diet alone would not be sufficient. After
      verbally counseling the patient, she will be recruited for the study by the investigators. An
      extensive explanation of the objectives of the study will be presented to the patient, as
      well as written copies of the protocol and consent. After informed consent is given, patients
      will be randomized to management with either insulin NPH or detemir together with rapid
      acting insulin aspart (Novolog) with meals, as necessary. The primary outcome will be level
      of glycemic control defined as overall mean blood glucose in pregnancy. This is a well
      established measure of overall glycemic control that has been used in numerous publications
      in the obstetric literature on diabetes in pregnancy. Participants will be followed until
      they deliver, with an expected range of 6-16 weeks depending on when the patient was enrolled
      in the study. The mean glucose will be determined by the sum of average glucose at each visit
      divided by the number of visits).
