      the lipopolysaccharride moiety (LPS) induces measurable immune responses. With an inhaled
      single dose of 20 micron, the inflammatory response in man is sub-clinical. During
      bronchoprovocation tests with allergens, the particle size determines to a large extent the
      intensity of the response. the response to LPS as a function of particle size is not known
      and will be studied in this study.
