      Î² -cells. Stem cells are primitive cells capable of differentiating into mature cells of the
      body of various lineages. Stem cells can be obtained from various sources like blastocyst
      (embryonal stem cells), umbilical cord or bone marrow. There is an evidence to suggest that
      stem cell transplantation can lead to improvement in pancreatic endocrine function and
      improvement in glycemic control in diabetic mice through various mechanisms such as
      transdifferentiation or regeneration of endothelial cell in the damaged islets which in turn
      lead to regeneration of islet cells by paracrine action. However, till date there is no study
      that demonstrates that stem cell therapy can be effective in patients with T2DM for their
      glycemic control.

      The investigators propose to carry out autologous bone marrow - derived stem cell
      transplantation (ABMSCT) in patients of T2DM, obtained from their own bone marrow and its
      superselective injection into the gastroduodenal artery after purification without any
      immunosuppressive regimen.
