      when they walk, which usually subsides with rest. This is known as intermittent claudication
      (IC) and is caused by a reduced blood supply to the legs as a result of narrowed or hardened
      arteries that supply the lower limbs. This ambulatory pain impedes on activities of daily
      living, functional capacity and quality of life.

      NICE clinical guidance recommends a 12-week supervised exercise programme as first-line
      treatment for IC, whereby patients are encouraged to walk to the point of maximal pain.
      Robust clinical trials have demonstrated that supervised exercise programmes are efficacious
      for improving both pain-free and maximal walking distances, whilst also potentially improving
      quality of life.

      Despite this, supervised exercise programmes are vastly under-utilised and not always
      available to consultant vascular surgeons. This means that further programmes need to be
      developed in order to provide a range of options to patients to improve uptake and adherence
      rates. One such programme is a 6-week high-intensity interval training programme.

      An initial observational cohort study of the 6 week HIIT programme will be conducted to
      determine to determine the feasibility of the intervention and inclusion criteria. The
      results from this will be used to make any necessary changes to the HIIT intervention before
      moving into a proof of concept study, considering the utility, safety, acceptability and
      potential clinical efficacy of this programme.
