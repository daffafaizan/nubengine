      century. Nonetheless, it's use during lumbar puncture in adults has only been investigated in
      a single-centre study.

      Thus, this study is designed to evaluate the analgesic effect of N2O on the pain induced
      during lumbar puncture.

      Patients with scheduled lumbar puncture realized for diagnosis purposes will be randomized in
      2 groups. One group will inhale N2O for the 5 minutes before the puncture and during the rest
      of the procedure. The second group will inhale compressed air during the same period of time.
      Neither the investigator realizing the lumbar puncture, nor the patient will know which type
      of gaz they are inhaling (double-blinding).

      The maximal pain level that occurred during the procedure will be evaluated on a Numerical
      Rating Scale (NRS). NRS will also be used to evaluate the maximal anxiety induced by the
      procedure.
