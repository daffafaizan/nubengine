    
      There are 2 ways you can participate in the study.

      OPTION 1 involves 6 one-hour visits to the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) Andrology
      Clinic over a 9 month period. At each visit you would be asked to fill out questionnaires and
      to provide a urine, semen, and blood sample. Following Visit 2, you are asked to switch your
      brand of mesalamine medication. After 4 months, you change back to your original brand of
      medication. The change in medication will be done in consultation with your primary GI
      doctor. If the cost of co-payment is greater for the new brand of medication, we will provide
      compensation to cover the difference. In the case you do not have prescription drug health
      insurance coverage, the study will reimburse up to $4000 to cover the cost for Asacol,
      Pentasa or Lialda medication taken during your study participation.

      OPTION 2 involves 4 one-hour visits to MGH Andrology clinic. At each visit you complete
      questionnaires and provide a blood, urine and semen sample. You are eligible for Option 2 if
      you are currently taking Asacol or Asacol HD and do not want to change your medication.
