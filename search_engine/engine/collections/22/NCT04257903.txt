      temporomandibular disorder. Patients suffer from pain and muscle tenderness and may present
      with or without restricted mouth opening. The etiology of myofascial pain dysfunction
      syndrome is multifactorial including psychological factors, occlusion imbalance, and
      parafunctional habits. Treatments for myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome include education,
      self-care, physical therapy, use of intra-oral appliances, short-term pharmacotherapy,
      behavioral therapy, and relaxation techniques.

      Temporomandibular disorder is most often treated using occlusal splints safely to reduce
      temporomandibular joint load, and subsequently, clinical symptoms, as a reversible therapy.
      Occlusal splints need to be used for at least three months to eliminate temporomandibular
      disorders.

      One of physical therapy is laser treatment. Laser treatment on tissues provides a clinical
      effect called biostimulation, where the basic mechanism occurs at the molecular level.

      The low-level laser has non-invasive and inoffensive characteristics at appropriate
      parameters.
