      Primary

        -  Determine the complete response rate in patients with biochemically-relapsed,
           hormone-sensitive prostate cancer treated with docetaxel.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to PSA recurrence in patients receiving this treatment.

        -  Determine the time to metastatic disease in patients receiving this treatment.

        -  Determine the time to androgen independent state in patients receiving this treatment.

        -  Determine the time to death from any cause in patients receiving this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      4-6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
