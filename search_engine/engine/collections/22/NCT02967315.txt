      with changes in preload, using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). Based on an intensive
      research and clinical observations the investigators hypothesize that changes in volume
      status cause a statistically significant difference in the Cardiovascular magnetic resonance
      (CMR) measured RV End Diastolic Volume (EDV), end-systolic volume (ESV), ejection fraction
      (EF) and pulmonary regurgitation (PR). The investigator hypothesizes that smaller changes
      will occur in left ventricular LV EDV, ESV, and EF.

        1. To establish a correlation between the changes in preload volume status and RV size and
           function in patients with free pulmonary insufficiency (PI) after TOF repair using CMRI.

        2. To assess the effects of preload status on the measured severity of pulmonary
           regurgitation (PR).

        3. To assess the effects of preload status on the left ventricular (LV) size

      This study will be conducted in compliance with this protocol, good clinical practice and the
      applicable regulatory requirements.
