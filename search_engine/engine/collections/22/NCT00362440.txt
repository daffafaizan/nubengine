      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication, and is thus very effective in reducing
      disease-associated morbidity and mortality in this patient population. However, HAART also
      results in the development of a lipodystrophic syndrome which is characterized by fat
      accumulation, fat wasting, or a combination of both, and similar to congenital forms of
      lipodystrophy, is associated with components of the metabolic syndrome, including insulin
      resistance (IR), fasting hypertriglyceridemia, and hypercholesterolemia.

      Our study is a "proof of concept" study on the treatment of the HAART-induced metabolic
      syndrome, which builds upon and represents a direct extension of a study previously funded by
      the American Diabetes Association (ADA). If our clinical trial proves that a combination
      treatment of leptin and an insulin sensitizer has additive or synergistic effects in
      reversing the metabolic abnormalities of HIV positive patients with lipoatrophy, it could
      lead to the design of larger multi-center, randomized, placebo-controlled trial(s) aiming at
      establishing safety and efficacy of this treatment for the HAART-induced metabolic syndrome.
