      thermal, chemical and evaporative stimuli. There are several types of desensitizing agents,
      used to aid in the control of this pathology, but they are not very effective and have short
      longevity. The agents based on potassium oxalate have been used by dental surgeons because
      they have mixed action, both neural and obliterating. Therefore, the aim of this study is
      through a triple blind randomized clinical trial (split-mouth), evaluate the longevity and
      efficacy of two products potassium oxalate-based in two concentrations, 10% and 5%.
      Thirty-two with DH at least 2 teeth and adequate oral hygiene will be randomly divided into
      two different groups according to the desensitization approach (10% and 5%) The dentin
      hypersensitivity level will be evaluated immediately after desensitization and after 1, 2 and
      3. Data will be collected, tabulated and submitted to statistical analysis.
