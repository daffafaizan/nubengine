    
      Nocturnal Enuresis is a very common and difficult to treat problem in the pediatric
      population which can have significant negative impact on a child's quality of life. Apart
      from medications which can have significant side effects limiting their use, there is a lack
      of effective and safe treatment options for children with frequent nocturnal enuresis. If
      foot stimulation prior to bed does indeed improve the frequency of nocturnal enuresis, it may
      provide a safe and non-invasive therapeutic option.
