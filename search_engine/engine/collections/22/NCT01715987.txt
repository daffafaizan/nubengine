    
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety use of ETV and TDF after at
      least 144 weeks of treatment in terms of the effects of renal tubular function as determined
      by (1) 24 hours Urine phosphate (wasting is >1200 mg daily); (2) 24 hours
      β2-microglobulinuria (NL β2-microglobulin level, <1 mg daily); (3) fractional excretion of
      uric acid, and (4) fractional tubular reabsorption of phosphorus.

      The secondary objectives are to evaluate:

        1. To evaluate compare the anti-viral effects of both TDF and ETV as determined the
           percentage of patient who achieve HBV DNA levels below 60 IU/mL (by quantitative HBV DNA
           PCR test with lowest level of detection at 60 IU/mL) and ALT normalization by routine
           biochemical test after 144 weeks of treatment.

        2. Serological responses including percentage of patients with HBeAg loss or seroconversion
           and HBsAg loss or seroconversion with TDF and ETV treatment in Asian-American adults
           with CHB infection.

        3. To evaluate the three-year (one year treatment before enrollment and two year treatment
           after enrollment) the percentage of patient with anti-HBV drug resistance of TDF and
           ETV, including genotypic mutations in Asian-American adults with CHB.
