      prognostic scores in limited. This study proposes to establish a deep learning algorithms of
      multiparametric MRI radiomics and nomogram for identifying lymph node metastasis and
      prognostic prediction of breast cancer. The study will investigate the relationship between
      the radiomics and the tumor microenvironment. The study includes the construction of
      multiparametric MRI radiomics-based prediction model and the validation of the prediction
      model.
