      I. To assess incidence of major molecular response (MMR) at 12 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess progression free survival (PFS) at 12 and 24 months.

      II. To assess accelerated phase (AP) or blast phase (BP) transformation-free survival at 12
      and 24 months.

      III. To assess incidence of deep MRs (≥ MR⁴) at 12 months and 24 months.

      IV. To assess safety.

      V. To assess patient reported outcomes (PRO).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess prognostic significance of detecting aberrant myeloid or lymphoid markers on
      diagnostic bone marrow.

      II. To assess ability to enroll subjects who maintain deep molecular remissions in tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors (TKIs) discontinuation trials.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) once a day (QD) or nilotinib PO twice a day (BID) at
      the discretion of the treating hematologist. Patients achieving either a 1 log reduction at 3
      months or a 2 log reduction at 6 months in their breakpoint cluster region-abelson murine
      leukemia viral oncogene homolog 1 (BCR-ABL1) transcript levels may switch to imatinib
      mesylate PO QD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and then up to 60
      months.
