    
      This study is a prospective, randomized, open, 2-arm, national multi-center study to evaluate
      the value of rituximab in humoral chronic rejection after renal transplantation in
      approximately 150-200 patients (75-100 patients each group).

      All biopsies will be analysed by Prof. Groene (Heidelberg) and the results immediately
      communicated to the central managing unit (Munich). Upon receipt, patients with biopsy proven
      CAN with C4d+ and/or plasma-cells and/or B-lymphocytes within the last 4 weeks before
      inclusion (centrally confirmed), fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be
      randomized 1:1 into one of the 2 groups:

      Arm 1: Treatment with rituximab Arm 2: Treatment without rituximab Recruitment will last for
      approximately one year. All patients will be treated with baseline medication of Tacrolimus,
      MMF, steroids (optional, with same dose as given before study entry) and ACE-inhibitor or
      AT1-receptor-antagonist. A single dose of 100 mg Methylprednisolone i.v. will be given at
      baseline (day 0) in both groups (in the rituximab group 30 min before start of the rituximab
      infusion).

      Each patient will be followed for 1 year within protocol, with study visits at 1,3,7 and 14
      days (rituximab group), 3, 6 and 12 months followed by a follow-up period of 1 year with a
      study visit at 24 months.
