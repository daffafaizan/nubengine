      of global deaths, killing 17.1 million people worldwide each year, accounting for 31% of the
      world's total deaths. Heart disease is the second leading cause of death in China. Coronary
      artery disease (CAD) is the majority, and coronary artery disease is the most common
      cardiovascular disease. Good self-management can reduce disease risk factors and improve
      related prognosis. It is also an important issue in health promotion around the world. This
      article uses the smart medical case management tracking system, combined with various
      terminal devices to fully record the measured data (pulse, blood pressure) for case home care
      tracking to prevent the occurrence and deterioration of the disease. Therefore, with the
      promotion of the eHealth medical staff and members of the family can instantly grasp the
      health of the body and cultivate the habits of self-health management and enhance the quality
      of care. Therefore, we hope to use the Smart Health Cloud as an interventional measure to
      improve the care of patients with coronary artery disease, improve self-management ability
      and quality of life.
