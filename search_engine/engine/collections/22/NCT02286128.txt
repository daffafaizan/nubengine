      underlined higher RAGE activation and osteoblast differentiation defect demonstrated in the
      MSC of type 2 diabetes, as well as the effects of the proinflammation on cellular
      differentiation and apoptosis of the MSC. Type 2 diabetes was known to be in proinflammatory
      state due to NF-кB-dependent cytokine secretion (for example, TNF-α, IL1 and IL6), which in
      turn contribute to NF-кB upregulation. Because RAGE expression is partly regulated by NF-кB
      signal, the NF-кB upregulation in proinflammatory state observed in type 2 diabetes may
      entail RAGE overactivation in this population. Therefore, the proinflammatory state and its
      correlation to cellular NF-кB-dependent RAGE activation is noteworthy to be determined in the
      MSC of type 2 diabetes. Furthermore, the effect of proinflammation on differentiation
      potential and apoptosis of the MSC in type 2 diabetes remains to be elucidated.
