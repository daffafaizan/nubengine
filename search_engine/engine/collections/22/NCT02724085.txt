    
      Up to seven cohorts of eight subjects each (up to a total of 56 subjects) will be enrolled.
      The eight subjects within each cohort will be randomized 6:2 to receive a single intravenous
      dose of TP-271 or placebo. The planned doses are:

      Cohort A: 0.15 mg/kg Cohort B: 0.45 mg/kg Cohort C: 1.0 mg/kg Cohort D: 2.0 mg/kg Cohort E:
      3.0 mg/kg Cohort F: 4.0 mg/kg Cohort G: 5.0 mg/kg

      Doses of IMP will be administered intravenously on the morning of Day 1 following an
      overnight fast (minimum 8 hours).

      During the Screening Period (within the 28 days prior to the subject receiving TP-271 or
      placebo) each subject will be assessed for eligibility. Each subject must sign and date an
      ICF prior to undergoing any study-related procedures.

      All cohorts will follow the same study design (Figure 1). On Day -1, subjects will be
      admitted to the study unit so their eligibility can be confirmed. Subjects will be required
      to stay overnight at the study unit on Day -1. On Day 1, eligible subjects will be enrolled
      and randomized to receive either TP-271 or placebo. Subjects will be required to stay at the
      study unit from Day 1 through Day 5 to assess safety and obtain required PK samples. On Day
      5, subjects will be discharged from the study unit. A final safety assessment will be
      performed once between Day 7 and Day 10 following the subject's dose of IMP.
