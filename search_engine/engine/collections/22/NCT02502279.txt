      Alveolar recruitment manoeuvers recruit collapsed alveoli, increase gas exchange, and improve
      arterial oxygenation. However, the effect of recruitment manoeuvre is short lasting and does
      not extend to the post operative period. Postoperative CPAP keeps the lung open and can
      improve oxygenation in the early postoperative period.
