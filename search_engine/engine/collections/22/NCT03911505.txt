      30-day safety follow-up period, for a total duration of approximately 14 months. Subjects who
      complete this study may have an opportunity to enroll in a separate long-term extension
      study.

      Pediatric subjects will be treated every other week with oral AT2221 followed by ATB200 IV.
      Subjects will undergo PK assessments at Day 1, Week 26, and Week 52.

      Safety assessments include monitoring of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, physical
      examinations, vital signs, echocardiograms, 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and detection of
      ATB200 antibodies. Efficacy assessments include evaluation of ambulatory function (6-Minute
      Walk Test [6MWT]); motor function tests; muscle strength; pulmonary function tests;
      Patient-reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMISÂ®) for dyspnea, fatigue,
      physical functioning, and upper extremity; Gross Motor Function Measure-88 Items (GMFM-88);
      Pompe-pediatric Evaluation of Disability Inventory (PompePedi); Subject/Physician Global
      Impression of Change (SGIC/PGIC); Visual Analog Scale (VAS) for pain assessment, and time to
      initiation of use of assistive device. The patient-reported outcomes are to be completed if
      available. Pharmacodynamic (PD) assessments include measurement of serum creatine kinase (CK)
      levels and urinary hexose tetrasaccharide (Hex4) levels.
