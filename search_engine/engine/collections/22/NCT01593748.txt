      Pazopanib compared with Gemcitabine and Docetaxel in participants with soft tissue sarcoma.
      Screening tests will be done to ensure subjects are eligible to participate in this study. If
      the exams, tests and procedures show that subjects can be in the study, and they choose to
      take part, then they will be "randomized" into one of the two study groups: Group 1 or Group
      2. Subjects in Group 1 will receive Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 intravenously (directly into a
      vein) on Day 1 and Day 8 and Pazopanib 800mg by mouth daily. Subjects in Group 2 will receive
      Gemcitabine 900 mg/m2 intravenously on Day 1 and Day 8 and Docetaxel 100 mg/m2 intravenously
      on Day 8. Both groups will be in 21 day cycles. Both groups will be asked to complete
      "quality of life" questionnaires, on their first visit, then at 6 weeks (2nd cycle), 18 weeks
      (6th cycle) and at the end of study treatment. Subjects will be followed for up to 2 years.
