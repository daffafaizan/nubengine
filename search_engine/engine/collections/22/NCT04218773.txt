      criteria. In stage 1 of the study, the investigators will monitor beat-to-beat blood pressure
      and other hemodynamic parameters in 20 patients receiving standard of care therapy. For the
      second stage, the investigators will enroll an additional 20 patients who will receive blood
      pressure augmentation therapy using intravenous fluids and phenylephrine or norepinephrine
      infusion. The investigators will increase baseline systolic blood pressure by 20% to at least
      160 mmHg until blood vessel recanalization is achieved or the thrombectomy procedure is
      completed. The study will assess how quickly a target blood pressure can be reached in the
      acute stroke setting, and furthermore the ability to successfully maintain these blood
      pressure targets throughout the intervention and avoid hypotension during conscious sedation
      or general anesthesia. The primary research hypothesis of the trial is that treatment failure
      defined as an inability to achieve and maintain blood pressure targets despite the use of
      maximum tolerable doses of vasopressors (phenylephrine or norepinephrine) occurs in less than
      20% of cases. In addition, the study will evaluate the recruitment feasibility and
      preliminary safety of blood pressure augmentation.
