      Infection or other obvious causes must be excluded. The overactive bladder is loss of
      inhibition of the detrusor muscle during the filling or emptying of the bladder.

      Specific receptors and neurotransmitters have role in development of overactive bladder.
      These includes adrenergic, cholinergic, non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic receptors and
      interstitial cells.

      Nerve growth factor (NGF-R) receptors are between the detrusor muscle fibers and can cause
      afferent signals. Metabolic syndrome and obesity have been advocated to be risk factors for
      the development of overactive bladder. The investigators believe that our findings will shed
      light on treatment.
