      Haukeland University Hospital within the specified age range (children: 2 to less than 18
      years old and adults >18-59 years old) will receive an invitation to join the study. The
      primary endpoints of the trial are the evaluation of the systemic and local immune response
      after live attenuated influenza vaccine. The vaccine specific immune response will be
      assessed through the induction of specific local and systemic antibody and cellular immune
      responses, and analyses of the epitopes to which the response is directed. Furthermore the
      capacity of the vaccine to elicit cross reactive and long lasting immunity will be evaluated.
