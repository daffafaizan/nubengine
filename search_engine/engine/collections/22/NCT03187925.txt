      will provide a large cohort using standardized diagnostic studies, diverticulum size
      measurements, treatment approaches, pre-operative and post-operative assessment of symptoms
      in order to both compare the effectiveness of the procedures and to stratify the patients in
      order to determine whether demographics such as age, pre-operative size, and/or
      peri-operative co-morbidities influence outcomes.
