    
      This study will be conducted on patients with monostotic unilateral craniofacial fibrous
      dysplasia affecting zone I (fronto-orbital, zygomatic, and upper maxillary regions).

      I. Preoperative preparation

        1. Virtual planning Computed tomography (CT) will be performed for the skull using a
           multi-slice helical CT machine. Computed tomography DICOM (digital Imaging and
           Communication in Medicine) files will be imported to the 3D surgical planning software
           (Mimics 10.0, Materialise NV, Leuven, Belgium). Using the software and through a series
           of segmentation and simulation processes, area of interest will be virtually selected
           and separated. Finally, the virtual image of the surgical guide will be reconstructed.

        2. Rapid prototyping Stereolithographic (STL) files of the virtual image will be exported
           to multi-jet modelling printing machine (InVision Si2, 3D Systems e Rock Hill, SC) and
           will be fabricated using plastic material (VisiJet SR 200, 3D Systems e Rock Hill, SC).

      II. Surgical procedures Area of interest for all patients will be exposed using the
      hemicoronal, and maxillary intraoral vestibular incisions. The surgical guide(s) will be
      seated in position on the affected side. Bone removal will be performed through the guide
      according to the preoperative planning. The bone removal will be then performed to connect
      the guiding holes using surgical burs. Finally, the incisions will be sutured after soft
      tissue suspension.

      III. Follow up Postoperative CT will be performed for postoperative assessment. After 1 week
      patients will be recalled for suture removal and clinical assessment. Then the patients will
      be recalled 1, 3 months for further assessment.
