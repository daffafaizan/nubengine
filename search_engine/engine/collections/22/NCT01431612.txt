      and surgery, but experiments in conscious sheep indicate that the renal fluid clearance might
      approach a normal rate when the adrenergic balance is modified.

      METHODS Sixty females (mean age, 32 years) undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery were
      randomized to control group and received only the conventional anesthetic drugs and 20 ml/kg
      of lactated Ringer's over 30 min. The others were also given an infusion of 50 µg/kg/min of
      esmolol (beta1-receptor blocker) or 0.01 µg/kg/min of phenylephrine (alpha1-adrenergic
      agonist) over 3 hours. The distribution and elimination of infused fluid was studied by
      volume kinetic analysis based on urinary excretion and blood Hgb level.
