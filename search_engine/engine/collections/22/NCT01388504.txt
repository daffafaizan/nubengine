      every year. Although substantial progress has been made in reducing the infarct size by
      prompt opening of the infarct related artery (with thrombolytic therapy or percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI)), effective therapy to further reduce the infarct size would
      substantially reduce the risk of the patient subsequently developing heart failure.

      There is a growing body of evidence from studies in animals that the use of nitrites may help
      in reducing the infarct size, although this has not been tested in man.

      In this phase 2/3 study, the investigators propose to investigate the effect of sodium
      nitrite injection on infarct size. Eligible patients will be males aged 18 and over and
      females aged 55 and over, presenting within 12 hours of the onset of chest pain, who are
      suitable for treatment with percutaneous coronary intervention. Those who give verbal
      agreement to take part will receive a 2.5-5 minute injection of sodium nitrite (or placebo)
      immediately prior to the blocked artery being opened with percutaneous coronary intervention.
