      inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are considered the standard of
      care in treatment of Proteinuric Chronic Kidney Disease. However, these agents lead to
      incomplete renal protection. The purpose of the study is to investigate the antiproteinuric
      effect of adding Dapagliflozin to the standard of care in children with proteinuria. In this
      study, participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive ACEI+Dapagliflozin (5mg or 10mg,
      based on body weight) or ACEI only once daily for 24 weeks. Prespecified outcomes includes
      changes in 24-hr proteinuria, albumin, eGFR (estimated glomerular filtration rate), blood
      pressure, body weight and so on.
