      of the digestive and airway tracts. The procedure is typically conducted for cases of
      laryngeal cancer and intractable aspiration. Following this procedure, patients are no longer
      at risk for aspiration; however some patients continue to experience difficulties in
      propulsion of food or drink throughout the pharynx. Previous research has demonstrated a
      reduction in pharyngeal contractile pressure and increased pharyngeal transit time in
      patients post laryngectomy. Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) may assist bolus
      propulsion in these patients by increasing pressure in the direction of bolus flow. This
      study aims to evaluate the utility of a CPAP mask to improve pharyngeal swallow outcomes
      during Video Fluoroscopic Swallowing Exam (VFSE) in patients with dysphagia following total
      laryngectomy. This specific population could be well-suited for this application, since the
      digestive tract and airway are completely separate and there is no risk of the aspiration
      into the airway.
