      for a screening session. Participants who meet study criteria will participate in two study
      sessions separated by at least two weeks. The sessions will be identical except on one day
      they will receive guanfacine and on the other, they will receive a placebo.

      This study was initially completed in 2014. Upon analysis of the collected data, it was
      decided to add additional subjects and gather additional data to verify results seen in the
      collected data. The study was reopened and new data was added beginning in September 2016.
      Information about the study beginning in 2016 is available in a separate record.
