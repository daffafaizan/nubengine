      Primary

        -  To identify novel biomarkers of disease that would help in the initial diagnosis of
           myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).

      Secondary

        -  To understand the genesis of anemia in cancers.

        -  To identify novel biomarkers of disease that predict progression of MDS to acute myeloid
           leukemia.

      OUTLINE: Blood and bone marrow samples are collected. Hemopoietic stem cells (HSC) and
      progenitor cells are isolated from samples for analysis. Some of these HSC and progenitor
      cells are used for functional assays. From the rest of the cells, DNA, RNA, and protein is
      extracted for molecular analyses, including gene mutation analysis, gene methylation assays,
      chromatin immunoprecipitation, microarray, and real-time polymerase chain reaction.
