        -  Assess the frequency and degree of hypoxia as measured by etanidazole derivative EF5
           binding in patients with stage I, II, or III non-small cell lung cancer.

        -  Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with potential serum/plasma markers and
           tissue markers of hypoxia in these patients.

        -  Correlate hypoxia as measured by EF5 binding with tumor angiogenesis and apoptosis in
           these patients.

        -  Correlate tumor perfusion with hypoxia in these patients.

        -  Correlate tumor perfusion with microvessel density in tumor samples in these patients.

        -  Determine the longevity of EF5 adducts in human lung tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease stage (stage I or II vs stage III vs no
      stage I-III determined after pathologic staging).

      Within 24-48 hours prior to the planned surgical procedure, patients receive etanidazole
      derivative EF5 IV over 1-2.5 hours. Tumor hypoxia is then measured using an intraoperative
      Eppendorf needle electrode during surgical biopsy or resection. Tumor specimens are tested
      for EF5 binding using immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry.

      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-60 patients (20 with stage I/II disease, 20 with stage III
      disease, and 20 without stage I-III disease) will be accrued for this study.
