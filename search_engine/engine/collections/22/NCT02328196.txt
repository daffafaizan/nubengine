      and rehabilitative settings by testing it for fit against a multidimensional Rasch model.

      Participants in this research will be 500 dysphagic clients from several centres in Denmark,
      namely 250 acute patients from three Danish Regional university Hospitals in Herning,
      Hjørring and Odense, and 250 clients in the rehabilitation setting from the Århus
      Rehabilitation Institute, Hillerød Rehabilitation Institute and the Rehabilitation division
      of Copenhagen.

      Participants who are judged to have a swallowing problem are assessed with the MISA-DK by
      special educated occupational therapists The MISA-DK assessment are implemented as a part of
      the usual assessment routine at the occupational therapy departments at the included centres
      and will be administered immediately after referral to Occupational therapy. This research
      will be the first to implement and assess a standardised method for assessing mealtime
      performance for dysphagia in dysphagic patients across the continuum of diagnosis and
      rehabilitation recovery.

      The application of the Multidimensional Rasch models to the MIS-DK data aims to identify the
      combination of items in the MISA-DK that provide the highest level of specific objectivity
      and statistical sufficiency when determining ingestive skill ability. Furthermore,
      Differential item function by diagnosis, age and setting will be determined.
