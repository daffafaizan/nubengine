      exists comparing the acceptability of colesevelam HCl powder for oral suspension formulation
      versus other bile acid sequestrant powder formulations. A Bile Acid Sequestrant Acceptability
      (BASA) Scale was developed and validated as an instrument to compare the acceptability of
      different bile acid sequestrant preparations
