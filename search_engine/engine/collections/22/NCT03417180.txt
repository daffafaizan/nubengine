      influences quality of surgical field. Each incident of haemorrhage makes the operator stop
      the procedure in order to bring back the optimal visualization of the intranasal anatomy. In
      the end it prolongs the time of procedure.

      Currently, intraoperative blood loss is estimated based on Boezaart Bleeding Scale (BBS) (0 -
      no bleeding (cadaveric conditions), 1 - Slight bleeding, no suctioning required, 2 - Slight
      bleeding, occasional suctioning required, 3 - Slight bleeding, frequent suctioning required;
      bleeding threatens surgical field a few seconds after suction is removed, 4 - Moderate
      bleeding, frequent suctioning required, and bleeding threatens surgical field directly after
      suction is removed, 5 - Severe bleeding, constant suctioning required; bleeding appears
      faster than can be removed by suction; surgical field severely threatened and surgery usually
      not possible).

      Recently, the Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) was added as a surrogate variable showing the
      nociception-antinociception balance into above mentioned parameters constituting a novel
      approach in monitoring patients intraoperatively, known as adequacy of anaesthesia (AoA) or
      tailor-made anaesthesia. SPI>10 or any SPI>50, were proposed to constitute the indication for
      administration of rescue analgesia intraoperatively.

      This study aims at evaluating utility of SPI-guided analgesia using remifentanil on the
      intraoperative blood loss, haemodynamic stability and time duration of surgery in patients
      undergoing functional sinus surgery (FESS) under total intravenous anaesthesia using propofol
      or volatile anaesthesia using sevoflurane or desflurane.

      Currently, FESS is most often performed using total intravenous anaesthesia (TIVA) which is
      by majority of anaesthesiologists believed to reduce the intraoperative blood loss compared
      to general anaesthesia using volatile anaesthetics, but current literature provides
      conflicting findings in this area if the sort of anaesthetic used influences quality of the
      surgical field.
