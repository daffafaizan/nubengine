      with greater marginal bone loss. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) play a major role in
      periodontal tissue destruction. MMP-2 and MMP-9, called gelatinases, are one of the major
      MMPs that plays important roles in periodontitis. To date, several studies showed the
      increased levels of gelatinases in periodontal disease and only a limited number of study
      investigated the effect of smoking on gelatinases. However, no previous study has directly
      investigated the possible relationship between smoking and gingival tissue gelatinases
      expressions (MMP-2 and MMP-9) in chronic periodontitis (CP) patients relative to
      periodontally healthy subjects.

      Therefore this study is conducted to comparatively evaluate the expressions of MMP-2 and
      MMP-9 in smoker vs non-smoker chronic periodontitis patients as well as periodontally healthy
      subjects. the of this study hypothesis was that smoking may interfere with periodontal
      disease by effecting MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions.
