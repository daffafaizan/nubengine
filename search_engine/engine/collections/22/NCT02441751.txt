      and sudden death (see reference). Variations of QT-interval caused by changes in the volume
      status of the patient during an operation remained unclear. QT interval changes will be
      monitored during the surgery with the focus of the influence of sudden blood loss, volume
      substitution by crystalloids, blood and blood products. The effect of surgical procedures on
      the QT-interval (e.g. clamping of kidney artery) will be observed as well as the association
      of intra-operative QT-interval alterations with postoperative complications.
