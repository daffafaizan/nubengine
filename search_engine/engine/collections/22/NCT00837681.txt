      responsible for significant morbidity and mortality. The incidence of pulmonary disease has
      been reported to be as high as 50% of all patients that undergo transplant. The most common
      manifestation of early onset lung disease is idiopathic pneumonia syndrome. This can occur in
      autologous and allogeneic transplants, with an incidence between 5% and 10% and a mortality
      rate as high as 74%(1). Late onset pulmonary disease may be even more frequent and has been
      reported between 10-24% in recipients of allogeneic HSCT(2-4). Additionally, a recent study
      demonstrated 26% of patients develop airflow obstruction after transplant and this was
      correlated with mortality(5). One quite useful classification system divides late onset
      pulmonary disease into bronchiolitis obliterans and interstitial pneumonia(4). Interstitial
      pneumonia is a condition characterized by diffuse infiltrates, often with lymphocyte
      predominance, and associated with restrictive defects on pulmonary function testing.
      Bronchiolitis obliterans is characterized by progressive airflow obstruction and a normal
      radiograph (except possibly associated air trapping). The incidence of bronchiolitis
      obliterans after HSCT varies widely, but is usually reported to be between 1% and 11%(6-8),
      although the presence of post HSCT obstructive airway disease was reported at 26% in a recent
      large study(5). Late onset pulmonary diseases are often treated with increased
      immunosuppression, but the prognosis is poor with limited response to therapy(9; 4).
