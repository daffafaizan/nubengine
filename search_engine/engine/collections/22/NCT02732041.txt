      ventilation in different settings. Few studies have evaluated double cycling in ARDS patient.
      No clear predictors of this finding beside low tidal volume have been found, and clinical
      outcome implications have not been addressed. This study has 3 main objectives: evaluate the
      frequency of double cycling and ineffective efforts, seek for potential predictors and
      clinical outcomes related to asynchronies. Subjects with less than 72 hours of mechanical
      ventilation due to ARDS will be recruited. Thirty minutes of mechanical ventilation will be
      recorded and automatically analyzed with a custom-made program to detect asynchronies. A
      blood sample will be drawn to measure inflammatory and lung tissue damage biomarkers.
      Clinical and outcome data will be recorded.
