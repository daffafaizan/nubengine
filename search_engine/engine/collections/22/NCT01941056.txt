      I. To establish a biological optimal dose of the cytomegalovirus (CMV)-modified vaccinia
      Ankara (MVA) Triplex vaccine (multi-CMV epitope modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine).

      II. To determine if the vaccine is safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers at these
      doses.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide preliminary evidence of CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine driven expansion of
      CMV-specific immune responses that would support further evaluation of this vaccine in
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients.

      II. To confer CMV-specific immunity to CMV-negative volunteers and to determine the duration
      of immune enhancement of CMV-specific cell mediated immunity (CMI) function up to 12 months
      following immunization of healthy volunteers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Participants receive multi-CMV epitope modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine intramuscularly (IM)
      followed by a booster injection 28 days later in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 12 months.
