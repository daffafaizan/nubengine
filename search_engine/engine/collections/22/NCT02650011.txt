      although advancement of medical management and transplantation. Acute-on-chronic liver
      failure (ACLF) refers to condition of previously stable chronic liver disease with occurrence
      of an acute insult resulting in rapid deterioration of liver function and subsequent
      decompensation. Various factors could be a precipitating factor of ACLF. This condition is
      different from liver cirrhosis (chronic hepatic decompensation) in terms of having more
      chance of recovery with management before acute deterioration, although it shows high
      short-term mortality. Thus, earlier recognition and intensive management are important for
      this condition. However, the definition or diagnostic criteria is unclear and the natural
      course of this condition is not definitely investigated. The aim of this study is to
      establish the common etiology, symptom and natural course of ACLF in Korean patients.
