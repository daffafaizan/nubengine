      of skin prick testing in our lab will not be required to undergo preliminary skin prick
      testing, as the allergen to be used for skin prick titrations is known. New participants will
      undergo skin prick testing. The procedures for skin prick testing and skin test endpoint
      (STE) titration will be guided by the AllerGen CIC Allergen Skin Titration by Epicutaneous
      Method (Prick) Standard Operating Procedure. Different allergen extracts for the skin prick
      test or different doubling doses of an allergen in duplicate for the STE will be applied to
      the forearm, pricked with a lancet, and assessed ten minutes later by measuring the wheal
      sizes produced. The study will require three visits to the lab (i.e. three testers), each
      separated by one week and lasting roughly 30 minutes. Each visit will entail the duplicate
      STE procedure performed by a different tester. If a participant is new to the lab, they will
      undergo skin prick testing during their first lab visit prior to undergoing the skin prick
      titration and so, their first study visit may last up to one hour.
