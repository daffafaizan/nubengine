      atrial flutter in the United States (Heart Disease & Stroke Statistics - 2003 Update, AHA).
      These arrhythmias may be occasional or sustained. While not directly fatal, these arrhythmias
      cause discomfort and can lead to stroke or congestive heart failure.

      This Phase III trial is Cardiome's first pivotal study with RSD1235. The study seeks to
      confirm the findings of the Phase II proof-of-concept through demonstration of RSD1235's
      abilities to convert AF to sinus rhythm. The patient population will include recent onset AF
      (AF duration of 3 hours to 7 days) and patients with longer AF duration.

      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study in patients with AF;
      stratification will be based on duration of AF. Treatment will be considered successful if
      there is a treatment-induced conversion of atrial arrhythmia to sinus rhythm for a minimum of
      1-minute by Hour 1.5 (Time 0 = start of first infusion). All patients will be evaluated for
      safety.
