      patients is currently debated and overall the choice stands between CoC and MoP. New HXLPE is
      wear-resistant and safe and clinical HXLPE wear (RSA) hardly exceed the wear measured in
      retrieval CoC implants. For CoC articulations stripe wear on edge loading is a reported
      problem leading to increased wear in examined retrieval components and CoC wear is dependent
      on component position. Although the risk is very small, CoC bearings are at still at risk of
      fracture, and functional squeaking is a complication that adversely affects the quality of
      life in about 1% of CoC THA patient. Dual mobility MoP cups were designed for reducing hip
      dislocations in older patients treated with THA after medial hip fractures. The concept
      provides good stability and mobility and may also be an optimal solution for younger and
      active patients; however, dual mobility MoP has not previously been documented for use in
      younger patients. The anatomical dual mobility (ADM) cup design (Stryker) is soft tissue
      sparing (iliopsoas tendon) potentially leading to lesser groin-pain and squeaking is not a
      concern. It is currently unknown if the outer-articulation of the dual mobility PE liner
      keeps moving over time or could impinge in the joint capsule in an undesirable position and
      result in unwanted edge loading and higher wear-rates. Metal ions are produced even in MoP
      bearings and even though in dual-articulation MoP bearings most (90%) of the motion is
      believed to occur between the head and liner (ceramic-polyenthylene), the metal ion levels
      may be higher than expected for MoP hips (large poly contact in metal shell), while
      expectedly there will be no metal ions in CoC THA.
