      years) with ESBL-E UTI were enrolled in 24 pediatric departments in France. Clinical and
      biological characteristics, risk factors of infection of E-ESBL, first and second lines of
      antibiotic therapies were analyzed. The investigators used the Kaplan-Meier method to
      estimate the time to fever defervescence and hospitalization duration, and Log-rank test to
      assess equality of survivor functions. The investigators also analyzed the resistance
      patterns and molecular characterization of ESBL types in the isolates.
