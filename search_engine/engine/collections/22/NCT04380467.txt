    
      The study is a single (observer) blinded feasibility pilot randomised study. Study subjects
      will be recruited from clinics run by St George's Hospital Renal Department and randomised to
      treatment arm or no treatment arm.

      In treatment arm, six doses of vitamin D tablets (cholecalciferol 100,000 IU, five capsules
      total) will be administered on weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20. In the no-treatment arm the
      participants receive no cholecalciferol. Participants will have serum calcium levels measured
      at week 12.

      All participants will undergo estimation of endothelial function, carotid intima-media
      thickness, CD4+CD28null and regulatory T cell frequency in week 0 and week 26. The observer
      will be blinded to whether the patient is in the treatment or no-treatment arm whilst the
      following tests are performed:

        1. Measurement of Brachial Artery Flow Mediated Dilatation

        2. Measurement of Carotid Intima Media Thickness

        3. Quantification of CD4+CD28null and regulatory T cell frequency

      The pilot study will assess feasibility of the study methods.
