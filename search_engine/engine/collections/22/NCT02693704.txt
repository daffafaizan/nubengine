      has developed a new feature of sound rendering in hearing aids. This is a collaboration
      between EPFL and the Swiss company Phonak Communications AG. The new functionality works with
      the range of Roger products from Phonak, a new generation of FM systems that use a digital
      transmission.

      FM technology refers to a type of wireless system that helps people better understand speech
      in noisy situations. FM systems commonly work together with a user's hearing aids, although
      systems are also available for those with otherwise normal hearing (such as people who suffer
      from APD, ADHD etc.). An FM system works like this: the person speaking wears or holds a
      transmitter microphone, or the transmitter is placed in the middle of the group (picking up
      speech from all around). Using harmless radio waves, the FM system sends speech signal(s) to
      the listener, who wears a tiny FM receiver behind the ear.

      The new feature of such systems performs processing of the speaker's speech signal so that it
      renders information related to their spatial location. This so-called sound "spatialization"
      is a natural property of the human binaural auditory system, which allows us to localize
      sounds. However, this sound spatialization is not delivered by the current FM systems. Thanks
      to the new technology from EPFL and Phonak, it is now possible to include a binaural
      spatialization of the speech signal in the Roger product of Phonak hearing devices.
