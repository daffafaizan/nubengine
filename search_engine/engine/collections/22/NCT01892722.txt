      an Extension Phase in which all patients will be treated with fingolimod. The Core Phase is a
      24-month, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, parallel-group multicenter study phase
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of fingolimod compared to IFN β-1a in children/adolescent
      patients aged 10-17 years old with MS. The Extension Phase is a 60-month (5 year) study phase
      for patients who complete the Core Phase of the study and meet all inclusion/exclusion
      criteria and for patients who will be recruited in the younger cohort to participate in the
      Extension Phase. The 'younger cohort' refers to the population of pediatric patients
      fulfilling any single one or a combination of the following criteria: being ≤12 years of age,
      or weighing ≤40 kg, or being prepubertal (i.e. pubertal status of Tanner stage <2). The
      recruitment of the younger cohort (30 patients) was requested as a post- approval health
      authority commitment
