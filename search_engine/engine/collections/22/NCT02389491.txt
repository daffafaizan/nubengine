      with malnutrition.Recent studies have shown that increasing energy intake in CHD infants can
      improve their nutrition status.But there are no high qualified evidences supporting that high
      density formula can promote infants' nutrition status and ensure its safety. The hypothesis
      of the current study is that high density formula intake can increase infants'weight and it's
      safe.

      The current study adopts randomized,controlled intervention trial, gives high density
      formula(Infatrini,100kcal/100ml)to CHD infants in intervention group and normal density
      formula（Neocate,67kcal/100ml）in control group. Intervention begins when infants start enteral
      nutrition after operation and continues for 7days.
