      (Glofil) will be obtained in 220 patients with cirrhosis. Utilizing this information, the
      correlation between cystatin C and 125I-Iothalamate clearance will be obtained. In addition,
      the current serum creatinine based calculations and true creatinine clearance will also be
      correlated with 125I-Iothalamate clearance. The results of this study should help to
      determine whether serum cystatin C is a more sensitive laboratory measurement of renal
      function in patients with cirrhosis.
