    
      This will be a single center, comparative, randomized, double-blind, phase III trial designed
      to evaluate the efficacy of the NK-1 antagonist, aprepitant (MK-869), in combination with
      ondansetron and dexamethasone in the prevention of acute and delayed nausea and vomiting
      compared to ondansetron and dexamethasone in patients receiving highly emetogenic preparative
      regimens prior to autologous or allogeneic (related and unrelated) stem cell transplantation.

      Patients will be randomized to one of two treatments: dexamethasone 10 mg IV once daily and
      ondansetron 8 mg orally every 8 hours on each day of the preparative regimen plus one
      additional day vs. 7.5 mg IV once daily and ondansetron 8 mg orally every 8 hours on each day
      of the preparative regimen plus one additional day combined with aprepitant, 125 mg orally on
      the first day of their preparative regimen followed by 80 mg daily on each remaining day of
      the preparative regimen plus three additional days.
