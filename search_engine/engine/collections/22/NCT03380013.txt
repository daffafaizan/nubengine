      rates and improved long term neurodevelopment following treatment with therapeutic
      hypothermia. However, a barrier to hospital discharge for these infants is a successful
      transition from gavage to either breast or bottle feeding.

      Often, the factor delaying hospital discharge is slow transition to full oral feeds.
      Osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) helps to effectively stabilize and regulate the
      autonomic nervous system as well as the cranial nerves important in the sucking and latching
      reflexes, which may in turn help to ease the transition to full oral feeding. We hypothesize
      that infants who receive OMT will accelerate the transition to full oral feeds, thus
      decreasing their overall length of hospitalization compared to historical matched controls.
