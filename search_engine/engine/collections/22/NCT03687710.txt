    
      The Comparative Effectiveness Dementia & Alzheimer's Registry (CEDAR) Project is a
      prospective, observational registry of adult patients at-risk for, or with, a diagnosis of
      dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) or other neurodegenerative dementias. The purpose of
      this study is to develop a research repository, or database, for information collected during
      routine medical care of people with normal memory and family history of AD, or with memory
      loss or other changes in thinking. The registry will help generate empirical evidence that
      improves knowledge and informs care decisions about risk reduction for dementia due to AD,
      and about the effectiveness of a clinical precision medicine intervention. Using a life
      course approach to comparative effectiveness research will enable investigators to analyze
      the effects of evidence-based multidomain interventions on cognition, biomarkers of AD risk,
      and calculated AD risk across the pre-dementia spectrum of AD.
