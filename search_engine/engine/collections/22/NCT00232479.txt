      cancer. It is unknown if dose dense therapy will improve survival in tumors that express
      her-2. This study evaluates a neoadjuvant regimen containing carboplatin, taxotere and
      herceptin when used in a dose dense manner in patients with large breast cancers. The
      endpoint of pathologic complete response is used as a surrogate marker for survival.Safety
