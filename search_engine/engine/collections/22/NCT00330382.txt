      I. Determine if chemoprevention by the Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate (BBIC) can prevent
      cancer in patients with oral leukoplakia (OL).

      II. Determine the clinical and histologic response rate of OL to BBIC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure the effect of BBIC on intermediate marker endpoint levels. II. Correlate the
      clinical and histologic responses of OL with cellular levels of proteolytic activity, erb-B2
      (neu), retinioc acid receptor β, bcl-2, and mutant p53 expression, and serum levels of neu.

      III. Determine the individual and group side effects of BBIC.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study. Prior to
      randomization, all patients receive oral placebo for 4 weeks. Patients who show good
      compliance (> 75% packet count) are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive oral Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate twice daily for 6 months in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 6 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete questionnaires about diet, tobacco, and alcohol usage at baseline and at
      the completion of study treatment. Blood, urine, and biopsy tissue are collected at baseline
      and at the completion of study treatment. Oral mucosal cells are collected at baseline,
      during the run-in phase, at randomization, after completion of study treatment, and at 3
      months after completion of study treatment. Samples are examined for protease activity,
      levels of bcl-2 and erbB-2, mutant p53 oncogene expression and epidermal growth factor
      receptor, and retinoic acid receptor-β expression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 months.
