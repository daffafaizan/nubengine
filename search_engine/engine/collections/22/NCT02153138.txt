      essentially put to rest by recent studies that suggested that plant-based diets are healthy
      and associated with lower risk of several chronic diseases. Nevertheless, various nutritional
      deficiencies have been identified, and it has been shown that individuals who follow
      different types of vegetarian/vegan diets may not experience the same effects on their
      health.

      Working Hypothesis

        1. Vegetarian/vegan diets will promote protection against cardiovascular risk factors if
           supplemented with possibly deficient nutrients.

        2. There will a further protective effect and a greater number of differences between
           subjects following a vegetarian diet compared to those following a vegan diet.

        3. Higher energy expenditure and lower and different caloric intake will promote a
           favorable difference in body composition (lower body fat) via a different substrate
           utilization expressed in the measured respiratory quotient (RQ).

        4. Extra- and intracellular free radicals will be higher in subjects who adhere to
           vegetarian/vegan diets compared to omnivores.

      Aims of the study

        1. To study the effect of vegetarian/vegan diets on endothelial functions after correcting
           for modifying factors.

        2. To study the effect of the above-mentioned plant-based diets on carotid intima-media
           thickness.

        3. To study the differences in body composition, resting energy expenditure and over-night
           substrate utilization between the different diets.

        4. To study the intracellular ROS of subjects following different diets.
