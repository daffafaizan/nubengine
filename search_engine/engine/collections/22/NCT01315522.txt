      measures for alleviating obstructive jaundice secondary to advanced cholangiocarcinoma.
      Previous meta-analysis showed no significant difference in stent patency between covered and
      uncovered SEMS, which are currently available. However, information on secondary SEMS
      insertion is still scarce, and there has been no prospective trial comparing efficacy of
      secondary stenting between covered and uncovered SEMS for the management of occluded metal
      stent in malignant biliary obstruction. Previously, only two small retrospective studies
      addressed this issue. Given the absence of prospective trial on re-intervention for occluded
      SEMS in malignant biliary obstruction, we aimed to prospectively compare the efficacies and
      complication rates of secondary ComVi stent (cSEMS) and uSEMS for the management of such
      condition.
