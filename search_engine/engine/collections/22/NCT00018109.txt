    
      Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is the most common lethal inherited disorder worldwide.
      Despite the exponential increase in our understanding of the disorder since the discovery and
      characterization of the causative gene and its product dystrophin in 1987, current
      therapeutic management remains largely supportive. Awaiting a final genetic cure to be
      available in the future, further investments in developing better drug therapies for DMD
      remain important. Not only because the uniform use of prednisone (the only drug proven to be
      beneficial) is hampered by potential adverse effects, but also because it may very well be
      the case that ultimately a combination of both gene and drug therapy will be needed to cure
      Duchenne children. Here, we test two compounds that have shown promise in a 45-drug screen in
      the mdx mouse model of Duchenne dystrophy.

      The effect of glutamine (0.6/kg/day) and creatine monohydrate (5g/day) on muscle strength
      will be evaluated in a multi-center randomized double-blind placebo-controlled 3-arm study.
      Ambulant children aged 5-10 years with an established DMD diagnosis will be studied. Patients
      will undergo 2 screening evaluations within 2 weeks. Patients will be randomized into
      treatment groups on the second screening visits, followed by a 6-month treatment period.
      During the treatment period, patients will be evaluated at monthly intervals. The primary
      endpoints are percentage change in average muscle strength score and QMT performance for
      specific muscle groups. Secondary endpoints include timed function tests, functional grades
      for arms and legs, and pulmonary function tests.
