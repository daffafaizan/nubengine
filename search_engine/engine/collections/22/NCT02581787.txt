      Phase 1: Evaluate the safe dose of fresolimumab in combination with stereotactic ablative
      radiotherapy (SABR) in patients.

      Phase 2. Evaluate the rate of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus
      fresolimumab.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate potential adverse events in patients receiving fresolimumab plus SABR. (Phase I)
      II. Evaluate post treatment changes in pulmonary function. (Phase I) III. Evaluate recurrence
      rates and progression free survival. (Phase I) IV. Assess pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      fresolimumab in combination with SABR (optional for patient). (Phase I) V. Evaluate the rate
      and severity of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus fresolimumab. (Phase I)
      VI. Evaluate the severity of radiation induced pulmonary fibrosis after SABR plus
      fresolimumab. (Phase II) VII. Evaluate potential adverse events in patients receiving
      fresolimumab plus SABR. (Phase II) VIII. Evaluate post treatment changes in pulmonary
      function. (Phase II) IX. Evaluate recurrence rates and progression free survival. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of fresolimumab followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive fresolimumab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 15, and 36 and undergo SABR in 4
      fractions between days 8 and 12.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months.
