      higher speed and more complex maneuvers such as running.

      (Willy, et al., 2011) - 10 female runners, underwent 6 wk. hip focused intervention, change
      in SLS but NO change in hip adduction angle while running.

      A different intervention strategy that includes utilizing the trunk as the proximal lever to
      strengthen the hip, could potentially alter biomechanical outcomes such as hip adduction
      angles in female runners.

      This study will apply a new intervention model and then measure running, single leg squat and
      hip strength to determine if a newly informed intervention can alter LE kinematics in females
      while running and make improvements in hip strength following the intervention Inclusion
