      body. While surgical intervention can offer a cure for localized soft tissue sarcoma,
      treatment of unresectable and metastatic disease is particularly challenging. New treatment
      options are needed for patients with unresectable or metastatic disease if they progress or
      cannot tolerate conventional chemotherapy. This study will investigate sunitinib - a novel
      orally-administered multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor with anti-tumor and
      antiangiogenic activities.
