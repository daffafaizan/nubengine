      patients should be included: 50 children suffering from ocular rosacea, and 50 children with
      no palpebral or Meibomian disease. Witnesses will be matched on the age of the cases.

      Patient and controls will undergo a classic ophthalmologic examination with visual acuity
      measurement and slit lamp examination of both eyes and eyelids. Then, the child will go
      through a meibographic and interferometric evaluation of his two inferior eyelids. This
      evaluation is made by an optometrist with the Lipiview device, and lasts a few minutes.
