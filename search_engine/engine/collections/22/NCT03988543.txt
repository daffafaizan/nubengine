      effectiveness of an enhanced care (EC) approach aimed to engage participants actively, and to
      increase self-efficacy, in the monitoring and managing of their symptoms. The existing
      EHR-integrated symptom monitoring system will constitute usual care (UC), and added patient
      engagement and activation features will comprise the EC condition.

      Project aims target both patient- and system-level outcomes. Aim 1: Implement a
      fully-integrated oncology symptom assessment and management program across six clinical units
      that are part of the NMHC healthcare delivery system; Aim 2: Evaluate the impact of the
      program by conducting a hybrid Type I effectiveness-implementation trial to evaluate the
      enhanced care program (EC: symptom monitoring & self-management intervention), relative to
      usual care (UC) on patient- and system-level outcomes; Aim 3: Identify facilitators and
      barriers to implementation and disseminate to other health systems. We will enroll an
      estimated 12,671 participants. To address possible contamination effects within each clinical
      unit, and allow for unit-level data collection for pre- and post-implementation comparison
      within and across clinical units, 50% will be enrolled and followed prior to program
      implementation. The other half will be enrolled post-implementation and will be randomly
      assigned at a 1:1 ratio (stratified by sex and cancer phase; curative intent, non-curative
      intent & survivorship) to UC versus EC. Fatigue, pain, anxiety, and depression will be
      assessed using Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMISÂ®) computerized
      adaptive tests (CATs). In addition, we will assess patient clinical outcomes, including
      healthcare utilization, and cancer treatment delivery outcomes.
