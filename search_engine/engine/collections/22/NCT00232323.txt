      organizations. Stress reduction may reduce or ameliorate such errors. Simulation training,
      using advanced patient simulators, has been shown to improve diagnostic, resuscitation and
      technical skills amongst physicians and nurses.We intend to check wether stress during ICU
      shifts may be reduced by using specifically designed scenarios based on real life
      experience,in integrative multidisciplinary ICU teams.
