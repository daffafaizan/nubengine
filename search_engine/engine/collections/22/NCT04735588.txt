    
      Multicenter retrospective and prospective observational study based on the collection -
      through pre-piloted electronic CRFs - of sequential anonymized data from principal Italian
      ITP centers representative of national geographical distribution, to evaluate, during a
      2-years study period, both the cumulative incidence COVID-19 occurring in patients with prior
      or ongoing ITP (COVID-19 in ITP) and the cumulative incidence of de novo ITP manifesting
      during COVID-19 (ITP in COVID-19). Data will be collected to describe the clinical course of
      patients in the two groups. The enrolment period will last 24 months or terminate at the last
      day of 1-month-COVID-19 free in Italy, whichever comes first. Each patient will be followed
      up to the first visit scheduled as per common center practice, including at least six months
      after hospital discharge or end of quarantine home confinement.
