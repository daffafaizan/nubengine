           thoughts or behavior and current or past depressive symptoms.

        -  These treatments work for depression and some preliminary data suggest they may work to
           prevent suicidal behavior.

        -  Participation includes:

             -  Nine weeks of free treatment

             -  Clinical assessments

             -  An opportunity to offer your views on treatment and suggestions for improving the
                treatment in focus groups
