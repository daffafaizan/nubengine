      and polymorphisms that differentiate two groups of adult dialyzed ESRD patients, matched for
      age and gender, and with comparable values for dialysis dose and daily protein intake. These
      two groups consist of one group of 20 adult, dialyzed patients with serum phosphate levels >
      2.50 mM compared to another group of 20 adult, dialyzed ESRD patients with serum phosphate
      levels < 1.50 mM. The results of this study will allow to determine whether there is a
      relationship between extreme hyperphosphatemia and klotho gene polymorphisms in dialysed ESRD
      patients.
