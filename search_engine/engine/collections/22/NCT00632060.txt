      These may result from training exercises, normal job duties, or recreational activities (2).
      Such injuries may cause reduced levels of performance and therefore decrease military
      readiness (1). This prospective, randomized, clinical trial compares manual/manipulative
      therapy (M/MT) and standard care to standard care alone for episodes of low back pain.
      Patients will be randomized to standard care or standard care plus M/MT. Standard care
      consists of medication prescribed by the credentialed medical provider; M/MT will be
      delivered by the chiropractor physician. The trial time period will be 4 weeks with outcome
      measurements at intake, 2 weeks, and 4 weeks. Outcome measures include the Visual Analogue
      Scale (VAS) for pain, Roland-Morris Low Back Pain and Disability Questionnaire (RDQ), the
      Back Pain Functional Scale for assessing function (3), Global Improvement Questionnaire for
      patient perception regarding improvement in function, Patient Expectation and Patient
      Satisfaction Questionnaires to examine patient expectations toward care and reception of that
      care, and drug use and profiles. The SF-36 will be used to measure the general health
      component and quality of life of our sample (4). This will be a pragmatic study that will
      allow us the opportunity to develop further investigations leading to a larger scale and more
      robust clinical trial. In addition, this study will provide information on the challenges and
      opportunities involved in conducting clinical research concerning M/MT in a military setting
      and may lead to additional studies at a wider number of bases throughout the US.
