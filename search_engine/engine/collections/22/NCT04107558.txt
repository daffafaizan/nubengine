      pharmacological means that involve a series of risks and side effects.

      For many years, non-drug solutions have been of interest to the public and the care staff.

      expensive and also effective for the well-being of the patient and the care staff. The use of
      a blended solution using both clinical hypnosis and virtual reality has been only scarcely
      documented.
