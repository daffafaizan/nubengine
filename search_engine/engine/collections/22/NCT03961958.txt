      position were included. In addition to standard anesthesia monitoring, bispectral index and
      noninvasive cardiac output monitoring were undertaken. The study was carried out in 2 parts.
      In phase 1, target-controlled infusion propofol anesthesia was adjusted to maintain BIS 40 to
      60. In phase 2, there were 2 planned reductions in propofol target concentration: (1)
      immediately after loss of consciousness: reduction calculated using a predefined formula, and
      (2) before positioning: reduction equal to the average percentage decrease in CO after
      knee-chest position in phase 1.
