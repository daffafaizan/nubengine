        -  Determine the feasibility of adding cisplatin and locoregional hyperthermia to external
           beam and intracavity radiotherapy in patients with stage IIB-IVA cervical cancer.

        -  Determine the acute toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the complete response rate of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) once daily 5 days a week for 5 weeks. On 1
      day of each week, patients also receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours and hyperthermia over 90
      minutes beginning 1-6 hours after completion of EBRT. During week 6, patients receive
      hyperthermia and cisplatin on the day before the 1 day of intracavity radiotherapy. Treatment
      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 6-8 weeks, every 3 months for 3 years, and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-34 patients will be accrued for this study.
