      to two additional doses (to be confirmed) of LY3471851 will be compared to placebo.

      LY3471851 (NKTR-358) is a potential first-in-class therapeutic that may address an underlying
      immune system imbalance in people with many autoimmune conditions. It targets the interleukin
      (IL-2) receptor complex in the body in order to stimulate proliferation of inhibitory immune
      cells known as regulatory T cells. By activating these cells, LY3471851 may act to bring the
      immune system back into balance.
