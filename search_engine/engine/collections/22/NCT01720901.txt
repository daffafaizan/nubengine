      of using high dose of Icotinib (Conmana) as a way to treat patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer that progressed after routine gefitinib therapy by progression-free survival, as well
      as overall survival and disease control rate. The adverse events and adverse reaction are
      evaluated as well.
