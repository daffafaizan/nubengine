      sucrose esters, and xanthan gum to help them stay dissolved). Then rate them for their taste
      intensities. Next, participants will taste 5 butyric acid solutions, 5 hexenoic acid
      solutions, 5 caprylic acid solutions, 5 lauric acid solutions, 5 palmitic acid solutions, 5
      oleic acid solutions, and 5 linoleic acid solutions (all will also contain the sucrose esters
      and xanthan gums.) and rate them for their taste intensities. This should take no longer than
      1 hour. Participants will spit all samples into a cup after tasting them. They will not
      swallow any samples.
