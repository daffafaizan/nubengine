      disease. Coronary calcium deposition amount is an established independent coronary artery
      disease risk factor. However, coronary artery stenosis seldom occurred in the same location
      as calcium deposition. With the advent of 16-detector-row multislice spiral CT, direct
      visualization of coronary artery is possible. But it remains a great challenge to obtain
      diagnostic quality image in the beating heart. Small distal vessels may not be adequately
      visualized. Artifacts from severe calcification or coronary stent may render diagnosis
      difficult. The clinical implication of coronary calcium score, indication of coronary CT
      angiography and myocardial enhancement measurement should be further studied. The purposes of
      this study are: 1) Establish normal value for coronary calcium scoring in Taiwan. 2) Find out
      the relationship of coronary calcium deposition and coronary artery stenosis. Propose a
      clinical management guideline based on coronary calcium score. 3) Evaluate
      sensitivity/specificity of coronary CT angiography and the influence of coronary calcium
      score on coronary CT angiography. 4) Evaluate the clinical application of myocardial
      enhancement measurement.
