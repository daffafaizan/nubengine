      According to Hans' algorithms, DLBCL can be identified as 2 subtypes: germinal
      b-cell-like(GCB) and non-germinal b-cell-like(non-GCB). Approximately 50 to 60% of DLBCL was
      non-GCB subtype DLBCL.The non-GCB DLBCL revealed poor clinical outcomes. Bruton's tyrosine
      kinase (BTK) inhibitors have established therapeutic activity in B cell malignancies, with
      potential activity in non-GCB DLBCL. This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      zanubrutinib in combination with R-CHOP for newly diagnosed untreated Non-GCB DLBCL Patients.
