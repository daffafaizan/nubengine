      and unique sensitivities to hormonal changes including pregnancy, oral contraceptives, and
      hormone replacement therapy .Melasma can be divided into centrofacial, malar, and mandibular,
      according to the pigment distribution on the skin. The hyperpigmented patches are usually
      symmetrical and have a sharp irregular border.On wood's light examination three forms of
      melasma exist (epidermal, dermal, and mixed). Epidermal & mixed types shows accentuation of
      pigmentation, while there is no change in dermal type The epidermal type is the most
      responsive to treatment .Melasma is often difficult to treat, and the condition may be
      refractory. Principles of therapy include protection from ultraviolet light, inhibition of
      melanocyte activity and melanin synthesis, and the disruption and removal of melanin granules
      .Many depigmenting agents and other therapies such as chemical peeling are used for treating
      melasma, in the form of monotherapy or combined therapy .The most commonly used peeling
      agents are alpha-hydroxy-acids, glycolic acid , Jessner solution, salicylic acid
      resorcinol,trichloroacetic acid , pyruvic acid and phenol Several hypopigmenting agents such
      as topical hydroquinone (2 to 4%) alone or in combination with tretinoin (0.05 to 0.1%) have
      been used with differing results. Topical azelaic acid (15 to 20%) can be as efficacious as
      hydroquinone. Kojic acid, alone or in combination with glycolic acid or hydroquinone, has
      shown good results, due to its inhibitory action on tyrosinase. Chemical peeling is
      apromising treatment for numerous pigmentary disorders as melasma.Which aim to remove the
      melanin ,rather than the inhibition of melanocytes or melanogenesis by causing controlled
      necrosis and subsequent regeneration of the epidermis ,apart from remodeling of collagen and
      elastic fiberes in the dermis . The gold standard for chemical peeling agents is
      trichloroacetic acid It is a traditional chemical substance which has been used for both
      superficial and medium-depth as well as deep peelings.It is not expensive, stable, not
      light-sensitive and does not need to be neutralized .Classic Jessner's solution is a
      combination of different chemical substances, including salicylic acid(14gm),
      resorcinol(14gm), lactic acid(14gm) and ethanol, which can be used either alone for
      superficial peeling or in combination with other agents to make easier medium-depth
      procedures. Dr.Max Jessner originally formulated this peel to reduce the concentration and
      toxicity of each of the individual ingredients while increasing efficacy. Modified formula:
      lactic acid(17%), salicylic acid(17%), citric acid(8%) and ethanol .It is preferred , to
      avoid possible allergic reactions and hyperpigmentation problems, which may be created by
      resorcinol, especially in skin types V and VI.Gary Monheit has popularized the combination
      peel using the classic Jessner's solution combined with trichloroacetic acid , to achieve a
      more uniform penetration and an excellent peel with a low, safe concentration of
      trichloroacetic acid Glycolic acid it is one of the most frequently used superficial peeling
      agent.

      It is stable , not light sensitive, inexpensive and easy to administer. Generally it is safe;
      scarring uncommon; persistent erythema and postpeel hyperpigmentation rarely seen.The depth
      of a Glycolic acid peel is a function of the concentration,volume and duration of
      application.Glycolic acid has been used in combination with trichloroacetic acid peels .70%
      glycolic acid is applied to the skin for 2 minutes.This is then neutralized,followed by the
      application of 35% trichloroacetic acid peels without any prior acetone scrub.This
      combination is thought to produce greater neoelastogenesis and less inflammation than
      Jessner/trichloroacetic acid combination.
