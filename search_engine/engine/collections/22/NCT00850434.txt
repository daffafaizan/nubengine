    
      Subjects in the trial will spend 2 nights in a sleep laboratory being monitored with a full
      montage polysomnograph (PSG) with each of the algorithms providing positive airway pressure
      therapy. The PSG records EEG, EMG, EOG, patient airflow, respiratory effort, blood oxygen
      saturation, and body position.

      In a randomised order each subject will spend one night being treated by the modified AutoSet
      algorithm and a second night being treated by the traditional AutoSet algorithm.

      The subjects will be blinded to which therapy they are receiving and the scorer of the PSG
      will also be blinded to which therapy is being used.
