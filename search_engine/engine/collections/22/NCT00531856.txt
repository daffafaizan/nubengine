      appear to vary among the models and organs with the common theme of carbon monoxide acting as
      a potent anti-inflammatory molecule. Carbon monoxide affects several intracellular signaling
      pathways. In addition, carbon monoxide generates increased levels of anti-inflammatory
      molecules.

      Evaluate the safety and tolerability of three carbon monoxide dose levels consisting of a
      single 0.7 mg/kg dose and a single 2.0 mg/kg dose when administered post-operatively and a
      single 2.0 mg/kg dose, a single 3.0mg/kg dose and a 3.5 mg/kg dose when administered
      intra-operatively as an inhaled gas for 1 hour, by assessment of adverse events (AEs), vital
      signs, laboratory variables, serum carboxyhemoglobin (COHb), oxygenation, electrocardiography
      (ECG), and neurocognitive status in patients receiving kidney transplants.
