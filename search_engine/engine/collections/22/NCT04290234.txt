      by profound difficulties in social interactions. However, it is still unclear how childhood
      maltreatment affects social interactions in adulthood. In this study, we examine how
      childhood maltreatment may modulate threat sensitivity assessed by the distance at which an
      individual flees from an approaching threat. While rapid escape decisions rely on "reactive
      fear" circuits, slower escape decisions are associated with "cognitive fear" circuits. Based
      on previous observations of altered early sensory processing, we expect that childhood
      maltreatment affects both cognitive and reactive fear circuits.
