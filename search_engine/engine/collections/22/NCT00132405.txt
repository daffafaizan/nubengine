      pain-free epidermal injection of lidocaine powder that provides local anesthesia within 3
      minutes to provide painless needle or catheter insertion for blood drawing. ALGRX 3268 is a
      single use disposable system, incorporating a drug cassette and gas cylinder into a single
      hand held device, with a button to actuate the system. This is a single center, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo (sham) controlled, single dose, parallel group study in pediatric
      subjects scheduled to undergo venipuncture. Three age groups are enrolled: 3-7 years, 8-12
      years, and 13-18 years. Within each age group, subjects are randomized to receive ALGRX 3268
      0.5 mg/20 bar or pressure matched placebo. Two to 3 minutes after administration of study
      treatment at the back of the hand, venipuncture is performed with either a
      needle/Vacutainer®, needle/syringe or "butterfly," at the discretion of the investigator.
      Subjects aged 3-7 are asked to rate the pain of venipuncture using the Wong-Baker FACES Pain
      Rating Scale, anchored at 0 for "no hurt" and 5 for "hurts worst." Subjects in oldest age
      group complete a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), anchored at 0 for "no pain" and at 100
      for "extreme pain." Subjects in the middle group used both the Wong-Baker FACES scale and the
      VAS to rate the pain of venipuncture. Safety ratings of skin are completed 15, 30, and 60
      minutes after the procedure.
