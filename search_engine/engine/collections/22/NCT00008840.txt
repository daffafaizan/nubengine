      are given through a vein (IV) for at least 3 days. At the conclusion of 3 days, the
      voriconazole patients are then switched to oral voriconazole. The AmBisome patients continue
      with IV AmBisome. Both groups continue treatment until blood counts increase and fever
      subsides.
