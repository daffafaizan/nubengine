    
      This is a prospective, phase II study evaluating the efficacy of a risk-adapted, personalized
      allo-HCT strategy based on geriatric vulnerabilities identified by pre-transplant GA. The
      less vulnerable/fit older patients are recommended to receive MA conditioning and the more
      vulnerable older patients are recommended to receive RIC/NMA conditioning.

        1. HCT-CI/Age â‰¤4 AND no IADL impairment (less vulnerable/fit) -> MA regimen

        2. HCT-CI/Age >4 AND/OR any IADL impairment (more vulnerable) -> RIC/NMA regimen

             -  Chemotherapies: busulfan, fludarabine, melphalan, cyclophosphamide, thiotepa,
                clofarabine

             -  Radiation therapy: total body irradiation (TBI)

             -  Other therapy: anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG)
