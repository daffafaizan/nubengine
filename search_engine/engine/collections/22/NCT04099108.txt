      long-term functional impairment. Hence effective strategies, or a combination of strategies,
      are needed to reduce skeletal muscle wasting during critical illness. Although amino acids
      and mobilisation are both known to stimulate the mechanistic target of rapamycin pathway
      (MTOR) pathway for muscle protein synthesis in healthy adults, there are no trials to date
      investigating the combined approach of combined cycle ergometry and bolus amino acid
      supplementation on muscle accretion in the ICU.
