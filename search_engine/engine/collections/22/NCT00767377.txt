      regimen has been proved to be more effective while less toxicity than ECF regimen.
      Oxaliplatin has demonstrated synergy with 5-FU in vitro, in vivo, and in the clinical setting
      in advanced colorectal cancer. It presents a better toxicity profile than cisplatin. Recently
      some studies used combination regimens of oxaliplatin, folinic acid, and continuous infusion
      5-FU for about 44 hours (e.g FOLFOX4 ) to treat A/MGC, and yielded good response rates and
      median overall survival times while resulting in lower rates of grade 3-4 adverse events.
      Therefore, it is logical to modify ECF regimen with oxaliplatin replacing cisplatin and a
      short-term FU infusion replacing 21-day FU infusion. Our objective is to evaluate whether the
      EOF5 regimen is less toxicity while is comparable effective as ECF regimen.
