      described below. This will be a single arm trial in which investigators compare the outcomes
      of interest pre- and post- intervention. Investigators will adapt an HIV risk reduction
      social network intervention to create a new social network intervention targeting reduction
      in intake of sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB). The investigators' primary outcomes will be to
      test the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention and its components as well as
      estimate the likely effect of the intervention.

      In the intervention, individuals will be recruited and trained to be "Peer Educators" who
      will participate in group sessions and then communicate this information with members of
      participant's social network ("Sidekick") and work to make changes to reduce intake of added
      sugars together. Given the frequent intake of SSB in this population, the intervention will
      focus on reducing added sugar intake through the reduced consumption of SSB. Peer Educators
      will participate in 6 core group sessions over a 6-week period as well as 3 additional
      booster sessions after completing the core curriculum. All sessions will be delivered by a
      facilitator and assistant facilitator using a guide. All groups will be held in a room in
      each public housing development's administrative building.
