      each infusion set for up to 7 days or until the infusion set fails. Subjects will alternate
      between wearing the Quick-Set Teflon catheter and the Sure-T steel catheter each week. They
      will wear each infusion set twice.

      For the study, subjects will be provided with an investigational Medtronic Real-Time
      Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) Enlite Sensor/Serter to help identify, serious hyperglycemia
      or hypoglycemia during the study. This sensor is not yet FDA approved, but is similar to
      commercially available sensors. If the sensor detects a high or low glucose, subject must
      obtain a fingerstick glucose to confirm the result. In the study, all insulin dose and other
      treatment decisions will be made using glucose meter results, and will not be based on sensor
      results. Subjects will be instructed on how to identify infusion set failures.

      Infusion set failure are defined as: 1) Blood ketones greater than 0.6 mmol/L, 2) Evidence of
      infection at the infusion site (such as redness of more than 4 mm), or 3) Blood glucose that
      does not decrease by at least 50 mg/dL within 1 hour of a correction bolus to treat a blood
      glucose greater than 300 mg/dL.

      Subjects will follow-up weekly in one of our test centers for a total of five visits.

      At home subjects will be asked to keep a log recording measurements of redness and induration
      at the infusion site when it is changed prior to the study visit.
