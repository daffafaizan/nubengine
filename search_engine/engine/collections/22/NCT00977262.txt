      endothelial function, activation of immune cells and changes in gene expression profiles of
      immune cells such as peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Recently it was shown that
      postprandial gene expression profiles of PBMC and plasma triglyceride (TG) and free fatty
      acid (FFA) responses are dependent on the type of dietary fat consumed (i.e. saturated,
      monounsaturated and polyunsaturated). Since obese and diabetic subjects usually are in a
      pro-inflammatory state and have dyslipidemia and endothelial dysfunction we are interested in
      the effect of different fatty acids in a high load on the PBMC gene expression profiles,
      plasma cytokine profiles and endothelial function of these subjects.
