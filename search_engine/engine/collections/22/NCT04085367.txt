      adult subjects with clinically-confirmed mild to moderate AKs on the face and the balding
      scalp, to be conducted at approximately 60 clinical sites in the United States. Sites will be
      selected to ensure that diverse daylight conditions will be represented in the study to
      understand the effects of latitude, elevation, and climate.
