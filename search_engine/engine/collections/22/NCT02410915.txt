    
      To compare outcome after 4 weeks of gait training with HAL vs. 4 weeks of conventional gait
      training as part of a regular inpatient rehabilitation program for hemiparetic patients with
      severely limited mobility early after stroke.

      Study design: Randomized, controlled study with blinded outcome assessment.

      Conventional gait training is individualized and performed according to current practice
      (approximately 30-60 minutes/session, 5 days a week) and may include standing, weight
      shifting, stepping, over ground walking with assistance and/or assistant devices as well as
      the use of a treadmill and body weight support. Conventional gait training is offered to both
      study groups.

      Training with HAL is performed in 1 session per day, 4 days per week during 4 weeks. Time for
      each session is individualised but does not exceed 60 minutes/session (effective time).
      Training with HAL is performed in combination with body-weight support system and on a
      treadmill. The training program is performed by 2 physiotherapists, who have been trained in
      the HAL method.
