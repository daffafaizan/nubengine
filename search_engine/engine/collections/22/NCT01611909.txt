      insect repellent products. Recently, it has been shown that lemon eucalyptus has potent
      anti-bacterial and anti-fungal effects that should assist in the treatment of inflammatory
      conditions such as impetigo. Our aim is to investigate this further by investigating the
      safety and efficacy of this product in the treatment of Impetigo.

      A randomised, double-blinded, three-armed pilot study, involving a total of 30 patients will
      be recruited from the dermatology outpatient department clinic at Royal North Shore hospital
      for this study. These patients will be between the ages of 12 months and 12 years with a
      clinical diagnosis of Impetigo.

      The three treatment groups will include a 2% or 5% topical p-menthane-3,8-diol (extracted
      from lemon eucalyptus) and a topical Mupirocin arm, which will be applied topically twice a
      day till resolution of symptoms. Follow-up will occur weekly until resolution of symptoms,
      which is expected within 2 weeks. Photographs, disease severity assessment and lesional swabs
      for culture will be taken at recruitment and as progress.
