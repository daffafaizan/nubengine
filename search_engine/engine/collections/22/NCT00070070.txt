        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine, BCG, and sargramostim
           (GM-CSF) in post-cystectomy patients with transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder
           expressing NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 antigen.

        -  Determine the immunological profile (NY-ESO-1 antibody, CD8+ cells, and delayed-type
           hypersensitivity) induced by this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive NY-ESO-1 peptide vaccine mixed with BCG intradermally (ID) once weekly on
      weeks 1 and 2. Patients then receive NY-ESO-1 peptide mixed with sargramostim (GM-CSF) ID
      once weekly on day 2 of weeks 3-6. Patients also receive GM-CSF subcutaneously alone on days
      1, 3, 4, and 5 of weeks 3-6. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 2 and 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-28 patients (8 HLA-A2 positive with prior intravesical BCG,
      8 HLA-A2 positive without prior intravesical BCG, 4-6 HLA-A2 negative with prior intravesical
      BCG, and 4-6 HLA-A2 negative without prior intravesical BCG) will be accrued for this study
      within 15 months.
