      custom scleral contact lenses to further improve vision in keratoconus or irregular
      astigmatism by reducing residual aberrations. The derived custom scleral lenses will include
      customized aberration correcting optics, guided by a wavefront aberrometer measurements.
      These lenses are custom made based on the individual measurements from an eye.The primary
      objective of this study is to evaluate the vision differences between traditional scleral
      lens optics and customized scleral lens optics. In particular, the investigators will compare
      efficacy in reducing aberrations and improvement in vision.
