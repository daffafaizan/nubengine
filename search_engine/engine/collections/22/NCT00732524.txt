      services at John H. Stroger Hospital of Cook County serving a largely uninsured/underserved
      population. Individuals more than 18 years of age with DM2, either with new onset DM2 or
      known diabetics who did not take oral hypoglycemic agents for more than 2 weeks, presenting
      with fasting blood glucose (FBG) 300-500 mg/dl or random blood glucose (RBG) 400-700 mg/dl
      and who did not have any exclusion criteria listed in Table 1, were eligible for the study.
      Subjects were randomized to one of the two fixed dose treatment groups: 1) Glipizide XL 10 mg
      orally daily prior to breakfast (G group), 2) Glipizide XL 10 mg orally daily along with
      Insulin Glargine 10 units at bedtime, subcutaneously (G+G group).
