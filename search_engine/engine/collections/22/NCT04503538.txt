    
      Primary Objective: To determine feasibility of telemedicine for outpatient cytokine release
      syndrome and neurotoxicity assessment (how many telemedicine visits successfully completed
      per patient)

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  To determine how many times a telemedicine visit triggered an action (inpatient
           admission/ outpatient observation status)

        -  To determine how many patients were detected to have cytokine release syndrome and/or
           neurotoxicity based on their telemedicine visit
