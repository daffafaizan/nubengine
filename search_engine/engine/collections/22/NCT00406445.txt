      mutated genes in human cancers, dose dependently modulates the balance between the
      utilization of oxidative and glycolytic pathways for energy generation in human colon cancer
      cells and mouse liver mitochondria. Though morphologically similar to their wild-type
      littermates, mice deficient in p53 display a gene dose-dependent decrease in aerobic exercise
      capacity, implying that p53 has functions beyond its well characterized cell cycle
      activities. These current findings have broad implications in fields ranging from cancer and
      aging research to cardiovascular physiology.

      In the Li-Fraumeni familial cancer syndrome (LFS), affected individuals harbor a germline
      mutation in TP53, hence they are heterozygous with reduced wild-type p53 activity. We
      hypothesize that the heterozygous individuals will display alterations in aerobic capacity
      and metabolism that previously has been unappreciated. This IRB proposal translates our
      experimental observation to human subjects in collaboration with extramural groups studying
      this rare familial syndrome. The results may not only help clarify why mutations of p53 gene
      are so common in cancers by potentially conferring metabolic advantages in tumorigenesis, but
      they may also give us an opportunity to understand a fundamental regulatory mechanism in
      cellular energy generation relevant to other processes.
