    
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an Autoadjusting CPAP machine is better than the
      regular CPAP machine in treatment of Obstructive Sleep Apnea in the postoperative setting.

      Patients with known Obstructive Sleep Apnea who are on CPAP therapy at home and undergo an
      elective surgery (meeting specified inclusion and exclusion criteria) will be randomized to
      either using Autoadjusting CPAP vs their usual CPAP at their prescribed settings the night
      after surgery. During that night, they will be monitored with full polysomnography in their
      hospital bed.
