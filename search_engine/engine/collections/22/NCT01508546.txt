      To compare the efficacy of conservative surgery, with or without axillary lymphnode removal
      (quadrantectomy with axillary dissection (QUAD) vs. quadrantectomy alone (QU)) followed by
      adjuvant treatment.

      To plan no adjuvant therapy vs. adjuvant therapy (eA+CMF+TAM regimen) based on a biological
      panel of the primary tumor in the QU group (defined as good panel (GP) ( ER+, and up to one
      unfavourable features (G3, Her2+++, Laminin Receptor+) or bad panel (BP)(ER-, or ER+ and more
      than one unfavourable features), whereas in QUAD group based on good factor ( N-, ER+ and
      GI-II disease (GF)) or bad factor ( N+ or GIII or ER- disease (BF)).

      To determine the relationship between the biological variables (hormone receptor status,
      grading, Laminin receptor, and c-erbB2) and the clinical outcome of the disease in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE This is a randomized unicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 o 2 treatment
      arms.

      Arm 1: patients undergo conservative surgery with axillary lymphnodes removal Arm 2: patients
      undergo conservative surgery without axillary lymphnodes removal Post-operative adjuvant
      strategy was previously described.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for the first two years, every 6 months for the
      following two years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECT ACCRUAL 600 patients will be accrued for this study over 4 years
