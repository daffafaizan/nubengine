      methods after thyroidectomy in a resource limited setting.

      Study population: All adult patients aged between 18 to 79 years who attended the
      endocrinology outpatient clinic and had been diagnosed with goiter.

      Study Participants: All adult patients with goiters who were eligible for thyroidectomy
      Inclusion criteria: All adult patients aged between 18 to 79 years with a diagnosis of goiter
      who consented to participate in the study.

      Exclusion criteria: The investigators excluded patients with goiter who had a history
      suggestive of bleeding tendencies, recurrent goiter, and thyroid cancer with fixation of the
      thyroid gland to surrounding structures and had uncontrolled co-morbidities such as diabetes
