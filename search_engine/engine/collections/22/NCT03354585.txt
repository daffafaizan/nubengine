      mindfulness and have been diagnosed with chronic low-back pain. Your participation is
      voluntary. We will randomly assign 40 subjects to each group for the initiation of the final
      phase of the study. Randomization means that you have a one in two chance of being assigned
      to the mindfulness meditation training or book-listening control intervention. Your
      assignment is based on chance rather than a medical decision made by the researchers.
