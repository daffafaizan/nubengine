      satiety. The proposal integrates investigation of human volunteers and laboratory rodents
      throughout the life course, applying imaging and other cutting edge technologies to critical
      research questions. Full4Health will combine study of the mechanisms of hunger and satiety
      with intervention studies to validate the effects of the relevant food characteristics on the
      regulation of satiety/hunger. The development of cerebral responses to food through the
      gut-brain axis across lifespan particularly during childhood, adolescence and elderly will be
      studied.
