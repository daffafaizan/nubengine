      frequency and severity of high blood sugar (hyperglycemia) and the need for continuous
      intravenous insulin infusion (CII) in the intensive care unit (ICU) in patients with type 2
      diabetes (T2D) undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. In addition, the study
      seeks to determine whether treatment with sitagliptin is effective in maintaining glycemic
      control and in preventing the need for subcutaneous (SC) insulin therapy in patients with T2D
      during the transition from intensive care unit (ICU) to regular floor in cardiac surgery
      patients with T2D.
