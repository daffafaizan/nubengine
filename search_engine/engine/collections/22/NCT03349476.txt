      fast anatomical mapping (mFAM) to create left atrial (LA) geometry for atrial fibrillation
      ablation.

      Specifically, the study will assess the following issues in atrial fibrillation ablation:

        1. Accuracy of map (defined as the distance between the ablation points and the surface of
           the mFAM geometry)

        2. Left atrial geometry creation time

        3. Fluoroscopy time

      The clinical team will hypothesize that this approach will lead to accurate LA geometry
      creation more rapidly and using less fluoroscopy than standard techniques
