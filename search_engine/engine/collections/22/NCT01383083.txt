      relevant systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, will develop pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) if
      left untreated. Persistent exposure of the pulmonary vasculature to increased blood flow, as
      well as increased pressure, may result in pulmonary obstructive arteriopathy, which leads to
      increased pulmonary vascular resistance that, if it approaches or exceeds systemic
      resistance, will result in shunt reversal. Eisenmenger's syndrome, the most advanced form of
      PAH associated with CHD, is defined as CHD with an initial large systemic-to-pulmonary shunt
      that induces severe pulmonary vascular disease and PAH, with resultant reversal of the shunt
      and central cyanosis. The histopathological and pathobiological changes seen in patients with
      PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts, such as endothelial dysfunction
      of the pulmonary vasculature, are considered similar to those observed in idiopathic or other
      associated forms of PAH.
