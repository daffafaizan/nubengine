      and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) in
      type 2 diabetes subjects with albuminuria. In the proposed study, the bioactive form of
      vitamin D (calcitriol) is being used for its ability to synergize with ACEI or ARB and
      prevent renal disease progression. The study expands on preliminary studies demonstrating a
      reduction in proteinuria with vitamin D analogue treatment, in subjects with both diabetic as
      well as non-diabetic kidney disease.
