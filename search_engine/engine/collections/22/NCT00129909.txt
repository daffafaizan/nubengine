      improved compliance with medication regimens. Although decreasing the frequency of drug
      taking does improve blood pressure control, whether fixed-dose combinations are more
      effective than taking multiple tablets is unknown. Additionally, notwithstanding the presence
      of excellent evidence-based recommendations for the treatment of hypertension, the choices
      for practitioners in regards to first line therapy is widening (and may be more confusing,
      especially in the setting of the proliferation of recommendations for a range of diseases).
      Whether a simplified treatment algorithm, consistent with the Canadian Hypertension Education
      Program (CHEP) guidelines but using a step-care approach, might improve management of
      hypertension is unknown. The current study will determine the effectiveness of a simplified
      treatment algorithm which incorporates early use of a fixed-dose combination therapy.

      This is a cluster randomized controlled trial. Approximately 50 family practices eligible for
      study participation will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to implement a treatment algorithm or
      to continue usual care for the management of hypertension. The randomization schedule will be
      stratified by the year of graduation of the family physician (< 1984 or â‰¥ 1984). Within each
      practice, 50 subjects will be managed according to the algorithm or usual care and will be
      followed for six months.
