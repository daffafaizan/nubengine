      biomedical indexes, but much more on the TCM syndrome(Chinese name:Zheng Hou)which is
      generalized from patients' TCM signs and symptoms. Thus, conventional medical curative
      effecacy evaluation system seems not to so fit for TCM clinical studies. Although many
      clinical studies from Chinese literature have reported the beneficial effects of various of
      TCM herbal agents in improving symptoms and signs as well as antagonism of specific
      pathological changes in CHD patients, most of these trials are lack of well-designed
      methodologies and the reliability of results still remains unclear. Therefore, we designed
      this clinical trial, with a randomized, placebo controlled way, to evaluate the curative
      effects of Xuefu Zhuyu capsule(a Chinese herbal medicine)in patients with Post-PCI CHD
      patients and find out whether this effects will be better displayed within subjects
      administered with syndrome-based individualized medication.
