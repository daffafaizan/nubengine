      of neoplastic lesions detected. Both factors are associated with adequate bowel cleansing.
      Poor cleansing ranged from 5% to 30% across studies, negatively affecting the efficiency of
      colonoscopy.

      The most important factor associated with poor colonic preparation is the past history of
      poor bowel preparation. However, there are no recommendations on the proper type of
      preparation in those patients. In two non-randomized studies inadequate cleansing in the
      second colonoscopy ranged from 9.8% to 23%. Randomized studies comparing high volume (3-4
      liters) with low volume (2 liters) PEG preparations, which are better tolerated by patients,
      are therefore needed before making any recommendations in this regard.
