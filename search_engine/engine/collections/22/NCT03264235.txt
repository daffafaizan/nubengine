      device while completing all training sessions. Group 2 will not wear the exoskeleton device
      during training sessions. All screening and evaluation sessions will be completed without the
      exoskeleton device for both Group 1 and Group 2. Pre and post-session vitals (blood pressure,
      heart rate) will be taken and monitored throughout the session as needed. Gait belts and/or
      overhead track and harnessing systems will be used throughout sessions as needed for
      increased safety of participants. Skin integrity will also be monitored both before and after
      each use of the exoskeleton device.

      Each enrolled participant will complete the following sessions:

      Session 1: Screening

        -  After consenting, subjects will undergo a physical evaluation and screening exam by a
           licensed physical therapist. If they meet study criteria, they will be randomly placed
           into either the Keeogo group or the traditional stair training group using a random
           number generator and they will be entered into the study. Once they are enrolled,
           baseline outcome measures will be assessed.

      Sessions 2 through 6: Training

        -  Subjects will participate in 30 minutes of stair training with or without the
           exoskeleton device, depending on group assignment.

      Session 7: Post-Testing

        -  Outcomes measures will once again be assessed by a licensed physical therapist.
