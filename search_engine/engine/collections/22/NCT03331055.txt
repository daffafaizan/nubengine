      cancer pain, lower back pain, neck pain, stomachache and so on.

      Effect and mechanism of PENS on pain relieving has been widely researched. With additional
      electrical stimulation in certain frequency and intensity to conventional acupuncture, pain
      controlling effect has been largely enhanced. However, invasive operation limits its
      application and acceptability, especially on pancreatic cancer.

      TENS is an advanced technique generated from PENS, which is much more welcome for its
      noninvasive character. Further more, its analgesic effect on cancer pain has been proved by
      several multi-central, randomized, clinical trials.
