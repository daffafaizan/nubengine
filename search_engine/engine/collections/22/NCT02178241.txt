      I. To estimate the objective response rate of gemcitabine (gemcitabine
      hydrochloride)-eribulin (eribulin mesylate) (GE) when given to cisplatin ineligible patients
      with advanced or unresectable urothelial carcinoma who have not received any prior
      chemotherapy for the advanced disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the median progression-free survival (PFS). II. To summarize the toxicity
      profile (using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] version [v] 4 criteria)
      of the GE regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8
      and eribulin mesylate IV over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 36
      months.
