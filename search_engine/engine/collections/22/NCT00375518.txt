      contribute to the initiation and severity of cardiopulmonary complications after thoracic
      surgery.

      Aim 1. To determine whether prophylactic administration of atorvastatin attenuates the
      inflammatory and oxidative response to surgery and significantly reduces the composite risk
      of cardiovascular morbidity (atrial fibrillation (AF), acute coronary syndrome, myocardial
      infarction (MI), cerebrovascular accident (CVA), pulmonary embolism) and mortality within 30
      days after thoracic surgery.

      Aim 2. To explore whether prophylactic administration of atorvastatin attenuates the
      inflammatory and oxidative (CRP, IL-6, TNF, and MPO) response to surgery and significantly
      reduces the overall risk of pulmonary complications (atelectasis, pneumonia, pneumonitis,
      acute respiratory failure) after thoracic surgery.

      Aim 3. To explore the association of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) changes in genes
      linked to atrial fibrillation and inflammatory markers and development of pulmonary morbidity
      after thoracic surgery.

      Aim 4. To explore whether an imbalance between metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and its inhibitor
      (TIMP) is associated with postoperative atrial fibrillation risk and/or development of
      pulmonary morbidity after thoracic surgery.
