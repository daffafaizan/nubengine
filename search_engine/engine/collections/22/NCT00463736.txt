      to the commmon usage of antenatal steroids and prophylactic maternal antibiotics. In most
      studies, tocolysis was not attempted prior to the onset of labor in this group of women. The
      ACOG Practice Bulletin of June 1998 concedes that the recommendation of tocolysis to permit
      administration of steroids and maternal antibiotics is based primarily upon consensus, not
      consistent scientific evidence.

      The purpose of this study, which will randomize 128 subjects to tocolysis or no tocolysis, is
      to prospectively assess whether short term (48 hr) tocolysis affords benefit to women and
      babies between 26 and 32 weeks gestation with PPROM.

      Subjects will be enrolled at 1-2 high risk hospitals in Chattanooga and Knoxville. All
      English and Spanish speaking women 18-45 years with PPROM and cervical dilation <4 will be
      eligible. Women with suspected intrauterine infection, positive fetal lung maturity, or > 6
      hours tocolysis at time of admission will be excluded.

      Both groups of women will receive continuous fetal monitoring, antibiotics, and antenatal
      steroids (if not previously administered). Both groups will be evaluated every 2-4 hours for
      fetal and maternal well being. Both groups will receive IVF at 125cc/hr, and the treatment
      group will be loaded with 4 grams of magnesium sulfate and receive maintainence dose of 2
      grams/hr x 48 hrs.
