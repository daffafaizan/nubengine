      evaluated lymphokine-activated killer cells and tumor-infiltrating cells. In metastatic renal
      cell carcinoma, these therapies have shown some complete responses and a low toxicity. In our
      study, we evaluate the response to a new therapeutic strategy which combines an injection of
      patient's own activated lymphocytes to a classic immunotherapy with interferon-Î± and
      interleukin-2. A secondary objective is to improve cell preparation methods and to
      characterize functionally and phenotypically injected cells.
