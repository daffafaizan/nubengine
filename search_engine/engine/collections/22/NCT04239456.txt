      who will receive memory strategy training and complete three memory modules of the RehaCom at
      one of the Kessler Foundation locations. Changes in attention, processing speed,
      verbal/non-verbal new learning and memory (NLM) and executive control will be assessed via
      pre/post and 3-month follow-up assessments before and after the 8-10 week intervention.
      Self-report questionnaires will also track functional and emotional outcomes such as mood and
      anxiety, cognition, quality of life, self-efficacy, deficit awareness, community
      participation, and readiness for occupational functioning
