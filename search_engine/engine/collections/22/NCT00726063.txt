      the Nanotite vs. the standard Ossotite implants when placed by graduate students with little
      or no prior experience. Enrolled patients will have the study site(s) randomized to either a
      Nanotite (test) or an Osseotite (control) implant. The manner of treatment observed at the
      participating center will be followed for this study.

      Study Hypothesis: The performance of the Nanotite implant in this study will be no different
      than or superior to that of the Osseotite implant placed during the early period of graduate
      student training.
