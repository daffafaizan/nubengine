      Tonometry. Submacular choroidal blood flow is measured with Laser Doppler Flowmetry. During
      both examinations the systemic blood pressure is continuously recorded with Finometer. An
      average systolic and diastolic LDF parameter flow during 30 seconds are determined and the
      pulsatility index is calculated according to the formula (LDFsys-LDFdia)/LDFdia. An
      association of OPA with the LDF pulsatility index, systemic blood pressure values and mean
      intraocular pressure will be analysed.
