      syndrome patients in our hospital were asked to participate in the study. By a declaration of
      consent the patients were randomized in two different groups.

      Group 1: started with CPAP at the first night and continued with Bi-level- APAP at the second
      night.

      Group 2: began with Bi-level-APAP and ended with CPAP

      Patients will be discharged with CPAP after the second night
