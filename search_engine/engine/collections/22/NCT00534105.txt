      exaggerated lipid response compared to non-gestational diabetics. If a difference is noted,
      further studies will explore the possibility of screening gestational diabetics during their
      pregnancy for hyperlipidemia to determine if prenatal screening can predict postpartum risk
      for hyperlipidemia. In addition the relationship, if any between maternal lipid dysfunction
      and placental disease will be explored. Subsequent studies could also explore the possible
      perinatal complications associated with elevated lipids and or metabolic syndrome.

      C. Experimental Design, Methodology and Expected Results

      Study Design:

      We propose a prospective cohort design.

      Study Population:

      All women that are scheduled to receive a three hour GTT to rule out gestational diabetes
      would be identified and ask to enroll in this study. Specifically, eligible patients will be
      women who failed their glucose challenge test (GCT) and are scheduled for the follow-up three
      hour glucose tolerance test (GTT). The GCT is routinely performed among all prenatal care
      patients at 24-28 wks gestation. The 3 hour GTT requires patients to be fasting overnight. A
      fasting blood glucose is sampled, and the patients are given a 100 gram glucose drink. Serum
      glucose samples are then taken at one, two and three hours after the glucose loading. The
      "exposed" group will be defined as women diagnosed with GDM (elevated glucose values on two
      or more samples in the three hour GTT). The "unexposed" group will be defined as women with
      no abnormal glucose values in the three hour GTT.
