      trial in women undergoing female pelvic reconstructive surgery with vaginal native tissue
      repair with same-day discharge planned.

      Duration of catheterization, postoperative urinary tract infection rates, patient level of
      satisfaction, Emergency Department (ED) visits and adverse events postoperatively will also
      be compared between women receiving Tamsulosin versus placebo.

      Patients will be offered participation in the study at their postoperative visit if they meet
      study criteria. Once consent is obtained, patients will be randomized to receive Tamsulosin
      0.4 mg orally once daily or matching placebo capsules for a total of 10 days starting 5 days
      pre-operatively.
