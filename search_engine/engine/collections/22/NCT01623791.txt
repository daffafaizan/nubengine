      consisted of severe preeclamptic patients. The predictive values of the spot urinary dipstick
      proteinuria and protein/creatinin ratio were determinant and the correlations of the
      diagnostic test of 24 hour total proteinuria were evaluated. The correlations of the severity
      of the disease and the tests of the proteinuria were evaluated.
