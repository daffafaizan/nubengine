      scalp and around the body. This pilot RCT aims to test a newly developed Alopecia-specific,
      psychological intervention with 8 patients diagnosed with enduring Alopecia. The intervention
      is an Integrative Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, implemented through a protocolled programme
      entailing 12 weeks of hourly individual sessions. The trial will be delivered at The
      Dermatology Department at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London. The pilot study aims
      to evaluate the impact of the intervention on patients' psychological and physical symptoms
      (stress, anxiety, depression, quality of life, scalp hair, and other bio-markers) compared to
      the wait-list control group.
