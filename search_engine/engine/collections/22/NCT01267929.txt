      recruited from Thammasat University Hospital and Rajanukul institute. Informed consent was
      obtained from the participants' parents before participation in this study. The participants
      were randomly assigned according to the randomization list to receive either the mirror
      neurons stimulation based VCD program and practice at home or conventional physical therapy
      for six months. The participants in the experiment group received the mirror neurons
      stimulation based VCD program and practice at home three times a day for six months.
      Concerning the control group, the participants received conventional physical therapy
      regularly at the hospital once a week for first two months and twice a month for last four
      months. Both experimental and control groups were measured their motor functions with gross
      motor function measure (GMFM-66).
