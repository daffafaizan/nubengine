      national perinatal survey. Labor induction could be associated with a higher risk of fetal
      and maternal complications, justifying its assessment from a population-based prospective
      cohort.

      Several methods (dinoprostone, oxytocin, misoprostol, balloon catheter â€¦) are used to induce
      labor in France. To decide and perform labor inductions, physicians can refer to published
      guidelines according to specific obstetrical situations. But many of these guidelines are
      based on a low level of evidence probably explaining observed differences in practices.

      In some cases, labor induction is decided without indication, and women's involvement in this
      kind of decisions is not really evaluated.

      The objectives are therefore :

        -  To evaluate the frequency of use of different methods for labor induction according to
           the cervix status, the indication of labor induction, and the place of the delivery.

        -  To analyse maternal, fetal and neonatal issues according to the different induction
           methods, taken into account the induction indications

        -  To compare current practices of labor induction to published national guidelines and to
           assess the impact of deviations from these guidelines on maternal and neonatal issues

        -  To assess women's satisfaction regarding the indication and the induction method used.
