      heart failure. The sub-study will include 40 of the patients with heart failure included in
      the main study. In the sub-study six additional measures will be performed at baseline and
      after 3 months in 20 study participants with heart failure in the intervention group;
      ergospirometry, echocardiography, Holter ECG, microcirculation using the epos system, maximal
      inspiratory and expiratory pressure. There will be four additional measures in 20
      participants from the control-group at baseline and after 3 months; Holter ECG,
      microcirculation using the epos system and maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure.
