      structured approach. Despite an increasing prevalence of adolescent depression in Taiwan, few
      studies have been conducted to evaluate the immediate and long-term effectiveness of CBT for
      community-based adolescents at risk for depression and suicide. Also, little is known about
      the effectiveness of the involvement of parents in CBT groups. The Adolescent Coping with
      Depression Course (CWDA) (19) is an effective CBT-oriented group intervention for adolescent
      depression. However, it has not been tested in specific cultural groups. The primary purpose
      of this study was therefore to compare the immediate and long-term effectiveness of CBT
      alone, CBT with parental education, and control groups for community-based adolescents at
      risk for depression and suicide.A quasi-experimental research design was used in this study.
      Community-based high school students at risk for depression and suicide were recruited and
      assigned to one of two experimental groups or a control group. Students in the experimental
      groups received CBT plus parental education (group A, n = 9) or CBT alone (group B, n = 10).
      The control group was designed as a waiting list group (group C, n = 12). Both experimental
      groups received a follow-up session 1 year after the intervention. Several outcome variables
      (depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, cognitive triad, learned resourcefulness [LR], and
      salivary cortisol level) were used to determine the effectiveness of treatment.
