        -  To determine whether overall survival is improved in patients with asymptomatic,
           unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy alone versus surgery
           followed by chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (control arm): Patients receive systemic chemotherapy according to standard local
           practice. Patients who develop symptoms from their primary tumor receive treatment as
           required including surgery, if indicated.

        -  Arm II (experimental arm): Patients undergo surgery at the discretion of the surgeon.
           Beginning 8 weeks after completion of surgery, patients receive chemotherapy according
           to standard local practice.

      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires (EQ-5D) at baseline and then periodically
      during and after completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
