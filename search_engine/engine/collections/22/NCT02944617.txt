    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if adding Activia yogurt (containing Bifidobacterium lactis DN-173 010) to
      the diet of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) increases the level of
      Bifidobacterium spp in stool.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if Activia reduces the incidence of diarrhea for mRCC patients treated with
      vascular endothelial growth factor - tyrosine kinase inhibitor (VEGF-TKI) therapy.

      II. To compare pre-treatment levels of circulating T regulatory (Treg) cells and levels of
      peripheral signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3) in patients with and
      without diarrhea with VEGF-TKI therapy, and correlate with Bifidobacterium, other bacteria,
      and Activia.

      III. To determine if patients with the diarrhea in mRCC patients treated with VEGF-TKI
      therapy have a lower baseline of Bifidobacterium spp.

      IV. To assess the change in global stool bacteriomic profile of patients receiving therapy
      with VEGF-TKI therapy with or without Activia.

      V. To better assess the feasibility of stool collection and bacteriomic profiling.

      VI. To explore association between psychosocial symptoms (anxiety and depression) and
      bacteriomic profile and gastrointestinal toxicity in mRCC patients receiving VEGF-TKI therapy
      therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive probiotic supplement Activia yogurt twice daily (QD) during weeks
      2-13 of VEGF-TKI treatment.

      ARM II: Patients avoid any intake of yogurt or yogurt-containing foods and refrain from
      taking/consuming other probiotic supplements for 3 months.
