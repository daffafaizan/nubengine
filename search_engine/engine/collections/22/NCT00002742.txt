      empiric treatment of persistent febrile neutropenic patients. II. Compare the incidence of
      drug-related toxicity or impairment and infusion-related toxicity in patients treated with
      liposomal nystatin vs standard amphotericin B. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of
      liposomal nystatin.

      OUTLINE: Randomized, double-blind study. Arm I: Antifungal Therapy. Liposomal Nystatin. Arm
      II: Antifungal Therapy. Amphotericin B, NSC-527017.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 350 evaluable patients will be studied in this multicenter trial.
