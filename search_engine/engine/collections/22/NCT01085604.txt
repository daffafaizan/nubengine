      is an important finding in a large number of patients with recurrent and chronic low back
      pain and may play a role in recurrence of symptoms. Despite findings of altered trunk motor
      control in individuals with low back pain, the neuromuscular strategies underlying these
      alterations have not been satisfactorily characterized. The aims of this study are to(1)
      identify which neural control strategies are altered following a rehabilitation program that
      emphasizes trunk control and stability using a motor learning approach and (2) provide
      preliminary evidence of a link between hypothesized mechanism and effectiveness for programs
      designed to improve trunk control.
