      frequently triggering metabolic decompensation, multiorgan dysfunction, and neurologic
      deterioration. In the context of the recent COVID19 pandemic, people with mitochondrial
      disease are at increased risk for severe disease and poor outcomes if infected. However, the
      mechanisms for this link between infection and clinical decline are incompletely understood.
      Given that people with mitochondrial disease are particularly susceptible to infection and
      may experience delayed recovery, we hypothesize that this is in part due to immune factors
      that influence host-pathogen interactions. The purpose of this protocol is to collect
      biological specimens to identify immune signatures that contribute to the phenotype of
      infection and outcomes in patients with mitochondrial disease who become ill during the
      COVID19 pandemic. In order to compare these cases with others of similar genetic backgrounds
      and environmental exposures, we will also collect specimens from family members. We will then
      examine how these signatures correlate with comprehensive quantifiable clinical measures
      throughout the course of disease, from presenting symptoms, through acute decompensation,
      stabilization and convalescence. While this protocol is developed during the COVID-19
      pandemic with a focus on a specific infectious pathogen, we hope that this study will extend
      beyond the pandemic in an effort to more broadly understand acute infectious illness in
      patients with mitochondrial disease. Additionally, it will serve as a remote adjunct to the
      NIH MINI Study, a natural history study focused on the immunophenotype of mitochondrial
      disease that is conducted at the NIH Clinical Center.
