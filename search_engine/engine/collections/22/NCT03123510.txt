      2 groups; Group A will follow the conventional coaching and diet plan, while group B will
      also receive a daily dose of the synbiotic treatment (group A will receive a placebo
      supplement similar in appearance and caloric content to the synbiotic treatment). Volunteers
      will be followed for 6 months, and weight loss, waist circumference, BMI and glucose and
      cholesterol levels will be assessed monthly. Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) will be
      used to analyze body composition at the beginning and end of the dietary interventions. Fecal
      samples will be obtained at the beginning and the end of the study. Because both our pre- and
      probiotic supplements have been reported to increase the concentration of satiating
      bacteria-derived metabolites, we expect that the individuals on the group B (synbiotic
      supplement) will experience a higher weight loss as well as more significant drops in glucose
      and cholesterol levels. Because synbiotic treatments have been reported to facilitate GI
      passage, the investigators expect volunteers in group B will also report improved bowels
      movements and general wellbeing.
