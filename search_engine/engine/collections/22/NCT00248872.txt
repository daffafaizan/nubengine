    
      The objective of this randomized trial is to evaluate, among African American patients with
      poorly controlled hypertension, whether a novel intervention of positive affect induction and
      self-affirmation is more effective than usual care in increasing adherence to prescribed
      antihypertensive medications. The main outcome will be the change in medication adherence
      rate from enrollment to 12 months, which is defined as percentage (%) of prescribed doses
      taken by the patient during the interval of observation as measured by electronic medication
      event monitoring system (MEMS).

      2. Secondary objectives

        1. To determine, among African American patients with poorly controlled hypertension, the
           extent to which positive affect induction and self-affirmation influence patients'
           self-efficacy.

        2. To determine, among African American patients with poorly controlled hypertension, the
           extent to which positive affect induction and self-affirmation influence medication
           adherence in those with significant depressive symptomatology (CES-D score > 16).

        3. To determine, among African-American patients with poorly controlled hypertension, the
           extent to which positive affect induction and self-affirmation influence blood pressure
           control.

        4. To explore the health beliefs of hypertensive African-American patients, regarding the
           meaning, causes and treatment of hypertension. In addition, the factors that facilitate
           and prevent adherence to prescribed antihypertensive medications will also be explored
           using a qualitative approach.
