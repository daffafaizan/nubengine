    
      For each potential subject, there is a 28-day screening and eligibility assessment period
      before enrollment; the first dose of study treatment will be administered on Day 1 of Cycle 1
      (C1D1) (Safety population). Subjects will continue to receive their assigned treatment
      throughout the study until the occurrence of confirmed disease progression [progressive
      disease (PD)] by irRECIST, death, unacceptable treatment-related toxicity, or until the study
      is closed by the Sponsor. During the treatment period, study visits will occur on Day 1, Day
      2, Day 8, Day 15, Day 22 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 and Day 15 of every subsequent cycle. Subjects
      who experience a response [Complete Response (CR), Partial Response (PR)] â‰¥ 2 cycles, PD 1
      plus APL-101 combination will be continued until disease progression based on irRECIST.
      Subjects should receive a minimal of 2 cycles of PD-1 and APL-101 for adequate evaluation of
      response (Evaluable population). Discontinuation of PD-1 and APL-101 should occur upon
      determination of disease progression as determined by irRECIST, intolerable toxicity or when
      the risk/benefit ratio is no longer beneficial for the subjects as determined by the
      Principal Investigator, or upon subject withdrawal of consent. Upon permanent discontinuation
      of study treatment, there is a Treatment Termination visit and three monthly follow-up visits
      for a 90-day safety follow-up visit period. Subjects who drop out before they complete the
      first cycle of combination treatment for reasons other than toxicity will be replaced
