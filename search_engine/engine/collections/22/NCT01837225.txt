      fluorescent contrast and therefore increase tumor margin delineation using the PRODIGI device
      compared to standard white light or autofluorescence visualization. The goal of this
      observational study is to use intraoperative fluorescence imaging across all three patient
      cohorts (control, 15mg/kg 5-ALA, 30mg/kg 5-ALA) to determine if there is an increase in
      tumor-specific fluorescence contrast, and to select the optimum 5-ALA contrast agent dose.
      All patients across each cohort will receive conventional BCS and care independent of
      contrast agent dose. Data from this preliminary study will be used to guide the design of
      future statistically powered randomized controlled trials involving PRODIGI and 5-ALA.
      However, at this early stage our initial aim is to develop a baseline understanding of the
      5-ALA fluorescent signatures in normal and tumor breast tissues in the surgical setting.

      This technology has the potential to guide surgeons during BCS and reduce the re-incision
      rates by ensuring that the surgeons can properly identify tumor from normal tissue during
      surgery. If successful, this new fluorescence imaging technology may improve patient outcomes
      by reducing the likelihood of cancer recurrence, accelerating the recovery process and
      decreasing healthcare costs by eliminating the need for a second surgery.
