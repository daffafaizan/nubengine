      spine surgeons. Although ACDF with autologous bone graft and anterior plating is commonly
      performed, this procedure may be associated with postoperative dysphagia, significant costs
      and adjacent segment pathology. To address these concerns, a number of surgeons have opted to
      utilize an interbody cage in a stand-alone fashion with good to excellent results. However,
      the published data is limited and currently there in no consensus among spine surgeons
      regarding the best technique to achieve fusion and improve clinical outcomes in patients with
      degenerative disc disease in the cervical spine.
