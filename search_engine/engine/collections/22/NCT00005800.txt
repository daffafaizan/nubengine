        -  Evaluate the clinical and pathological response rate of sequential doxorubicin and
           docetaxel chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant treatment of women with stage III breast
           cancer.

        -  Measure signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) activation before and
           after this neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in this patient population.

        -  Correlate response to chemotherapy with STAT activation before and after this
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine how other potential predictors of response correlate with STAT activation by
           measuring Bcl-2, Bcl-xL, Bax protein levels, tyrosine kinase levels, growth rate of the
           tumor, and apoptotic index before and after this neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen in
           these patients.

        -  Correlate response to chemotherapy with levels of STAT activation in association with
           the presence of Bcl-2 proteins and tyrosine kinases, growth rate of the tumor, and
           apoptotic index in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the toxicity of this neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimen given in a dose-dense
           fashion in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin IV on day 1 every 2 weeks for 3 courses. After 3 weeks
      of rest, patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 every 2 weeks for 3 courses.
      Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously on days 3-10 of each doxorubicin and
      docetaxel course. Within 6 weeks of completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo
      surgery with mastectomy or lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years.
