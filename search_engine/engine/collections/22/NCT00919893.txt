      safety and efficacy of Cernilton, a standardized pollen extract, in men with inflammatory
      CP-CPPS (National Institutes of Health (NIH) type IIIA). Participants were randomized to
      Cernilton or placebo for 12 weeks and were evaluated using the National Institutes of Health
      Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) individual domains and total score, the number
      of leukocytes in post prostatic massage urine, the International Prostate Symptom Score
      (IPSS) and the sexuality domain of a life satisfaction questionnaire at baseline and after 6
      and 12 weeks.
