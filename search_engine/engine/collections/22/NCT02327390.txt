      I. Assess the safety and toxicity profile of repeated infusions of ex-vivo activated
      tumor-draining lymphocytes (X-ACT) in participants with advanced melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the feasibility of multiple infusions of X-ACT. II. Assess the effect of dose and
      schedule on immunologic parameters using two novel biomarkers.

      III. Observe the clinical outcomes of participants receiving X-ACT therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      STEP 1: Participants undergo lymph node biopsy for collection of at least one
      melanoma-draining lymph node (MDLN). MDLN cells will then be cryopreserved into aliquots
      until they are needed to generate an activated T cell culture.

      STEP 2: Cryopreserved lymph node cells are thawed and then undergo activation with
      anti-cluster of differentiation (CD)3/anti-CD28 microbeads. The cultures then undergo
      expansion over 14-18 days in the presence of recombinant human interleukin-2 and
      anti-vascular endothelial growth factor antibody. The activated X-ACT cells are then
      transferred i.v. into the same participant from which they were derived with no additional
      therapy.
