      Type 2 diabetes mellitus, which is becoming more prevalent in our society as the population
      ages, is one of the strongest risk factors for coronary artery disease (CAD) and consequent
      mortality. In addition to generating an enormous toll in human suffering, diabetes places an
      economic burden approaching 100 billion dollars annually on the U.S. health care system.
      Despite the well known dismal prognosis of diabetes complicated by angiographically
      documented CAD, the optimal treatment paradigm for this large group of patients has not been
      studied. Coronary revascularization, while increasingly used, has not been directly shown to
      be of additional benefit to simultaneous intensive medical management of CAD along with
      management of hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other risk factors. Moreover,
      while intensive efforts to lower HbA1c have been demonstrated to favorably affect the
      clinical course of Type 2 diabetes mellitus in terms of microvascular complications, the
      optimal hyperglycemia management strategy with regard to macrovascular outcome is not known.

      These critical treatment dilemmas have motivated the development of BARI 2D, a multicenter
      randomized trial designed to determine in patients with Type 2 diabetes and stable CAD: 1)
      the efficacy of initial elective coronary revascularization combined with aggressive medical
      therapy, compared to an initial strategy of aggressive medical therapy alone; and 2) the
      efficacy of a strategy of providing more insulin (endogenous or exogenous), versus a strategy
      of increasing sensitivity to insulin (reducing insulin resistance), in the management of
      hyperglycemia, with a target HbA1c level of less than 7.0% for each strategy.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The BARI 2D trial is a multicenter study that uses a 2x2 factorial design, with 2400 patients
      being assigned at random to initial elective revascularization with aggressive medical
      therapy or aggressive medical therapy alone with equal probability, and simultaneously being
      assigned at random to an insulin providing or insulin sensitizing strategy of glycemic
      control (with a target value for HbA1c of less than 7.0% for all patients). Following
      confirmation of patient eligibility and provision of written consent, patients were
      randomized as shown below:

      Number of Patients Per Treatment Assignment (N=2400 patients in total)

      Stable Ischemic Heart Disease Treatment Strategy and Glycemic Control Strategy:

      Revascularization and Insulin Providing (IP) N=600; Revascularization and Insulin Sensitizing
      (IS) N=600; Medical and Insulin Providing (IP) N=600; Medical and and Insulin Sensitizing
      (IS) N=600.
