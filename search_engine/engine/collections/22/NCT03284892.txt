      (PED) increasing the risk of penetration, aspiration, and aspiration pneumonia. Up to 84% of
      extubated patients had PED and approximately 60% penetrated and aspirated that can lead to
      aspiration pneumonia. The aims of this three-year, two-stage study are: 1) to develop a
      two-step PED Screen involved oral stereognosis and cough reflex test for detecting
      penetration and aspiration, using a diagnostic accuracy study method; and 2) to test effects
      of a once daily, 7-day PED Care intervention on reducing time to resume oral intake, rates of
      penetration and intervention at 10 days postextubation, and incidences of 30-day aspiration
      pneumonia in adult patients with prolonged intubation (â‰¥48 hours) from a medical center in
      Taiwan, using a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design.
