      stimulation on control autonomic and peripheral function in heart failure patients
      hospitalized for treatment of the syndrome. A randomized clinical trial with 30 advanced
      heart failure patients will be randomly assigned to functional electrical stimulation
      (Functional EE, n= 15) e 2) sensory electrical stimulation (Sensory EE, n=15). The functional
      electrical stimulation will be applied in the rectus femoris, and gastrocnemius, with
      frequency of 10 Hz, pulse duration of 150 ms, stimulation time (time on) of 20 seconds,
      resting time (time off) of 20 seconds and intensity according to the discomfort threshold of
      the patient , checked every day until achieve a maximum of 70mA. The session will last 60
      minuts. It will be held every weekday for a period of 10 days. The effects of interventions
      on functional capacity, autonomic control, peripheral function, peripheral muscle strength
      and quality of life will be analyzed at baseline and at the end of the protocol.
