      If you are eligible and agree to take part in the study, you will be assigned to a dose level
      of nerium oleander based on when you join this study. Up to 5 dose levels of nerium oleander
      will be tested. At least 3 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group
      of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will receive a higher dose
      than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen. This will continue until
      the highest tolerable dose of nerium oleander is found.

      You will take nerium oleander by mouth by placing it under your tongue. You should hold the
      nerium oleander under your tongue for 3 minutes before swallowing. It is very important for
      you to hold the nerium oleander under your tongue for 3 full minutes. Holding it under your
      tongue for 3 minutes before swallowing helps your body to take in the highest amount of the
      drug that you can receive. If you hold the nerium oleander under your tongue for less than 3
      minutes, your body will not receive as much of the study drug and may not possibly benefit as
      much. You will take nerium oleander 3 times a day while participating in this study. Nerium
      oleander should be taken on an empty stomach or at least 15 minutes before any large meal, to
      help your body take in as much of the drug as possible.

      Study Visits:

      Each of your chemotherapy cycles are 21 days.

      Each week while on study, you will complete the questionnaire about any symptoms you may be
      having. It should take about 5 minutes to complete it each time.

      Cycle 1:

      On Day -7 (7 days before you start chemotherapy):

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your physical and mental health. It should
           take about 5 minutes to complete it.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn 6 times over 8 hours for
           pharmacokinetic (PK) testing. PK testing measures the amount of study drug in the body
           at different time points.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to learn if the study drug is reducing
           inflammation.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test the effect of the study drug on your
           immune system.

      On Day -6, blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn 1 time for PK testing.

      On Day 1 (the day you start chemotherapy):

        -  You will be asked about any symptoms you may be having or drugs you may be taking.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of weight and vital signs.

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  You will complete the questionnaire about your physical and mental health.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons each time) will be drawn 6 times over 8 hours for PK testing.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to learn if the study drug is reducing
           inflammation.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test the effect of the study drug on your

      On Day 2:

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for PK testing.

        -  Blood (about 6 teaspoons) will be drawn to learn if the study drug is reducing
           inflammation.

        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn to test the effect of the study drug on your
           immune system.
