      effectiveness of diclofenac suppositories in the prevention of side effects of BCG bladder
      irrigation in bladder cancer patients. After signing an informed consent, the patients will
      be randomized to either receive an unmarked suppository of Diclofenac or a placebo
      suppository. The effectiveness of the drug will be tested weekly by quality of life
      questionnaires and bladder symptom questionnaire. Another questionnaire is designed to
      monitor the time in minutes that the BCG is retained in the bladder before the patients
      urinates.
