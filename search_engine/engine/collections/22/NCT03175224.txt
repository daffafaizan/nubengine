    
      This is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, global, open-label, 2-part study with a Dose Escalation
      Segment and Dose and Disease Expansion Cohorts study of APL-101, a c-MET inhibitor, to
      determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and dose limiting toxicities for APL-101, and
      to obtain preliminary efficacy and target engagement data, in subjects with NSCLC and
      advanced malignancies with c-Met dysregulation.

      c-MET dysregulation will be determined from historical results by molecular pre-screening
      evaluations to determine eligibility of enrollment for both the Dose Escalation Segment
      (Phase 1) and Dose and Disease Expansion Cohorts (Phase 2).

      Dose escalation will occur until a protocol defined dose limited toxicity (DLT) occurs and a
      tentative maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.

      Once dose is determined, five cohort groups will be further evaluated:

        -  Cohort A-1: NSCLC EXON 14 skip mutation (c-Met naïve, 1L)

        -  Cohort A-2: NSCLC EXON 14 skip mutation (c-Met naïve, 2/3L),

        -  Cohort B: NSCLC EXON 14 skip mutation (c-Met experienced; progressed on prior c-Met
           inhibitor),

        -  Cohort C: basket of tumor types (with c-Met high-level amplifications),

        -  Cohort D: basket of tumor types (with c-Met fusions)
