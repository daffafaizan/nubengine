      transplantation, the overall outcome is poor. In this study, we design a treatment protocol
      aiming to achieve complete remission for this high-risk group of patients with chemotherapy
      consisting of Cladribine (5mg/m2), cytarabine (1.5g/m2) and mitoxantrone （10mg/m2）for 5 days
      followed by infusion of mobilized peripheral stem cell from the original donor. For patients
      who failed to achieved remission,a second cycles will be given. For patients who achieved
      remission, the post-remission therapy is open depend on patient's intent: consolidation with
      one more cycle, second allo-HSCT with different donor or continuous DLI.
