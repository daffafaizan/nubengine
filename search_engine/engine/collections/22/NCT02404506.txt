      well-tolerated and effective first line treatment is warranted. In this specific population
      often there are contra-indications for the use of standard first line drugs like
      anthracyclines and taxanes due to comorbidities (e.g. cardiac impairment or Peripheral
      neuropathy). Response rates in first line treatment with taxanes and anthracyclines usually
      do not exceed 30%. Eribulin has shown a response rate of 29% and a clinical benefit rate
      (corresponding to the investigators primary endpoint) of 52% in first line, so the
      investigators expect similar efficacy, but less toxicity.

      Optimal dose, schedule and tolerability of this drug in the first line setting are unknown in
      the elderly population. No information on dose modifications in this population is available.
      Based on the data of eribulin in the first line with higher efficacy in those patients with
      dose reductions, the SAKK 25/14 trial investigates the reduced starting-dose of eribulin of
      1.1mg/m2 for this vulnerable population of elderly patients. Growth factors to maintain a
      certain dose level of eribulin are not recommended, respecting the international guidelines.

      SAKK has a tradition in conducting trials in the elderly population, such as SAKK 25/99 in
      metastatic breast cancer, SAKK 38/08 in aggressive B-cell-Lymphoma, SAKK 41/10 in metastatic
      colorectal cancer.
