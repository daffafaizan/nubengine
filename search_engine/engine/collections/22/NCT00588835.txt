    
      Aprepitant acts initially as a moderate inhibitor of CYP3A4 followed by a short period of
      CYP3A4 induction. Etoposide is a substrate of CYP3A4 and may therefore be suvject to a drug
      interaction with aprepitant.

      CE can be classified as a highly emetogenic chemotherapeutic regimen and the use of
      aprepitant may therefore be considered when no clinically relevant drug interaction with
      etoposide can be determined.
