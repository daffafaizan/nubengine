      or 50 cryoballoon approaches. To insure the consecutiveness of recruitment, participating
      centers have to announce the intention to ablate the patient prior to the procedure to the
      coordinating center in Ludwigshafen. After inclusion of 500 patients with well accepted
      criteria for AF ablation undergoing cryoballoon pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in experienced
      german EP centers inclusion of patients will be extended to european centers. A total of
      4.000 patients will be included in the cohort-study, 2.000 in both the cryoballoon and the RF
      arm.
