      food allergic individuals. While oral immunotherapy (OIT) can lead to desensitization, it
      remains uncertain whether this treatment can lead to lasting protection. Therefore, this
      study aims to use the Chinese herbal formula in combination with OIT to determine whether
      sustained protection can be achieved. All subjects will receive multi-allergen OIT, along
      with a 4 month course of omalizumab to provide added safety for the initial dose escalation
      and build up phases. Subjects will be randomized to receive active Chinese herbal formula or
      placebo. Subjects will be treated with OIT for 2 years and then food challenges will be
      performed to assess for desensitization. For those who achieve desensitization, all
      treatments will be discontinued and food challenges will be performed 3 months later to
      assess for sustained unresponsiveness.
