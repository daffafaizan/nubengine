      corneal blindness in patients who are no longer candidates for penetrating keratoplasty.The
      global incidence of corneal blindness is estimated to be 6-8 million. In India there are
      approximately 6.8 million cases of unilateral corneal blindness and 1.3 million people with
      bilateral corneal pathology.

      Eligible subjects after getting informed consent will be included in this study. All the
      subjects will have pre-operative evaluation which includes history, visual acuity,
      Intraocular pressure (IOP), evaluation of tear film and ultrasound A and B scan. Ocular
      inflammation will be controlled prior to surgery. Keratoplasty will be performed with
      keratoprosthesis under local anesthesia. Patients will be followed up at regular interval to
      assess the outcome variables.
