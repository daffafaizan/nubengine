      bilateral tinnitus for at least 6 months will be included in the study. Patients will be
      randomly assigned using a random number generation randomization method into rTMS stimulation
      group (group 1), sham stimulation group (group 2) and group with medicament therapy only
      (group 3). Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (frequency 25 Hz; 300 pulses; 80% resting motor
      threshold=RMT) and primary auditory cortex on both sides (1 Hz; 1000 pulses; 110% RMT) will
      be stimulated in patients in rTMS stimulation group for 5 consecutive days. Both the patients
      and outcome assessor were blinded to the intervention group in which the patients (rTMS and
      shame stimulation group) belonged to. Medicament therapy in group 3 will consist of ginkgo
      biloba extract EGb 761 once a day for 6 months. There will be no medicament therapy for
      tinnitus in group 1 and 2. Tinnitus reaction questionnaire (TRQ), tinnitus handicap
      questionnaire (THQ), tinnitus handicap inventory (THI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI),
      pure-tone audiometry with Fowler scoring of hearing loss and tinnitus analysis will be used
      for evaluation of tinnitus in all patients. Data will be recorded on the day patient is
      included in the study, during follow-up after 1 month and 6 months. Descriptive statistics,
      such as the arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and absolute and relative frequency tables,
      will be used for data processing. The Pearson's chi-squared test, Fisher's exact test,
      Kruskal-Wallis test and analysis of variance will be used for comparison. The statistical
      tests will be assessed using a significance level of 5%.
