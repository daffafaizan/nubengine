      techniques, and this led to the introduction of synthetic meshes in vaginal repair in the
      early 2000s. However the use of mesh has recently been put under scrutiny due to a high risk
      of complications, such as mesh exposure. The gran majority of the investigators patients are
      operated with native tissue repairs, about 60% of them by a Manchester procedure, where
      ligament plication is an essential part of the procedure. The investigators previous study
      documented high patient satisfaction and low risk of recurrence, but the data available were
      mainly collected retrospectively and no data were available on possible levator avulsions.
      Lateral defects caused by avulsions of the levator ani muscle represent a special sub-group
      amongst patients with POP, and are shown in several studies to have higher recurrence rates.
      There is no consensus on how to best repair a lateral defect in a POP, but since the
      prevalence of levator avulsions in patients with POP is shown to be high, the investigators
      find it credible that the Manchester Operation can give good results .

      The main justification for this study is that the investigators already have identified a
      surgical technique that has documented excellent results, but studies with more detailed data
      quality are needed in order to better evaluate the procedure's advantages and potential
      disadvantages. As the use of mesh in vaginal surgery has shown unacceptable high risks of new
      and serious complications, there is an international focus and interest in traditional native
      tissue repairs and how to optimize their performance.
