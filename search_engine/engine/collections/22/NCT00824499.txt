      and mortality, which can be reduced by effective care. An interdisciplinary approach, sharing
      responsibility and involvement and education of patients are of major importance in diabetes
      care.

      In Belgium a research project aimed at creating regional diabetes shared care was set up.

      Research questions

        -  Is regional implementation of shared care feasible?

        -  Does it increases quality of care (evidence based care) and patient satisfaction with
           care?

        -  Does it have a positive effect on health status (emotional distress, overall quality of
           life, Hba1c)?

      Methods Controlled trial (July 2004 - June 2006) with a regional complex intervention
      comprising introduction of a care-manager and 2 community based diabetes educators,
      development and implementation of a shared care protocol (with a central role for the GP),
      regional feedback on the quality of diabetes care and patient education. Practitioners and
      patients participate on a voluntary basis. In the control region usual care continues.

      Biophysical, psychosocial and process outcomes were collected thru GP registration of
      patients records and self-administered patient questionnaires (PAID, QUOTE).
