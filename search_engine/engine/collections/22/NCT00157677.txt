           probability (C-PTP)for deep vein thrombosis AND using a D-dimer level of < 1.0 µg FEU/mL
           to exclude deep vein thrombosis in those with a Low C-PTP, and a D-dimer level of < 0.5
           µg FEU/mL to exclude deep vein thrombosis in those with a Moderate C-PTP, is as safe and
           a more efficient way to diagnose DVT than:

        -  Performing D-dimer testing in all patients with suspected deep vein thrombosis with use
           of a single D-dimer value of < 0.5 µg FEU/mL to exclude thrombosis (current practice).

      All randomized patients, including those who are treated for deep vein thrombosis after
      initial testing, will be followed for a period of 3 months to monitor for signs and symptoms
      suggestive of deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, bleeds and death.
