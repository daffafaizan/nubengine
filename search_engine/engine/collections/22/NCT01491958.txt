      efficacy of atorvastatin for the prophylaxis of acute GVHD in patients with hematological
      malignancies undergoing HLA matched related donor HSCT. This study will explore a two-pronged
      acute GVHD prophylaxis strategy, consisting of pre-treating consenting related donors with
      atorvastatin before stem cell mobilization and collection, followed by atorvastatin plus
      methotrexate/tacrolimus-based GVHD prophylaxis in transplant recipient patients.
