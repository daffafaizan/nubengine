      information and disease status. Medical records will be requested from primary care providers
      to provide further information regarding their disorder. Individual patients identified
      through our survey of pediatric geneticists or via the disease foundations or associations
      will be sent a letter describing our purpose and which includes a consent form for a
      subsequent telephonic interview. Their medical records will also be requested.
