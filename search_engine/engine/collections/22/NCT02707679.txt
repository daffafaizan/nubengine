    
      Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome is one of the most common musculoskeletal problem in the world.
      It's incidence is also becoming higher and most people who have knee pain suffer from it for
      long time. In the treatment of PFPS, conservative treatment methods are preferred prior to
      surgical ones. When the literature was reviewed, no study in which Mobilization with movement
      (MWM) method was used and in which the effects of it was shown and compared with
      (Kinesiotaping) KT has been found so far with respect to the treatment of PFPS. Thirty-five
      female patients diagnosed with unilateral PFPS were randomly assigned into 2 groups. The
      patients in the first group (n=18) received two techniques of Mobilization with movement
      intervention while Kinesiotaping was applied to the other group (n=17). Both groups were
      treated with exercise. All patients received 4 sessions of treatment twice a week for a
      period of 2 weeks and followed up in accordance with a 6-week-home exercise program. Primary
      outcomes: pain severity, knee range of motion, hamstring flexibility, and physical
      performance (10-step stair climbing test, timed up and go test), Kujala Patellofemoral Pain
      Scoring and Y-Balance test were assessed.
