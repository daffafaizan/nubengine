      cancer. The estrogen receptor (ER) in these patients is a key driver of disease progression,
      and the primary reason for relapse in these patients is that endocrine therapies are only
      partially effective, typically causing cell cycle arrest rather than cell death. As a result,
      secondary resistance to endocrine therapy is a major clinical challenge. ZN-c5 is a novel and
      potent ZN-c5 is a novel and potent selective estrogen receptor degrader with oral
      bioavailability and strong activity in estrogen-dependent and tamoxifen-resistant tumor
      models.
