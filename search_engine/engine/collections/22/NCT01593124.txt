        1. Baseline in the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle;

        2. Baseline in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle;

        3. After a 3 day (4 dose) treatment with HEC placebo;

        4. After a 3 day (4 dose) treatment of 4% N-9;

        5. After a 2 day (2 dose) treatment of IMQ.

      A subset of 5 women will have an additional baseline visit in the follicular phase.

      The order of the N-9 and IMQ treatments is randomized. The study is cross over in design. The
      per sequence of treatments is as follows: Baseline in the follicular phase of the menstrual
      cycle, next is baseline in the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle, next is after a 3 day (4
      dose) treatment with HEC placebo. At this point in the study, half of the participants are
      randomized to do the N-9 treatment and then the IMQ treatment. The remaining half of the
      participants do the IMQ treatment and then the N-9 treatment.

      All participants are sampled at the 5 timepoints described above.
