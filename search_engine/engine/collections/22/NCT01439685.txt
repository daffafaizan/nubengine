      mortality in patients with biliary disease and biliary obstruction related to
      cholangiocarcinoma. Surgical biliary bypass is unfortunately complicated by a 30-day
      postoperative mortality rate of between 7 and 24%. Moreover, because of recovery time the
      quality of life following surgery is only improved in a minority. At present endoscopic
      insertion of a plastic or metal stent is the method of choice to relieve obstructive jaundice
      without the high morbidity and mortality associated with surgery. But this relief is
      unfortunately temporary since stents tend to become obstructed and the fact that effective
      biliary drainage in the proximal lesion is challenging. Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) is a new
      therapeutic approach that specifically targets neoplastic cells. This therapy involves the
      intravenous administration of a photosensitizing agent followed by activation of the agent by
      illumination with non-thermal light of a specific wavelength, resulting in cell death from
      direct cytotoxicity and ischemic necrosis. Cytotoxicity is directly proportional to tissue
      oxygenation.

      A prospective, randomized and controlled trial study by Ortner et all confirmed the
      significant advantage of PDT with regard to relief of jaundice, quality of life, and
      survival. The improvement of survival in the randomized PDT group was so impressive that it
      was believed unethical to continue with randomization after the first 39 patients (20 and 19
      in each group).Previously, the principal investigator conducted such a study (and also
      conducted Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography with PDT) at the University of
      Virginia, and would continue to conduct these procedures, as well as the study at WCMC.
