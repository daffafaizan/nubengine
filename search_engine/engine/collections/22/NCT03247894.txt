      foreign studies. The most frequently afflicted patients by MS are women of childbearing age
      and influence of anesthesia or obstetric epidural analgesia has only not been investigated in
      Czech Republic. The study aims to retrospectively compare the further course of the disease
      of MS in patients who labor between 2004 and 2013 in University Hospital Brno either by
      caesarean section or vaginally with epidural analgesia , with patients who gave birth
      spontaneously without anesthesia.The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of the
      labour on the clinical course of MS and further evaluate the possible influence of the type
      of anesthesia/analgesia in the peripartal period on the MS progression.
