    
      We will recruit patients to participate in the assessment of new MRI technologies designed to
      improve chest MRI exams that will result in improvements in patient care.

      Several different MRI technologies will be evaluated. Specific evaluation of distinct
      technologies (eg. new head coil design, and new imaging sequence for the spine) may be
      evaluated simultaneously, or over non-overlapping periods in time.
