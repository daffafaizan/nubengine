      Subjects are selected from hypertensive emergency patients with a BP (Blood Pressure) of
      >180/120mmHg (SBP/DBP) and accompany with end target organ damage. All subjects are
      randomized into two groups receiving the Nicardipine Injection: Control Group (at a
      weight-based dose adjustment, i.e. according to the current Package Insert approved by SFDA)
      and Study Group (at a non-weight-based dose adjustment, i.e. according to the Package Insert
      approved by FDA).

      Patients meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria are randomly allocated at 1:1 proportion to
      Control Group and Study Group. Before the treatment, investigators should define the target
      BP value for every subject according to different illness state, According to the BP, the
      dose of Nicardipine Injection is adjusted through different methods until reaching of target
      BP value. After reaching target BP value or 60min after the dosing initiation, BP and pulse
      rate are measured every 5~15min for 2h. Two to six hours after dosing, BP should be
      controlled at 160/100~110mmHg, and the maintenance dose is determined by the investigators
      according to the illness state.
