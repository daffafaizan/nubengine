    
      Non-clinical studies and a Phase 1 clinical trial suggest that intrathecal administration of
      VTS-270 in patients with neurologic manifestations of Niemann-Pick Type C1 (NPC1) disease has
      the potential to slow the rate of progression of their neurologic disease. Niemann-Pick Type
      C1 (NPC1) disease is a rare, neurodegenerative, inherited, autosomal recessive lysosomal
      lipid storage disorder primarily in children and teenagers. The disease is characterized by
      the inability to properly metabolize cholesterol and other lipids within the cell due to
      mutations in the NPC1 gene causing unesterified cholesterol to accumulate in the brain, liver
      and spleen.

      Eligible participants who transition into this study will receive treatment with VTS-270 at
      the last dose level administered in Study VTS301, administered IT via LP infusion every 2
      weeks, for up to a total duration of 3 years or until the investigator considers VTS-270 to
      be no longer beneficial to the participant, VTS-270 receives marketing authorization, or the
      VTS-270 development program is discontinued.
