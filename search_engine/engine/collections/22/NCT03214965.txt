      outcomes of chronic treatments. Currently, there is no study using social media as an
      education tool in kidney transplant patients in Brazil. This study is designed to answer the
      question: "Does the use of a popular social media such as facebook improves the knowledge,
      satisfaction and self-steem levels among kidney transplant adolescents when compared with
      their peers ?" This is a non-blinded randomized clinical trial. Patients will be randomly
      included into one of the two groups: the control group who will not receive any intervention
      or the facebook group (who will receive additional educational and consultative support
      through a closed facebook group) After three months, knowledge level, satisfaction level and
      self-esteem will be assessed by specific designed questionnaires and by the application of
      the Rosenberg's self-esteem scale. The study will have a sample of 122 subjects, equally
      divided (61 participants in each group). Collected data will be compared using the chi square
      test.
