      prevention intervention that uses gamification principles and mechanics. The intervention
      includes an online timer that reminds men to get tested, online quizzes, and peer
      recruitment; these activities are awarded with points redeemable for chances at prizes at
      participating clinics. The intervention was designed based on findings from interviews with
      health staff and focus groups with young MSM, and with input from a gamification consultant.
      The primary hypothesis is that the intervention will increase repeat HIV/STI testing among
      young MSM. The intervention will be implemented at two STI clinics in Oakland and Los
      Angeles, California in 2-week intervals for six months. The investigators will review medical
      records of exposed and unexposed young MSM attending the same STI clinics to compare uptake
      of quarterly HIV testing and self-reported behavior after six months.
