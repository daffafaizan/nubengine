      curricula, and it is not easy for medical students to develop non-verbal communication skills
      without adequate training. This study was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of the
      Micro Expression Training Tool (METT) and the Subtle Expression Training Tool (SETT) to help
      improve the non-verbal communication skills of medical students.
