    
      The objectives of the current randomized controlled study were to examine how the modality of
      an acute 3 day isocaloric -25% energy depletion by dieting alone or by aerobic exercise alone
      differently impacts appetite and appetite-related hormones, ad libitum energy intake (EI),
      food hedonics and food reward, and olfaction. It was hypothesized that independent of
      modality of depletion, that relative to the control, there would be increased ad libitum
      feeding and food reward, improvements in smell performance, and a decline in fasting leptin
      and increase in fasting total ghrelin. It was also hypothesized that the increased food
      reward would prove to be a predictor of ad libitum EI and that relative to the depletion by
      aerobic exercise alone, the depletion by diet alone would produce greater compensatory
      increases in appetite, ad libitum EI, and food reward.

      Statistics

      To test for differences in body weight, plasma hormone concentrations, relative-reinforcing
      value of food (RRVF), and olfaction across each condition of the study, repeated measures
      ANOVA controlling for day 1 as a covariate was employed. Pairwise comparisons at day 4 using
      Sidak adjustment to account for multiple comparisons are reported when the ANOVA was
      significant. One way repeated measures ANOVAs with Sidak adjustments for multiple comparisons
      were used to test for differences in variables measured only at day 4: body composition (fat
      mas, %Fat, and fat free mass), appetite, palatability, and ad libitum EI.
