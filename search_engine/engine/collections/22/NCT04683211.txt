      μg / day. The iodine intake is assessed by the iodine concentration in the urine, the target
      of which in pregnant women is ioduria between 150 and 250 μg / l. The general French
      population is not deficient in iodine according to the national nutrition health study in
      2006-2007, with a median ioduria of 136 μg / l (therefore greater than 100 μg / l) for all
      elderly adults aged 18-74. However, according to French studies, the median ioduria of
      pregnant women is between 50 and 100 μg / l, which suggests a moderate iodine deficiency. To
      maintain euthyroidism, the mother must increase her T4 production by 40- 50% (10-150%), which
      requires an additional iodine intake of 150-250 μg / d The thyroid contains a reserve of
      iodine, but this is depleted during pregnancy in the absence of supplementation. Our study
      therefore aims to assess the amount of iodine supplementation prescribed in pregnant women
      diagnosed with gestational diabetes because this group of patients benefit from early
      specialized care for their pregnancies.
