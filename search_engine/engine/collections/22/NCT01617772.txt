      steatosis to steatohepatitis (nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH) to cirrhosis. Statins are
      competitive inhibitors of Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting step in
      cholesterol biosynthesis. They occupy a portion of the binding site of
      Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA, blocking access of this substrate to the active site on the
      enzyme. A reduction in intrahepatic cholesterol leads to an increase in LDL receptor turnover
      that results from an enhanced rate of hepatic LDL receptor cycling. On the other hand recent
      studies have implicated several important cellular processes and signaling pathways that are
      affected by abnormal lipid metabolism, resulting in specific biochemical, histological, and
      clinical changes associated with NAFLD.

      Maybe statins, as lipid lowering agents, and through their effect in reduction of
      intrahepatic cholesterol, can affect the abnormal lipid metabolism in NASH.

      L- carnitine, can improve the outcome of NASH, because it reduces lipid levels, limits
      oxidative stress, and modulates inflammatory responses . It performs a number of essential
      intracellular and metabolic functions, such as fatty acid transport, detoxification of
      potentially toxic metabolites, regulation of the mitochondrial acyl-CoA / CoA ratio, and
      stabilization of cell membranes. It has a pivotal role in the transport of long chain fatty
      acids across the inner mitochondrial membrane.
