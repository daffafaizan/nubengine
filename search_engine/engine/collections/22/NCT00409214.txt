    
      Light Infusion Technology (Litxâ„¢) is a locoregional cancer treatment in which a systemically
      administered light-activated drug (LS11) is activated locally by illuminating the diseased
      tissue using light-emitting diodes (LEDs) of a specific wavelength. The activated
      photosensitizer reacts with endogenous oxygen to yield highly reactive species of oxygen that
      cause destruction of cellular structures such as mitochondria, lysosomes and cell walls
      leading to irreversible cell damage and tissue death.

      Either twenty-four or twelve hours prior to surgery, the patient will receive an intravenous
      dose of 1 mg/kg of LS11, given IV by slow push over 3-5 minutes.

      Following craniotomy, patients will undergo intraoperative placement of a single Light
      Source, centrally placed within the tumor, under direct visualization prior to tumor
      resection. Following placement of the light source (with the depth of the end of the light
      bar from the cortical surface to be calculated from the pre-operative MRI and spiral CT scan,
      so as to be centralized within the main tumor bulk), light will be delivered following a
      predetermined escalation schedule (either 100 J/cm or 200 J/cm) at 20 mW/cm light energy for
      a treatment time of 1 hour 24 minutes (100J/cm) or 2 hours 46 minutes (200 J/cm). The Light
      Source will then be manually removed and the tumor maximally resected.

      The resected tumor and marginal tissue will be submitted for pathology to determine depth of
      cell death, extent of tumor tissue containing closed vessels, any evidence of vessel closure
      or other damage to tissues outside of the projected kill zone.
