      basis. Our hypothesis is that toxicity will be less than that with standard dosing without
      any negative effect on survival. Patients will also be evaluated with CT scans every 3
      months. Toxicity will be assessed with every cycle of treatment. Treatment will continue
      until toxicity or signs of progression.
