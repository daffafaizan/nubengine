      because of low T cell regenerative capacity and high viral burden. If means were available to
      effectively suppress virus replication, the indigenous immune restorative responses of the
      host may be further stimulated and enhanced by rhIL-2. The use of protease inhibitors with
      nucleoside-analogue combination regimens appears to be most effective in controlling virus
      replication. High-dose intermittent rhIL-2 administered either intravenously or
      subcutaneously has been shown to be effective in inducing CD4 responses in a number of
      studies.

      All patients receive HAART consisting of two nucleoside analogues (at least one of which is
      new to the patient) and the protease inhibitor indinavir for 12 weeks. At Week 10, an HIV RNA
      is done. Patients with more than 5,000 copies/ml are taken off the study. Patients with 5,000
      copies/ml or less continue on the study and are stratified by their antiretroviral
      combination, and randomized to one of three treatment arms. Patients on Arm I continue HAART
      alone for an additional 72 weeks. Patients on Arm II continue HAART plus intermittent rhIL-2
      by continuous intravenous (CIV) administration for an additional 72 weeks (9 courses).
      Patients who achieve both at least a 25-percent increase and at least a 100-cell increase in
      CD4 count above prerandomization baseline switch to subcutaneously administered rhIL-2 after
      3 courses (24 weeks) or 6 courses (48 weeks) of CIV therapy for the remainder of their
      treatment course. Patients on Arm III continue HAART plus subcutaneous rhIL-2 for an
      additional 72 weeks (9 courses). [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/31/97: When protocol ACTG 928 is
      activated, patients randomized on ACTG 328 are stratified based on whether or not they have
      registered on ACTG 928.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/30/98: For the 4 weeks immediately prior to
      randomization, patients must receive continuous HAART therapy. Exceptions may be made by the
      protocol chair for short (i.e., less than 48 hours) interruptions of antiretroviral therapy
      during this period. Also per this amendment, two substudies have been added: A5033s and
      A5046s. Patients who choose to enroll in substudy A5046s must do so at Week 60 of ACTG 328.
      However, if the patient is already beyond Week 60 but not beyond Week 84 of ACTG 328 when
      A5046s becomes available, he/she is still encouraged to participate in A5046s. For such
      patients, ACTG 328 treatment is extended beyond Week 84 until the patient completes 24 weeks
      of A5046s.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/23/99: Patients who choose to enroll in substudy A5046s must
      do so at or after Week 64 of ACTG 328 and no later than Week 104.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/16/99:
      Patients choosing to enroll in A5046s must do so at or after Week 64 and no later than Week
      128.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 1/22/99: A 16-week treatment extension is provided for patients who
      have reached Week 84 of ACTG 328 and intend to enroll in either A5051 or A5046s (which are
      currently not available).] [AS PER AMENDMENT 4/23/99: Therapy is extended for 24 weeks beyond
      the original 84 weeks. Study treatment for patients awaiting co-enrollment into A5046s
      continues for up to 20 weeks until co-enrollment and then until completion of A5046s (24
      weeks). Study treatment continues for 24 weeks beyond Week 84 for patients who are awaiting
      enrollment in A5051 or who have chosen not to participate in A5046s.] [AS PER AMENDMENT
      6/3/99: A 24-week treatment extension has been added for patients who have reached Week 100
      and intend to enroll in A5046s.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/16/99: A treatment extension has been
      added for up to 44 weeks beyond Week 84 and through completion of A5046s (24 weeks) for
      on-study/on-study treatment patients who intend to co-enroll in A5046s. Patients who intend
      to enroll in A5051 or A5046s and remain on ACTG 328 study treatment are eligible for the
      treatment extension from Week 84 to Week 108. Patients who intend to co-enroll in A5046s and
      remain on ACTG 328 study treatment are eligible for the treatment extension from Week 108 to
      Week 128. All patients who are awaiting co-enrollment in A5046s must continue to receive
      their assigned ACTG 328 treatment regimen. Study treatment for ACTG 328 patients awaiting
      co-enrollment into A5046s will continue for up to 44 weeks and until completion of A5046s (24
      weeks). Each patient is followed every 8 weeks for the duration of the treatment extension
      period to monitor for safety and to collect cells and plasma for storage. No substudy
      evaluations are performed during the 24-week extension.]
