      population and are at risk for negative co-occurring outcomes including drug abuse, HIV/STI
      risk, criminal behavior, and educational failure. As they enter young adulthood, this
      constellation of behaviors puts them at heightened risk for early parenthood and subsequent
      involvement in the child welfare system (for their parenting behaviors) and the adult
      corrections system (for criminal behaviors). Such system involvement is costly, and its
      prevention would be of great significance to public health; however, very little is known
      about factors leading to females' success/failure in young adulthood and factors that might
      prevent involvement in these two public systems. This study aims to further our understanding
      of the pathways to and the prevention of HIV/STI risk, drug use, and child welfare and adult
      corrections involvement by following-up 166 women who participated in two randomized
      intervention trials aimed at reducing delinquency during adolescence. In the original
      studies, juvenile justice girls who had been referred for out-of-home placement due to
      chronic delinquency were randomly assigned to services as usual or to Treatment Foster Care
      Oregon (TFCO, formerly known as MTFC). Efficacy of the intervention with this sample has been
      shown at 12- and 24-month follow-ups on criminal referral rates, days spent in locked
      settings, deviant peer associations, educational engagement, and pregnancy prevention. The
      investigators propose to examine the developmental pathways for these juvenile justice girls
      into young adulthood (ages 21-28 years) using innovative data collection and data analytic
      techniques, with foci on the long-term effects of TFCO, the mediators of young adult
      adjustment and child welfare/corrections involvement, and the cost effectiveness and cost
      avoidance of TFCO on these outcomes. The overarching aim is to identify potential targets for
      subsequent intervention. One in-person assessment is proposed with each female and her
      current romantic partner (if she has one); in addition, telephone interviews will be
      conducted every 6 months for the duration of the study, and system data from child welfare
      and adult corrections will be collected.
