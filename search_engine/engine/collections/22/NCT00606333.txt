      occurring in an estimated 20-40% of procedures performed. Coronary stents provide mechanical
      scaffolding that helps reduce restenosis by limiting the extent of elastic recoil and late
      vascular remodeling. Despite improvements over balloon angioplasty alone, restenosis
      following coronary stenting procedures has been cited to occur in 20-40% of cases and is
      primarily a result of neointimal hyperplasia. Thus, stents which are capable of delivering
      drugs to limit neointimal hyperplasia, in addition to providing mechanical support at the
      area of the lesion, have been developed to further limit the extent of restenosis following
      coronary stenting. There are several pharmacologic agents approved for use with drug-eluting
      stents.Two drugs have been widely studied in controlled clinical trials and real-world
      patient populations, sirolimus and paclitaxel.

      This study will evaluate a new sirolimus-eluting cobalt chromium coronary stent system
      compared to an approved paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent system in the treatment of single
      de novo coronary lesions in native coronary arteries. Subjects meeting qualification will be
      randomized in a 1:1 fashion to treatment with the Conor sirolimus-eluting coronary stent or
      to treatment with an approved paclitaxel-eluting coronary stent. All subjects will undergo
      angiographic follow-up at six months and complete clinical follow-up for a period of five
      years.
