      artery disease (CAD) and underwent cardiac computed tomography (CT). Cardiac CT was assessed
      for coronary artery calcification score (CACS) and the extent, the location, the stenosis
      severity, and the composition of the plaque in CTA. The base line information was recorded,
      including risk factors, drugs, bio-markers, and psychological. The endpoint was MACE, defined
      as composite cardiac death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI).we aim to evaluate the
      prognostic value of CTA, risk factors and bio-markers for major adverse cardiac events
      (MACE).
