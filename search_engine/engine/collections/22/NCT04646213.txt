    
      In this study, participants will be asked to do the following things:

        1. Complete ~15-minute online surveys before the program, immediately after the program (4
           months), and at follow-up (6 months). . Questions will ask about mood, anxiety, death
           distress, quality of social relationships, and satisfaction with life.

        2. Meet with an interventionist six times (biweekly) for individual sessions via Zoom,
           lasting 50-60 minutes each. Sessions will be audio-recorded to ensure all participants
           receive the same information. Participants will be asked to only use first names.

        3. Complete weekly ~5 minute online surveys after each session on satisfaction with the
           program.

        4. Complete an exit interview by telephone approximately 1 month after the 6-session
           intervention. This exit interview will last approximately 15-30 minutes.
