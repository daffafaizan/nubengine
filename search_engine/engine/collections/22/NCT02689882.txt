    
      1. On Day 1, participants will have a baseline assessment, including blood pressure and
           heart rate, as well as baseline assessment of "safety" labs: complete blood count with
           white blood count differential and platelets, serum chemistry panel (sodium, potassium,
           chloride, glucose, blood urea nitrogen and creatinine), uric acid, creatine kinase,
           aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase, and lactate dehydrogenase.

        2. Participants will receive 250 mg nicotinamide riboside (NR) by mouth daily on Days 1-2,
           250 mg NR by mouth twice daily on Days 3-4, 500 mg NR twice daily by mouth on Days 5-6
           and 1000 mg NR twice daily by mouth on Days 7-8.

        3. On Day 2, a blood sample will be obtained from each participant to measure serum
           chemistry panel to assess for the possibility of hyperkalemia and hyperglycemia. In
           addition, an instant read potassium will be measured using a point-of-care device
           available on the University of Washington (UW) General Clinical Research Center (GCRC).
           If the potassium is greater than 5.5, a repeat value and an ECG will be performed and
           the Study Investigator. If it is greater than 6.0, the Study Investigator will evaluate
           the subject for admission.

        4. On Day 9 prior to receiving their morning dose, participants will be admitted to the UW
           GCRC for an overnight stay.

             1. In the UW GCRC, the participants will receive the last 1000 mg dose of NR at
                time=0.

             2. Blood samples will be collected at time = 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12,
                16 and 24 hours.

             3. Whole blood samples will be frozen at -80 degrees C until assayed for NR and NAD+.

             4. "Safety labs" performed on Day 1 will be repeated
