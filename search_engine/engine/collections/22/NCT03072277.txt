      women in India to test the effectiveness of supplementing pregnant Indian women with 400 mg/d
      algal DHA compared to placebo from mid-pregnancy through delivery. Eligible participants
      would be randomized to receive either 400 mg of DHA or a placebo baseline measures would be
      taken before the enrollment of the participant in the study. The mother-child dyads would be
      followed through infant age 1 year and anthropometric measurements and biochemical
      investigations would be used to assess the effect of maternal DHA supplementation on infant
      neurodevelopment at ages 6- and 12-months using validated the Development Assessment Scale
      for Indian Infants (DASII).
