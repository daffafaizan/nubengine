    
      The purpose of the study is

        -  To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ASLAN002 in subjects with advanced or
           metastatic solid tumours

        -  To define the overall safety profile of ASLAN002

        -  To assess the effects of ASLAN002 on overall cardiac function as measured by blood
           pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and left ventricular
           function

      Secondary:

        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of ASLAN002 and its N-oxide metabolite,
           following single and multiple dosing

        -  To provide a preliminary assessment of anti-tumour activity, as assessed by the Overall
           Response Rate (ORR) and changes from baseline in tumour size
