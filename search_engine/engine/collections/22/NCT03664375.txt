      the functional activities making patient dependent on others for performance of daily living
      activities. Dystonia not only limits the physical activity of the patient but also affects
      their quality of life significantly. Various treatment protocols have been used in the
      literature for treatment of focal hand dystonia in the past including deep brain stimulation,
      kinesio taping, sensory oriented training, splinting, extracorporeal shock wave therapy and
      botox. Out of these Botox has gained much importance but it results only in improving the
      passive range of motion and has no consensus in improving the active range of motion and
      functional independence of the patient. The current study was planned to determine the
      effects of botulinum toxin type A combined with task-specific therapy, for post-stroke focal
      dystonia of upper limb.
