    
      Aim 1: Compare measures of lung ventilation performance obtained using 133Xe Scintigraphy
      with performance using 19F Perfluorinated gas MRI using two independent readers.

      133Xe Scintigraphy will be scored using the methods described in the statistics section and
      19F images will be scored using the methods described in the statistics section. Scores for
      each subject will be earluated for consistency between readers and modalities. 60%
      concordance will be considered equivalent.

      The outcomes of the work proposed is expected to show the non-inferiority of 19F
      Perfluorinated gas MRI to 133Xenon Scintigraphy
