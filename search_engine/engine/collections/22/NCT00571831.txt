    
      The following parameters were measured for evaluation of blood retinal barrier disruption.

        -  the incidence of macular leakage by fluorescence angiography (FA)

        -  the mean fluorescein concentration in the vitreous by fluorophotometry (VFP)

        -  the thickness of the macula by optical coherence tomography (OCT)

      Results

        -  the incidence fo macular leakage decreased significantly from 24%(3 months) to 5% (12
           months) in the blue-filtering IOL group (P<0.05), and was significantly lower compared
           with the UV-filtering IOL group at 12 months.

        -  the VFP significantly decreased in both group from 3 to 12 months.

        -  the OCT decreased from 175 (3 months) to 166 um (12 months) in the blue- filtering IOL
           group.
