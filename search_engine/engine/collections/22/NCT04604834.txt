      decrease in neurotrophic and epitheliotropic factors that are essential for proper corneal
      epithelial and ocular surface function. This neurotrophic state halts mitosis and epithelial
      turnover, which in turn slow down wound healing and lead to epithelial breakdown. Due to the
      chronicity of this disease, treatment adherence becomes a problem for patients; furthermore,
      results with conventional treatments such as preservative-free artificial tears are
      discouraging. Hematopoietic derivatives such as APRP may replace those missing neurotrophic
      factors and lead to epithelial healing in a faster and more comfortable manner. The objective
      of this study is to determine if APRP+PFAT is better than autologous platelet-rich plasma
      (APRP) or preservative-free artificial tears (PFAT) in the treatment of neurotrophic
      keratopathy. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three groups and treatment will be
      administered for four weeks. After this period, subjects will switch groups and receive the
      new treatment for four more weeks (cross-over). After this second period is completed,
      subjects will receive the last treatment for four more weeks. A thorough ophthalmologic
      evaluation will be performed before starting treatment and every four weeks until completion.
      Treatment will be discontinued if there are adverse effects or treatment intolerance.
