    
      This study is a randomised, multicenter controlled trial Our Aim is to test the effects of an
      8-week diet lacking red meat, containing increased fibers and coffee (verum) versus standard
      recommendation (control)in a multicenter setting.

      We are expecting that the verum diet will improve insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion
      due to reductions in visceral and hepatic fat along with improved adipocyte cytokine
      secretion profiles
