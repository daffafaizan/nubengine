      keeping off the weight over the long term (1). While early behavioral and dietary adherence
      have been associated with greater weight loss, sticking to a diet plan is difficult. It is
      not clear if adherence to any diet plan (even one which does not produce weight loss) is hard
      or whether people who are overweight have more difficulty with adhering to diet plans
      compared to people who are relatively lean.

      The main aim of this study is to evaluate dietary adherence in 3 groups of individuals
      participating in a 6-week heart-healthy dietary intervention program. Two groups [1 (BMI < 25
      kg/m(2)) and 2. Obese (BMI greater than or equal to 30 kg/m(2))] will receive a heart-healthy
      diet designed to maintain their weight, and the third group [3. Obese] will be given a
      heart-healthy diet that is 35% less than their daily calorie needs to lose weight.
      Participants will attend one counseling session per week and will be contacted randomly
      1x/week by study staff for completion of a 24-hour dietary recall. They will complete daily
      food diaries and daily records using smart-phones. Prior to starting the assigned
      heart-healthy dietary intervention, participants will complete questionnaires that include
      questions about how motivated they are to follow a diet, lose weight, and change eating
      patterns. These findings may help us understand what factors affect adherence, and help us
      design weight loss studies that improve people's ability to stick to diet interventions.
