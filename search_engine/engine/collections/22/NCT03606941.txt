      follow-up design. In this study, bilateral Shenmen, Neiguan, Baihui and Yintang acupoints
      were selected for perioperative electroacupuncture treatment, accompanied with evaluating the
      incidence of delirium within 5 days after surgery,the effects on postoperative NRS pain and
      sleep quality scores as well as the detection of blood biochemical indexes such as serum
      S100Î², brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), interleukin-6 and interleukin-8. To clarify
      the effect of electroacupuncture on the incidence of postoperative delirium in elderly
      patients undergoing the major surgery is of great significance to the clinical applications
      and popularization of traditional acupuncture treatment perioperatively across the world.
