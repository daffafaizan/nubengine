      defects such as truncus arteriousus, coarctation of the aorta, interrupted aortic arch,
      tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia with VSD, and several others. The defect is usually
      due to a deletion in the long arm of chromosome 22. Approximately 25% of patients with
      DiGeorge have a congenital heart defect. These patients also have varying degrees of thymic
      hypoplasia with associated T cell dysfunction. They are at increased risk of infections and
      can be at risk for opportunistic infections when the degree of T cell dysfunction is severe.
      Children undergoing cardiac surgery are at risk for infections in the post-operative period,
      prolonging hospital stay and increasing morbidity and mortality. The patient with DiGeorge
      syndrome may have higher rates of infection due to associated immune system dysfunction,
      however, this has not been previously reported from a large group of DiGeorge syndrome
      patients. Children's Healthcare of Atlanta follows over 200 patients with DiGeorge syndrome,
      with the majority having previously undergone cardiac surgery. This group of patients may
      benefit from more extensive antibiotic prophylaxis following surgery if they indeed have
      significantly higher rates of infection, but the true incidence needs to be determined.
