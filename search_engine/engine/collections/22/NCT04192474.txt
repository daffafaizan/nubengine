    
      Clinical Phase: pre-CE study

      Design: A prospective, multicenter, single- arm open-label clinical study on the performance
      and safety of Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia, a single-use, flexible cystoscope
      for flexible cystoscopy

      Population: Adult subjects (≥ 18 years) undergoing flexible cystoscopy for diagnostic or
      therapeutic purposes.

      Planned Sample Size: A total of 80 patients will result in a maximum (if the true proportion
      is 50 %) width (i.e. the difference between the point estimate and the upper, or lower, limit
      of the confidence interval) of the two-sided 95 % confidence interval for the binary variable
      "Performance level acceptable" to be 11%. This width is considered to be useful in the
      interpretations of the results from this part of the trial.

      Study duration: Screening, procedure and follow-up will take 14 days maximum. A follow-up
      telephone call at 7 days post procedure is performed to record any adverse events
      post-procedure.

      Planned Trial Period: 3 months

      Investigational Device: Ambu® aScope™ 4 Cysto and aView™ Urologia. A pre-CE, single use
      cystoscope.
