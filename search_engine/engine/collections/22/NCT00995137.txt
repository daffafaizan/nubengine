      their capacity to lyse ALL cells is generally low and difficult to predict. A novel method
      has been developed to redirect NK cells towards CD19, a molecule highly expressed on the
      surface of B-lineage ALL cells, but not expressed on normal cells other than B-lymphocytes.
      In this method, donor NK cells are first expanded by co-culture with irradiated K562 cell
      line modified to express membrane bound IL-15 and 41BB ligand (K562-mb15-41BBL).
      Overexpansion of these proteins promotes selective growth of NK cells. Then, the expanded NK
      cells are transduced with a signaling receptor that binds to CD19 (anti-CD19-BB-zeta). NK
      cells expressing these receptors showed powerful anti-leukemic activity against CD19+ ALL
      cells in vitro and in an animal model of leukemia.

      This study represents the translation of laboratory findings into clinical application. It
      will allow us to assess the safety of infusing genetically modified NK cells into research
      participants who have chemotherapy refractory or relapse B-lineage ALL. In this same cohort,
      we also intend to study the in vivo lifespan and phenotype of genetically modified NK cells
      and explore the efficacy of NK cells in patients with B-lineage ALL.
