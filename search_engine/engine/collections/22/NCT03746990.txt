      caries, with minimal clinically observable dental fluorosis (Dunning 7). This level is
      determined according to the climate and the resultant drinking habits (Newborn 6). Cawson 1
      stated that mottling of enamel is the most frequently seen and most reliable sign of
      excessive quantities of fluoride in the drinking water. Dean 8 concluded that a fluoride
      level of above 1ppm does not significantly reduce caries beyond the optimal effect of 1ppm.

      Different classifications have been introduce to score dental fluorosis. (Dean 9, Al -Alousi
      10, Thylstrup & Fejerskov 11, (Fejerskov, 12). and the DDE index by FDI 1982). Aira Sabokseir
      13, concluded, fluorosis indices, if used alone, could result in misdiagnosis of dental
      fluorosis and information about adverse health-related conditions linked to DDEs
      (Developmental Defects of Enamel) at specific positions on teeth could help to differentiate
      between genuine fluorosis and fluorosis-resembling defects.Various figures for mouth
      prevalence of enamel fluorosis have been reported by different investigators. 39.2% by
      Al-Alousi 10, for Welsh children, 32% by Akpata 14 for Nigerian children. Using the DDE index
      of the FDI (1982), Al alousi 10 defective enamel of 48.9% in children from south Wales. In
      England,Tabari 15 found the prevalence of fluorosis was 54% in the fluoridated area and 23%
      in the fluoride-deficient area. In Iran the prevalence of fluorosis was 61% (Azami-Aghdash et
      al., 16).
