      University Hospital (NTUH) were divided into the preoperative motor function intact group
      (Group A) and motor deficit group (Group B). The motor deficit group was subdivided into
      operation within 48 hours (Group B1), and after 48 hours (Group B2). All patients underwent
      palliative decompression and posterior stabilization. Investigators did wide laminectomy for
      tumor invading the vertebral body, and debulking surgery for tumor destructing the posterior
      column of the spine. Investigators retrospectively reviewed all patient records, including
      patient demographics, prognostic factors for survival (Kaplan-Meier survival analysis),
      neurological outcome (Frankel grade), primary tumor, complications, and relevance of Tomita
      and Tokuhashi scores.
