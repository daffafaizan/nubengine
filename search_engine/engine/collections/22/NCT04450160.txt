      includes maximal surgical resection of the tumor followed by radiotherapy plus concomitant
      and maintenance temozolomide chemotherapy.This study will treat newly diagnosed GBM patients
      by adding Anhydrous Enol-Oxaloacetate treatment to their current Standard of Care.

      In the body, Anhydrous Enol-Oxaloacetate (AEO) converts into "Oxaloacetate", a metabolite
      important for many biochemical reactions in the body. On a cellular level, oxaloacetate
      treatment has been found to modify cancer metabolism in GBM cells, reversing the "Warburg
      Effect", reducing glycolysis and reducing lactate production. In animals, oxaloacetate
      treatment has increased survival and reduced tumor growth of implanted GBM tumors.

      In other animal studies, oxaloacetate has also shown to have neuo-protective effects
      including positive effects on seizure development.
