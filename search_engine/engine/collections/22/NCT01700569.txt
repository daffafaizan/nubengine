    
      Glioblastoma treated by Stupp regimen (Temozolomide + radiation therapy) have a different
      outcome depending on the methylation status of MGMT gene: when the gene is unmethylated, the
      repair process is active and the prognostic poor. In pre-clinical models, it has been
      demonstrated that Folic acid could re-methylate the MGMT gene and therefore the repair
      process to radiation and temozolomide could be limited, allowing a better prognosis. The
      proposed phase-1 study will explore the safety and efficacy of escalated doses of oral
      Folinic acid concomitantly with Stupp regimen. To determine the MTD is the main objective of
      the study, then the toxicty profile, the RDP2 and the methylation process efficacy at the
      MGMT gene level.
