    
      This is a single-center, observer-blinded, Phase 1, dosage-escalation trial to evaluate the
      safety, tolerability, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of ChAd155-RG compared with RABAVERT
      in rabies virus-na√Øve healthy male and non-pregnant female adult subjects ages 18-49.
      Subjects who have never received a licensed or investigational rabies virus vaccine, or an
      Ad-based investigational vaccine, and who have never been exposed to a rabid animal will be
      eligible for enrollment. There are 4 dose groups: Group A will receive ChAd155-RG at the
      lower dosage (5x1010vp) on Day 1, then placebo injections on Days 8, 15, and 22; Group B will
      receive ChAd155-RG at the higher dosage (1x1011vp) on Day 1, then placebo injections on Days
      8, 15, and 22; Group C will receive ChAd155-RG at the higher dosage (1x1011vp) on Days 1 and
      15, and placebo injections on Days 8 and 22; Group D will receive RABAVERT at the standard
      dose (1 mL) on Days 1, 8, and 22, and a placebo injection on Day 15. Since this is a
      dosage-escalation study, sentinel subjects will be used at each dosage level before
      non-sentinel subjects will be enrolled. The SMC will review the available safety,
      reactogenicity, AE, and lab data of all the sentinel subjects, and will decide if the
      remaining non-sentinel subjects should be enrolled. The study will be conducted at Emory
      University Vaccine and Treatment Evaluation Unit (VTEU). This trial is expected to take
      approximately 48 months to complete. The duration of each subject's participation is
      approximately 13 months, from recruitment through the last study visit. The primary
      objectives of this study are: 1) Assessment of the safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity
      of one dose of ChAd155-RG at 5x1010vp per dose, or one or two doses of ChAd155-RG at 1x1011vp
      per dose; 2) Comparison of the safety, tolerability, and reactogenicity of one or two doses
      of ChAd155-RG, with three doses of RABAVERT. The secondary objective is to assess the serum
      rabies VNA levels by a standard, WHO-approved, RFFIT, as assessed by immune response kinetics
      (through approximately 12 months after first dose of vaccine), seroconversion rates, and peak
      GMT in each treatment arm.
