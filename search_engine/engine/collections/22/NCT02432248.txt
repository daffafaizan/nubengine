      live birth rate in poor ovarian responders. Consecutive infertile women attending the
      subfertility clinic for IVF treatment will be approached. Those fulfilling the selection
      criteria would be recruited and a written consent will be obtained after detailed explanation
      and counseling.

      Baseline assessment will be performed at early follicular phase (Day 2 or 3) at recruitment.
      Patient characteristics including age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status would be
      recorded and blood test including follicular stimulating hormone (FSH), estradiol (E2),
      testosterone and anti-MÃ¼llerian hormone (AMH) would be checked. Pelvic scan will be performed
      to assess the total antral follicle count (AFC) and total ovarian volume.

      Subjects will be randomized divided into two groups:

        1. DHEA group: Subjects will take DHEA (Vitacost) 25mg three times a day for 12 weeks prior
           to the start of IVF treatment.

        2. Placebo group: Subjects will take placebo three times a day for 12 weeks prior to the
           start of IVF treatment.

      Ultrasound assessment will be repeated in follicular phase (D2 or 3) of every month or cycle
      followed by a IVF treatment using antagonist protocol based on our standard departmental
      regimen. Cycle characteristics including the dose of gonadotrophins use, duration of
      stimulation, number of oocytes obtained, number of fertilized embryos and good quality
      embryos will be recorded and follicular fluid will be saved for hormonal profiles.
