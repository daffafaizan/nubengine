      designed to assess epidemiology, clinical data, management and outcomes of AHF in six Gulf
      countries and whether published, professional guidelines on the diagnosis and treatment of
      heart failure are being applied appropriately in patients with heart failure. The registry
      will also provide a quantitative estimate as well as qualitative description of the hospital
      disease activity related to heart failure. The information gathered will identify management
      gaps in diagnosis and care of AHF patients that may be addressed by more effective
      implementation of current guidelines or development of AHF guidelines which may be
      appropriate to this region. Findings from this registry may help in knowing the current
      status of heart transplantation in the Middle-East countries as well as identify issues in
      establishing future heart transplant programme including selection of appropriate candidates
      and donors, requirements for pre- and post-transplant support.
