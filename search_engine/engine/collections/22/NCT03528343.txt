      excessive and is in excess of patient need. Current practice following pediatric appendectomy
      is to prescribe all children with 5-15 doses of narcotic pain medication upon discharge
      regardless of their age, severity of appendicitis, or pain control in the hospital. This
      study examines the amount of narcotic pain control required by pediatric patients after
      undergoing appendectomy using a randomized controlled trial study design.

      Children admitted after undergoing surgical management for a diagnosis of acute appendicitis
      will be randomized at discharge to a narcotic arm or a tylenol/motrin arm. The narcotic arm
      will receive the standard of care narcotic prescription. The tylenol/motrin arm will receive
      education to use tylenol and motrin for pain control as well as a paper prescription provided
      for the sole purpose of rescue.

      Pain control will be assessed with a post-operative pain scale, patient satisfaction survey,
      and parent satisfaction survey on the days following surgery and at post-operative follow-up.

      The hypothesis is that the pain scores and patient satisfaction surveys will show no
      difference in post-operative pain control between the two arms.
