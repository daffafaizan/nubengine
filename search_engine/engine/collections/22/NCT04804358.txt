      university hospital of Montpellier : 50 patients with an history of psychological trauma and
      50 patients without any history of psychological trauma

      Participation consists of a half-day visit. Patients will perform clinical and
      neuropsychological assessments and an exposition test. During this test, participants will be
      exposed, for 7 minutes, to neutral, positive or negative emotional photos. Heart rate
      variability will be determined through a Biopac MP160 before, during and after this event.
      Saliva samples to measure kynurenin, tryptophan, substance P and neurokinin-1 will be
      collected before and directly after the test.
