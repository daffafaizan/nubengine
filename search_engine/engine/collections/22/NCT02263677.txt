      steatohepatitis (NASH) and finally cirrhosis is rapidly becoming the leading cause of liver
      injury and end stage liver disease, particularly in industrialized countries. Though several
      pharmacologic agents (i.e. metformin, pioglitazone and others) have been suggested to have
      benefit in reducing the progression of this disease, none is approved for use.

      The causes of NAFLD and NASH are unknown, though visceral obesity, metabolic syndrome and
      type 2 diabetes are recognized co-existent risk factors. Recent evidence has linked NAFLD to
      elevated dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). DPP-4 levels in the plasma and livers of persons
      with NAFLD are elevated and correlate with elevations in liver enzymes, though not with
      markers of insulin resistance alone.

      It has been proposed that increased DPP-4 activity in combination with decreased PPAR
      signaling stimulates the inflammatory response that leads to liver fibrosis in the transition
      of NASH to cirrhosis. Debate exists as to whether the effect of DPP-4 in the liver is via its
      effect on the intestinal hormones or its direct effects on liver tissue. Indeed some studies
      have found reductions in liver fat with administration of GLP-1 agonists in animal models of
      obesity.
