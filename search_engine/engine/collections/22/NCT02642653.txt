      with an innovative parent-implemented intervention (PILI) targeting language and challenging
      behavior delivered through telehealth technology.The hypothesis is that targeted treatments
      will be more effective when applied in combination with PILI. Examination of whether changes
      in the activity of key pathways/proteins influenced by fragile X mental retardation protein
      (FMRP) (the mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK) and MMP-9) are biomarkers of treatment
      responsiveness. Because lovastatin is also an anti-inflammatory, characterization of MEK/ERK
      signaling in peripheral immune cells both pre- and post- treatment will be carried out to
      determine whether levels of these signaling molecules are predictive biomarkers of treatment
      response. It is hypothesized that those individuals with elevated inflammatory cytokine
      profiles will be most responsive to lovastatin treatment. Once modeled in FXS, results from
      these studies can then be applied to other neurodevelopmental disorders including
      RASopathies.

      The behavioral component of the proposed multi-modal treatment will be a Parent-implemented
      Intervention (PILI) that targets improvements in spoken language and challenging behavior for
      10- to 17-year-olds with FXS by increasing parental verbal responsiveness (PVR) within
      picture-book based story-telling episodes. Parents will be encouraged to use the targeted
      strategies in other everyday interactions with their child. The intervention will be
      delivered to parents in their homes by way of video teleconferencing (VTC). Participants will
      be randomly assigned to receive the behavioral intervention alone or in combination with
      Lovastatin.
