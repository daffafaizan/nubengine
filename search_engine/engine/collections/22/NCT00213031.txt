    
      Carraguardâ„¢ (PC-515), the Population Council's lead candidate microbicide, was tested in a
      triple-masked, randomized, placebo-controlled trial fielded in one site in Chiang Rai,
      northern Thailand. The primary aims of the study were to assess Carraguard's safety
      (toxicity) - including signs of local irritation, such as itching or burning; changes in
      vaginal flora; and incidence of abnormal external genital, vaginal, and cervical findings -
      when applied vaginally for 12 months; to evaluate acceptability; to assess feasibility of
      conducting a large scale microbicide trial in a non-sex worker population; to gauge women's
      reactions to a non-contraceptive microbicide; and to explore microbicide use dynamics in a
      Thai population.

      Secondary aims were to investigate HIV infections averted (preliminary indications); other
      sexually transmitted infections averted - including C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, T.
      vaginalis, and T. pallidum (preliminary indications); and effect on cervical cytology.
