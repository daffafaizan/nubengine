      drivers aged 15-19 involved in fatal crashes, 21% of distracted drivers were distracted by
      the use of cellphones. Nearly 90% of teens expect a response to a text message within 5
      minutes, and the compulsion to respond is stronger for messages from close social contacts.
      This suggests that behavioral-economic interventions such as immediate and frequent
      incentives are needed to offset the disutility caused by not being able to communicate by
      cellphone while driving. If proven to be effective, incentives could be scaled up via auto
      insurance discount contributions, school programs, and parental contributions.
