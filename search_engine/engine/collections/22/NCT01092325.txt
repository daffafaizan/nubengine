      and Tolerability of CXL-1020 and Specific Effects on Electrocardiographic and Non-Invasive
      Hemodynamic Parameters in Patients with Chronic Heart Failure. 4 weekly four-hour treatments
      involving ascending dosages of CXL-1020 with a randomly interspersed placebo dose within two
      or more unique patient cohorts. Separate echocardiography cohorts (Echo Cohort A and Echo
      Cohort B) will evaluate a sustained dose over 4 hours (ECHO A), and an ascending two dose
      level, 4-hour infusion (2 hours each) (ECHO B), in individual patients. Echo Cohort dosages
      will be determined from responses observed in previous cohort exposures.
