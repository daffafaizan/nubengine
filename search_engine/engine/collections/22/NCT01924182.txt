    
      This was a randomized, controlled, open-label, multi-center, prospective post-market study to
      assess pain control and opioid-related side effects following a route of delivery change to
      low dose IT morphine therapy from systemic opioid therapy. Subjects with nonmalignant,
      chronic, intractable pain who were experiencing inadequate pain relief and/or intolerable
      side effects from systemic opioid therapy receiving â‰¤300 mg/day morphine equivalent dose were
      eligible for screening. Additionally, the subjects had no known history of sleep apnea and
      were candidates for IT morphine administration via the SynchroMed Infusion System. Subjects
      must not have previously undergone an intrathecal/epidural trial for pump infusion therapy.
