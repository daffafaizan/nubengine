      the stomas, in order to diminish solid stool and bacterial load on the colon prior to a
      colostomy takedown. This was thought to decrease the surgery related complications.

      However mechanical bowel preparation can cause discomfort in patients as well as other
      complications like hydro electrolyte imbalance.

      Studies in adult population have shown that there is not a significant difference in the
      presence of surgery related complications in patients that received bowel prep and those who
      did not.

      There is not enough evidence in pediatric patients that this affirmation is also true.
