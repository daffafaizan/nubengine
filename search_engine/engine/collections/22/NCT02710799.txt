      highly overloaded. There is currently a referral protocol to select patients how should be
      referred. It will be evaluated if a intervention of telephone-based teleconsultations
      provided by the TelessaúdeRS to the primary care physicians can provide additional benefits.
      TelessaúdeRS is a telehealth program from the University of Rio Grande do Sul. This will be
      evaluated in a cluster randomized clinical trial.
