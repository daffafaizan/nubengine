           vaccine should be stored at 2-8 â„ƒ to protect the efficacy (titer) of the vaccine from
           being damaged.All vaccines must be stored and transported at temperatures that meet
           regulatory requirements.A cold chain system is required to support and monitor the
           temperature at all stages of the vaccine from production to final inoculation (aircraft,
           ship, train, automobile, motorcycle, bicycle, walking, etc.);Cold storage, refrigerator,
           vaccine transport box, cold pack, ice bar, etc.) to avoid overheating or over-cooling.

        2. Treatment plan: intramuscular injection of vaccines of D1, D4, D7, D14, D21, D51, D142
           of the deltoid muscle of the left and right upper arm, every six months for the next 3
           years, and every year for the next 3 years, until the patient withdrew from the clinical
