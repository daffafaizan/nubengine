      consecutive nursing shifts, the infant will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention
      (swaddling) or control condition (no swaddling) first, by the research OT randomly choosing
      an envelope with the assignment enclosed. The intervention and control feedings for each
      infant will be consecutive and will take place at the infant's bedside in the NICU. Infants
      will be assessed at each nursing care time for feeding readiness by the research OT and
      feeding OT according the policies of the NYU Langone Medical Center NICU, which utilizes the
      Infant-Driven Feeding Scale-Readiness (Appendix B) (Ludwig & Waitzman, 2006). When the infant
      demonstrates readiness, the first condition will be initiated. At the next feeding when the
      infant demonstrates readiness, the opposite condition will be applied. If the infant is not
      available due to procedures or not demonstrating feeding readiness, at the next two
      caregiving times after the first feeding, the infant will be discontinued for that day and
      will start the study over the next day.
