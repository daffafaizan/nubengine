      corneal and conjunctival cells. Determining if a patient has hyperosmolarity is critical
      allowing us to offer therapies to correct the problem. Reducing and regulating osmolarity is
      important in preventing potential long-term tissue compromise. Treatment leading to
      decreasing tear osmolarity can improve the patient's quality of life by stabilizing vision
      and, in many cases, simply allowing patients to return to normal activities.

      Fatty Acids (EFA) have been shown to diminish inflammatory responses in many human
      inflammatory diseases, and interest in the use of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids for disease
      treatment has resulted in several small studies as well as the use (and over-the-counter
      availability) of EFA-containing nutritional supplements, including several specifically for
      the treatment of DED. Unfortunately, the effects of Omega 3 on dry eye disease have not been
      established to date. The purpose of this study is to better understand the role of Omega 3
      plays in the regulating tear osmolarity in patients with established findings consistent with
      dry eye disease.
