    
      Pre-specified primary analysis for Aim 1 is the change in AHI with combination treatment
      versus oral appliance alone (%reduction versus placebo; including hypopnea events without
      desaturation/arousals).

      Aim 2 seeks to identify subgroups of patients that have the greatest reduction in AHI
      (responders) with each treatment (post-hoc). We will use baseline physiological measures of
      the four traits causing OSA (collapsibility, responsiveness, loop gain, arousal threshold) to
      determine which characteristics predict responses to each intervention (leave-one-out support
      vector machine modeling). Clinical measures of the same traits will be estimated from the
      placebo night to confirm that responses can be predicted with clinically-available data. We
      will also test whether responders to oral appliances have a greater response to oxygen than
      oral appliance non-responders (and vice-versa), to address whether responders to both
      treatments are similar or different.
