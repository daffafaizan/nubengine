      malnutrition, both under and over nutrition, is highly prevalent. Children who are
      malnourished while undergoing treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) are shown to
      have chances of reduced survival. Children, who are malnourished at diagnosis, if the
      nutritional status is improved over the course of 6 months during the ALL treatment, have
      chances of similar survival as the ones who were nourished throughout. Therefore, it is
      important to study nutritional status in children with ALL, to understand and implement
      better treatment outcomes. Height and weight alone are considered incomprehensive in
      classifying nutritional status, especially in poorly nourished children. A more advanced
      nutritional assessment that distinguishes between fat and muscle mass is required. Treatment
      for ALL results in an increase in weight over the course of therapy with preferential gain in
      fat mass (FM) compared to fat free mass (FFM). Hence, there is a pressing need to advance
      nutritional assessment and implementation in pediatric oncology that includes monitoring of
      FM and FFM.
