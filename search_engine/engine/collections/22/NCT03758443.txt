    
      This protocol consists of 3 separate studies: an 8-week Phase 2b dose-finding induction
      study, an 8-week dose-confirming Phase 3 induction study, and a 44-week Phase 3 maintenance
      study. Subjects who respond to induction will enter the maintenance study; those who do not
      will receive TD-1473 during extended induction. The safety and efficacy data of the Phase 2b
      study will be analyzed to select the induction and maintenance dose regimens for the
      confirmatory Phase 3 studies. Participants who have disease relapse or complete the
      maintenance study may be eligible to enter a separate long-term safety study. Efficacy,
      pharmacokinetic, biomarkers, and safety will be evaluated in all 3 studies.

      240 subjects are planned for the Phase 2b and the planned Primary Completion Date for this
      portion of the study is JULY 2021. 640 subjects are planned for the Phase 3 portion of the
      study.
