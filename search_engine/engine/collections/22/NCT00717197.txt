    
      High grade gliomas (HGGs) represent a heterogenous group of primary brain tumors that share
      WHO grade III or IV classification (anaplastic astrocytoma, anaplastic oligodendroglioma,
      anaplastic mixed glioma, and glioblastoma multiforme). Despite the upfront use of surgery,
      radiation, and chemotherapy, high grade gliomas uniformly result in recurrence and death.
      Palliative chemotherapy offers an improvement in time to progression, symptom control,
      quality of life, and potential survival; however, no established chemotherapy regimen for
      recurrence exists and new treatments are needed. Oral capecitabine is a rationale strategy
      for therapeutic palliation of recurrent high grade gliomas given its oral administration, its
      well-known kinetics and toxicities, its non-competitive toxicities to other high grade glioma
      treatments, its well established management algorithms, its established evidence of entry
      into the central nervous system, and its evidence of safety and efficacy in malignancies in
      the central nervous system.
