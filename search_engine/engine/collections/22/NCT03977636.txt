      information technicians to control hospital activity coding in a Regional Hospital Center.

      From March 2016 to the beginning of January 2017, medical information technicians reported
      the time they spent on each quality control, and the time they needed when they had to code
      the entire stay. Multiple linear regressions were performed to identify the determinants of
      quality control or coding duration. A split sample validation was used: model was created on
      one half of the sample and validated on the remaining half.
