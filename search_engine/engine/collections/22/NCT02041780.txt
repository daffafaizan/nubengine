      evaluation of fibrosis. All children included will have a measure of liver stiffness using
      SWE with 5 measures performed in the area where the biopsy is performed and 5 measures in an
      other place in the liver. Fibrotest速/ Fibromax速 will be performed on blood sample. All exams
      will be done within 1 month. diagnostic performance of SWE and Fibrotest速/ Fibromax速 will be
      assessed respectively. algorithm using the results of both technics will be tested in order
      to test diagnostic performance and to obtain better performances.
