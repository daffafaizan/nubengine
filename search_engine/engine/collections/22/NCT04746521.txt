      adaptive compartment comprising B, T, and NK cells.

      The Investigators will recruit three classes of subjects:

        1. Patients with previous Sars-CoV-2 infection who did not undergo vaccination;

        2. Patients with previous Sars-CoV-2 infection who undergone vaccination

        3. Subjects without previous Sars-CoV-2 infection who undergone vaccination

      The Investigators aim's is to detect the cellular-mediated immune response in patients
      affected by COVID-19 and subjects who undergone vaccination program.
