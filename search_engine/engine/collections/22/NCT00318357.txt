      Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland,
      and UK). All patients that were reported to be alive in May 2005 will be asked to
      participate.

      In the CARE-HF LTFU program patients from the CARE-HF trial were asked to be enrolled for an
      additional 4 year follow-up. Investigators were free to choose whatever available treatment
      they believe is in the patient's best interest, however the outcome of the CARE-HF trial
      suggested that all patients should receive CRT therapy on top of Optimal Medical Treatment.
