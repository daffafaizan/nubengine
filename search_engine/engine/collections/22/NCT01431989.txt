      treatments, 02 sequences and 02 periods. The objective is to confirm if two formulations of
      Amoxicillin trihydrate, in the form powder for oral suspension, are bioequivalent. The test
      product is Amoxicillin trihydrate - Clamoxyl 500mg/5mL (Glaxo Wellcome Production.) in the
      form powder for oral suspension and reference product is Amoxil Â® 500mg/5mL (GlaxoSmithKline
      Mexico SA) in the form of powder for oral suspension. Twenty eight healthy volunteers, of
      both genders, were evaluated. The volunteers received, in each period, the reference or the
      test formulation, according to the randomization list, under fasting conditions. In each
      period blood samples are collected in the following times: 0.00 (prior to administration of
      medication); 0.25; 0.50; 0.75; 1.00; 1.25; 1.50; 1.75; 2.00; 2.50; 3.00; 4.00; 5.00; 6.00;
      8.00 (after administration of medication). The comparative bioavailability of the two
      formulations was evaluated based in statistical comparisons of relevant pharmacokinetic
      parameters, obtained from data of drug concentrations in blood.
