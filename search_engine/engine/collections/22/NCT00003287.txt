      administration of a 3 drug high-dose chemotherapy regimen on survival in patients with
      locoregionally recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer. II. Assess the antitumor effect of
      the combination of fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin given as first line
      chemotherapy in these patients. III. Assess the response rate and toxicity of this treatment
      in these patients. IV. Assess the quality of life of patients receiving this treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      performance status (ECOG 0-1 vs 2), extent of liver involvement (none vs less than 25% vs 25%
      or greater), and institution. Patients are randomized into 2 arms: Arm I (chronotherapy):
      Patients receive a 4 day infusion of fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin
      administered via pump using chronomodulated delivery rates. Arm II (fixed infusion rate):
      Patients receive leucovorin calcium and oxaliplatin as 2 hour concurrent infusions followed
      by fluorouracil as a 22 hour infusion on day 1. On day 2, patients receive a 2 hour infusion
      of leucovorin calcium followed by a 22 hour infusion of fluorouracil. For patients on both
      arms, courses repeat every 2 weeks until the occurrence of disease progression, severe
      toxicity, or complete remission for a minimum of 4 months. Quality of life is assessed prior
      to treatment and 2 weeks after courses 4 and 8. Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 554 patients will be accrued for this study.
