      receptors present in the thyroid cells and extra-ocular muscles and soft tissue of the orbit.
      The disorder is characterised by enlargement of the extra-ocular muscles, fatty and
      connective tissue volume.

      Upper lid retraction is the most common sign of the eye disease (present in up to 92%). The
      causes for retraction are not fully understood. It may be related to inflammation of the
      Levator muscle and the Muller muscle, or related to over sympathetic activity causing
      overstimulation of the Muller muscle.

      Upper lid retraction severity can range from very light to severe, with scleral show, eye
      dryness and even exposure keratopathy. Additionally it can have a very significant effect on
      the patient's appearance (a constant surprised look).

      Treatments for lid retraction include aggressive lubrication and tarsorrhaphy if needed
      (sewing the eyelids together).

      The Muller is a smooth muscle which elevates the upper eyelid and is sympathetically
      innervated (alpha receptor).

      The drug Tamsulosin which is a selective alpha1 receptor antagonist is commonly used today
      for benign prostatic hyperplasia (relaxing the prostate muscle).

      In this study we would like to test using Tamsulosin for treatment of lid retraction caused
      by thyroid eye disease. We hypothesise that the relaxation of the Muller muscle may have a
      beneficial effect on the retraction.
