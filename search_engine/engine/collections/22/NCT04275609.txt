      patients' quality of life. However, writing endoscopic report takes a lot of manpower and
      time, reducing the efficiency of endoscopy. Our center has developed a structured diagnostic
      report generation system for digestive endoscopy, which can generates the report by
      artificial intelligence. Here, we compare the efficiency of writing endoscopic reports by
      artificial intelligence and physicians through a randomized controlled trial.
