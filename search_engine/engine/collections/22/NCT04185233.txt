      anxiety consequent to venipuncture and insertion of a peripheral vein catheter. The
      comparator is nitrous oxide in a 50% mixture with oxygen that is routinely used for sedation
      during procedural pain. However, nitrous oxide has secondary effects particularly on the
      inhibition of Vitamin B12.

      The primary outcome is anxiety scores. Secondary outcomes are pain scores and satisfaction of
      parents and health providers.

      All children will have EMLA cream (mixture prilocaine and lidocaine) applied one hour prior
      to venous punction. Anxiety, pain and satisfaction scores will be recorded at baseline and
      then within an hour following the venipuncture and insertion of the peripheral vein catheter.
