      including male and female subjects with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS)
      as determined by a physician using the current diagnostic criteria for IC/BPS. A total of 36
      subjects will be enrolled at up to five (5) study sites in the U.S. Enrollment is expected to
      be completed within one year of initiating the study. The study is comprised of two parts.
      The first part of the study is a dose-ranging, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study evaluating the safety, tolerability and efficacy of LP-08 at 20 mg and 80 mg doses as
      compared with placebo. The second part of the study is an Open Label Extension study of the
      safety, tolerability and efficacy of LP-08 80 mg. Subjects randomized to the placebo control
      group must have completed the randomized portion study, including the eight week follow-up
      period, to be eligible for the Open Label Extension.
