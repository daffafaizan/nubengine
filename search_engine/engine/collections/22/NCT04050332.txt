      associated with self-report bias and cognitive processing. This study will test the utility
      of radio frequency identification (RFID) for the measurement of stair walking within
      buildings. RFID readers will be placed at stairwell entrances on each floor. Participants
      will wear a RFID tag. As the participant walks past the different readers going up and down
      the stairs, the reader will log the date and time. The frequency and duration of time in the
      stairwell can be calculated, as can an estimated speed.

      There are known effects for blood pressure (hypotensive) and moodafter exercise. However, few
      studies have assessed this effect for short bouts (<10 minutes) of exercise. Participants
      will have their pre- and post-stair walking blood pressure measured to determine the
      hypotensive and mood enhancing effects of four minutes of stair walking at a comfortable
      pace. Participants also will rate the exertion level of four minutes of stair walking at a
      self-selected pace.
