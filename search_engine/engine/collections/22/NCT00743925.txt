    
      This is a double-blind randomized parallel group placebo controlled study in subjects
      presenting with an ACS. Subjects will be randomized to receive either A 002 500 mg once daily
      (QD) or placebo tablets in addition to 80 mg atorvastatin QD.

      Randomization must occur within ≤96 hours of hospital admission for the index ACS event, or,
      if already hospitalized, within ≤96 hours of index event diagnosis. Follow-up visits will
      occur at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24 post-randomization; and monthly thereafter until
      study completion.

      All enrolled subjects will remain on treatment until all subjects have been treated for a
      minimum of 24 weeks or until the occurrence of a Major Adverse Cardiac Event (MACE). At that
      point, all active subjects (those who have not early withdrawn or those that have not already
      had a MACE) will be brought in for a Final Study Visit. Subjects who complete the Final Study
      Visit may be eligible to enroll in an open-label extension study for up to 2 years total
      study drug exposure.
