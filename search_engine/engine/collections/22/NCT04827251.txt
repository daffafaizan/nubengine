      selected at the Heart Institute (InCor USP) for the study. Patients will be instructed to
      abstain from caffeinated beverages during 22 days. After this period, one group will consume
      caffeinated coffee during 28 days, followed by decaffeinated coffee during more 28 days and
      another group will start with decaffeinated coffee followed by caffeinated. All participants
      will receive "Nespresso" coffee maker "Essenza" model. The coffee "Nespresso blend voluto"
      will be provided (caffeinated and decaffeinated). The patients will have to take four cups of
      espresso per day (three cups a day for patients aged 65 and over). The investigators will
      evaluate platelet aggregation by MultiplateÂ® (ASPI, ADP and arachidonic acid) and by optical
      aggregometry (ADP and arachidonic acid).
