    
      Aim 1. To examine the magnitude, location and timing of drug-induced dopamine release.

        1. Tobacco smokers (n=20) will be imaged with [11C]raclopride PET, after overnight
           abstinence from tobacco. Subjects will smoke their preferred brand of cigarette during
           the PET scan.

        2. Marijuana smokers (n=20) will be imaged with [11C]raclopride PET, after overnight
           abstinence from marijuana. Subjects will smoke a marijuana cigarette during the PET
           scan.

        3. Cocaine users (n=20) will be imaged with [11C]raclopride PET, after overnight abstinence
           from cocaine. Subjects will be administered cocaine during the PET scan.

      Aim 2. To examine the magnitude, location and timing of drug-induced beta-endorphin release.
      *The Investigators will attempt to use the same subjects from Aim 1 for Aim 2.

        1. Tobacco smokers (n=20) will be imaged with [11C]carfentanil PET, after overnight
           abstinence from tobacco. Subjects will smoke their preferred brand of cigarette during
           the PET scan.

        2. Marijuana smokers (n=20) will be imaged with [11C]carfentanil PET, after overnight
           abstinence from marijuana. Subjects will smoke a marijuana cigarette during the PET
           scan.

        3. Cocaine users (n=20) will be imaged with [11C]carfentanil PET, after overnight
           abstinence from cocaine. Subjects will be administered cocaine during the PET scan.
