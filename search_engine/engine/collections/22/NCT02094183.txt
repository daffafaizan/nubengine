      the weight loss over a longer period (e.g. one year) Therefore, we want to investigate the
      metabolic response and the importance for maintenance of weight loss in obese people, who
      lost at least 7, 5 % body weight by low calorie diet followed by 52 weeks of diet weight
      maintenance with or without supplement of GLP-1.
