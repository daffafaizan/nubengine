      drug), placebo controlled (substance containing no medication), study in healthy, overweight
      or obese adult male volunteers. For each volunteer, the study consists of a screening phase
      (up to 30 days), a treatment phase during which volunteers will receive 4 study treatments in
      a randomized (study sequence assigned by chance) sequence (28 days), and a follow-up phase
      (10 days). During the treatment phase there will be at least 7 days between each of the 4
      treatments. The four treatments will be JNJ-38431055, sitagliptin, JNJ-38431055 and
      sitagliptin, and placebo. The following safety evaluations will be taken throughout the
      study: Electrocardiogram (an ECG is a painless procedure that gives a picture of the
      electrical activity of the heart), blood pressure, heart rate, and blood samples for
      laboratory tests. The primary outcome will be the effect of JNJ-38431055 and sitagliptin on
      glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels. Study drug will be administered as single oral doses
      separated by at least 7 days. The four treatments will be JNJ-38431055, sitagliptin,
      JNJ-38431055 and sitagliptin, and placebo.
