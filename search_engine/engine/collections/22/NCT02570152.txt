      prepare sites for the conduct of future vaccine efficacy trials.

      Operational goals include:

        -  Build long-term collaboration with sites in dengue-endemic regions of South Asia where
           the incidence of clinical dengue illness can be studied.

        -  Establish dengue surveillance cohorts that can be followed long-term.

        -  Establish operational feasibility of future Phase III studies with regard to
           recruitment, case capture and sampling procedures.

        -  Prepare sites for participation in Phase III clinical endpoint studies.
