    
      Goal of the study: Evaluation of the effectiveness of BLS technique on a composite endpoint
      (pain at rest, pain during patient mobilization and opioid consumption).

      Open trial, therapeutic, prospective, monocentric. One group of patients who will benefits
      from the placement of two multihole catheters in BLS position:

        -  The ropivacaine group (40 patients): placement by the surgeon of two catheters in BLS
           position before the surgical incision. Administration of a bolus dose of 10 ml of
           ropivacaine 7, 5 mg/mL in each catheter followed by a continuous infusion of ropivacaine
           2 mg/ml in a rate of 3 mL/h during the first 48 hours postoperatively.

        -  The control group (80 patients) from the two previous studies who underwent standard
           analgesia with PCA morphine.
