      suggests that empagliflozin works quickly to lessen CVD mortality and reduce heart failure
      hospitalisations in patients with diabetes and existing cardiovascular disease. The lack of
      effect on non-fatal MI and stroke would suggest limited impact on atherothrombotic
      mechanisms. It is important to understand the mechanisms by which empagliflozin is acting in
      more detail, in order that the drug can be more widely targeted at patient groups that might
      benefit most; particularly patients with heart failure and diabetes (or pre-diabetes) (as
      discussed in the rationale).

      The investigators have hypothesised, in a detailed published review, that the benefit derives
      from the specific effects of sodium-glucose linked transporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibition on renal
      sodium and glucose handling, leading to both diuresis and improvements in diabetes-related
      maladaptive renal arteriolar responses. These haemodynamic and renal effects are likely to be
      beneficial in patients with clinical or subclinical cardiac dysfunction. The net result of
      these processes is an improvement in cardiac systolic and diastolic function and, thereby, a
      lower risk of heart failure hospitalisation (HFH) and sudden cardiac death.

      The investigators have therefore designed the present trial to perform a comprehensive
      clinical trial to interrogate in detail the effects of empagliflozin on specific pathways
      (inclusive of cardiac and renal effects) in patients with type 2 diabetes (or pre-diabetes)
      and heart failure.
