    
      The intervention plan during hospitalization will consist of daily monitoring of
      pharmacological efficacy and safety, participating in clinical rounds and patient interviews.
      To review, assess the indications according to the conditions of each patient and evaluating
      possible interactions of clinical importance, dose adjustments, potentially inappropriate
      medication for older adult (OA), adverse effects and omissions of therapy. To make
      recommendations to the healthcare team regarding pharmacological therapy received during
      hospitalization and at discharge.

      Patient-directed interventions will occur at discharge and post-discharge, focusing on
      clarifying management regimens, drug use motives, preventing drug-related problems,
      clarifying doubts and educating on pharmacotherapy, and enhancing adherence to treatment. The
      selection and recruitment of the patients will be made during the first 48 hours of their
      admission to the Internal Medicine Service (IMS), where they will be invited to participate
      and sign the informed consent.

      In all groups, a physician, pharmacist, and occupational therapist, blind to treatment
      assignment, will collect sociodemographic, morbid, pharmacotherapeutic, and functional
      (Barthel Index and Lawton & Brody Scale), adherence (Morisky & Green Scale), delirium
      (Confusion Assessment Method, CAM), comorbidity (cumulative illness rating scale in
      Geriatrics (CIRS-G)), anticholinergic burden (Anticholinergic Burden Scale and Ars Risk
      Scale), potentially inappropriate medications (Beers Criteria and screening tool of older
      people's prescriptions & screening tool to alert to right treatment criteria (STOPP & START))
      before, during hospitalization, at discharge and post-discharge. Also a follow up by
      telephone interviews at 30, 60 and 90 days after hospital discharge from the IMS.

      Two trained and independent evaluators (geriatrician and clinical pharmacist), blind to
      treatment assignment, will evaluate the history of each case and by consensus will assign the
      presence of Adverse Drug Events (ADE), and classify them as preventable or not and according
      to severity. The Chi-squared or Fisher exact test will be used to test the hypothesis that
      clinical pharmacist intervention prevents at least 50% of ADE at 3 months post-discharge in
      OA compared to usual care in the IMS.
