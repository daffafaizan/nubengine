      I. To assess the efficacy (response rate) of sunitinib (sunitinib malate) given orally daily
      in patients with advanced or metastatic previously treated epithelial ovarian, fallopian
      tube, or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

      II. To assess the toxicity of sunitinib in patients with advanced or metastatic previously
      treated epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma.

      III. To document cancer antigen 125 (CA125) response rate, early objective progression rate,
      and, if objective responses are observed, response duration.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sunitinib malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 3
      months thereafter.
