      typically treated with corticosteroids. Of those treated, approximately 60% respond, however,
      that response may be lost over time. Other therapies use to date have proven largely
      ineffectual in improving hearing. This study proposes a phase I open label clinical trial of
      Anakinra for corticosteroid-resistant patients to determine if this therapy is efficacious in
      hearing restoration.
