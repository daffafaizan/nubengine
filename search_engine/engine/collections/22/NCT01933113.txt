      different settings during stimulation of the LHA with DBS and to find the optimal setting for
      increasing the RMR in two patients that previously were implanted. Although 3 subjects had
      undergone placement of the DBS electrode in the pilot study, one subject was withdrawn from
      this study due to a lead breakage and medical instability pertaining to an unrelated
      abdominal infection.

      Each subject utilized the metabolic chambers and Deltatrac II Metabolic Carts (SensorMedics
      Corporation, Anaheim, California or Datex-Ohmeda, Helsinki, Finland) at Pennington Biomedical
      Research Center (PBRC), in Baton Rouge, Louisiana to objectively measure the correlation of
      their metabolic rate to various novel settings on the DBS for a one week period.

      The schedule for the metabolic testing included: Day 0 baseline overnight chamber with no
      stimulation. Days 1-4 Resting metabolic rate (RMR) will be performed hourly with variable LHS
      DBS settings. The settings will be changed approximately every 15 minutes after the DBS
      settings are changed. Day 4 overnight chamber at ideal metabolic rate setting. After RMR test
      on Day 4, the subject will have a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan performed to
      assess body composition.

      Subjects were also be seen in clinic as often as every month but no less than every 3 months
      to assess changes in weight until the study ended.
