      the patients will receive treatment with mecillinam and the other half will receive treatment
      with ibuprofen. The study will follow the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP).

      Urine cultures will be obtained on day one and after two weeks. The patients will be given a
      diary where they daily will register symptom load, possible complications or adverse effects
      and on which day they feel completely cured. We will contact the patients after two weeks to
      make sure they have followed the study procedures. After four weeks we will perform a final
      interview with the patient.
