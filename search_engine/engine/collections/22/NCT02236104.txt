      care department of Raymond Poincaré Hospital (Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris,Garches,
      France).

      Respiratory parameters and comfort will be evaluated before and after (5min,

      1h, 3h) a MI-E session. Vital capacity, maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressures (PImax
      and PEmax), peak cough flow and peak expiratory flows will be measured. Breathing pattern
      will be recorded allowing the measurements of respiratory frequency, tidal volume,
      Inspiratory time (Ti),total breath (Ttot) during tidal breathing and the calculation of
      tension-time index (TT0.1).

      Gas exchange will be evaluated by measuring end tidal CO2, transcutaneous CO2 and pulse
      oxymetry.

      Respiratory comfort will be assessed with a visual analog scale. Optoelectronic
      plethysmography will be use to perform regional ventilation evaluation. Using chest wall
      motion analysis we will compute respiratory participation of upper, lower thorax and abdomen,
      right and left side.

      Results should allow to analyse the effects of MI-E on regional ventilation. The mechanisms
      of action of MI-E on respiration and chest-wall motion will be analysed and the persistence
      of the beneficial effect of MI-E will be assessed.
