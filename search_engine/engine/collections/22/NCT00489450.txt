    
      This study was a randomized, open, single-dose, three-treatment, three-period,
      three-sequence, crossover study in which subjects were received, in random order, SK3530
      100mg alone, 0.5g/Kg of alcohol alone, and SK3530 plus alcohol together. There was a minimum
      of a 7 day washout period between treatments. The alcohol was diluted to 240 mL with water.
      The contents were drunk in 1 minutes or less. For SK3530 and metabolite measurement, plasma
      samples were collected at pre-scheduled time and the safety was monitored all through the
      study.
