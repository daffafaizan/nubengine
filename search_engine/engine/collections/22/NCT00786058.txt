      with advanced pancreatic cancer. No standard secondline regimen is available after PD. Best
      supportive care (BSC) is the main option for these patients. Our phase II study (Pelzer et
      al, ASCO 2002) showed activity of the OFF (Oxaliplatin/Folinic Acid/5-FU) regimen. To confirm
      these data we started this multicenter phase III study to examine OFF vs. BSC alone.

      165 patients were needed for this study. Following CT/ MRT confirmed PD patients were
      randomized. Stratification included duration of firstline therapy, Karnofsky Performance
      Status (KPS) and tumor stage. OFF (outpatient regimen): 5-FU 2g/m² (24h)/FA 200 mg/m² (30min)
      on d1, d8, d15, d22, additional Oxaliplatin 85mg/m² (2h) on day 8 and 22. Rest on day 23 and
      42.
