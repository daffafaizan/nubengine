      childbearing age, which seriously affects the health and quality of life of the vast majority
      of women. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is unknown until now, and the recurrence rate of
      existing treatment methods is high. It is more and more necessary to introduce new
      therapeutic methods and strategies in view of the mechanism associated with the reduction of
      natural killer cell (NK) cytotoxicity. In this study, routine therapy combined with NK cell
      therapy was used in the treatment of severe endometriosis. The clinical data were collected
      to confirm the efficacy and safety of NK cell therapy. It is expected to provide a new way of
      thinking and method for the clinical treatment of EMs.
