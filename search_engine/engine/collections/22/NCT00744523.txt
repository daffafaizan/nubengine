    
      Test Device:

      Mo.Maâ„¢ Proximal Flow Blockage Cerebral Protection Device. Single size catheter device with a
      9 French introducer sheath compatible shaft (outer diameter) and a 6 French compatible
      working channel (inner diameter), integrating two compliant balloons intended to achieve
      endovascular clamping of external carotid arteries (ECA) 3-6 mm in diameter and common
      carotid arteries (CCA) 5-13 mm in diameter.

      Primary Objective:

      Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the Mo.Ma device for cerebral protection in the
      treatment of internal carotid artery (ICA) stenoses, which may or may not involve the
      bifurcation of the CCA, in subjects considered to be at high surgical risk for complications
      during carotid endarterectomy (CEA).

      Primary Endpoint:

      Major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCE) within 30 days of implantation.
      MACCE are defined as: any myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or death through day 30
      post-procedure.
