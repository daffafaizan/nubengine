      risk factor for type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. It is also often linked to
      cardiovascular disease, certain cancers (e.g., colorectal, esophageal, endometrial, and
      ovarian), and inflammatory diseases (e.g., psoriasis, osteoarthritis,inflammatory bowel
      disease).The phenotyping of subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) hematopoetic cells from obese
      subjects by flow cytometry, microscopy and gene expression will enable us to identify
      inflammation in this tissue and may help us to understand the causes and consequences of
      obesity in order to determine how these cells might be implicated in the initiation and/or
      progression of the aforementioned diseases.
