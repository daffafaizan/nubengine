      therapy. This phenomenon, which is secondary to vascular injury outside the treated segment,
      was strongly correlated with the development of restenosis at the edges of the treated
      coronary segment. The European and Canadian SIRIUS trials (E and C-SIRIUS) randomized 350
      patients with similar baseline characteristics of the US SIRIUS study. Operators used shorter
      post-dilatation balloons and direct stented 27% of the patients, achieving a 4.0% TLR rate
      and a 5.1% in-lesion binary restenosis. These somewhat superior results support the concept
      that refinement in deployment techniques may further improve clinical outcomes of
      drug-eluting stents.
