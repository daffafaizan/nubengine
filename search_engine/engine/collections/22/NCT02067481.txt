      The present study assessed changes in weight, quality of life (QoL) and cardiorespiratory
      fitness (CRF) during a diet and physical activity (PA) intervention in breast cancer (BC)
      survivors and investigated the possible relation between these changes.

      Methods:

      The intervention of this 12-week single-arm pre-post pilot study involved group-based
      sessions: one-hour weekly diet sessions delivered by a dietician and 75-minute bi-weekly PA
      sessions of moderate-to-high intensity led by PA monitors. This intervention, designed to
      promote weight loss, targeted overweight/obese women who had completed treatment less than
      six months before recruitment. CRF and QoL were assessed before and after the intervention
      and compared using paired t-tests. Linear regression models, including CRF variables, weight
      change and participants' characteristics, were used to assess the independent association
      between change in CRF and change in QoL.
