    
      Each subject enrolled will already be scheduled to undergo a hip, shoulder or knee
      replacement, limb amputations or other orthopedic surgical procedures and each subject
      enrolled in the non-control group will have retrospectively undergone one or more
      administrations of MultiHance or PROHANCE with the last dose administered at least 1 month
      before their scheduled surgery. In order to classify the subjects' renal status, the serum
      creatinine (SCr) value and/or estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at the time of last
      MRI with MultiHance or ProHance must be available and collected. The control subjects'
      documented SCr values will be collected prior to enrollment in the study.

      The bone and skin tissue sample(s) collected (during the subjects surgery) will be blinded to
      gadolinium based contrast agent (GBCA) exposure and sent to a central laboratory where they
      will be tested for gadolinium (Gd) and other analytes including calcium, phosphorous, sodium,
      iron, zinc, and potassium. The Gd deposition of the resected bone and skin tissue will be
      analyzed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). The bone and skin tissue
      will also be analyzed for other analytes using ICP-MS. These sample(s) will be stored at the
      central laboratory.

      A separate sample of the skin tissue collected (during the subjects' surgery) will also be
      sent to a central dermatopathologist who will be blinded to GBCA exposure and test for any
      possible NSF related abnormalities. These skin tissue sample(s) will be stored with the
      central dermatopathology laboratory.
