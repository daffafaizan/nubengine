      applied by the method of major autohemotherapy in the last six months from the time the first
      COVID-19 case of Turkey reported (Mar 11, 2020). Individuals who received ozone therapy
      locally or fewer than ten sessions, who did not want to participate were excluded.

      The major autohemotherapy procedure to all the participants was applied as follows: 100mL of
      blood was drawn by a vacuum from the antecubital vein into a sterile glass bottle in which 12
      mL of 3.13% sodium citrate solution as an anticoagulant (MediPac®, Germany). A corresponding
      volume (100mL) of gas with an ozone concentration of 10-20 µg/mL was immediately added and
      continuously mixed by a gentle rotating movement to avoid foaming to the blood in the bottle.
      Ozone was produced by a Blue-S medical ozone generator (Turkozone®, Turkey). Reinfusion was
      accomplished in about 15-20 minutes, and the whole procedure was carried out in approximately
      30 minutes and was repeated two or three times a week.
