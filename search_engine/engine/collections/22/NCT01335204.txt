    
      Cabazitaxel will be administered IV on day 1 of each 21-day treatment cycle. Bavituximab (3
      mg/kg) will be administered as an intravenous (IV) infusion on a weekly basis (Cycle 1 Day 2,
      all other cycles Day 1; day 8, day 15). Patients will receive cabazitaxel (day 1) plus
      bavituximab weekly of each 21-day cycle for up to 8 cycles.

      Up to 31 patients will be enrolled to ensure 28 evaluable subjects. The accrual period is
      expected to be between 12 to 18 months (1-1.5 years).

      Subjects will remain on the treatment phase of the study until any of the following events
      occur:

        -  Disease progression as evidenced by an increase in the prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
           level, worsening of pain, or disease progression by Response Evaluation Criteria in
           Solid Tumors (RECIST)

        -  Completion of 8 cycles of cabazitaxel-bavituximab therapy (day 169)

        -  Development of toxicity that, in the investigator's judgment, precludes further study
           participation

        -  Significant protocol violations or noncompliance on the part of the patient or
           investigator

        -  The investigator's judgment that discontinuation is in the patient's best interest

        -  Initiation of alternative antineoplastic treatments.

        -  Refusal of the patient to continue treatment or follow-up

        -  Loss to follow-up

      After completion of the treatment phase, subjects will remain on the followup phase of the
      study until any of the following events occur:

        -  Refusal of the patient to continue treatment or follow-up

        -  Loss to follow-up

        -  Death

        -  The investigator's judgment that discontinuation is in the patient's best interest
