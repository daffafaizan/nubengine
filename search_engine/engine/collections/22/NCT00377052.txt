        -  Determine the efficacy (response rate) of bortezomib and gemcitabine hydrochloride in
           patients with relapsed mantle cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to progression and duration of response in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over
      30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter until relapse/progression.
