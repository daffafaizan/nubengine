      result from defects in collagen formation. People with EDS are often affected by chronic,
      progressive pain poorly responsive to conventional treatment. We propose to investigate the
      efficacy of mind-body therapy for treatment of chronic pain in Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome. A
      cohort of adult subjects will be treated with mind-body therapy in a pilot study to assess
      the efficacy and acceptability of this treatment modality. The primary outcome measure will
      be change in pain as scored with a standardized inventory. We will also evaluate general
      health status, psychological variables, medication usage, and physical performance abilities.
