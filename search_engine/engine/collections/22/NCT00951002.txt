      The advantages of this technique include simple and repeatable application, preservation of
      sphincter integrity, minimal patient discomfort, and the ability for subsequent surgical
      options if needed. Champagne et al reported using a biologic absorbable anal fistula plug
      which is made from lyophilized porcine small intestinal submucosa (Surgisis®). In their
      series of 46 patients treated with the anal fistula plug, a success rate of 83 percent was
      achieved at a median follow-up of 12 months. In addition, evaluation of the functional
      outcome after fistula closure showed no impairment of continence with significant improvement
      in quality of life showed. However, the long term success rates of Surgisis® are variable
      according to other studies.

      Human acellular dermal matrix (ADM) is a biologic material consists of dermis without its
      cellular components. Early and rapid revascularization of the implanted ADM, as was shown in
      our previous experimental study, is thought to enhance resistance to infection and
      contamination. These properties make ADM an attractive alternative for the treatment of anal
      fistula. The ability of ADM to become vascularized and remodeled by autologous cells may be
      advantageous for anal fistulas healing.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether human acellular dermal matrix plug is
      effective in the treatment of anal fistula.
