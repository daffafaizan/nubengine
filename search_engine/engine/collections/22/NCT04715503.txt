      aneurysm and planned for elective surgical treatment of intracranial aneurysms. Prior the
      planned surgery, all study subjects will undergo PET-imaging of the brain with 18F-FDG- and
      68Ga-DOTANOC-tracers targeting glucose metabolism and somatostatin receptors in inflammatory
      cells. After PET-imaging, samples for histopathological examination from the intracranial
      aneurysm sac will be collected during the surgery from every study subject. Blood samples are
      collected prior to aneurysm operation from the routine pre-operative laboratory tests.
      Cerebrospinal fluid samples are collected during the surgical procedure from the surgical
      site. From blood samples we will evaluate expression of 20 different circulating microRNAs
      (miRNA) and the level of tumor necrosis factor-1, interleukin 1 beta, vascular endothelial
      growth factor, and evaluate correlations between miRNA expression and SUVmax in PET-imaging
      and miRNA and aneurysm histological findings.

      Correlation between inflammatory findings in histological studies and PET-imaging will be
      evaluated (correlation of SUVmax to aneurysm histological findings).
