      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose, safety and efficacy of AR-42 in combination with
      pomalidomide in relapsed multiple myeloma (MM) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine time to progression (TTP). II. To determine overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of HDAC inhibitor AR-42 and pomalidomide.

      Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-21, dexamethasone PO twice weekly
      (BIW) or thrice weekly (TIW) weeks 1-3, and HDAC inhibitor AR-42 PO BIW or TIW on weeks 1-3.
      Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days.
