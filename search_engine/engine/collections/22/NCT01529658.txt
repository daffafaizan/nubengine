      51,000 new renal cancers will be diagnosed in the United States. To preserve renal function,
      urologists commonly remove the diseased segment of the kidney (partial nephrectomy) instead
      of removing the entire kidney (radical nephrectomy). While the benefit of preserving function
      in patients with renal cell carcinoma has become clear, optimal preservation techniques are
      yet to be determined. Specifically, the role of hypothermia during partial nephrectomy has
      been inadequately studied despite theoretical benefit. The investigators objective is to
      assess the effectiveness of renal hypothermia during partial nephrectomy. The investigators
      hypothesis is that renal hypothermia during partial nephrectomy results in improved
      post-operative renal function compared to warm ischemia.

      Methods: To test the investigators hypothesis, 180 partial nephrectomy patients will be
      randomized to cold or warm ischemia. Global and side-specific renal function will be assessed
      pre-operatively and 12 months post-operatively using radionucleotide clearance and renal
      scintigraphy.

      Significance: To the investigators knowledge, this study will be the first prospective trial
      to evaluate the clinical impact of renal hypothermia during partial nephrectomy. Since renal
      function preservation is the primary purpose of partial nephrectomy, these findings will have
      an important impact on surgical technique and patient outcome.
