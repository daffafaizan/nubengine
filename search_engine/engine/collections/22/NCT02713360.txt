      outcome assessment, including two university hospitals, with 1:1 randomisation to cognitive
      therapy plus usual care or usual care alone.

      The intervention: all patients receive usual care. Patients in the intervention group will
      receive an intervention based on cognitive behavioral therapy. The intervention consists of
      three steps: 1. The intervention begins with a consultation with a nurse aiming at uncovering
      anxiety using the Hamilton anxiety scale and exploring how life with an ICD is perceived, 2.
      Based on the pre-specified protocols for each type of anxiety, cognitive therapy is provided
      and 3. After each session participants are asked to fill out the HADS questionnaire. When the
      patient scores below the cut-off value two times in a row, sessions will end. Each patient
      can have a maximum of 15 sessions.
