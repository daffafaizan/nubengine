      progressive wasting and paralysis of voluntary muscles. It is known that nerve cells called
      motor neurons die in the brains and spinal cords of people with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
      (ALS). However, the cause of this cell death is unknown.

      In this double blind, randomized, selection design trial, researchers will evaluate the
      safety and effectiveness of creatine and tamoxifen in volunteers with ALS. There are a large
      number of potential drugs that may improve the survival or slow down the disease progression
      in people with ALS. The current strategy is to test one drug at a time against placebo.
      "Selection Design" is a different type of study design. A Selection Design study uses
      multiple drugs to screen against each other and picks the winner to take to a larger study.
      This design can speed the search for effective drugs to treat ALS. In this Selection Design
      study, each volunteer will take one active study drug (creatine 30gm, tamoxifen 40mg, or
      tamoxifen 80mg) and one placebo.

      Approximately 60 eligible volunteers with ALS will be recruited from multiple centers in the
      US that belong to the Northeast ALS Consortium (NEALS). Volunteers will be randomly assigned
      equally to the three treatment arms: creatine 30gm/day, tamoxifen 40mg/day and tamoxifen
      80mg/day. Volunteers will take study treatment for 38 weeks. After screening and
      randomization, volunteers will be followed at weeks 4, 10, 18, 28 and week 38. A final
      telephone interview will occur at week 42 (off study drug).
