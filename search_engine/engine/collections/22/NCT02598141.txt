      A. Compare the two techniques in terms of bacterial species identified.

      B. Compare the diagnostic capabilities (sensitivity and specificity) of the two sample
      processing techniques depending on the type of analyzed samples (soft tissue, bone tissue)
      (subgroup analysis).

      C. Compare the diagnostic capabilities (sensitivity and specificity) of the two sample
      processing techniques depending on the type of joint (subgroup analysis).

      D. Compare the diagnostic capabilities (sensitivity and specificity) of the two sample
      processing techniques depending on the type of implanted materials (prosthesis versus other
      equipment) (subgroup analysis).

      E. Develop a culture collection of bacteria isolated from infection osteo-articular
      protheses.
