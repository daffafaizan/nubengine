    
      Outline: This is a dose-escalation study of vorinostat. The purpose of this research study is
      to test the safety and effectiveness of a combination of two cancer drugs, sorafenib
      (Nexavar) and vorinostat (Zolinza), in advanced liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma).
      Advanced means that the cancer has spread too far to consider surgery. Approximately 19
      people will take part in this study.

      After enrollment of 6 patients at sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day and vorinostat 300 mg
      orally, only 2 of the 6 patients were evaluable for DLT (no DLTs). The other 4 patients were
      not evaluable for DLT because of required dose modifications. Because of this dose
      modification need, Cohort A has been modified to include 2 dose levels: Dose level A-1a
      (sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day and vorinostat 200 mg orally once a day) and dose level
      A1 (sorafenib 400 mg orally twice a day with vorinostat 100 mg orally once a day). The
      starting dose upon reopening after approval of this version will be dose level A-1a. Dose
      level A1 will only be used if dose level A-1a is not tolerable.
