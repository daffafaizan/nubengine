      derivative (PPD)-positive individuals. Problems with this treatment include compliance,
      adverse reaction, and the possibility of not preventing disease due to INH-resistant
      organisms. Studies suggest that two or three months of rifampin and pyrazinamide may be more
      effective than longer courses of INH. A two-month prevention course should help to increase
      compliance. In addition, the use of two drugs (rifampin and pyrazinamide) may help overcome
      problems with drug resistance.

      After baseline screening, patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms and are
      evaluated by means of clinic visits monthly for the first three months, then every three
      months for the first year (there are additional clinic visits for INH patients). Patients are
      then evaluated every six months. One group of patients takes INH plus vitamin B6 for 12
      months. The other group of patients takes 1 of 2 doses of rifampin (depending on patient's
      weight) plus pyrazinamide in 3-4 divided doses for 60 days.
