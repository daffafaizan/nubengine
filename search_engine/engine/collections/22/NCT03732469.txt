      attention from all medical subspecialties. This includes reproductive endocrinology and
      infertility (REI), where opioids are primarily utilized for intraoperative and postoperative
      pain management for outpatient procedures such as oocyte retrievals, operative hysteroscopy,
      and laparoscopic myomectomy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the
      administration of rectal acetaminophen in addition to the current, standard anesthesia and
      analgesia protocol in oocyte retrievals can help decrease utilization of prescribed opioid at
      home following oocyte retrieval. Rectal acetaminophen will be used rather than conventional
      IV acetaminophen because of the lack of access to IV acetaminophen at the study institution.
      Rectal acetaminophen is appealing because it is cheap, readily available in most medical
      centers and there is the potential for increased analgesic benefit due to the proximity to
      the vaginal and ovarian tissue, as well as the possible benefit from the partial avoidance of
      hepatic first-pass metabolism. This trial has the potential to provide practice-changing
      clinical information to the field of REI. The information gained can even translate to other
      ambulatory procedures and guide clinical practice. The investigators hypothesize that
      participants given rectal acetaminophen in addition to standard anesthesia/analgesia at the
      end of their oocyte retrieval will use less amount of prescribed Tylenol with codeine 3 days
      after discharge from the surgery center compared those receiving standard
      anesthesia/analgesia for oocyte retrieval.
