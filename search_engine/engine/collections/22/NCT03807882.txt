      treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) and will be conducted in the Department of
      Psychiatry, AIIMS, Bhubaneswar, over a period of 16 months. Sixty patients with TRS (IPAP
      criteria), fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criterion will be recruited for the study.
      Written informed consent will be taken after explaining the objectives and procedure of the
      study in detail. The detailed history, relevant social-demographic and clinical data will be
      collected in a structured case record form (CRF). At baseline, PANSS will be administered to
      determine the severity of positive symptoms, negative symptoms and general psychopathology,
      Global assessment of functioning (GAF) and CGI to determine the baseline severity of the
      illness and improvement with treatment and MoCA to assess change in cognitive impairment.
      Before starting the treatment, brain SPECT-CT will be done to measure baseline regional brain
      blood perfusion. The study cohort will be randomized into two treatment groups by
      computer-generated random numbers, each group comprising of 30 patients. One group will
      receive maintenance ECT (M-ECT) following acute treatment of bilateral ECT of six sessions
      along with ongoing antipsychotic and the other group will be treated with Clozapine
      monotherapy. PANSS, GAF, CGI, MoCA will be re-administered at 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months
      follow-up visits to compare the changes within each group and between the groups.
      Post-treatment SPECT-CT of the brain will be done at the end of 6 months to document change
      in the regional cerebral blood perfusion.
