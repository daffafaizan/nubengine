      is the axillary dissection with variable options in both of them according to multiple
      factors. Mastectomy represents a part of several operations as radical and modified radical
      mastectomy, while in others it may be the whole operation as in palliative simple mastectomy.
      Moreover, re-excision of local recurrence is another form of surgical intervention.

      At the step of mastectomy or re-excision of locally recurrent disease, the challenge of
      closure may arise, as simple primary closure may not be possible because of wide wound gap.
      In this situation, reconstruction is unavoidably needed and this situation represents one of
      two situations in which reconstruction is indicated.

      As reconstruction sometimes needs certain expertise which may not be available momentarily
      and needs previous arrangement. Moreover sometimes mastectomy exceeds the previous
      expectation leaving a big gap beyond simple approximation, so the investigators developed a
      formula to assess the need of reconstructive coverage.
