      research suggests that treatment to slow disease progression may be most effective if
      introduced early in a patient's life before muscle weakness and sensation loss develop, as it
      may be easier to slow disease progression than to reverse disability that is already in
      place. Clinical outcome measures have been developed for adults (CMT Neuropathy Score) and
      for children 3 years of age and older (CMT Pediatric Scale). However, no CMT-specific
      clinical outcome measure currently exists to measure disease severity or progression in
      children from birth to 3 years of age. It is the goal of this study to develop and validate
      the CMT Infant Scale (CMTInfS) to meet this need.
