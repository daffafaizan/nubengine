    
      Subjects are recruited as patients in one of the neurology, neurosurgery, neuro-oncology,
      Multiple Sclerosis Clinic or cardiothoracic surgery clinics at OHSU. Eligible subjects will
      be enrolled in different groups based on their disease (MS, cardiac surgery or CNS vascular
      surgery, stroke). Subsequently a MRI and MRA of the brain using the standard contrast agent
      (Gadolinium) will be obtained; this study will be compared with the ferumoxytol-contrasted
      MRA and MRIs performed the next day(s).

      Visit 1: the subjects are enrolled and distributed in their corresponding group; also basic
      laboratory studies are obtained as well as a Gadolinium contrasted MRI and MRA of the brain.

      For Groups 1 and 2 (MS and Stroke):

      Visit 2: Ferumoxytol will be injected as an i.v. bolus. The total dose over 2 hours will not
      exceed 510mg, and can be divided into multiple smaller doses such as 1 mg Fe/kg to optimize
      MRA imaging and may be diluted up to 4 fold in normal saline to reduce T2* effects in the MR
      angiography.

      Visit 3: 24 hours after the second visit an MRI with the standard contrast agent will be
      done.

      Last visit: 1 month after Ferumoxytol administration, the subject will be reassessed with
      physical and laboratory exams.

      For Groups 3 and 4 (Cardiac surgery or CNS vascular surgery):

      After the screening visit (Visit 1) and baseline MRI and MRA you will be randomly assigned to
      one of two groups. These groups are very similar but there are slight differences in the
      schedule of events.

        -  Group 3a and 4a: ferumoxytol infusion (Visit 2) before surgery

        -  Group 3b and 4b: ferumoxytol infusion (Visit 2) after surgery

      Visit 2: Ferumoxytol will be injected as an i.v. bolus. The total dose over 2 hours will not
      exceed 510mg, and can be divided into multiple smaller doses such as 1 mg Fe/kg to optimize
      MRA imaging and may be diluted up to 4 fold in normal saline to reduce T2* effects in the MR
      angiography.

      Visit 3: 24-72 hours after the second visit an MRI with the standard contrast agent will be
      done.

      Last visit: 1 month after Ferumoxytol administration, the subject will be reassessed with
      physical and laboratory exams.
