      to its effect. These individuals have a four fold higher risk of a heart attack or stroke
      compared to those who respond to aspirin. Current tests for determining those who are aspirin
      resistant are not reliable. This study is assessing the effectiveness of a new assay in
      determining the rate and time it takes for people who are or are not on aspirin in forming a
      blood clot.
