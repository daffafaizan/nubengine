      and peripheral blood monocytes from normal individuals. The ongoing objective varies from
      investigation to investigation but in general the investigational goals are to better
      understand the immune function of monocytes purified from normal volunteers. In some
      instances the emphasis will be upon comparing the specific immune function (e.g. ability to
      sense endotoxin and release a cytokine) from blood monocytes as compared to human alveolar
      macrophages. This comparison is not the only goal of the study, however. In many cases the
      immune function of the monocyte will be sufficient in and of itself as an investigational
      goal. In other cases the same is true of alveolar macrophage function.
