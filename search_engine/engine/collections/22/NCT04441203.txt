    
      This will be a single center, prospective, randomized, open-label blinded-endpoint (PROBE)
      trial in which the treatment group will be implanted with a CardioMEMS HF sensor and managed
      using remote access to hemodynamics compared to a non-implanted control group. Patients with
      at least one hospitalization for HF (â‰¥1) in the previous year (12 months) will be randomized
      into two groups, regardless of LVEF:

      Usual care with the specialized multidisciplinary HF clinic team (Non-implanted Control) or
      Hemodynamic monitoring, less intense HF clinic follow-up, and remote follow-up by a nurse
      clinician and patient empowerment with access to the PAP data (CardioMEMS group).

      Primary and secondary endpoints will be compared between groups after 12 months of follow-up
      and within groups comparing baseline parameters with 12 month follow-up measurements.
