        -  Determine the complete remission rate of patients with relapsed or refractory acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia treated with arsenic trioxide.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of induction arsenic trioxide in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to administration schedule of arsenic trioxide (5
      days a week vs 7 days a week).

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1 hour daily until bone marrow blasts are less than
      5% or for a maximum of 60 days. Beginning 3-6 weeks after induction, patients achieving a
      complete remission receive arsenic trioxide IV over 1 hour daily either 5 days or 7 days a
      week for 25 days. Subsequent consolidation courses are given with 4 week treatment-free
      intervals between courses. Treatment continues for a maximum of 5 consolidation courses in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 13-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
