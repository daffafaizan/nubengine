      every other week (eow) treatment period (Period 1), a 40-week double-blind placebo controlled
      eow treatment period (Period 2) with an opportunity to receive at least 12 weeks of rescue
      therapy with open-label adalimumab (participants that flared at Weeks 60, 64 or 68 were
      allowed 12 weeks of rescue therapy and final visits were at Weeks 72, 76 or 80 respectively),
      plus a 70-day follow-up phone call. Participants in sustained Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease
      Activity Score (ASDAS) inactive disease were randomized at Week 28 at a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either blinded adalimumab 40 mg eow or matching placebo. The length of exposure to adalimumab
      depended on remission or flare status and ranged from 20 (first time Ankylosing Spondylitis
      Disease Activity Score [ASDAS] remission was calculated) to 80 weeks of treatment.
