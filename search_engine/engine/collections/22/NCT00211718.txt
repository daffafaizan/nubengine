      an important treatment problem, especially for the young, very old and those with complex
      medical problems that preclude joint reconstructive surgery. We hypothesized that
      intra-articular botulinum toxin could provide important joint pain relief in these patients.
      This is a prospective, double blined, placebo controlled 6month trial with an open label
      extension phase when pain returns to baseline levels (re-injection with 100units of botulinum
      toxin and 6 months followup thereafter).

      Comparisons: Intra-articular injection of botulinum toxin type a will be compared to
      intra-articular injection of placebo ( lidocaine then saline).
