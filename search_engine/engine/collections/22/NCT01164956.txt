    
      I. To assess the N-1-T as a study design to evaluate a symptom-directed intervention in
      children with cancer

      Primary objective

      -To evaluate the feasibility of conducting an N-1-T to evaluate MPH for cancer-related
      fatigue in children as a group

      Secondary objectives

        -  To evaluate the ability of the N-1-T to assess efficacy of MPH for an individual subject
           statistically and clinically definite answer (regarding the ability of MPH to reduce
           fatigue)

        -  To explore subject/family and oncologist perspectives on N1T participation

        -  To examine in a preliminary fashion whether there are patient, family, disease or
           study-related factors that are associated with attrition to help guide future
           large-scale N1Ts

      II. To evaluate MPH for treatment of cancer-related fatigue and related symptoms in children

      Primary objective

      -To evaluate the effect of MPH on cancer-related fatigue in children based on various
      assessments including pedsFACIT-F and a unidimensional single-item Likert scale for measuring
      fatigue

      Secondary objective

      -To assess the side effect profile of MPH for fatigue in children with cancer

      III. To evaluate fatigue assessment tools Primary objective

      -To evaluate correlation between fatigue scores
