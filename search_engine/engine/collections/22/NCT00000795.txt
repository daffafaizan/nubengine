      locations worldwide, a multivalent peptide vaccine has been constructed to include prevalent
      and divergent isolates, potentially providing for wide coverage of geographically isolated
      epidemics.

      Fourteen volunteers are entered at one of two dose levels of multivalent candidate vaccine.
      At each dose level, 12 volunteers receive vaccine and two receive placebo. At least eight
      volunteers at the low dose level must be monitored for 2 weeks before subsequent volunteers
      are entered at the high dose. Intramuscular injections are given on days 0, 28, and 168, and
      patients are followed for a minimum of 48 weeks after the initial immunization. Approximately
      13 clinical visits are required.
