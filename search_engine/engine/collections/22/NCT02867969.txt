      populations of neurons are already lost and compensatory resources exhausted at time of
      clinical diagnosis. This calls for early intervention strategies aiming to slow down disease
      progression already at the premanifest stage of the disease. Here we propose the world-first
      interventional study aiming to delay onset in a rare genetic neurodegenerative disease.
      Specifically, we propose a piloting study using continuous motor training provided via whole
      body-controlled video games (exergames) to establish proof-of-concept evidence that such
      training leads to motor and neural changes in pre-manifest SCA subjects. The subclinical
      effects will be unravelled within an intraindividual control study design by elaborated
      quantitative Video Management System (VICONÂ®)-based movement analysis and structural and
      functional 3 Tesla (T) magnetic resonance imaging. This will provide unique insights in
      underlying motor and neural networks and compensatory strategies. If successful, this
      piloting trial will provide the basis for a rigorous international multi-center large-scale
      study in a larger SCA population. Moreover, it will stimulate complementary tandem projects
      on effects of motor training on neural functioning and molecular pathways in premanifest SCA
      mouse models.
