      drink on nutritional status, inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in hemodialysis
      patients. 92 hemodialysis patients were selected for the study. Inclusion criteria included:
      mean age of 17-65 years old; having mild, moderate or severe malnutrition based on the SGA
      (subjective global assessment) assessment; being dialyzed at least 2 times a week for 3
      months. Exclusion criteria included: hospitalization in the last month; active infection;
      using immunosuppressant drugs or multi-vitamins; pregnancy. The Ethics Committee of Shiraz
      University of Medical Sciences reviewed and approved the protocol of this study.Informed
      consent were signed by all of them for participating in the study. Weight and height of the
      patients were recorded for BMI (body mass index) calculation. Then, all of the patients were
      assigned into 4 groups:

        1. consumption of 220 milliliters of whey drink three times a week,

        2. consumption of 220 milliliters of whey drink fortified with 400 milligrams of vitamin E
           three times a week,

        3. consumption of 400 milligrams of vitamin E three times a week,

        4. control group: no intervention. Patients were followed for 2 months. At the beginning
           and the end of the 2-month intervention period, 10 milliliters of blood were taken from
           all of the patients and nutritional status of the patients were assessed as the primary
           outcome. Serum levels of malondialdehyde, c-reactive protein, albumin, transferrin and
           lipoproteins were also measured. SGA, MIS and SF-12 questionnaires were filled for all
           of the patients at the beginning and the end of the study.
