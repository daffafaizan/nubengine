      outpatients who are suspected of having or have been diagnosed with coronary artery disease
      will be recruited. All subjects will be asked to undergo either a non-contrast MRI or a
      contrast-enhanced MRI of the coronary artery depending upon the focus of development at the
      time of their participation

      It is anticipated that healthy volunteers will undergo non-contrast or contrast-enhanced MRI
      for evaluating the image quality associated with each acquisition module of the developed
      technique and motion artifact associated with motion compensation strategy. For subjects
      receiving contrast, a total dose of up to 0.2 mmol/kg of a gadolinium based contrast agent
      will be injected intravenously provided all the safety requirements are met.

      Subjects undergoing a contrast-enhanced MRI will be screened using the standard clinical
      protocol to determine whether it is safe to administer contrast. If subjects do not qualify
      for contrast administration, they may be asked to have a research scan without contrast.

      Research MRI results will be compared with clinical diagnostic CT and/or invasive imaging
      studies for patients who have been evaluated with these exams at Cedars-Sinai Medical
      Center..
