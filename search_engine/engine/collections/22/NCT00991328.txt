      known complications seen in elderly patients after cardiac surgery. The etiologies of PD and
      POCD are unknown, but cerebral ischemia remains a prime candidate. Attempts to correlate
      reduced levels of systemic oxygenation (i.e. SpO2) with the development of PD/POCD have been
      to date disappointing.

      We believe that cerebral oximetry, a noninvasive technology that continuously monitors
      cerebral tissue oxygen saturation (SctO2), will enable us to answer the question of whether
      or not a correlation exists.

      The availability of an absolute cerebral oximeter (FORE-SIGHT), with its ability to establish
      and manipulate threshold values for SctO2, provides us the opportunity to assess the
      relationship between cerebral oxygenation and the development of neurocognitive
      complications.

      We propose a randomized, masked trial of 120 patients, adequately powered to assess the
      following:

        -  Is there an association between deficits in cerebral oxygenation and the occurrence of
           PD at some time in the 1st 5 days after the operation?

        -  Is there an association between deficits in cerebral oxygenation and changes in POCD
           scores shortly (5 days) after the operation and/or 4-6 weeks later? We hypothesize that
           individually tailored patient management guided with intraoperative and postoperative
           absolute cerebral oximetry monitoring using a tailored protocol designed to maintain
           SctO2 values above a specific threshold will result in improved neurocognitive outcomes
           in geriatric patients undergoing cardiac surgery.
