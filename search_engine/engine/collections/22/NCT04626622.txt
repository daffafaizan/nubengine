      had no symptoms of acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) and influenza at the time of
      inclusion and had not taken any antiviral medications to prevent ARVI and influenza for 30
      days before.

      The total duration of the study was 2 months: the first month participants took either
      Kagocel (the main group), or did not take anything at all (the control group), during the
      next 1 month all participants were monitored.

      The diagnosis of influenza and ARVI has been confirmed in accordance with the world health
      organization (WHO) guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of pandemic influenza A
      (H1N1) 2009 and other influenza viruses. All patient examinations are conducted in accordance
      with local routine clinical practice and local and international standards of care.

        -  demography

        -  anamnesis data (the incidence of ARVI and flu for previous year, the date of the lastest
           episode of the disease, the presence of concomitant diseases, including ENT-organs, the
           date of the lastest influenza vaccination).

        -  timelines: start of Kagocel's prevention - only for the group receiving Kagocel's
           prevention; start of the disease; duration of ARVI and influenza symptoms (fever,
           headache, runny nose, sore throat, cough); start of treatment

        -  symptomatic therapy (Yes/no, drug name)

        -  bacterial exacerbations (Yes/no)
