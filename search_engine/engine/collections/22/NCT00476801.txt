      wavelength, hence high energy, UVB (290-320nm) and longer wavelength, hence low energy UVA
      (320-400nm). The wavelengths of light that cause sunburn and are associated with skin cancer
      causation is the high energy UVB. UVA wavelengths can be further divided into relatively
      shorter wavelength, hence higher energy UVA2 (320-340nm) and longer wavelength, lower energy
      UVA1 (340-400nm). Phototherapy light boxes used in our clinic for the treatment of psoriasis,
      atopic dermatitis, and pruritus, as well as those used in tanning salons emit both UVB and
      UVA wavelengths of light. The advantages of using UVA1 light source in the treatment of skin
      conditions are 1) lack of skin cancer and sunburn causing rays (UVB/UVA2) and 2) as a
      consequence, the ability to treat patients more safely.

      Keloid, scleroderma, acne keloidalis nuchae, and burn scars are all characterized by
      collagenous thickening of the skin resulting in superficial and deep cutaneous sclerosis.
      Treatments for these disabling conditions are inadequate at present. Recently, in
      non-controlled studies, UVA1 was shown to induce improvement in patients with scleroderma,
      granuloma annulare and urticaria pigmentosa (1-3). The mode of action of UVA1 treatment is
      not completely understood, however, local immuno-modulation appears to be important (4). UVA1
      has also been shown to stimulate collagenase activity in a dose dependent manner in the
      dermis (5,6). We postulate, therefore, that UVA1 in appropriate doses can improve these
      fibrosing skin conditions safely through collagenase-mediated removal of excess dermal
      collagen.
