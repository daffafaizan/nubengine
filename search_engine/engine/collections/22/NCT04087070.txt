    
      Blood pressure is measured by an automated oscillometric device or arterial waveform from
      IntelliVue MX800 Bedside patient monitor (Philips Healthcare, Amsterdam, Netherlands).

      Following parameters will be measured by non-invasive electrocardiogram (ECG),
      photoplethysmograph (PPG), and an accelerometer on the chest and will be used to estimate the
      biosignal derived blood pressure.

        1. PAT(time between R peak of ECG and beginning of the pulse of PPG)

        2. PEP(time between R peak of ECG and peak of accelerometer signal)

        3. PTT(PAT-PEP)

      The algorithm of the biosignal derived blood pressure will be made using the MATLAB
      2016b(Mathworks, Natick, MA) program.

      The agreement between the non-invasive blood pressure and the biosignal derived blood
      pressure will be analyzed using Cohen's Kappa or Bland-Altman plot.
