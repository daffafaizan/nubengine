      I. To assess objective response rate of sorafenib tosylate (sorafenib [BAY 43-9006]) in
      metastatic medullary thyroid carcinoma in setting of inherited tumor syndromes, such as
      multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) 2A, MEN 2B, or familial medullary thyroid carcinoma
      (FMTC).

      II. To assess objective response rate of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in sporadic metastatic
      medullary thyroid carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess toxicity of sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) in patients with metastatic medullary
      thyroid carcinoma.

      II. Measure serum tumor markers calcitonin and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) pre-, during,
      and post-treatment to correlate with disease response.

      III. Correlate nuclear medicine functional imaging (fludeoxyglucose F 18 [F-18
      fluorodeoxyglucose] positron emission tomography [PET] scan) data obtained at pre-, during,
      and post-treatment with tumor response.

      IV. Correlate dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) data obtained at
      pre-, during, and post-treatment with changes in tumor permeability and vascularity with
      tumor response.

      V. Perform pharmacogenomic studies on procured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) if
      clinical responses are observed.

      VI. To correlate between the degree of retrovirus-associated sequence (Ras)-mitogen-activated
      protein kinase (MAPK) signaling inhibition and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      expression in the tumor and clinical response.

      VII. To correlate between the presence and type of ret proto-oncogene (RET) gene defects in
      tumor and clinical response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.
