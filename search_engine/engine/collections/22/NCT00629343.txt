      well as acceptability/tolerance of this dose schedule of combined drug treatment with
      temozolomide and azacitidine.

      Secondary objectives include determination of biochemical response to azacitidine as defined
      as change in methylation status. We will specifically be looking at changes in genome wide
      methylation patterns as determined by two high-throughput platforms:

        1. A single nucleotide polymorphism chip-based method (MSNP) for genome wide epigenetic
           profiling

        2. CpG island promoter arrays will be performed to focus on promoter methylation status.

      We will also monitor clinical response, time to progression and overall survival.
