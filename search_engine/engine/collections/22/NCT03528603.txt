      be randomized double-blind controlled crossover trials with 2 study visits. The participants
      will arrive to the facility after an overnight fast, and will be asked to consume their
      assigned EVOO either without (trial 1) or with (trial 2) a standardized low-phenolic food
      (such as rice, pasta or mashed potatoes) with 40 mL of one of 2 EVOOs that are matched for
      their total phenolic content, but with one oil containing oleocanthal, and one with very low
      levels of oleocanthal. At zero, two, 4 and 6 hours after EVOO intake a blood sample will be
      collected for the assessment of collagen- ADP-, and AA-induced platelet aggregation, as well
      as an untargeted metabolomics profile.

      As an assessment of phenotypic stability, a subset of individuals (n=5 per trial) that have
      exhibit either low or high platelet responses, will be asked to repeat the above study.
