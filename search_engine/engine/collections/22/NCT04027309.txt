      diseases is chemotherapy. A subgroup of these diseases is characterized by a specific error
      in the DNA of the leukemic cells. This is the FLT3 mutation, which leads to a change of a
      certain protein (FLT3) on the blasts. This altered protein plays an important role in the
      development of leukemia and the survival of leukemic cells.

      FLT3 can be inhibited by the drug midostaurin. Adding midostaurin to chemotherapy leads to
      better treatment results in patients with AML. Therefore, the standard treatment for AML or
      MDS-EB2 with a FLT3 mutation (FLT3-AML) is a combination of chemotherapy and midostaurin.

      Gilteritinib is also a drug that inhibits FLT3. In laboratory studies, gilteritinib was found
      to be significantly more specific and potent than midostaurin in inhibiting FLT3.

      Gilteritinib has subsequently been studied in patients with AML, who relapsed after previous
      treatment with chemotherapy. This resulted in a much larger number of complete remissions
      than previously seen when comparable patients were treated with midostaurin.
