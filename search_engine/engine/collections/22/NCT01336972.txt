      (eGFR), which was calculated with the 4-variable modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD)
      equation using a minimum of 2 creatinine measurements. The eGFR values were used to
      categorize participants into 1 of 3 mutually exclusive strata (> 60 [Group A], 30 to 60
      [Group B], and < 30 [Group C] mL/min/1.73 m^2). Each of the 3 groups received the same
      tolvaptan treatment.

      During the 3-week treatment period, participants were up-titrated on a weekly basis from
      45/15 mg to 60/30 mg to 90/30 mg (AM and PM [8 hours later] split-dose) to the maximally
      tolerated dose. The 3-week treatment period was followed by a 3-week post-treatment period
      during which no study medication was administered.

      The effects of the highest tolerated split-dose of tolvaptan on renal hemodynamics and
      pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters were assessed throughout the 6 weeks of the
      study. The reversibility of changes during the post-treatment period after withdrawal of the
      drug was determined and the acute transitory effects on kidney volume were also explored.
