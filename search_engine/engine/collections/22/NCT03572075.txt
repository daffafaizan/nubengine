    
      Symptomatic, nulliparous women with deep infiltrating endometriosis are included in the
      study.

      During the first medical examination, endometriosis related symptoms are assessed using NRS
      (Numerical Rating Scale); intestinal, sexual and urinary functions are evaluated with
      validated questionnaires (Knowles-Eccersley-Scott-Symptom Questionnaire (KESS), Female Sexual
      Function Index (FSFI), Bristol Female Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms (BFLUTS)); pelvic floor
      morphometry at rest, during pelvic floor contraction and during Valsalva manoeuvre is
      evaluated using 3D/4D transperineal ultrasound through the assessment of the levator hiatus
      area (LHA). Gynaecological examination, transvaginal and transabdominal ultrasound are
      performed.

      After the first medical examination, enrolled patients are randomized into two groups:
      patients in Group A receive standard care procedure and pelvic floor physiotherapy; patients
      in Group B receive standard care procedure only. Pelvic floor physiotherapy protocol consists
      of six sessions (weeks 1, 3, 5, 8, 11 from the randomization). After four months from the
      first medical examination, endometriosis related symptoms, intestinal, sexual and urinary
      functions and pelvic floor morphometry are reassessed for all patients, using the same
      procedures, comparing the two groups and evaluating the impact of pelvic floor physiotherapy.
