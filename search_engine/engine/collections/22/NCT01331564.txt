      childbearing women. The intervention goals are to decrease the prevalence of excessive
      pregnancy weight gain and mean weight retention in the first 18 months postpartum in
      socio-economically and racially/ethnically diverse sample of 1,641 pregnant women. Women will
      be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Intervention Group 1 will receive the
      intervention program only during pregnancy (e-intervention 1). Intervention Group 2 will
      receive e-intervention 1 plus intervention for 18 months postpartum (e-intervention 2).
      Control women will receive non-weight related content during both time periods at the project
      website. The primary hypotheses for the randomized controlled trial are: H1: The proportion
      of women in Intervention Groups 1 and 2 who gain more weight in pregnancy than is recommended
      by the IOM will be 33% less than the proportion of the women in the Control Group who gain
      excessively and H2: The Control Group will have a higher mean weight retention at 12 months
      postpartum than Intervention Groups 1 and 2.
