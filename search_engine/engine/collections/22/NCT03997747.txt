      To investigate the clinical relevance of conducting comprehensive molecular analyses on
      clinically annotated high-quality tumor specimens from patients with advanced stage
      osteosarcoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a single-center study.

      Biological specimens are collected from participating clinical site and analyzed by
      transcription profiling of RNA and microRNA; detection of DNA copy number changes and
      chromosomal rearrangements; epigenetic modifications analyses; and sequencing of genomic
      segments, genes, and regulatory regions to assess sequence variation. Clinical information
      associated with each specimen donor is also collected.
