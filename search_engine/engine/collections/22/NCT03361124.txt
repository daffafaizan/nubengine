      utilized in the post cesarean period to determine if laboratory definitions of anemia are
      different. Oxytocin is an antidiuretic hormone that is utilized after delivery of the fetus
      and placenta to contract the uterus and decrease blood loss both at the time of surgery and
      in the post-partum period. Here at the Penn State Hershey Medical center the investigators
      will use 20 units of oxytocin in a 1 L bag of LR in bolus fashion after delivery of the
      placenta. Other protocols use an extended course of therapy using 20 units of oxytocin in a 1
      L bag of LR in a bolus plus an additional 20 units of oxytocin in a 1 L bag of LR over an 8
      hour period of time.

      We hypothesize that:

        -  Women who receive the standard 20 mU of oxytocin in 1L of LR in bolus fashion plus 20 mU
           in 1L over 8 hours will have a decreased reduction in pre-operative vs post-operative
           hematocrit and hemoglobin versus those that receive 20 mU in 1L of LR.

        -  Women who receive the standard 20 mU of oxytocin in 1L of LR in bolus fashion plus 20 mU
           in 1L over 8 hours will have decreased blood loss by weight in the postpartum period
           compared to patients who receive 20 mU in 1L of LR.
