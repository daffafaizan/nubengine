    
      This 3-day study will enroll subjects with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis, as defined by
      the Hanifin criteria.

      All subjects will be screened for study enrollment at the baseline visit. Those meeting
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be fully consented (or assented) using an IRB-approved ICF.
      Subjects will then be randomized to either the treatment or control study arm. Those in the
      treatment arm will be instructed on product application technique and study instructions at
      baseline. Subjects will apply Aurstat BID, or as needed, to determine frequency of use as a
      surrogate marker for duration of therapy effect to affected, qualifying atopic dermatitis
      lesions.

      The investigator will assess treatment response using an ordinal scale for tolerability and
      an IGA scale for disease severity ratings. Subjects will assess treatment response using a
      VAS to rate pruritus and an ordinal scale to assess tolerability. Photography assessments
      will be obtained. All adverse events will be captured.
