      prognosis. Treatment with antiviral therapy may be effective in altering the course of the
      disease and decreasing mortality in these children. AZT has been shown to be effective in
      certain adult patients with symptomatic HIV infection. It is therefore likely that infected
      children may also benefit from this treatment.

      The participants receive AZT mixed with juice at a dose dependent on body size every 6 hours
      for 24 weeks. The children are evaluated weekly for the first 4 weeks, every two weeks for
      the subsequent 8 weeks, and monthly thereafter. Blood samples are collected periodically and
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by lumbar puncture on 2 occasions.
