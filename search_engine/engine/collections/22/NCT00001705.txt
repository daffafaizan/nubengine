    
      Patients with metastatic melanoma who are HLA-A201+ will be immunized with a modified peptide
      from the gp100 molecule that contains a signal sequence designed to improve peptide
      presentation by antigen presenting cells. This peptide called gp100:ES209-217 (210M) will be
      administered either alone or in combination with high or low dose IL-2. Patients will be
      evaluated for clinical response, as well as undergo studies of the immunologic response to
      the peptide immunization.
