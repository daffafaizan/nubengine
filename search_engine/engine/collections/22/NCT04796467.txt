      persistently high numbers dying from this disease. Due to low levels of glycolysis in
      prostate cancer cell, the uses of 18F-FDG PET/CT to detect prostate cancer and its metastases
      are limited. Prostate specific membrane antigen (PSMA), as known as folate hydrolase I or
      glutamate carboxypeptidase II, is overexpressed on the cells of prostatic adenocarcinoma.
      Various low molecular weight radiopharmaceuticals targeting PSMA such as PSMA-617, PSMA-11
      for 68Ga-labeling have been developed. 68Ga-PSMA PET/CT has demonstrated desirable
      sensitivity and specificity in the detection of prostate cancer lesions, which can find many
      micro lesions that cannot be identified by CT, MRI and bone scan. 68Ga-P16-093, a novel
      radiopharmaceutical targeting PSMA, with the urea fragment of a conjugate that employs the
      HBED-CC chelator for labeling with 68Ga(III). The HBED-based chelating ligand binds the
      68Ga3+ ion with high affinity in a pseudo-octahedral N2O4 coordination sphere by its two
      phenolate O, two amino-acetate carboxylate O, and two amino N donor atoms. Mark A. Green
      et.al had demonstrated that 68Ga-P16-093 provided diagnostic information that appeared
      equivalent to 68Ga-PSMA-11 in prostate cancer patients presenting with biochemical
      recurrence, and 68Ga-P16-093 exhibits less urinary excretion than observed for 68Ga-PSMA-11.
      This pilot study was prospectively designed to evaluate the early dynamic distribution of
      68Ga-P16-093 compared with 68Ga-PSMA-617 in the same group of prostate cancer patients.
