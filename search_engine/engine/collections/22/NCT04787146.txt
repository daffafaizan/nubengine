      (GhPSJ). Reducing these falls is one of the institutional goals. A dedicated working group
      has been created to put in place preventive and corrective measures.

      These falls can be caused by many factors to the patient:

        1. Intrinsic:

             -  History of a fall,

             -  pathologies (Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease),

             -  hearing and visual disturbances,

             -  urinary incontinence.

        2. extrinsic:

             -  Unsuitable shoes

             -  unsuitable habitat,

             -  slippery floors (eg bathroom).

      Among the intrinsic factors, polypharmacy is also found. It has been established that certain
      drug classes are at risk of falling, in particular psychotropic drugs (benzodiazepines,
      hypnotics, anxiolytics, antidepressants, neuroleptics) which promote sedation and dizziness,
      hypoglycemic drugs which cause hypoglycaemia in diabetic patients on -treated or
      antihypertensive drugs causing hypotension.

      It is now clearly established that drug adherence to treatment is poor in cities, giving rise
      to omissions but also sometimes to overconsumption of certain drugs, including psychotropic
      drugs.
