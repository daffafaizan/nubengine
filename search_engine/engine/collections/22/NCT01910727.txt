    
      This is a single group pre-post study designed to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness
      of a pilot intervention at improving the prevention and management of type 2 diabetes among
      American Indian youth. The intervention uses a Family Health Coach model to work with
      families of youth with diabetes or at high risk of diabetes. Health Coaches visit families in
      their homes and conduct intervention sessions with both youth and a designated adult 'support
      person' (e.g., parent, guardian, etc). For Youth Participants, the pilot intervention
      consists of 12 sessions (45-60 minutes in duration) delivered during a 6-month intervention
      phase, plus 6 check-ins delivered during a 6-month follow-up phase. There are also 4 optional
      social support visits for the Youth Participants in order to provide necessary assistance
      with challenges the youth may be facing. For Support Persons, the pilot intervention consists
      of 4 family skill building sessions (20-30 minutes in length) delivered during the first 4
      months of the Youth Participant's intervention phase. Support Persons will also be welcomed
      and encouraged to attend any of the Youth Participant sessions. All sessions are designed to
      be taught at the participant's home, but they may also occur at another location chosen by
      the participant (e.g. school, study office, clinic). Outcome data will be collected at
      Baseline, 3 months following Baseline, 6 months following Baseline, and 12 months following
      Baseline.
