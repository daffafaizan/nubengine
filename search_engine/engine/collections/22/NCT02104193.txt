      fatal. New therapeutic approaches, such as radiosensitizing agents, are needed to provide a
      significant survival advantage for those patients. Statins have been reported to enhance the
      efficacy of radiotherapy in addition to a neuroprotective effect. The aim of the study is to
      evaluate the effect of simvastatin on the efficacy and safety of radiation therapy in
      patients with brain metastases and on improving patients' quality of life.
