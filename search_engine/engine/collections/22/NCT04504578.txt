      keratoconic corneas. It is the only treatment that halts progression of keratoconus, It was
      first described in 1998 by Spoerl et al . A major limitation of the procedure that it cannot
      be used in corneas with pachymetry less than400 micrometers based on the fact that an
      irradiance of 0.37 mW/cm2 has been found to be cytotoxic for the endothelial cell layer.
      Since the absorption coefficient for the human corneas is 70 cm-1 and the intended surface
      irradiance is 3.0 mW/cm2, the 0.37 mW/cm2 irradiance is reached at 300 microns depth. In a
      400 microns thick cornea saturated with riboflavin, the irradiance at the endothelial level
      is 0.18 mW/cm2, which is a factor of 2 smaller than the damage threshold. Therefore, the 400
      microns limit is considered to be a safe limit to protect the endothelium and intraocular
      structures from the hazards of UV irradiation 12 However , the patients with advanced ectasia
      who are desperately in need for cxl , are the same ones who have thin corneas often below the
      threshold which is considered to be safe for CXL treatment However further studies with
      longer follow up and larger numbers of cases are needed to confirm our findings.
