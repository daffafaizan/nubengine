      caused by an inbalance of proliferation/apoptosis rate within the vascular wall. This
      pathological phenotype seems to be triggered by different environmental stress and injury
      events such as increased inflammation, DNA damage, and epigenetic deregulation. Many immune
      cells are increased in PAH, such as T and B lymphocytes. Remarkably, T cells are essential
      players of adaptive immunity and may be relevant initiators ("initial hit") of vascular
      remodelling. We will perform the first multi-omics study to: 1) investigate DNA methylome of
      circulating T cells isolated from peripheral blood of PAH patients, 2) detect transcriptomic
      profiles of lung tissues, 3) to assess if DNA methylation of distinct genomic regions in
      circulating T cells could reflect modifications of lung gene expression programs.
