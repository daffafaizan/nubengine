      progressive loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) and their optic nerve axons. Early
      diagnosis and treatment can effectively prevent the progression of the disease and avoid
      blindness. The damage of RGCs appears in the early stage of glaucoma, and the asymmetry of
      the eyes has also been observed clinically. CPLRAD may serve as an effective screening tool
      for glaucomatous optic neuropathy, since they can dynamically detect abnormal pupillary
      responses from a novel sequence of light stimuli and functionally-shaped stimuli. The current
      theoretical evidence of relative afferent pupillary defect/pupillary light reflex (RAPD/PLR)
      as a functional test for predicting nerve damage is insufficient, and pupil detection
      technology is not yet mature. Therefore, the investigators want to complete these tasks: 1)
      collect the clinical examination data and objectively measure the pupil dynamic parameters
      monocularly and/or binocularly as indicators from the retina and optic nerve in glaucoma
      patients 2) design RAPD/PLR detection technology and develop dynamic analysis system; 3)
      verify the feasibility of RAPD/PLR applied to early glaucoma screening through clinical
      trials. The pupil image dynamic analysis and iris recognition system will provide a simple,
      inexpensive and non-invasive screen tool, and is highly reliable and cost-effective.
