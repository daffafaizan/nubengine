    
      Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor with effects on tumor proliferation
      and angiogenesis. Sorafenib is approved for the treatment of patients with advanced renal
      cancer and unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The recommended daily dose of
      Sorafenib is 400 mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) taken twice daily without food (at least 1 hour
      before or 2 hours after a meal). Studies of single-agent sorafenib showed treatment was
      well-tolerated with manageable side effects. The results seen with sorafenib in the Phase III
      (SHARP) trial suggest that VEGF and RAF kinase inhibition prolong survival in patients with
      advanced HCC. It is not known whether a drug which is considered primarily cytostatic will be
      effective in preventing cancer recurrences in the setting of minimal residual disease.

      This is a phase I, single center, open-label, dose-escalation study to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and overall safety profile of daily sorafenib as therapy to prevent HCC
      recurrence in liver transplant subjects with high-risk HCC. For each subject, the study will
      consist of two phases: a treatment phase and an extension phase.
