      clinical trials is overall survival. More detailed information is needed to guide
      individualized therapies and expedite progress. Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) is an underutilized
      source of potential biomarkers for brain tumors. The goal of this study is to generate a
      repository of CSF samples with at least 2 timepoints per patient. Such samples are of
      particular importance to identify quantitative biomarkers of disease burden and response to
      therapy.

      Patients with a central nervous system tumor may be approached for study participation. At
      least two CSF collections are required for this study. No more than 20 mL (1.3 tablespoons)
      of CSF will be collected per visit. Options for CSF collection include collection during a
      clinically indicated surgical procedure, collection from an existing device (shunt, drain,
      Ommaya reservoir), or lumbar puncture. Specially-trained personnel will be responsible for
      CSF collection. CSF will be accessed during standard clinic visits to avoid extra
      appointments.

      CSF samples will be correlated with pertinent medical records and imaging findings. Samples
      may be made available for multiple research projects in a de-identified manner. Participation
      in this study will not generate specific information intended to guide care, but will provide
      an important resource to help advance brain tumor research. If a treating physician wishes to
      access a participant's CSF as part of any future IRB-approved study or individualized
      treatment strategy, it can be made available upon request.
