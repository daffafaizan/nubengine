      who say they have a stroke need, at home, a wheelchair to get from one room to another. The
      use of a wheelchair can cause postural disorders which can lead to pain, orthopedic deformity
      and pressure ulcers.

      This study aims to assess the interest of using wheelchair positioning equipment (Seat back,
      Positioning cushion and Belt) on the decrease of postural disorders.

      This decrease will be assessed after a standardized course, performed under three different
      conditions: with the positioning equipment (Positioning cushion and Seat back), with the
      positioning equipment and the belt and with the wheelchair alone.

      Clinical tool used to assess the decrease is the Seated Postural Control Measure for Adults
      2.0 (SPCMA 2.0).

      This study, which will be the first prospective, interventional, multicenter, controlled and
      randomized study, could pave the way for guidelines of good practice, for wheelchair
      positioning of hemiplegic patients in France
