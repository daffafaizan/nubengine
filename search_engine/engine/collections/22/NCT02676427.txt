      fine catheter with ultrasound doppler probe will be introduced into the central venous
      catheter already in place in superior vena cava. Doppler signal will be evaluated by console
      prototype (NILUS Medical) and continuous analysis of blood flow velocity respiratory
      variation will be performed. These values will be compared to standard hemodynamic monitoring
      parameters (central venous and arterial pressures) and to parameters acquired by
      transoesophageal (TOE) and transthoracic echocardiography.
