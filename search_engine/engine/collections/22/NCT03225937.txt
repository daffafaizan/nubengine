      resistance to anti-EGFR therapy in mCRC patients for which other known genetic alterations
      conferring resistance to anti EGFR antibodies were excluded.

      Exploiting direct transfer xenografts of mCRC surgical samples in mice (xenopatients),
      investigators conducted a multi-arm study in HER2-amplified xenopatients showing that
      combinations of the dual EGFR/HER2 inhibitor lapatinib and the anti-HER2 moAb trastuzumab
      induced long-lasting tumor regressions, while monotherapy with lapatinib led to stabilization
      and monotherapy with trastuzumab was ineffective. On these findings investigators designed
      the HERACLES trial.

      HERACLES is an open-label Phase II, 2-sequential cohorts trial, assessing the response rate
      (ORR) of Trastuzumab combined Lapatinib (Cohort A) or Pertuzumab combined with
      trastuzumab-emtansine (Cohort B), in metastatic colorectal patients harboring an amplified
      HER2 tumors .

      HER2 positivity is centrally established by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and Silver In Situ
      Hybridization (SISH). To be HER2 eligible the original tumor, or the biopsied metastasis
      (whichever is last available), must be IHC 3+ or 2+ in more than 50% of cells, confirmed by
      SISH or FISH with a HER2:CEP17 ratio â‰¥ 2.0. For IHC a positive staining (3+) is defined as an
      intense membrane staining which can be circumferential, basolateral, or lateral of the tumor
      cells.
