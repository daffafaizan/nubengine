      little progress has been made in personalized surgical cancer therapy. The ARMANI trial
      presents the first prospective, randomized trial to evaluate effectiveness and safety of
      molecular-guided resection in patients with colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM). While CRLM
      might be removed independently of the liver's segmental borders, retrospective data favor
      anatomic resections in the subgroup of patients with a mutation in the RAS oncogene.
      Therefore, the ARMANI trial will test the hypothesis, if an anatomic resection (AR) improves
      long-term outcome vs. a non-anatomical resection (NAR) in patients undergoing surgery for
      RAS-mutated CRLM. The trial will be carried out among 11 high-volume centers of
      hepato-biliary surgery in Germany. A total of 220 patients will be enrolled and randomized in
      a 1:1 ratio to undergo an AR vs. NAR. The primary endpoint is intrahepatic disease-free
      survival (iDFS). In addition, the study will provide important data on perioperative outcomes
      and quality of life for both surgical techniques. Given the trend among liver surgeons to aim
      for parenchymal-sparing operations to preserve liver parenchyma, a positive trial will be
      practice changing and present the first piece of high-level evidence on benefits of
      personalized surgical therapy guided by the tumor's mutational profile in patients with CRLM.
