      in patients with open-angle glaucoma. Clinical evaluations of its effectiveness in individual
      patients usually are derived from baseline and post-laser measurements of intraocular
      pressure during office hours in the sitting position. Only a few studies have examined the
      efficacy of laser trabeculoplasty beyond office hours. Although the 24-hour effect of laser
      trabeculoplasty has been studied ,the study was conducted before the use of these new and
      more potent intraocular pressure lowering drugs. So it doesn't have any study to determine
      the effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty and travoprost to reduce the diurnal and
      nocturnal variation of Iintraocular pressure.
