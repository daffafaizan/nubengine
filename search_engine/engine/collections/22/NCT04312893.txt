      which can affect 25-80% of ICU patients. Delirium is also associated with long term cognition
      impairment, higher mortality and higher ICU costs. Previous acupuncture studies showed the
      potential to prevent delirium. This study will examine the ability of acupuncture to treat
      ICU delirium.

      Methods: A double-blind randomized control trial will examine the effect of press tack
      acupuncture vs. press tack placebos. The patients will be randomly divided (1:1) into one of
      two groups. A total of 80 ICU patient will have to meet the following criteria: age 20-90,
      APACHE score <30, Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC) >4 points (indicates
      existing delirium), Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale (RASS): +1, +2, +3, +4, -1, -2. Three
      interventions will be given in each group. The main outcomes will be the delirium days
      according to the ICDSC.

      Expected outcome: The study finding will help to determine the therapeutic effect of
      acupuncture for critically ill delirium patients. Furthermore, the study design will involve
      longer needle/placebos retention which is less investigated nowadays.

      Other information: This study will be conducted in the ICU departments of China medical
      hospital, Taichung city, Taiwan. The study is conducted on stable ICU patients and we don't
      anticipate any serious risk for adverse events following the intervention. The study will
      take place until May 2022.
