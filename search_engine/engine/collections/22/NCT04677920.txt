    
      Linoleic acid has many health benefits including altering body composition and energy
      metabolism, possibly through its impact on cardiolipin and mitochondria.

      The investigators plan to test the central hypothesis and accomplish the overall objective of
      this research by pursuing the following four specific aims

      Aim 1) To assess muscle biopsy yield with a micro biopsy needle

      Aim 2) To determine the amount of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and muscle needed
      to measure mitochondria function

      Aim 3) To assess the feasibility of measuring mitochondria function on fresh PBMC and muscle
      samples

      Aim 4) To determine the effect of short-term healthy cookies made with linoleic acid rich oil
      on measures of mitochondrial function in white blood cells and muscle as well as their
      relationship to lipid composition of the blood, markers of metabolic health and markers of
      mitochondria biogenesis
