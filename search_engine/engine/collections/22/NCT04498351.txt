      the spermatic cord block has been of great advantage, as it has been cost saving, efficient
      technique whether used inon its own or combination with a sedative or . Furthermore, it
      provides minimal cardiac risks, early case ambulation, satisfactory postoperative pain
      control, as well as a reduced hospital stay and cost. one of the major drawbacks of spermatic
      cord block is being a single injection technique, leading to a short postoperative analgesia
      duration. So, to overcome this flaw some adjuvants were proven to prolong the analgesia
      duration as Dexmetedomidine (Dex), and magnesium.
