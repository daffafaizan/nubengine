      and death, but have inconsistent follow-up care. Our team has developed and tested a model to
      deliver structured follow-up kidney care (the AKI Follow-up Clinic) that is feasible and
      sustainable, with standardized assessments based upon clinical practice guidelines that are
      transferable to any setting. This study will randomize patients with Kidney Disease Improving
      Global Outcomes (KDIGO) stage 2-3 AKI to the AKI Follow-up Clinic or usual care (control
      group). The usual care group will have a letter outlining their AKI diagnosis mailed to their
      family physician; the usual care group may still be referred to a nephrologist by their
      healthcare provider if desired, but these participants will not have access to the AKI
      Follow-up Clinic pathways. The primary outcome is development of a major adverse kidney event
      (MAKE), a composite of death, chronic dialysis, and estimated glomerular filtration rate
      (eGFR) decline. Outcomes will be ascertained after one year of follow-up, which is when AKI
      Follow-up Clinic patients are transitioned back to their family doctor or general
      nephrologist based upon pre-specified graduation criteria. Participants will also be followed
      using local hospital electronic resources and the Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences
      (ICES) administrative databases in order to assess the long-term impact of early nephrologist
      follow-up on AKI outcomes.
