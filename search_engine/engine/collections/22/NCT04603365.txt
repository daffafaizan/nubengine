      I. Evaluate response rate of pamiparib plus low-dose temozolomide.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression-free survival with pamiparib plus low-dose temozolomide.

      II. To evaluate the safety (adverse events [AE's]) with pamiparib plus low-dose temozolomide.

      TRANSLATIONAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the association between plasma and tumor 2-hydroxyglutarate (2HG), fumarate,
      and succinate levels and response to treatment.

      II. To analyze the association of the genomic mutational signature (by whole genome
      sequencing) of the tumor to treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and temozolomide PO once daily
      (QD) on days 1-7. Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 36 months in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months.
