      I. Determine the most optimal fluorine-18 (18F) fluoromethylcholine (FCH) PET/CT parameters
      for detecting primary hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by conducting a clinical
      radiologic-pathologic correlation study to estimate and compare the receiver operating
      characteristics of kinetic and static PET measures of tumor FCH metabolism in patients that
      test positive during screening or conventional imaging.

      II. Identify cancer signaling pathways associated with choline metabolism in HCC by profiling
      the global gene expression patterns in fresh-frozen liver tissue samples that are correlated
      with the features derived from FCH PET/CT images.

      III. Characterize the association between features derived from FCH PET/CT images of the
      liver and clinical liver disease severity and comparatively evaluate the ability of
      corresponding gene expression signatures to predictively model HCC disease outcome.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 18F-fluoromethylcholine PET/CT within 14 days of surgical resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
