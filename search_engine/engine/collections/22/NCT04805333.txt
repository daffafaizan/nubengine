    
      This is a phase I dose-escalation study of Artemisia annua (Aa) decaffeinated coffee in
      patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have completed front-line chemotherapy with
      carboplatin and paclitaxel. The primary objective of this study is to determine the
      recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of Aa decaf coffee pods. Sequential cohorts of three
      patients per cohort will have escalating doses of Aa, starting with one cup per day (450mg)
      and with a maximum of 4 cups per day (1800mg). After identifying the RP2D, the study will
      evaluate an expansion cohort of 6 patients for further tolerability and secondary endpoints.
      The secondary endpoints include: 1) Efficacy as measured by time to tumor progression or
      recurrence; 2) the ability of Aa decaf coffee to influence downstream biomarkers of the
      NRF2/KEAP1 signaling pathway; and 3) plasma concentrations of artemisinin and
      dihydroartemisinin.
