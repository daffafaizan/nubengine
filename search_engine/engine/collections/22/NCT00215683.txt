    
      Participants who completed the main FE200486 CS12 study initially continued with the same
      dose in the FE200486 CS12A extension study. After a protocol amendment all study participants
      were treated with 160 mg (40 mg/mL).

      The data include data from the participants who participated in both the main study (FE200486
      CS12; NCT00819156) and the extension study FE200486 CS12A.
