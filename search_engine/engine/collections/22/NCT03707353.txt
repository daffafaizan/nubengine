      investigational vaccines, be infected with malaria by mosquito bite, may develop clinical
      malaria disease, will be treated with antimalarial drugs, and will have blood taken
      regularly. They will also be given the option to undergo a minimally invasive procedure -
      Fine Needle Aspiration of the liver - to examine the immune response in this target organ
      which is also considered to be low risk.

      As this is the first time intravenous dose of the vaccines following intramuscular
      prime/boost doses will be administered, once volunteers have received their intramuscular
      doses the investigators will stagger the intravenous vaccinations to allow for interim safety
      reviews. The first volunteer in groups 1&2, once they have received their two intramuscular
      doses, will receive their intravenous vaccine dose alone and observed for a minimum 8 hours.
      If there have been no concerns identified at the 8 hour and 24 hour reviews identified by the
      CI and Local Safety Committee (LSC) chair, the next two volunteers in these groups will
      receive their intravenous vaccine dose. There will be a further safety 24 hours after these
      volunteers have been vaccinated before the remaining volunteers are vaccinated.

      Volunteers are expected to have both vaccine site reactions (eg, pain, swelling, warmth in
      the arm where the vaccine is given) and systemic reactions to vaccination (eg, fever,
      headache, tiredness, sore muscles and joints). These are expected to resolve completely
      within several days, and symptoms strong enough to prevent usual activities over this time
      are expected to be uncommon.
