      nerve block in addition to a lumbar plexus block for postoperative analgesia following total
      hip arthroplasty. Although the placement of a lumbar plexus block alone has become accepted
      as the standard of care at UPMC for postoperative analgesia following total hip arthroplasty,
      the addition of a parasacral (sciatic) nerve block may provide the advantage of blocking the
      superior gluteal nerve and nerve to the quadratus femoris which both supply small articular
      sensory branches to the posterior hip capsule.
