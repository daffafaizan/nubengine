      pharmacokinetics(PK) of sildenafil, udenafil, and vardenafil in healthy male subjects. Twenty
      one healthy male subjects with CYP3A5*1/*1, *1/*3, or *3/*3 were enrolled. An open-label
      3-way crossover study was performed with a week washout. A single oral dose of PDE5I (100 mg
      sildenafil; 200 mg udenafil; 20 mg vardenafil) was administered, respectively. After a single
      oral dose of phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitor (PDE5I), plasma levels of the parent and the
      major metabolite were measured up to 24 or 48 h.
