      periodontitis were enrolled and all completed the 3-day study. Three-hundred-sixty samples of
      GCF were harvested from the interproximal sites of each of the two maxillary non-molar teeth
      according to the orifice method. Each site was sampled three times with 1-min intervals
      between repeat samples. By using intracrevicular method, the other 360 samples of GCF were
      collected on the same sites following 10-minutes interval. In first day, 2nd day and 3rd day
      the length of sampling time in seconds and order were 5. 10. 30; 10. 30. 5 and 30. 5. 10.
      respectively. GCF elastase activity was determined by hydrolysis of neutrophil specific
      substrate N-methoxysuccinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-p-nitroanilide and was expressed as concentration
      (microU/microl) and total enzyme activity (microU).
