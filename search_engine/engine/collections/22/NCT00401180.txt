      Primary

        -  Determine the toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated dose of
           docetaxel and temozolomide (TMZ) in patients with metastatic cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the activity of docetaxel and TMZ in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and oral temozolomide once
      daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 1 year in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel and temozolomide until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. A total of 6
      patients receive treatment at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
