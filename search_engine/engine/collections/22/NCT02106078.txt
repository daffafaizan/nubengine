      bipolar diagnoses, and what components appear to be useful. Specifically, the study will
      examine (1) whether exposure to the MoodSwings 2.0 intervention results in decreased
      depressive symptoms as measured by the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale for Depression (MADRS)
      and (2) whether there is an association between graduated levels of involvement (Level I, 2,
      or 3) and resulting improvement? We expect that those participants assigned to the control
      condition (Level 1, peer discussion board only), will have fewer positive outcomes than those
      in Level 2 (discussion board and psychoeducation) or 3 (discussion board, psychoeducation,
      and interactive psychosocial tools) conditions.
