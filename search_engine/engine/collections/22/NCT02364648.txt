      Endothelial dysfunction, characterized by a reduced bioavailability in nitric oxide, is an
      independent predictor of cardiovascular disease in CKD. Increased oxidative stress is a
      potential cause of endothelial dysfunction in this patient cohort. This study investigates
      the role that mitochondrial derived oxidative stress plays in CKD related vascular
      dysfunction. In a controlled, double blinded trial, Stage 3-5 CKD patients will be randomly
      assigned to receive a 4 week daily dose of a mitochondria targeted antioxidant (MitoQ) or a
      placebo.
