      anhedonia in animal models of human depression psychopathology. Herein, we propose to study
      the KOR in vivo using positron emission tomography, and we will also measure the activity of
      the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA)-axis in all study participants. We propose to
      recruit up to N=50 medication-free individuals using a transdiagnostic approach, measure
      their KOR-selective radioligand [11C]LY2795050 volumes of distribution (VT), an equivalent of
      KOR availability using positron emission tomography (PET) and study the role of the KOR in
      mediating the quality and severity of the depressive phenotype.
