      a chewable tablet (CT) in pediatric asthma subjects aged 6 to < 12 years. The results of this
      study would have supported the identification of a fevipiprant dose for subsequent pediatric
      efficacy studies aiming to provide an exposure similar to that of the to-be marketed
      adult/adolescent dose. Based on evaluation of the fevipiprant asthma development program in
      the recently completed studies (CQAW039A2307/ CQAW039A2314) in the adult population (the
      analyses of these studies did not meet the clinically relevant threshold for reduction in
      rate of moderate-to-severe exacerbation compared to placebo over a 52-week treatment period
      for either of the doses [i.e. 150 mg/ 450 mg]), Novartis decided to discontinue this study
      (CQAW039B2201).
