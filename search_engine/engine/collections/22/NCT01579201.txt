      Carbetocin have been shown effective in the prevention of uterine atony, which is the leading
      cause of postpartum hemorrhage. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada
      recommends a single 100 mcg dose of carbetocin after elective cesarean delivery to prevent
      postpartum hemorrhage. However, there is no clear data in the literature regarding the lowest
      effective dose of carbetocin that should be administered. The use of the minimum effective
      dose of carbetocin may reduce its side effects, including hypotension, tachycardia, nausea,
      vomiting and flushing.

      In this trial, healthy term pregnant women undergoing elective cesarean delivery under spinal
      anesthesia will be recruited. The effective dose of carbetocin that will prevent postpartum
      uterine atony in 90% of the women (ED90) will be determined using a biased coin design
      up-down sequential allocation method. The determination of the carbetocin ED90 will help the
      anesthesiologist regarding the optimal dose of carbetocin to administer after elective
      cesarean delivery to prevent uterine atony.
