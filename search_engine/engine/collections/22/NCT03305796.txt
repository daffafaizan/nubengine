      cholesteatoma in relation to the ossicles and mastoid process,but computerized tomography has
      a high negative predictive value if neither a soft-tissue mass nor bony destructions are
      shown.However, if a soft-tissue mass in the middle ear is seen on computerized tomography,
      diagnosis of the mass is not possible because cholesteatoma, mucoid secretion, granulation
      tissue and cholesterol granuloma can not be differentiated from one another on computerized
      tomography.

      Standard magnetic resonance imaging shows tissues better than computerized
      tomography,Therefore in patients with cholesteatoma, magnetic resonance imaging plays a
      complementary role to computerized tomography in the diagnostic workup, Although computerized
      tomography provides excellent Bony resolution for showing the anatomy, magnetic resonance
      imaging provides specificity in characterizing soft-tissue abnormalities shown on
      computerized tomography,How ever standard magnetic resonance imaging frequently fails to
      allow differentiation of cholesteatoma from other soft tissues or mucoid secretions,
      particularly in patients who had ear surgery.

      Recent studies of diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging show that it is sensitive to
      cholesteatoma tissue.Recent studies highlights the ability of diffusion weighted magnetic
      resonance imaging in differentiating cholesteatoma from granulation tissue in patients who
      have undergone mastoidectomy and also these imaging modalities help in the diagnosis of
      residual cholesteatoma. Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging play an important role
      in diagnosis of retraction pockets .

      Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging is based on the principle of random microscopic
      motion (Brownian motion) of water molecules.This "diffusion" of water molecules differs in
      each biological tissue, For example water molecules in cholesteatoma are less mobile giving
      rise to a hyper-intense signal, while in other tissues as granulation tissues, water
      molecules are more mobile thus appear less intense on diffusion weighted magnetic resonance
      imaging sequence.
