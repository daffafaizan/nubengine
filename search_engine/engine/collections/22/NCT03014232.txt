      mortality in sepsis-related acute kidney injury(AKI). Reductions of these cytokines have been
      reported to improve clinical outcomes. Online sustained low-efficiency diafiltration(SLED-f)
      using traditional high-flux(HF) dialyzer could remove some cytokines. Interestingly, the
      potential of enhancing cytokine removal by using newly designed high cut-off(HCO) dialyzer
      that could theoretically remove larger molecular weight solutes has never been studied in
      SLED-f before.This pilot randomized controlled trial was conducted in sepsis-related AKI
      patients to compare the efficacy of cytokine removal including interleukin(IL)-6, IL-8,
      IL-10, and tumor necrotic factor(TNF)-Î± by six-hour SLED-f between using HCO
      dialyzer(HCO-SLED-f,n=8) and HF dialyzer(HF-SLED-f,n=8).
