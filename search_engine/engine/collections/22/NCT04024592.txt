    
      Intra-tester reliability of isokinetic strength measurements of the knee, hip and ankle in a
      Biodex System 4 device will be studied. Children will be assessed at different movement
      velocities using the test-positions as proposed by the manufacturer. Maximum peak torque will
      be established.

      Children will also perform functional strength assessments and the relation with the results
      of isokinetic strength measurements will be analysed.
