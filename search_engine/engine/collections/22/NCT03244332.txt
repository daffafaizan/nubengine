      First, the investigators will identify all children suffering from cirrhosis irrespective of
      underlying etiology and/or portal hypertension coming into the pediatric
      hepatogastroenterology unit at Saint-Luc University Clinics. Any patient with a congenital or
      acquired thrombophilia/haemorrhagic disorder will be excluded. The investigators expect to
      include 20 to 30 children in the study.

      The investigators will meet the parents to give them explanations about this study and its
      implications. Then the investigators will get the free and informed consent about the
      participation to this clinical study. Parents are obviously free to refuse to take part in
      this clinical study and to retire from it at any moment.
