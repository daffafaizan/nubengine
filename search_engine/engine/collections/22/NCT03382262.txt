    
      This is a randomized, open-label, single dose study that will be conducted in male and female
      patients â‰¥40 years of age with OA of either the shoulder or the hip.

      Approximately 24 patients with OA of the shoulder and approximately 24 patients with OA of
      the hip will be randomized to one of two treatment groups (1:1) and treated with a single IA
      injection of either:

        -  32 mg FX006 (approximately 12 patients per joint) or

        -  40 mg TAcs (approximately 12 patients per joint)

      Each patient will be screened to confirm the diagnosis of OA of either the shoulder or hip
      and eligibility based on the other inclusion/exclusion requirements and will be randomized to
      treatment on Day 1. Each patient will be evaluated for a total of 12 weeks following the IA
      injection. Following screening, sampling for pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety will be
      completed at 10 out-patient visits scheduled on Study Days 1 [calendar day of injection], 2,
      3, 5, 8, 15, 22, 29, 57, and 85.
