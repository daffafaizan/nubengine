      in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease on a participants without known liver disease.

      Nafld Score and Elastography are now being used to predict the severity of liver fibrosis and
      deciding whether the patient is going to a biopsy, clinical follow-up or further
      investigation of liver cirrhosis and complications.

      The detection of participants with Nafld Score more than 0.675 (advanced fibrosis) will
      enroll them to an elastography test. Participants with advanced fibrosis according to
      elastography will be introduced to follow-up and treatment that should delay or prevent
      progression of the disease to more advanced conditions like: cirrhosis, portal hypertension,
      esophageal varicose veins and hepatocellular carcinoma.

      If the investigators find that the results of the study are consistent with their hypothesis,
      this will lead to applying the flowchart to a larger sample of population in order to use it
      as a future survey.

      Moreover, the investigators will check whether there is a correlation between Nafld Score and
      elastography in participants without know liver disease with Nafld Score more than 0.675.
