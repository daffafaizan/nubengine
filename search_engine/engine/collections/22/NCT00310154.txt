        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel that can be safely delivered in
           combination with gefitinib and a definitive course of 3-D planned thoracic radiotherapy
           in patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of docetaxel.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy comprising docetaxel IV
           over 30 minutes on day 1 and thoracic radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5 in weeks 1-7
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Consolidation chemotherapy: Beginning 2 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy,
           patients receive consolidation chemotherapy comprising docetaxel IV over 60 minutes on
           days 1 and 22.

        -  Gefitinib therapy: Patients also receive oral gefitinib once daily beginning at the
           start of chemoradiotherapy and continuing for up to 1 year* in the absence of disease
           progression.

      NOTE: *Patients continue to receive gefitinib during the 2-week rest period between
      chemoradiotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Tumor tissue is tested to determine correlation between epidermal growth factor receptor
      presence and response to treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued in this study.
