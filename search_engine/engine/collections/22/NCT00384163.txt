      are the presence of pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary insufficiency or perivalvular leak on the
      initial post-operative echocardiogram. I estimate reviewing 50 patients' charts dated March
      22.2003 through and including March 22.2006 at Emory Hospital .

      Primary Aim: Present an effective technique for pulmonary valve replacement

      Secondary Aim: Present our excellent technical results of PVR in our adult congenital
      patients
