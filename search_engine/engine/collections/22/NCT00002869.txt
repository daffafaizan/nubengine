      high-dose interferon alfa maintenance therapy in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia
      in chronic phase. II. Compare the toxicity profiles, assessed by WHO criteria, and the
      percentage of patients requiring dose reduction or discontinuation with these two regimens.
      III. Compare hematologic and cytogenetic responses every 6 months in patients treated on
      these two regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients receive daily hydroxyurea until their white
      blood cell count (WBC) is maintained at a normal level for 2-3 weeks. Patients are randomized
      to two groups: one group receives daily high-dose interferon alfa, and the other receives
      low-dose interferon alfa, 5 days per week. Both groups continue to receive hydroxyurea at
      reduced doses as needed to maintain a normal WBC. Treatment continues until disease
      progression occurs. Patients may receive cytarabine in addition to interferon in either
      treatment arm at the investigator's discretion. Cytarabine is given subcutaneously for 10
      days every calendar month and continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 800 patients will be enrolled over 8 years on this
      multicenter study.
