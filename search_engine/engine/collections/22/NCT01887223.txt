    
      To compare the efficacy of transconjunctival needling revision (TNR) with 5-fluorouracil
      versus medical treatment (MT) in glaucomatous eyes with uncontrolled intraocular pressure
      (IOP) due to encapsulated bleb after trabeculectomy Prospective, randomized, interventional
      study. A total of forty eyes of 39 patients with elevated IOP and encapsulated bleb diagnosed
      at maximum 5 months after primary trabeculectomy with mitomycin C were included. The eyes
      were randomized to either TNR with 5-fluorouracil or MT (hypotensive eyedrops). A maximum of
      two TNR per patient was allowed in the needling arm. All eyes were followed up for 12 months.
      Success of treatment was defined as IOP â‰¤ 18mmHg and 20% reduction from baseline at last
      follow up.
