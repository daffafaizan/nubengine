      Expanded Access IND. CBD will be administered as an adjunct to all current antiepileptic
      drugs. After the screening visit, a 4 week baseline period will be followed and seizures will
      be recorded in the seizure diary given to the patient at this time. The patients will be
      clinically evaluated at baseline, once a month for three months and once every three months
      thereafter. For the first week after study initiation, patients will be called at day 3 to
      review any changes in condition and again at day 7 to review any changes in condition and to
      determine whether an increase in dosing is required. Subsequently, patients will be called
      each week during the titration period to review any changes in condition and determine
      whether an increase in dosing is required. Maximal dose titration should be achieved in most
      patients within 5 weeks. In order to ensure safe use at higher doses, patients who receive
      more than 600 mg of daily CBD will be evaluated at least monthly until they achieve steady
      state at their final fixed maintenance dose. The investigator will be available by telephone
      or email throughout the initial four months of the study in between the visits.
