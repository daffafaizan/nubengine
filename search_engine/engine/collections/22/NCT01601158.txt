      significant delay in two or more of the following developmental domains: gross/fine motor,
      speech/language, cognition, social/personal, and activities of daily living.

      Umbilical cord blood has been used for inherited metabolic diseases that feature global
      developmental delay and many experimental animal studies have revealed umbilical cord blood
      is useful to repair neurological impairments in brain.
