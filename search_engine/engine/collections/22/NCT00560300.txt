      secondary hyperparathyroidism were randomly assigned to one of 2 vitamin D analogues
      (calcitriol or doxercalciferol) and one of two phosphate binders (sevelamer or calcium
      carbonate) in a two by two factorial designed prospective trial. Serum biochemical
      measurements were obtained at baseline and monthly throughout the 8 months of the trial. Bone
      biopsy was obtaine at baseline and repeated at study completion.
