      system anatomy and limitation on using medications which can either be crushed or in liquid
      form for the first 10 days to 14 days after surgery. Additionally there are multiple programs
      in place to eliminate the use of narcotic/opioid based pain medications due their potential
      addictive risks.

      This study compares two groups of patients whom will have Roux en Y Gastric Bypass Surgery at
      UC Davis Medical Center, the control group will receive standard of care pain control
      medications (including opioid based medications) compared to the research arm, this group
      will receive Gabapentinin and Tylenol for pain control after surgery with rescue pain
      medications available if needed.

      Post surgery both groups will be managed by the Bariatric Surgery Team and will be contacted
      periodically as part of the standard of care to monitor pain control and usage of any rescue
      medications (if needed).
