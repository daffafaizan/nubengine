      acid bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, are usually administered as
      probiotics (defined as live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts,
      confer a health benefit on the host). Some probiotics were shown to sustain the development
      of immune competency in newborns, as well as to modulate the adaptive immune response and
      response to infections. For example, previous research suggests that probiotics decrease the
      incidence of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). Probiokid® is a commercially-available
      formulation that consist of probiotics (Lactobacillus helveticus, Bifidobacterium infantis,
      Bifidobacterium bifidum) and fructooligosaccharides. This formulation has been shown to
      decrease the rate of respiratory infection in children supplemented for 3 to 9 months.
      Therefore the aim of this clinical trial is to assess the efficacy of Probiokid® supplemented
      for 6 weeks on the prevention of URTI and related complications among children (aged 3 to 10
      years-old) that frequently suffer of acute respiratory infections. In addition, the impact of
      a prophylactic intervention with Probiokid® on the number of physician visits and antibiotic
      courses prescribed is assessed.
