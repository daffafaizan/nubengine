      agent (and thus at risk for disease) from the general community. This may create
      psychological, emotional, and financial problems for some persons. The experience of those
      placed under quarantine in terms of compliance, difficulties, emotional response and
      psychological impact remains under-researched.

      In view of the increasing cases of COVID-19 in India and the rising numbers of people being
      quarantined as a precautionary measure, it was imperative to assess those quarantined for the
      psychological impact of the concerns regarding this illness and the quarantine procedure. In
      India, no such study had been undertaken and our study would thus fill the research gap.

      The cross-sectional observational study is aimed at assessing the psychological impact of
      quarantine on Indian Border Security Force (BSF) soldiers (n=100).

      The participants will be assessed for depression, anxiety, perceived stress level of impact,
      and impact of life events using Beck Depression Inventory, State Trait Anxiety Inventory,
      Perceived Stress Scale, and Impact of Events Scale-Revised respectively. A qualitative
      interview schedule will be carried out.
