      during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). However ETI during CPR is a highly
      skill-dependent procedure, then it should be attempted only highly trained physicians.
      Because of technical difficulty in using direct laryngoscopy (DL), various types of
      videolaryngoscopy (VL) devices using micro-camera technology have been designed to overcome
      the problems of DL.

      This study tried to compare the recovery of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) and survival
      discharge between use of standard device (DL) and VL in a real clinical setting. In addition,
      this study also compare the first pass success rate of ETI,speed of ETI, incidences of
      complications, and chest compression interruptions during cardiopulmonary resuscitation
      between both device users.
