      regions of continuous electrical activity versus a strategy of generalized CFAE ablation in
      terms of (1) acute effects on AFCL (atrial fibrillation cycle length), AF regularization, and
      AF termination; (2) number and distribution of lesion sets delivered; and (3) long term
      effects on procedural outcome when combined with PVAI as a hybrid strategy.
