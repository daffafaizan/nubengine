    
      -  After local anesthesia a full thickness flap will be minimally reflected buccally and
           lingually around the tooth not exceeding 3mm apical to the alveolar crest.

        -  Tooth extraction will be performed using atraumatic extraction methods using Periotome.

        -  After extraction, the socket will be thoroughly curetted, inspected and irrigated with
           sterile saline solution.

        -  The socket satisfying the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomly allocated to
           either test or control group.

        -  Intra surgical measurements will be recorded.

        -  Socket preservation will be performed with either Demineralized dentin matrix DDM(TEST)
           or bovine derived xenograft DBM (CONTROL). Bone graft will be extended to the height of
           intra proximal bone.

        -  Collagen membrane will be placed over the grafted site extending approximately 3mm
           apical to buccal and lingual crest.

        -  Flaps will be approximated with sutures.
