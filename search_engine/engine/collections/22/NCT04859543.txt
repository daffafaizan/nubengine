      technologies in refractory/recurrent or very high-risk pediatric CNS tumors. The study will
      employ an analytically validated comparison of a selection of targeted agents/immune
      therapies on the basis of commercially available comprehensive genomic profiling
      FoundationOneHeme panel (F1Heme, comprising DNA and RNA analysis) vs selection of agents
      based on more complex DNA/RNA/Protein based analyses. This will be coupled to a computer
      algorithm that uses preexisting definitions and prioritization of target-agent pairs to
      assign patients by actionable mutation results to a targeted treatment. The selection of
      targeted agents will be performed by a multidisciplinary molecular tumor board, but the
      recommended treatment will not be a part of the PPROSPERTIT study.
