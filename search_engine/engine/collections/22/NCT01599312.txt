      tongue to achieve the best view of the glottis opening, thereby avoiding using the maxillary
      incisors as a fulcrum to lever the soft tissues upwards. Using the maxillary incisors as a
      fulcrum may otherwise result in dental trauma. It is obvious that contact with teeth and -
      even worse - the incidence of accidental dental trauma, is directly related to the difficulty
      of the intubation.

      Indirect videolaryngoscopy has proven advantageous over direct laryngoscopy using a classic
      Macintosh blade, for improved viewing of the glottis, with subsequent more successful
      intubations, and a shorter effective airway time both in patients with normal and difficult
      airways. Previously, it has been demonstrated that the forces exerted by the anesthesiologist
      on the patient's maxillary incisors are reduced when using a VLS, compared with a classic
      Macintosh laryngoscope. However, only one type of VLS (V-MACÂ®, Karl Storz, Tuttlingen,
      Germany) was used or only forces applied to upper teeth were being registered.
