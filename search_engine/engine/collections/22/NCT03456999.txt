      in kidney transplant recipients. Approximately 96 eligible subjects are planned to be
      randomized 2:1 to receive MAU868 or placebo. At least 78 subjects are expected to complete
      the study. The study will consist of a pre-treatment (screening) consenting period, a 24 week
      treatment period (consisting of 6 monthly i.v. doses of MAU868 or placebo) and a 24 week
      follow-up period. Subjects who complete the study per protocol will attend a total of 16
      visits over a period of 48 weeks.
