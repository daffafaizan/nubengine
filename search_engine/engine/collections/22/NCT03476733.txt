      students), conducted medication reconciliation process within 24 hours of admission or on the
      first working day following admission for admissions during week-ends. A medication
      reconciliation process was conducted according to a validated protocol. The first step
      consists of getting the Best Possible Medication History (BPMH), defined as the most
      comprehensive list of all medications taken by the patient. The second step consists of
      comparing the BPMH with admission prescription made by the physician in charge.

      During pharmacist interview, pharmacist discussed about medication adherence and knowledge.

      The third step consists of characterizing, solving and documenting DRPs. Each DRP highlighted
      by pharmaceutical team were collected and were classified regarding drug class and problem'
      types. For each patient with an identified DRP, the potential clinical impact was determined
      through a consensus of an expert panel: 2 pharmacists (1 hospital senior pharmacist and the
      resident) and 2 senior clinicians from the clinical department. The index used to rate the
      significance of the errors was based on the National Coordinating Council for Medication
      Error Reporting and Prevention (NCC MERP) Index for categorizing medication errors and
      adapted to get 4 severity categories with the type of error that leads to this severity: very
      serious, serious, moderate and minor.

      For each medication, we collected its name, dosage, dosage forms and frequency of
      administration. For each DRP, we collected the type of DRP, the drug classes (according to
      anatomical therapeutic chemical classification system) and the potential clinical impact for
      the patient.
