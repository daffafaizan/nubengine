      conventional animal-based protein to meet global dietary demands may no longer be desired nor
      feasible. Insects may represent an environmentally sustainable additional source of dietary
      protein that has the potential to help ensure global food security in the future. However,
      the functional characteristics of insect-derived proteins when fed to humans is unclear.
      Further, how insect-derived proteins compare to other animal-derived proteins (e.g. from
      beef) have not been explored.

      The purpose of this study was to compare postprandial plasma glucose, insulin, and amino acid
      concentrations, gut-derived appetite regulatory hormones, subjective appetite sensations, and
      ad libitum energy intake following the ingestion of 25 g insect- or beef-derived protein in
      healthy young men. It was hypothesized that hyperaminoacidaemia would be more rapid following
      the ingestion of beef-derived protein compared to cricket-derived protein, although total
      amino acid availability would be similar between protein sources over a 300-minute
      postprandial period. It was further hypothesized there would be no difference between protein
      sources on postprandial subjective appetite sensations or subsequent ad libitum energy
      intake.
