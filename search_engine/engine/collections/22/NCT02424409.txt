      To assess the impact of a strict formalized protocol of care of asthmatic patients discharged
      from the Emergency Department on the recurrence rate of asthma attacks, one month after an
      asthma attack.

      Secondary objectives

      Assess the impact of a strict formalized protocol on the rate of hospitalization one month
      after discharge from the ED.

      Assess the rate of early recurrence of asthma attacks within the first 15 days after
      discharge from the ED.

      Assess the control of the asthmatic disease at one month after discharge from the ED, by
      using a recognized tool, the Asthma Control Test (ACT).

      Assess the compliance rate of the patients to the recommended therapeutic strategy.

      Primary end point:

      Recurrence rate of any asthma attacks diagnosed by the GP or the ED doctor, one month after
      discharge from the ED.

      Secondary end points:

      Recurrence rate of asthma attacks at 15 days +/-2 after discharge from the ED. Rate of
      hospitalization within 30 days +/-2 after discharge from the ED Score to the asthma control
      test (ACT) 30 days +/-2 after discharge from the ED.

      Rate of patient's adherence to protocol: we will count the number of GINA (6) discharge
      recommendations followed in both groups Percentage of patients having purchased a peak
      expiratory flow meter at D30 +/-2 First day of contact with the general practitioner after
      leaving the Emergency Department.

      Percentage of patients' follow-up by the general practitioner at D30 +/-2 Percentage of
      patients using their peak expiratory flow meter at D30 +/-2. We will classify four categories
      of use of PEF: daily, weekly, less than once a week, never.

      Percentage of patients self-medicating before calling the doctor Experimental plan
      Multicenter, prospective, cluster-randomized, open study, enrolling a cohort of patients who
      were managed in the emergency department for an acute asthma attack and who have no admission
      criteria at the end of treatment. Forty-six Emergency Departments will be selected on the
      national territory, randomized by cluster (centers A [control=standard group], centers B
      [treatment group= strict formalized protocol] and stratified by size (number of patients per
      year) and types [CHU, CHG, CHR]).

      The two groups of patients will be contacted by telephone at Day 15 +/-2, and Day 30 +/-2 of
      discharge in order to identify a possible relapse, to collect the various elements of the
      evolution of their disease as well as a to answer a formalized questionnaire.

      Relapse is defined as a respiratory discomfort due to asthma and requiring medical assistance
      (in the emergency department or with the GP).

      Number of patients needed: A sample size of N= 466 patients/group allow 80% power to detect a
      30% relative difference in recurrences (i.e. from 25% to 17.5%) with a chi-square test and a
      two-sided 5% significance level. Considering an attrition rate around 5% and that the study
      is a cluster- randomized design, we applied a variance inflation factor equal to 1.5 (based
      on previous studies) .
