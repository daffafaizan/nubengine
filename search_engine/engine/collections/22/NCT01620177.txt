      in this study. They will undergo a physical exam at screening. There will be six study visits
      where the subject will arrive at the Clinical Research Unit(University of Iowa Hospitals &
      Clinics) the night before dosing. At each visit subjects will be receive one of the following
      six dosing regimens: placebo alcohol with placebo cannabis; placebo alcohol with low-dose
      cannabis, placebo alcohol with higher-dose of cannabis, low dose alcohol with placebo
      cannabis; low dose alcohol with low dose cannabis, low dose alcohol with higher-dose of
      cannabis. After dosing, participants will have provide saliva samples and blood drawn
      periodically to check cannabis levels and will complete a driving simulation. After
