    
      The project is designed as a multi-center prospective observational Post-Market-Release study
      to be conducted in up to 30 centers in Poland.

      Total duration of the study per patient will be up to 22 months (up to 12 months
      pre-conception phase, pregnancy, and 6 weeks after delivery). The optimal study start is the
      beginning of pre-conception phase, however, pregnant women up to the 16th week of pregnancy
      can participate in the study too. The study end is 6 weeks after delivery. If conception does
      not occur within 12-months, the patient's study participation is terminated, and the insulin
      pump might be taken away from the patient. The following therapy is decided by the
      investigator. If the pump is not taken away after the 12-month of trial period for
      conception, the patient can continue insulin pump therapy until the pump is needed for
      another patient.
