      consecutive days of once daily treatment with their assigned study treatment followed by an
      additional 90 days of three times weekly dosing, even if the treated toenail(s) is evaluated
      as a "complete responder" prior to the end of treatment 180 day treatment period.

      At the end of the 180-Day treatment period, subjects who remain in the study will be
      classified as complete responders, partial responders, or non-responders. All complete or
      partial responders will continue to be followed for an additional 180 days until the last
      evaluation for inclusion in the final analysis.

      Periodic efficacy and local tolerance evaluations of the test medication will be performed of
      the target great toenail and all other treated toenails. KOH wet mounts and fungal cultures
      from the treatment-targeted great toenail will be performed on the same schedule.

      Subjects will also be queried for adverse events and evaluated for application site
      reactions. Clinical laboratory assessment for safety will be made at Screening, periodically
      throughout the study, and upon premature discontinuation from the study.
