      Part A is an open label study and will enroll approximately 24 evaluable subjects with aGVHD
      across 4 cohorts. The total number of patients will depend on the number of dose escalations
      necessary to enable a decision to be made on the recommended dose to take forward into Part B
      of the study. The planned dose escalation will start with cohort 1, where subjects will
      receive EQ001 administered intravenously every two weeks for a total of 5 doses.

      Part B is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study and will enroll approximately
      60 additional subjects, randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either active treatment EQ001 (40) or
      placebo (20). Subjects will receive either EQ001 or placebo administered intravenously every
      two weeks for a total of 5 doses.
