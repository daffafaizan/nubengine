    
      Inducible laryngeal obstruction (ILO) is characterized by inappropriate closure of the
      structures of the larynx causing reduced airflow. The symptoms are breathing difficulties
      that resemble those seen in asthmatic patients, such as dyspnea, coughing and stridor. ILO
      may be diagnosed by the continuous laryngoscopy during exercise test (CLE-test), where the
      larynx is visualized live on video as the patient runs to exhaustion on a treadmill whilst
      having a laryngoscope placed through the nose.

      The prevalence of ILO in asthmatic patients will be assesed by preforming a CLE-test at start
      and after one year. Participant will be given visual feedback and instructed in breathing
      techniques. Others common comorbidities will be assessed by questionnaires and clinical
      interview. Respiratory polygraph recording will be done in participants with STOP-BANG score
      > 3.

      Changes in ILO-symptoms and asthma-symptoms and outcomes will be assessed after 1 year.
