    
      This Phase I pilot study will determine if supplementing with the combination of NR and Pter
      (BasisTM) is well tolerated and will provide the pretrial data necessary to plan a randomized
      clinical trial aimed at determining if BasisTM improves the functional outcome of injured
      elderly patients.

      Primary Objective

      â€¢ To determine if BasisTM is well tolerated by elderly patients up to 90 days post injury

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine if BasisTM preserves or improves muscular strength, endurance, and activity
           following traumatic injury in elders.

        -  To determine if BasisTM preserves or improves physiologic composition (muscle/fat ratio)
           following traumatic injury in elders.

        -  To determine if BasisTM decreases 90 day incidence of recurrent falls

        -  To determine the impact of BasisTM on subjective well-being (pain) and quality of life
           (EQ-5D-5L)

        -  To determine if BasisTM alters NAD and sirtuin activity in inflammatory cells.

      Elderly trauma patients who present after a traumatic injury will be screened and enrolled
      within 48 hours of their trauma evaluation. Baseline status will be determined using
      functional surveys, physical assessments, and physiologic measurements. Patients will be
      randomized to either BasisTM or placebo for 90 days. Patients will be reassessed at 2 weeks,
      6 weeks (optional) and 90 days. Activity and heart rate will be monitored continuously using
      a wrist FitBit Device.
