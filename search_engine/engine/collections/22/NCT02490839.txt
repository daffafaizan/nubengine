    
      Participants, aged â‰¥ 20, having H. pylori-positive chronic gastritis with/without peptic
      ulcers (duodenal or gastric ulcers) will be recruited. All undergo endoscopy with biopsy for
      rapid urease teat, histology, and bacterial culture before treatment. Four to eight weeks
      after termination of treatment, H. pylori infection status will be examined by the 13C-urea
      breath test. The CYP2C19 genotype of each participant will be analyzed by the polymerase
      chain reaction-based restriction fragment length polymerase (PCR-RFLP) method. A computed
      generated random numbers sequence will be blocked into two subgroups, say A, and B.

      If the patients failed anti-H. pylori therapy previously, they will be invited to enter this
      study for evaluating the efficacy of these rescue regimens. Participant who meet the
      inclusion criteria and do not have any one of the exclusion criteria will be randomized to
      receive one of the following regimens:

      group A- HDDT (rabeprazole 20 mg qid + amoxicillin 750 mg qid for 14 days);

      group B- BQT ( rabeprazole 20 mg qid + tripotassium dicitrate bismuthate 300 mg qid +
      metronidazole 250 mg qid + tetracycline 500 mg qid for 10 days);

      All participants will be asked to complete a questionnaire and to record symptoms and drug
      consumption daily during the treatment period. Post-treatment, the participants will be
      followed up at the Outpatients Clinic to investigate patient adherence and adverse effect of
      treatment.
