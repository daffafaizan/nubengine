      needs and predictors of needs in outpatient hemato-oncological cohort at UMMC Hemato-oncology
      Clinic for 12 months. The validated questionnaire employed evaluates the potential
      disabilities that could affect the aforementioned patients in domains such as communication,
      independence in mobility, self-care, social participation, handling relationships and
      domestic activity of daily living a month prior to the survey.

      Participants of age between 18 to 80 years old, diagnosed with haemato-oncological illnesses
      will be screened; excluding potential participants who are too ill or cannot understand
      English, Malay, or Chinese; to be recruited in the research.

      Based on the findings from the analysis, rehabilitation needs could be tailored accordingly
      to improve quality of life of these patients
