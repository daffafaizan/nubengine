      The investigators are currently following up a cohort of patients all of whom have had a
      metal on ceramic total hip arthroplasty.

      This new bearing couple has been approved for use in the UK for some time and has recently
      achieved USA FDA approval.

      The attraction of this bearing couple is a low rate of wear with reduced complications
      associated with ceramic on ceramic bearing such as bearing fracture.

      Of recent media attention has been the unacceptably high failure of the DePuy ASR metal on
      metal hip resurfacing. This metal on metal bearing couple has been associated with increased
      ion levels and chromosome abnormalities in vivo.

      In vitro studies and small in vivo studies have revealed much lower wear, particle numbers
      and ion levels in ceramic on metal studies than in metal on metal bearing surfaces; however
      there is no large scale evidence that this is the case.

      The investigators currently are following up the largest worldwide series of ceramic on metal
      bearings and clinical results are excellent. It is important however to obtain hard data on
      metal ion levels in this population firstly to ensure the long term function and health of
      this cohort but also to provide a barometer for other surgeons who will be using a prosthesis
      that as yet has little in the way of long term follow up and data on ion levels in a large
      cohort.

      If the ion levels are unacceptably high then the investigators will need to follow these
      patients closely and offer revision surgery if there are clinical concerns.

      For similar reasons it is important to monitor for chromosomal abnormalities.
