      psychiatric disorders can be managed with non-pharmacological techniques. The possibility of
      inducing central neuroplastic responses through transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been widely studied, as well as peripheral
      stimulation techniques such electroacupuncture (EA) and intramuscular stimulation (IMS).
      However, there are few studies on physiological mechanisms, indications and limitations of
      each technique.

      Thus, this randomized, crossover sham controlled trial, where sham intended to study the
      effect of electrical stimulation on peripheral nerve (spinal accessory nerve) with
      acupuncture needle in healthy subjects aims to access the effect o electrical stimulation of
      accessory spinal nerve in cortical activation, muscular perfusion and autonomic response in
      healthy subjects.

      Participants will be assessed through measure changes in cortical activation, local muscular
      peripheral perfusion and autonomic responses before and after intervention and
      intervention-sham, and crossed after a period of wash-out.

      The design aims to contribute to assessment of one electroacupuncture's techniques by
      measuring some of the physiological effects caused by peripheral stimulation.
