      lactate levels and rSO2, and distinguish between hypoxic and non-hypoxic hyperlactatemia seen
      in the early postoperative period.

      Sixty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) II-III patients were included in this
      study. Perioperative data, including age, weight, body surface area, gender, body
      temperature, preoperative co-morbidities, intraoperative and postoperative hemodynamic
      parameters, arterial blood gas analysis (ABG), cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic cross-clamp
      duration, flow rate, urine output, and blood product and inotropic agent usage, were
      recorded. Postoperative plasma lactate levels were measured simultaneously with cerebral
      tissue oxygen saturation (rSO2) in both cerebral hemispheres at 10 different time points.
