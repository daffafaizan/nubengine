      depends on the reduction of viable microorganisms of root canals by endodontic disinfection
      procedures. This study aims to evaluate by molecular methods the effect of different
      disinfection procedures on reduction, diversity and microbial metabolic activity. Patients
      with necrotic pulps and apical periodontitis in single-rooted teeth will be selected.
      Microbiological samples will be taken from root canals after access cavity (S1), after
      chemomechanical preparation with Reciproc System and 2.5% NaOCl (S2), after irrigant
      activation using the XP-Endo Finisher instrument (S3a) and ultrasonic activation (S3b); and
      after intracanal medication with calcium hydroxide for 14 days (S4), followed by 2nd-visit
      root canal preparation (S5). DNA and RNA will be extracted from root canal samples, and
      complementary DNA (cDNA) synthetized using reverse transcription reaction. The effect of
      treatment protocols on total microbiota levels will be determined by DNA-based quantitative
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using universal primers for Bacteria domain. RNA of root
      canal samples will be used to determine the diversity of metabolically active microbiota by
      Reverse Transcriptase Reaction (RT), followed by amplification (PCR) and high throughput
      sequencing of the hypervariable region V4-V5 of 16S rRNA gene. The metabolic activity of the
      most prevalent species / taxa will be calculated by rRNA- and DNA-based molecular methods.
      Ratios between rRNA and DNA levels will be calculated to search for active bacteria (rRNA/DNA
      â‰¥ 1) in root canal samples. Data will be analyzed by statistical tests, with 5% significance
      level.
