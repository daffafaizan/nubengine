      many cells would be needed to regenerate a certain section of injured muscle. As part of this
      research, we hope to gain a better understanding of the effect of age on muscle and how
      normal skeletal muscle can regenerate itself by producing myoblasts. The information gathered
      from this study will be specifically used in future research for treating Anal Incontinence.
