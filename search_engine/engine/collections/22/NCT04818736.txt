      mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, a critical question that remains unanswered is whether mRNA vaccines
      lead to herd immunity. The rationale for conducting this study is to learn whether
      vaccinating adults with a COVID-19 vaccine will prevent COVID-19 infections in non-vaccinated
      community members. Hutterite communities are unique since they are isolated from towns and
      cities and also share a number of communal activities, such as eating meals and attending
      church. Because of their location and practices, the Hutterite colonies give an opportunity
      to see whether vaccinating some Hutterite members with the COVID vaccine provides protection
      to the whole group. If the study shows that immunizing some of the population reduces the
      level of COVID-19 infection for other members of the population, this may be very important
      in stopping the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics.
