      irradiation for conditions including, but not limited to: primary brain tumors, brain
      metastases, patients with lung cancer receiving prophylactic brain irradiation, and long-term
      survivors of pediatric cancers. Up to 102 patients will be randomized 1:1 so half the
      patients receive Namzaric速 and half receive placebo. Patients on both arms will be taking
      Namzaric速 or placebo for 17 weeks, including dose-escalation and tapering. Patients will use
      a symptom monitoring app, Noona速 Healthcare Mobile PRO Application, to identify real-time
      select HRQoL and cognitive symptoms during Namzaric速 vs placebo therapy. Patients will be
      instructed to log symptoms as often as relevant using their own personal devices, as well as
      be prompted to fill out the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Global
      Health Screen (PROMIS Global Health-10) during treatment (weeks 9 and 14). There will be no
      patient follow-up after completing or discontinuing the study.
