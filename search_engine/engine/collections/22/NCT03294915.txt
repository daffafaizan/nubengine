      glucose tolerance test (OGGT 75g), lipid profile, insulin, C-peptide, glycated hemoglobin and
      glycated albumin. Insulin sensitivity and beta-cell function will be assessed by the
      hyperglycemic CLAMP before and after the intervention.Interim statistical analysis will be
      performed at the end of the participation of ten study volunteers.
