      treatment. This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Endostar Continued
      vein-pumping Combining with Gemcitabine-Carboplatin (GC)chemotherapy in patients with
      NSCLC,and seeking for more effective injection.

      Methods:

      In this randomized, open label, 90 patients are planned to be enrolled at random into 3
      arms(1:1:1): Experimental: Endostar -Continued Pumping
      into+Gemcitabine-Carboplatin(GC),Active Comparator: Endostar -injecting into
      +Gemcitabine-Carboplatin(GC),Active Comparator: Gemcitabine-Carboplatin(GC),
