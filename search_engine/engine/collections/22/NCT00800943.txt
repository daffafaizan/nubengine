      of the IgM class, can be detected in the serum and/or urine of most patients with CLL. Unique
      cell surface markers are increasingly being used to diagnose the disease, and in
      approximately 40% of patients, cytogenetic abnormalities (for example, trisomy 12) can be
      found. Patients commonly present with lymphocytosis, lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly and
      symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, and malaise. In more advanced cases anemia and
      thrombocytopenia can also occur. The clinical course of CLL is unpredictable, with survival
      from initial diagnosis varying from 1 to 20 years (2). In addition, there is a subset of
      patients with indolent CLL whose absolute lymphocyte count is less than 30 x 109/L and who
      rarely die from the disease.

      CLL is commonly staged according to the 5-point system proposed by Rai (Appendix B) and
      co-workers. While Rai staging is a relatively good predictor of overall survival, it cannot
      predict the prognosis in individual patients.
