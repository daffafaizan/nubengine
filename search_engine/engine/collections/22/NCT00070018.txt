        -  Determine the 2-year progression-free survival of patients with aggressive high-risk
           stage I or IE or non-bulky stage II or IIE CD20-positive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated
           with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone and radiotherapy
           followed by rituximab and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive CHOP chemotherapy comprising cyclophosphamide IV over 1-2
           hours, doxorubicin IV, and vincristine IV on day 1 and oral prednisone on days 1-5.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Radiotherapy: Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of CHOP chemotherapy, patients
           undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 4-5 weeks.

        -  Monoclonal antibody therapy: Beginning 3-6 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy,
           patients receive rituximab IV followed by indium In 111 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10
           minutes on day 1. Patients then undergo whole body imaging. If ibritumomab tiuxetan
           biodistribution is acceptable, patients receive rituximab IV and yttrium Y 90
           ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes on day 7, 8, OR 9.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 15 months.
