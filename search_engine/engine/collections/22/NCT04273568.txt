      The patients were randomly divided into two groups. The exercise group received an exercise
      program of 12 sessions. Scapular PNF techniques were applied to the PNF group with the same
      exercise program. Patients were evaluated twice; one before and one after 6 weeks of
      treatment; using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain, algometer for PPT, digital goniometer
      for range of motion (ROM), The Disabilities of Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) for functional
      status, lateral scapular slide test (LSST) for scapular dyskinesis, Travell and Simons
      criteria for trigger point and Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) for emotional
      state. At the end of treatment patient satisfaction was evaluated with Global Change Scale.
