      the world. Laser peripheral iridotomy (LPI) is a common and simple treatment used for both
      treatment and prevention of acute angle closure event.

      Anti-inflammatory drops are commonly prescribed to patients undergoing LPI in order to
      prevent or reduce post-treatment discomfort. However, to date, there are no specific
      guidelines for post LPI anti-inflammatory treatment, nor sufficient clinical evidence
      regarding the efficacy of such treatment.

      In the current study, the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of topical steroids and
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on post LPI symptoms and inflammation markers.
