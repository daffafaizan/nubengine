      remove fallopian tubes removed to determine whether aspirin decreases inflammation in the
      fallopian tube. Subjects will also submit blood samples at their initial visit with their
      oncologist, at the time of surgery and at the pre-operative visit to measure inflammation
      markers and blood counts. A portion of the subject's fallopian tube will be collected for
      future research studies.
