      mostly preferred for surgical treatment of gynecologic diseases, because of best cosmetically
      results, less perioperative complications, early recovery, and less postoperative pain.

      There are many undesirable effects of systemic reactions to the pain. Accordingly,
      multi-modal analgesic approach (including nerve blocks) for postoperative acute pain can
      decrease the side effects of the drugs (especially opioids) significantly.

      The primary indication for superior hypogastric plexus (SHP) block is visceral pelvic pain,
      most commonly from malignancy of the ovary, uterus, cervix, bladder, rectum or prostate.
      Per-cutaneous SHP blocks should be done under guidance of ultrasonography, fluoroscopy,
      magnetic resonance or computed tomography. During minimally invasive laparoscopic surgery,
      per-cutaneous technique can be done under the guidance of cameras.

      SHP block has been performed by anesthetists or surgeons in Kocaeli Derince Training and
      Research Hospital regularly since they have discovered the advantages of this block
      technique. SHP can be useful to decrease postoperative pain scores and opioid or NSAID
      consumption significantly.
