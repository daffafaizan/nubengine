    
      The objectives of this clinical study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of every other
      week (EOW) dosing of ISU302 at a dose of 60 U/kg as an effective glucocerebrosidase enzyme
      replacement therapeutic product in patients with Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD). Primary
      efficacy endpoint was the difference in hemoglobin concentration between baseline and Week
      24. Secondary efficacy endpoints included assessment of platelet counts, spleen and liver
      volume, and biomarker levels in plasma at Week 24 compared to baseline; skeletal change and
      bone mineral density (BMD); and single-dose pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis. Secondary safety
      endpoints included the assessment of adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical examination,
      and electrocardiogram (ECG); clinical safety laboratory analyses included serum chemistry,
      urinalysis, hematology and coagulation, and the measurement of anti-ISU302 antibodies.
