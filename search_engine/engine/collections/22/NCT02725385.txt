      I. To determine how the experience of distress and use of positive emotion coping strategies
      by pediatric cancer caregivers differs from caregivers of children with no chronic illnesses.

      II. To determine how relationships between positive coping strategies and caregiver distress
      change during the different phases of a child's illness.

      III. To explore how chronic caregiver stress affects physiological reactivity to and recovery
      from an acute laboratory stressor.

      IV. To explore how different positive coping mechanisms help chronically stressed caregivers
      recover from acute stressors and how these efficacies change during the different phases of
      the child's illness.

      OUTLINE:

      PART I:

      Participants complete a questionnaire that measures several psychological constructs
      including stress, anxiety, depression, coping mechanisms, uncertainty, positive and negative
      emotions, and life satisfaction over 15-30 minutes.

      PART II:

      Participants undergo a Trier Social Stress Test during a laboratory session over 1.5 hours.
