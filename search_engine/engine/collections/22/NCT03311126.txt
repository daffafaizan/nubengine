    
      This is a phase II single-arm, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the efficacy and
      safety of the combination of induction chemoimmunotherapy with bendamustine and obinutuzumab
      (BO) followed by consolidation therapy and maintenance therapy with obinutuzumab in subjects
      who have not received prior cytotoxic chemotherapy for their MCL (i.e., prior single-agent
      rituximab is permitted, prior involved-field radiotherapy is permitted). Therapy for
      individual subjects will be risk-adapted based on results of minimal residual disease (MRD)
      testing performed after the consolidation phase. The study will be carried out at the
      University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) and participating community and
      academic practice sites within the Wisconsin Oncology Network (WON). There will be 6-10 sites
      participating in this study.

      The subject participation will include a screening period, treatment period, and a follow-up
      period. The induction chemoimmunotherapy regimen consists of bendamustine and obinutuzumab
      for 4-6 cycles, followed by consolidation and maintenance therapy with obinutuzumab in
      subjects achieving an objective response to induction therapy (i.e., complete or partial
      response; stable disease with objective evidence of tumor shrinkage. Subjects who are
      MRD-negative (determined by MRD testing on bone marrow and PB) after consolidation therapy
      will omit maintenance therapy.

      Subjects will undergo disease reassessment after C4 of induction BO chemoimmunotherapy, after
      obinutuzumab consolidation therapy, and after C4 and C8 of maintenance obinutuzumab. MRD
      testing will be done after C2 of induction (PB only), after consolidation (BMA and PB), and
      post-maintenance or EOT (PB only).
