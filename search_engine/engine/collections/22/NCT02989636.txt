    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety profile of nivolumab alone and nivolumab in combination with
      stereotactic radiosurgery to treat patients with recurrent or advanced chordoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate toxicity and tolerability of nivolumab alone and nivolumab in combination with
      stereotactic radiosurgery.

      II. To estimate growth modulation index on target lesion. III. To estimate a clinical
      response (partial response [PR] + complete response [CR] within 6 month + stable disease [SD]
      beyond 6 months).

      IV. To assess progression-free survival and progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 months.

      V. To assess overall survival rate at 1 year, 3 years and 5 years.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore peripheral blood immune response during and after treatment.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 14 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive nivolumab as in Arm I. Patients undergo stereotactic radiosurgery
      (SRS) as per standard of care on day 8 of course 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 100 days and every 10 weeks
      thereafter.
