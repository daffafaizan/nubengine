      symptomatic heart failure due to left ventricular systolic dysfunction despite appropriate
      medical therapy. The study will gather additional data on the effect of CCM treatment with
      the objective of determining the impact of CCM on the composite of heart failure
      hospitalizations and mortality in the low ejection fraction (EF < 35%) and mildly reduced
      ejection fraction (35 ≤ EF ≤ 45) heart failure population. The study will also assess the
      impact of CCM on exercise tolerance (six minute hall walk test, 6 Minute Walk Test) and
      quality of life (Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire, MLWHFQ) in these same
      populations.
