      blood donations (provided by the German Red Cross, Institute of Transfusions Medicine, Goethe
      University Frankfurt) will be used. Blood will be diluted by full electrolyte solutions .
      Sponges and canisters will be prepared with a predetermined amount of blood.

      Study participants will estimate total blood loss on sponges and canisters. Study members not
      knowing the correct amount of prepared blood will measure the blood loss in sponges and
      canisters by Feature Extraction Technology (FET) and by gravimetric method before and after
      estimation of the participants.
