      the operation site. The tourniquet was applied at the opposite site of thigh in the both
      groups. The thigh was covered with blanket to conceal the tourniquet inflation and deflation.
      For R group, 3 cycles of tourniquet inflation for 5 minutes with 2 Ã— systemic systolic
      arterial blood pressure of arrival at operation room and deflation were performed. For C
      group, the tourniquet was applied with same manner for R group except inflation pressure of 0
