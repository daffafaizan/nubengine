      with optic nerve damage were randomly assigned to a rtACS- (n=12) or placebo-group (n=10).
      Visual field measures, visual acuity and EEG-recordings were collected before and after a
      daily 20-40min treatment for 10-days and at a 2-months-follow-up. Primary outcome measure was
      detection accuracy (DA) in defective visual field sectors of computer-based high resolution
      perimetry (HRP). Secondary outcome parameters included DA in static and kinetic perimetry,
      reaction time (RT) in HRP, visual acuity (VA), contrast vision, and EEG power spectra.
