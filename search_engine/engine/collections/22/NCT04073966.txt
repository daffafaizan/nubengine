      predict potential neurocognitive changes following SRS, and as a possible guide for SRS
      treatment alteration, whether through adjustment of dose or beam arrangements in relation to
      white matter tracts. In this observational pilot study of 20 patients, the association
      between RT-associated brain injury and neurocognitive function will be quantitatively
      assessed longitudinally over one year following SRS. The study team hypothesizes that, over
      this time, (1) there will be radiation dose-dependent reductions in regional white matter
      tract integrity and reduction in functional connectivity in the default mode network of gray
      matter, (2) there will be measurable decline in neurocognitive function, and (3) there will
      be an association between severity of radiation-induced brain injury on MRI and magnitude of
      neurocognitive functional decline. This association will relate, in part, to the location(s)
      affected.
