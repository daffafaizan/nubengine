      was performed before and after 10 days treatment programme under local anesthesia. Measure
      the brown fat characteristics of biopsy samples.The sample was immediately processed in 3
      sections.One part was stored for immunohistology and western blot, the second was snap-frozen
      for estimation of biochemical markers, and the remainder was used to harvest small
      subcutaneous arteries with micro-dissection. Also, the perivascular adipose tissue (PVAT) was
      studied on the changes of morphology and possible signal pathways before and after GLP-1
      treatment.
