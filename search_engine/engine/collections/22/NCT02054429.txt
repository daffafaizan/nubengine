      an insulin aspart (study drug) infusion (intensive insulin therapy [IIT arm]) for 48hrs or to
      a control arm. All patients attending the emergency department (ED) of Kaleida health within
      24 hrs of symptom onset suggestive of an anterior circulation ischemic stroke will be
      screened. If they meet the inclusion criteria and do not have any exclusion criteria,
      informed consent will be obtained and a blinded stratified block randomization process will
      be initiated.

      In addition to receiving endovascular and standard medical therapy for AIS, subjects will be
      randomized to an intensive insulin treatment arm (IIT arm) or control arm. In the IIT arm
      subjects will receive an insulin aspart infusion at a minimal rate of 2 units/hr while
      maintaining blood glucose between 90-120mg/dl for 48 hrs. Glucose control in the control will
      be at the discretion of the treating provider.

      Subjects will have the following study procedures done at different time points: A)
      assessment of neurological outcomes : modified Rankin scale (mRS) at 30 days and 90 days and
      NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) at baseline , 24 hrs, 72 hrs, 30 days and 90 days.

      B) MRI (Diffusion weighted imaging), 3-5 days and 90 days and C) various plasma and cellular
      endpoints will be measured in blood collected at baseline, 2, 4, 6, 24 , 48 and 72 hrs and at
      30 days and 90 days.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to detect a difference in the percentage of non diabetic
      subjects with mRS 0-2 at 90 days after an AIS treated with endovascular therapy, in the IIT
      and control arm.
