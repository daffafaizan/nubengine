    
      The National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions-III (NESARC-III) is
      planned to be fielded in 2012 by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism
      (NIAAA) in conjunction with Westat, through a contract under data collection authority Title
      42 U.S.C. 285 n (Attachment 23.a). The target population of the NESARC-III is the civilian
      noninstitutionalized population, 18 years and older, residing in the contiguous United States
      (U.S.) and Alaska and Hawaii. The sample (N=46,500) will include households and selected
      noninstitutionalized group quarters (e.g., agricultural, vocational training and other
      dormitories, halfway houses, hostels, YMCAs, shelters, campgrounds, carnivals). The
      NESARC-III will collect information on alcohol use disorders and related physical and mental
      disabilities in addition to DNA to be obtained through saliva samples.

      This request for IRB approval also includes a pilot test of approximately 50 respondents that
      will serve the sole purpose of testing the data collection procedures, operations and system
      architecture of the NESARC-III survey. There will also be two small methodological
      subcomponents of the NESARC-III proper that will serve the purposes of providing ongoing
      validation and assessment of the utility of outcome measures appearing on the major data
      collection questionnaire, the Alcohol Use Disorder and Associated Disabilities Interview
      Schedule-V (AUDADIS-V: Grant et al., 2008). In the first methodological subcomponent, 1000
      respondents participating in the NESARC-III proper will be re-interviewed with a shorter
      version of the original AUDADIS-V. In the second methodological subcomponent, 700 different
      respondents participating in the NESARC-III proper will be re-interviewed using a different
      assessment instrument, the Psychiatric Research Interview for Substance and Mental Disorders
      (PRISM: Hasin et al., 2008), covering information on major outcome variables very similar to
      those appearing in the AUDADIS-V. NIAAA has conducted such validation/utility tests that have
      received OMB approval (OMB No. 0930-0151, OMB No. 0925-0455: Grant et al., 2003a; Ruan et
      al., 2008) in the past. The design and procedures associated with each of these
      methodological subcomponents will be explicated and discussed within the body of this IRB
      submission as necessary.

      The NESARC-III will be the fourth national survey conducted by NIAAA. The objectives and
      content areas of the NESARC-III are extremely similar to those of the prior three NIAAA
      surveys, with the exception of the NESARC-III s provision for collecting saliva samples.
      Prior NIAAA national surveys included the 1991-1992 National Longitudinal Alcohol
      Epidemiologic Survey (OMB No. 0930-0151: Grant et al., 1994), the 2001-2002 Wave 1 NESARC
      (OMB No. 0925-0484: Grant et al., 2003b), and the 2004-2005 Wave 2 NESARC (OMB No. 0925-0484:
      Grant et al., 2006).
