    
      At the start of recruitment, a comprehensive geriatric assessment will be developed in
      enrolled patients of both groups. After this assessment and before starting the physical
      training in intervention group, a nutritional intervention will be provided in patients of
      both groups :

      Enrolled patients will receive nutritional information on optimal daily energy intake,
      ensuring at least a daily protein intake of 1 g. of by kg of weight.

      As well as, calcium and vitamin D will be provided if calcidiol blood levels are lower than
      30 ng/ml.

      Calcidiol blood value between 20-29 ng/dl it will provide calcium + vitamin D (total amount
      1200 mg calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D) daily and calciferol 20.000 IU every 15 days (3
      months)

      Calcidiol blood value between 10-19 ng/dl it will provide calcium + vitamin D (total amount
      1200 mg calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D) daily and calciferol 20.000 IU every 10 days (3
      months)

      Calcidiol blood value between 1-9 ng/dl it will provide calcium + vitamin D (total amount
      1200 mg calcium plus 800 IU of vitamin D) daily and calciferol 20.000 IU every 7 days (3
      months)

      After nutritional intervention, intervention group will start a multicomponent training
      intervention during 180 days Intervention characteristics: 24weeks, 5days/week, 60min/session

      Monthly, enrolled frail elderly patients will be evaluated. 6 minutes walking test, timed up
      and go test, bilateral hand grip, Barthel index, Tinetti balance assessment tool, Mini-mental
      state examination, short-MNA (Mini Nutritional Assessment ), lean and fat mass measures with
      impedanciometer and number of visits to general practitioner, emergency room and hospital
      admission were recorded.

      After follow up period a new comprehensive geriatric assessment will be recorded.
