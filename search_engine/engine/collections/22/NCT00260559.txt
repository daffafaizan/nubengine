      open esophagectomy. Measure standard observer derived outcomes such as morbidity, mortality,
      tumor recurrence and also patient derived outcomes, in particular quality of life (QOL) using
      the MOS SF36 questionnaire. Evaluate whether the SF36 will accurately reflect pre and
      postoperative changes in clinical status in this patient group.Compare the results of this
      global QOL instrument (SF 36) to disease specific scales of dysphagia and reflux. Assess the
      impact of adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy on QOL in this patient group and determine if any
      advantages of MIE can be demonstrated.
