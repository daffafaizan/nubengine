      enroll a total of 1968 individuals(984 cases in each group) with acute ischemic stroke less
      than 72 hours after onset. Participants will be randomized into Tongxinluo capsule treatment
      group with the capsule administration of 4 granules tid. for 90 days, while the patients in
      the control group receive placebo capsule. NIH Stroke Score of the subjects is 4-22 at
      randomization. Evaluations of efficacy and safety will be taken at baseline, 7 days,
      discharge date and 90 days. Neuroimaging [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans] will be
      obtained at baseline and 90 days after therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint is the
      proportion of Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) â‰¤1 at 90 days.
