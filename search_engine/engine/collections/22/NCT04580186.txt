           resulting from abnormal cloacal development .

        -  CBE, the most common form with an incidence of 2.68 in 100,000 live births is
           characterized by an evaginated bladder plate, epispadias and an anterior defect of the
           pelvis, pelvic floor and abdominal wall

        -  The single most important predictor of long-term bladder growth and continence is
           successful primary bladder closure .

        -  The staged reconstruction of bladder exstrophy was proposed by Jeff and led to
           significant improvements in continence and renal function with excellent cosmetic
           results.

        -  The initial staged management consisted of newborn bladder and posterior urethral
           closure followed by bladder neck reconstruction at 2 to 3 years of age and later
           epispadias repair.

        -  The understanding that appropriately timed epispadias repair may lead to enhancement in
           bladder capacity led to performance of epispadias repair at 2 to 3 years of age followed
           by later bladder neck reconstruction. The current modification of the staged repair
           consists of secure bladder and posterior urethral closure in infancy followed by
           epispadias repair at 6 to 12 months of age and bladder neck reconstruction when the
           patient is able to cooperate in a good voiding program.

        -  Complete repair surgery is performed in a single procedure that closes the bladder and
           the abdomen and repairs the urethra and outer sex organs

        -  A failed classic bladder exstrophy (CBE) closure is defined by wound dehiscence, bladder
           prolapse, bladder outlet obstruction, or formation of a vesicocutaneous fistula.
