      In this article the investigators describe the Noergaard technique for reduction of anterior
      shoulder dislocations. This is an atraumatic reduction method that has proven successful
      through several years of practice. The investigators describe and evaluate the results of
      this technique through a retrospective analysis of patients admitted and treated for anterior
      shoulder dislocation at the emergency department (ED) of Copenhagen University Hospital
      Hvidovre, Denmark, in a 1-year period.

      Methods

      In the Noergaard technique the patient is placed standing bend over forwards in front of the
      rail on a hospital bed, resting the forehead on the back of the non-affected forearm, which
      is put on the rail. The affected arm should now be relaxed and stretched, hanging straight
      down toward the floor. The patient is then instructed to attempt to relax and make pendular
      and circular motions with the affected arm hanging down.
