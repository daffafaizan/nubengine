      Methadone maintenance therapy may decrease the criminal rate and increase the quality of life
      for individuals with opioid dependence, but the high drop-out rate and long-term requirement
      to use of methadone are major problems in methadone maintenance therapy for opioid
      dependence. Methadone is after all another long acting opioid which may cause dependence.
      Therefore, current effort of methadone maintenance therapy is limited.

      Memantine used to be recognized as a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist.
      It was found with neuroprotective effects in several neurodegenerative diseases in recent few
      years. Memantine could inhibit brain inflammatory response through its action on reuroglial
      cells and provide neurotrophic effect. Previous studies also found memantine with inhibitory
      effects addictive behaviors in several substances. All of the above demonstrated that the
      combination of memantine and methadone in treating substance dependence prossess unique
      advantages, which may be superior to the original treatment. The main purpose of this study
      is to explore the neuroprotective effect of memantine on inhibition of brain inflammatory
      response through its action on reuroglial cells. Besides, we will evaluate the therapeutic
      effect of the combination of memantine and methadone in the subjects with opioid combine
      amphetamine dependence/abuse. It will also investigate multiple pathogenesis of addictive
      behaviors from the perspective of treatment response.
