      population, according to some authors up to 50% of all pregnancies would have the label of
      high risk pregnancies.

      At present, it is recommended that high risk pregnancies, thought to be at risk of placental
      insufficiency should be monitored with Doppler studies of the umbilical artery. Doppler
      assessment of the placental circulation plays an important role in screening for impaired
      placentation and its complications of intrauterine growth restriction.

      The purpose of umbilical artery Doppler surveillance is to predict fetal academia thereby
      allowing timely delivery prior to irreversible end-organ damage and intrauterine fetal death.

      According to a Cochrane Pregnancy and Childbirth Group's systematic review and meta-analysis,
      in which Published and unpublished randomised and quasi-randomised trials evaluating the
      effects of one or more described antenatal fetal surveillance regimens were searched, the
      optimal frequency of umbilical artery Doppler surveillance is unclear.

      Our randomized controlled study was conducted on patients with high risk pregnancies at their
      third trimester who attended Ain Shams University Maternity Hospital. A total of 292 high
      risk pregnant women fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected by random sampling and
      divided between two groups with 146 patients in each group. Group I underwent Doppler every
      other week and Group II underwent Doppler once weekly.
