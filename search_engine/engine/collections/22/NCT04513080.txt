      message-based psychotherapy (MBP) for depression, compared to traditionally delivered,
      video-chat psychotherapy (VCP) and (2) develop an evidence-based treatment sequence for those
      who do not respond to either daily MBP or VCP.

      Phase 1 consists of a pilot study to determine the best incentive model to retain a sample of
      people 18 years old and older with depression into a SMART trial. Information from this pilot
      will inform the retention strategy for Phase 2.

      Phase 2 is a 12-week, randomized clinical trial using a SMART design to test the following
      aims: 1. Determine the relative effectiveness of daily MBP compared to weekly VCP in treating
      symptoms of depression and improving social functioning; 2. For those who fail to respond to
      6 weeks of weekly VCP only, determine whether the addition of daily messaging, or a switch to
      monthly video-chat plus daily messaging improves depression and functional outcomes; and 3.
      For those who fail to respond to 6 weeks of daily MBP, whether the addition of monthly
      video-chat or weekly video-chat improves outcomes. Participants will provide data on mood,
      activity, and functioning, and we will collect data on use of treatment (texts and sessions),
      and working alliance.
