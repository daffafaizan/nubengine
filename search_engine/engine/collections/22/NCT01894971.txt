      coagulated by Ligasure®. The randomized, the same word selected side of the fallopian tube is
      coagulated one more time at the cornual portion than unselected other side of fallopian tube.
      Hypothesis is that the side selected and coagulated twice would have less fallopian tube
      tisse left at fianl pathology than the side only once coagulated by Ligasure®.
