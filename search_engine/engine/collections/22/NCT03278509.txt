    
      REDUCE-SWEDEHEART is designed as a registry-based, randomized, parallel, open-label,
      multicenter trial.

      Patients, day 1-7 after myocardial infarction, who have undergone a coronary angiography and
      with preserved left ventricular systolic ejection fraction will be randomized to either oral
      beta-blockade (see "Intervention" for detailed description) at a dose according to the
      treating physician, or no beta-blockade. To allow quick inclusion the randomization module
      will be accessible by a simple web-based log-in procedure. Concomitantly, all baseline data
      about each individual patient will be collected from the SWEDEHEART registry. Patients will
      then be followed regarding all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, heart failure, atrial
      fibrillation, and patient-related outcome measures (for a subgroup of patients). Patients
      that are eligible but not included in REDUCE-SWEDEHEART will also be followed regarding
      chosen treatment and the primary and secondary endpoints.

      Follow-up will continue until 944 primary endpoints have been observed (endpoint driven). All
      analyses will be performed on the intention-to-treat set, defined as all intentionally
      randomized patients, by randomized treatment. The primary endpoint is death or new MI.
      Information about death will be obtained from the Swedish population registry. Information
      regarding new myocardial infarction during hospitalization and readmission because of
      myocardial infarction or other outcome (secondary outcomes, see section below), will be
      obtained from the SWEDEHEART-registry (for myocardial infarction) and the patient registry of
      the National board of health and welfare.
