      temperature-controlled ablation with microelectrodes and 6 thermocouples for real-time
      temperature monitoring during ablation. The associated vHPSD algorithm modulates power to
      maintain target temperature during these vHPSD lesions (90 W, 4 s). In preclinical models,
      vHPSD ablation with this novel catheter has improved atrial linear lesion contiguity,
      transmurality, and durability and has substantially reduced radiofrequency ablation times,
      but with a safety profile similar to those of standard irrigated radiofrequency ablation
      catheters.

      The QDOT -FAST study demonstrated the clinical feasibility and safety of vHPSD ablation.
      Procedure and fluoroscopy times were substantially lower than historical standard ablation
      with point-by-point catheters.

      The aim of the present study is to compare the safety and short-term performance between
      THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH SF-5D QDOT system used with fast ablation mode and the standard
      Thermocool Smartouch SF in treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF).
