    
      Benzodiazepines (such as oxazepam) are among the most frequently prescribed class of drugs
      and are commonly used therapeutically for patients with chronic disease. This study is
      important because of the potential for toxicity resulting from a reaction between AZT and
      benzodiazepines and the likelihood of frequent use of the combination of these drugs in
      patients with HIV infection.

      Patients are studied to determine oral and intravenous AZT and single oral dose oxazepam
      pharmacokinetics. Patients then take AZT and oxazepam together to determine if interactions
      between the drugs occur.
