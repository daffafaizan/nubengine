      eligibility. After having signed informed consent patients will receive open,
      guideline-based, state-of-the-art treatment for their current symptomatology ((hypo)manic
      and/or depressed) for up to 16 weeks. As soon as patients meet stabilisation criteria (YMRS
      total score < 12 and IDS total score < 12) they will be equipped with a study smartphone, for
      exclusive use during the study period, to assess the parameters of interest (activity,
      communication pattern, sleep pattern) and define the individual symptoms' threshold during 4
      consecutive weeks of stabilisation . If patients fulfil randomization criteria (4 consecutive
      weeks with YMRS total score < 12 and IDStotal score < 12), they will enter the observer
      (rater) - blind, intervention phase, which will continue for 18 months (78 weeks). At
      randomization patients will be assigned to either the Smartphone-Based Ambulatory Assessment
      group, including real-time data capture and data-driven, individual symptoms'
      threshold-defined therapeutic interventions (SBAA+), in addition to state-of-the-art
      maintenance treatment or the Smartphone-Based Ambulatory Assessment group, only including
      real-time data capture (SBAA), in addition to state-of-the-art maintenance treatment.
