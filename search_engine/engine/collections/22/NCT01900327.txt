      cancer ranges under study conditions from 17.9 months to 23.6 months. Tumor recurrence occurs
      locally, at distant sites (liver, peritoneum, lungs), or both. Observational and autopsy
      series report local recurrence rates of up to 87% even after potentially "curative" R0
      resection. To achieve better local control, neoadjuvant chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) has
      been suggested for preoperative tumour downsizing, to elevate the likelihood of curative,
      margin-negative R0 resection and to increase the OS rate. However, controlled, randomized
      trials addressing the impact of neoadjuvant CRT survival do not exist. The underlying
      hypothesis of this randomized, two-armed, open-label, multicenter, phase III trial is that
      neoadjuvant CRT increases the three-year overall survival by 12% (30% to 42%) compared to
      patients undergoing upfront surgery for resectable pancreatic cancer. Overall, 410 patients
      (n=205 in each study arm) will be enrolled in the trial, taking into regard an expected drop
      out rate of 7% and allocated either to receive neoadjuvant CRT prior to surgery or to undergo
      surgery alone. Circumferential resection margin status, i.e. R0 and R1 rates, respectively,
      surgical resectability rate, local and distant disease-free and global survival, and first
      site of tumor recurrence constitute further essential endpoints of the trial.
