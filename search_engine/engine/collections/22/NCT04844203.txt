    
      Among patients who will be referred for ENMG and exploration of a neuropathy, orthostatic
      tremor will be investigated systematically.

      Main objective and primary endpoint:

        -  To estimate the prevalence of OT with its 95% confidence interval in the population of
           patients defined above

        -  Presence of OT confirmed by surface EMG (polygraphy) in patients with standing
           instability referred for ENMG.

      Secondary objectives and end points

        -  Determine the demographic, clinical, electrophysiological characteristics of patients
           with OT; Estimate the prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in patients with OT; Duration
           of symptoms; Correlation with quantitative neuropathy scores (ISS, MRC, ONLS, R-ODS)

        -  Age, sex, clinical parameters: symptoms reported by the patient (instability, tremor,
           weakness, pain, falls), duration, current medications, ISS score, MRC score, ONLS score,
           R-ODS score) and electrophysiological parameters (mean frequency of OT in Hertz, MUNIX
           score (number of motor units in the anterior tibialis, calculated by software on the
           ENMG machine).
