      usual (TAU) to increase substance use treatment engagement among HIV-positive adults aged 50
      years and older. The investigators will recruit patients from the Southern HIV and Alcohol
      Research Consortium (SHARC) HIV primary care clinic network.

      In order to develop effective substance use intervention models for HIV care settings the
      specific aims of the current project are:

      Aim1: Examine the feasibility of the SBIRT-PN model at the UF Health Infectious
      Disease-Medical Specialties Clinic. The investigators hypothesize that the SBIRT-PN model
      will demonstrate high feasibility among providers within the UF Health Infectious Disease -
      Medical Specialties Clinic.

      Aim2a: Assess the acceptability of SBIRT-PN. The investigators hypothesize that SBIRT-PN will
      demonstrate high acceptability among patients enrolled in this condition.

      Aim2b: Assess the acceptability of SBIRT-PN among HIV-positive individuals by age cohort
      (younger vs older). The investigators hypothesize that SBIRT-PN will demonstrate higher
      acceptability among older HIV-positive patients enrolled in this condition.

      Aim3: Assess influence of SBIRT-PN model on treatment engagement and substance use compared
      to enhanced treatment as usual (TAU).The investigators hypothesize that those in the SBIRT-PN
      condition will evidence greater treatment engagement and a reduction in substance use.
