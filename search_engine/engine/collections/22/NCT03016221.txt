      disorders is widely used. Despite the widespread use of these products, there is missing
      information on the physiological mechanisms and efficacy of topical warming and cooling
      ointments. Most of the existing literature is about the efficacy of topical non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-products on chronic pain in osteoarthritis. Furthermore, one
      study tested the cooling effect of gels with different menthol concentrations. They found
      that, regardless of the concentration, the skin temperature was reduced up to one hour post
      application in the area of application.

      The aim of our study is to evaluate the change of skin characteristics after a single
      application of a warming or cooling topical product on healthy subjects. Outcome parameters
      include skin perfusion, temperature, skin redness and subjective thermal sensation. We only
      selected products in form of alcohol based ointments, menthol or wintergreen oil. Sprays and
      patches were excluded.

      The application area is the unilateral lumbar back region, whereas the contralateral side
      serves as control area. After an acclimatization period, baseline measurements are performed,
      followed by standardized application of the topical product. The local skin responses are
      measured in 10 mins time increments up to one hour.
