    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the objective clinical response in patients with recurrent or newly diagnosed
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with AZD2171 (cediranib
      maleate).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients. II. Assess the early and late
      physiological and biological effects of this drug on tumor interstitial fluid pressure, pO2,
      and tumor microvasculature.

      III. Assess the value of potential noninvasive biomarkers of response, including plasma
      levels of molecules involved in angiogenesis, circulating endothelial cells and progenitor
      cells, and functional imaging changes before and after treatment.

      IV. Assess the gene expression patterns before and after treatment as predictors of clinical
      and biological response.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral cediranib maleate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo dynamic contrast-enhanced CT imaging and blood collection periodically
      during study for research studies assessing plasma levels of angiogenic/antiangiogenic
      molecules, circulating endothelial cells (by flow cytometry), progenitor cells, and protein
      analysis of potential biomarkers.
