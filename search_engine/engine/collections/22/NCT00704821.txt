      participants will receive progressively higher PTC299 dose levels; in this stage, treatment
      will be given in repeated 6-week cycles consisting of 4 weeks of oral PTC299 twice per day
      followed by a 2-week, no-drug period. In Stage 2, additional groups of 3 to 6 participants
      will be enrolled at tolerable dose levels to receive treatment in repeated 6-week cycles
      consisting of oral PTC299 administered 2 or 3 times per day continuously (that is, without
      the 2-week no-drug period as in Stage 1). In Stage 3, additional groups of 3 to 6
      participants will be enrolled at tolerable dose levels to receive treatment in repeated
      3-week cycles consisting of oral PTC299 administered 2 or 3 times per day continuously in
      combination with docetaxel (75 milligrams/meter squared [mg/m^2] intravenously [IV] every 3
      weeks). All planned dose levels in all stages are expected to achieve circulating blood
      levels of PTC299 known to be active in animal models of human cancer. Treatment for each
      participant can continue as long as the therapy appears to be safely offering tumor control
      to that participant. Up to 76 evaluable participants will be accrued across the 3 stages.
