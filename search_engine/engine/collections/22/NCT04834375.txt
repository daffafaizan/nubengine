      steroids has shown promise. In a recent randomized control trial, dexamethasone 6 mg once
      daily showed a modest decrease in mortality among hospitalized COVID-19 patients who require
      oxygen supplementation or invasive mechanical ventilation. Other trials have shown that the
      inflammatory response to COVID-19 can be further attenuated at higher dosages of
      dexamethasone. These higher dosages have not been well studied and have not been directly
      compared to the current standard dose of dexamethasone 6 mg daily. We propose that a higher
      dexamethasone dose, equivalent to methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg/day which is routinely used to
      treat other inflammatory conditions of the lungs, may be more effective than the current
      standard dose in reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure.
