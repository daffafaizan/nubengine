      perceptions of breastfeeding support in the NICU, this study will follow a descriptive,
      qualitative design. Mothers of preterm newborns in the Royal Victoria Hospital will
      participate in a semi-structured interview about their breastfeeding goals and what they
      perceived to be facilitators and barriers to achieving their intended goals. During the
      interviews, the mothers will be asked a set of socio-demographic questions, open-ended
      questions about their breastfeeding goals, and open-ended questions about their perceptions
      of barriers and facilitators to meeting these goals in the NICU Participants may also receive
      one follow-up phone call to clarify their responses to the questions or to validate the
      information obtained from the interview.
