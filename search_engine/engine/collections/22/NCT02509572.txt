      adolescents in the emergency department (ED) through the use of an audio-computer assisted
      self-interview (ACASI). This information can then be used to provide clinical decision
      support to clinicians for targeted sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening in the ED
      for adolescents. This randomized trial randomizes patients to whether or not the clinician
      receives the decision support and tests whether provision of decision support results in
      increased STI screening for patients who report high risk sexual activity. Secondary outcomes
      include evaluation of whether the clinical decision support results in increased STI
      detection, and identifying factors associated with adapting the clinical decision support.
