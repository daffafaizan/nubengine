    
      Our institution performs therapeutic ERCP (Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography ),
      Endoscopic Ultrasound (EUS) and Interventional Endoscopy in around 1000 patients a year.
      Procedures such as biliary and/or pancreatic sphincterotomy, stents placement (metallic or
      plastic) and removal for revision, cysts and pseudocysts drainage are conducted in patients
      suffering from pancreatico-biliary disorders, gastrointestinal disorders and esophageal
      disorders. The investigators would like to assess prospectively the efficacy and safety of
      these routine procedures to permit identification of technical details about the procedures
      or other factors which might be associated with outcome or results. Assessment of these
      details would help us with problem identification and recommendations to improve health
      outcomes and quality of life in these patients.
