      patients. Our preliminary data suggests that efavirenz may worsen endothelial function, which
      in turn may increase the risk for future CVD events. Efavirenz has also been linked to lower
      vitamin D levels, which may in turn result in increased bone fragility. Raltegravir is not
      known to affect either endothelial function or vitamin D levels. Therefore, switching
      efavirenz to raltegravir in patients with suppressed HIV viremia may lead to improved
      outcomes.
