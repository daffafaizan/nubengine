    
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study to evaluate the antitumor
      activity, safety, and pharmacology of MEDI-575 in adult subjects with first recurrence of
      GBM.

      Approximately 55 subjects will be enrolled to determine the preliminary efficacy profile of
      MEDI-575 in the treatment of subjects with first recurrence of GBM. Subjects will receive
      MEDI-575 as a 60-minute IV infusion on Day 1 every 21 days until disease progression,
      initiation of alternative anticancer therapy, unacceptable toxicity, or other reasons for
      subject withdrawal.

      The primary assessment of antitumor activity is PFS-6; tumor response and progression will be
      determined using Updated Response Assessment Criteria of High Grade Gliomas- Neuro-Oncology
      Working Group v.1. Approximately 15 investigational sites in the United States will
      participate in this study. All subjects will be followed every 3 months for the duration of
      the trial (defined as 9 months from the date the last subject is entered into the trial or
      when the sponsor stops the study.
