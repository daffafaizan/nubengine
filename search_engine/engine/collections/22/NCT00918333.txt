      I. To determine the maximum tolerated doses (MTD) of LBH589 (panobinostat) and RAD001
      (everolimus) when used in combination in patients with myeloma or lymphoma. (Phase I) II. To
      evaluate the therapeutic activity of the combination of LBH589 with RAD001 in patients with
      relapsed or refractory lymphoma. (Arm A, phase II) III. To evaluate the therapeutic activity
      of the combination of LBH589 with RAD001 in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple
      myeloma. (Arm B, phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicities associated with the combination of LBH589 with RAD001. (Phase
      I) II. To further describe the toxicities associated with the combination of LBH589 with
      RAD001 in each arm independently. (Phase II) III. To evaluate overall survival,
      progression-free survival, and duration of response in each arm independently. (Phase II)

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic interaction of LBH589 and RAD001. II. To assess the
      correlation between clinical (toxicity and/or tumor response or activity) effects with the
      pharmacologic (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) parameters, and/or biologic (correlative
      laboratory) results.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of panobinostat and everolimus followed by
      a phase II study. (dose-escalation closed to accrual as of April 6, 2011)

      Patients receive panobinostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) or on days 1, 3, 5, 15, 17, and 19
      and everolimus PO QD on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years.
