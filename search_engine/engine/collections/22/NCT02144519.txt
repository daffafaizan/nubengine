      design with 20 ASPs that serve mostly low-income and minority children (approximately 1300
      children ages 6-12yrs) in Columbia, SC and address the following specific aims: Aim 1.
      Evaluate the impact of a staff-level intervention, a professional development training
      program focused on core competencies to promote physical activity, on children's physical
      activity levels; Aim 2. Evaluate the impact of a site-level intervention, a snack
      modification program that includes a discount buying program, on the quality of snacks served
      and consumed; and Aim 3. Evaluate the implementation of the staff-level and site-level
      interventions and identify organizational, staff, and setting characteristics that influence
      the process of implementing these strategies.
