      I. Percentage of patients with successful retrieval of the reflector confirmed by specimen
      radiography.

      II. Percentage of patients with successful retrieval of the biopsied node, confirmed by
      presence of clip, biopsy changes or treatment-related changes on pathology.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Total number of lymph nodes removed. II. Percentage of patients in which clipped node was
      a sentinel node. III. Percentage of patients with nodal pathologic complete response (PCR).
      IV. Residual cancer burden (RCB) score for patients with residual nodal disease.

      V. Percentage of patients requiring axillary dissection. VI. Days prior to surgery of
      reflector insertion.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo image-guided placement of the SCOUT reflector prior to course 2 of standard
      of care neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Patients undergo standard of care surgery approximately 4-8
      weeks after chemotherapy completion.
