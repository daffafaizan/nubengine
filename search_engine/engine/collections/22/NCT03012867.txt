      homeostasis differently in critically ill medical patients. All patients are admitted to a
      tertiary ICU and require mechanical ventilation.

      Resting energy expenditure is assessed at baseline in the fasting state by indirect
      calorimetry. Total energy demand is calculated and patients are randomized to receive
      fat-based or glucose-based nutrition which is administered continously for 7 days. Indirect
      calorimetry is repeated on days 3 and 7 under continous nutrition. During the study period,
      various parameters of glucose homeostasis are assessed. Daily, there will be at least 3
      measurements of blood glucose, more if the treating physician deems it necessary. Daily
      average glucose, daily glucose variability, overall area under the curve for glucose are
      calculated. Furthermore, energy intake by nutrition, medications (i.e. propofol), and glucose
      infusion, as well as substrate intake, and insulin demand per 24hrs are determined daily.
      Adverse effects such as episodes of hyper- or hypoglycemia, cholestasis,
      hypertriglyceridemia, diarrhea, vomiting, and the amount of gastric residual volume are
      noted.
