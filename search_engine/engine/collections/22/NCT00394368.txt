    
      Asthma is a chronic disease that is estimated to affect over 25 million people both in the
      U.S. and Europe (i.e. approximately 10% of the total population). Pharmacological therapy is
      used to treat reversible airway obstruction, inflammation and hyper-reactivity. Medications
      include preventive treatments in forms of antinflammatory/antiallergic agents (i.e.
      glucocorticosteroids, leukotriene antagonists, cromolyn sodium) and reliever treatments, in
      form of bronchodilators (i.e. β-adrenergic agonists, anticholinergics). In patients treated
      with inhaled glucocorticosteroids whose asthma is not fully controlled, national and
      international guidelines recommend a stepwise approach. Recent evidence-based clinical trials
      show that the addition of a LABA to inhaled glucocorticosteroids is more beneficial in terms
      of asthma control than increasing the dose of corticosteroids alone.
