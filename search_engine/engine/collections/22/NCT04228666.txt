    
      This is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, non-randomized study in subjects with Alzheimer's disease.
      24 patients will be enrolled for the study. The overall objective of this study is to
      evaluate the safety profile of four IV infusions of autologous adipose-derived mesenchymal
      stem cells (HB-adMSCs) in subjects with clinical diagnosis of AD. The primary endpoint of
      this study is to measure the number and frequency of adverse event(s) and/or severe adverse
      event(s) throughout the study duration. The second endpoint of this study is to evaluate the
      ability of HB-adMSCs to alter AD-related inflammation via measuring levels of Tumor Necrosis
      Factor alpha (TNF-a), Interleukin-1 (IL-1), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-Reactive Protein (CRP),
      and markers associated with amyloid deposition, Amyloid beta 40 and Amyloid beta 42. Subjects
      will also be assessed for cognitive deficits measured by changes from baseline values using
      Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's disease Cooperative Study Activities of
      Daily Living (ADCS-ADL), Alzheimer's disease Related Quality of Life (ADRQL), Altoida Neuro
      Motor Index (NMI) for Digital Biomarkers, and Clinical Dementia Rating Questionnaire (CDR).
