      (ALDHbr) in ischemic cardiomyopathy patients. The study hypothesis is that transendocardial
      injections of autologous bone marrow cells in patients with end-stage ischemic heart disease
      is safe, can provide neovascularization, and can improve perfusion and myocardial
      contractility. The primary object of this study is to assess the safety of the ALDHbr cell
      injections. The efficacy will be based upon treadmill MVO2. A maximum of 60 patients will be
      enrolled in the study. At the end of 6 months, after the required testing has been completed,
      the patients will be told whether they were in the control group or not. The patients in the
      control group will be given the option to crossover and actually receive stem cell injection.
      At the time of crossover, which then becomes the baseline, patients will begin the follow-up
      with all testing including clinic visits for one year for a total of 18 months follow-up.
