      receive either cinnamon or placebo for three months. The dose of cinnamon will be one gram
      daily. Fasting serum glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and insulin levels
      will be measured at baseline and at 1, 2, and 3 months. HbA1c levels will be measured at
      baseline and at 3 months. Patients will be monitored for compliance, adverse effects, and
      dietary changes.
