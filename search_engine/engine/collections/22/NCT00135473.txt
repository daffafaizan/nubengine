      sepsis therapies; the role of supportive measures is comparatively unclear. In Europe the use
      of colloids is widespread, but there is no evidence on the role of either crystalloid or
      colloid volume therapy in sepsis. Recently, a higher incidence of kidney failure in sepsis
      was reported after administration of colloids.

      In critical illness, a significant reduction in mortality was recently achieved by strict
      glycemic control, however it has to be determined whether this is true and safe for patients
      with sepsis as well.
