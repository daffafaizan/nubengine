      Primary

        -  Determine the incidence of the D104N COL18A1 polymorphism in patients with prostate
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the incidence of this polymorphism in African-American patients with prostate
           cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a retrospective, multicenter study.

      DNA is extracted from preexisting serum samples and polymerase chain reaction is performed to
      determine the genotype pattern.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients and 250 healthy participants will be accrued for
      this study.
