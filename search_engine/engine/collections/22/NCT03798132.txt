      laparoscopy followed by cytoreductive surgery to calculate peritoneal carcinomatosis extent
      by each modality.

      Regional PCI was calculated in each of the 13 anatomical abdominopelvic regions, then total
      PCI by summation of the lesion size score, it ranged from 0 to 39. Categorization of
      peritoneal carcinomatosis was classified into 3 categories low if PCI < 10, moderate if
      10-20, and large if >20.
