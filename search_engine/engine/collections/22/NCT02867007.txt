    
      The study is designed as a 2-part, multicenter, open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation,
      cohort-expansion study of KHK2455 as a monotherapy run-in (Cycle 0) followed by combination
      therapy with the anti-CCR4 antibody mogamulizumab (Cycle 1 and beyond).

      Part 1 will identify the MTD or the highest protocol-defined dose, in the absence of
      exceeding the MTD, for the KHK2455 monotherapy run-in and for the combination regimen
      (KHK2455 monotherapy [Cycle 0] followed by KHK2455 + mogamulizumab combination [Cycle 1]).
      The dose escalation phase (Part 1) will enroll up to approximately 36 subjects.

      Part 2, the cohort-expansion phase, will further explore the safety, tolerability, PK, PD,
      pharmacogenomics (PGx), and preliminary anti-tumor activity of KHK2455 administered as
      monotherapy and in combination with mogamulizumab in subjects with one cohort-specific tumor
      type. In Part 2, approximately 15 subjects with a selected tumor type will be enrolled and
      treated with the recommended KHK2455 dose established in Part 1 in combination with
      mogamulizumab.
