      interstitial and intracavitary brachytherapy. In this study, 3DUS images will be acquired
      during the regular clinical procedure to assess the quality of the images, anatomical detail
      and location of needles. The acquired images will be analyzed post-treatment and fused with
      pre-treatment MRI, and post-treatment CT scans to develop a virtual simulated radiation
      treatment plan, and to verify the applicator positions.
