      the university food service centre. Those who respond (n=136) were selected after the normal
      blood lipid profile was verified by laboratory testing of total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, VLDL
      and triacylglycerols, as well exclusion and inclusion criteria were applied. Within the
      exclusion criteria we included diagnosed coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus, arterial
      hypertension, use of any prescribed medication, restrictive diets and any migraine or cocoa
      products allergic antecedents.

      Finally enlisted subjects were 120 non-smokers, normolipemic, ages were between 20 and 30
      years old, who underwent anthropometric measurements like weight, height, BMI (among 16.0 and
      27.4 kg/m2) and regular nutritional and toxicological habits using standardized surveys.
      Subjects received 3 meals a day from the Food Nutritional Service of Universidad Industrial
      de Santander, in order to ensure the same diet conditions for all subjects along the
      experimental period. An average colombian diet, based on 2287 calories as a total caloric
      value (protein 15%, fats 35% and carbohydrates 60%) was used. The study protocol and the
      informed consent were approved by the Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá Institutional Ethical
      Committee (Santa Fe de Bogotá D.C., Colombia). We got written informed consent from all
      participants and they received money compensation for its participation in the study.

      resistance Determination of oxidative protection
