      ankle joint provides a unique opportunity for the study of post-traumatic OA because of the
      low risk of primary OA and the relatively high risk of post-traumatic OA. This study involves
      a multidisciplinary approach utilizing both laboratory and clinical research to improve
      understanding of OA and to develop innovative approaches for preventing and treating this
      disease. Mechanical distraction involves operative placement of specialized pins and rods to
      hold the joint in place. Some distraction allows for limited motion of the joint, while other
      distraction holds the joint immobile. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the
      mechanical factors that lead to restoration of a cartilaginous articular surface, decreased
      pain, and improved joint function after mechanical distraction of osteoarthritic joints.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Group A
      will be treated with mechanical distraction with motion; Group B will be treated with
      mechanical distraction without motion. Participants will be followed for 28 months and will
      have 11 study visits. Most of the study visits will occur during the first half of the study.
      State-of-the-art techniques for clinical assessment, articular surface imaging, biomechanical
      modeling, and biochemical testing will be used in this study.
