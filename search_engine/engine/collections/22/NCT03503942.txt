      targets to recruit up to 846 overweight/obese (BMI ≥23.0) adults (age 18-64) with isolated
      impaired fasting glucose (IFG), isolated impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), or IFG + IGT in
      Singapore. The follow-up period will be 3 years.

      Eligible subjects will be identified through community, primary care clinics and
      hospital-based diabetes screening program. Following informed consent, eligible participants
      will be randomised into the control or the treatment arm.

      Participants in the control arm will receive the current standard of care for pre-diabetes
      which includes counseling on lifestyle modifications and follow up by primary care
      physicians.

      Participants in the treatment arm will undergo a 3-month, locally tailored, group-based
      lifestyle intervention program (consisting of nutrition workshops, exercise sessions and
      goal-setting workshop) plus subsequent stepwise addition of metformin for selected
      participants at the highest risk of progression to diabetes at ≥ 6 months of follow-up.
      Financial incentives will be awarded to participants who achieve weight lost of ≥5% of
      baseline weight during follow-up period.

      The primary outcome of diabetes incidence will be assessed bi-annually and compared across
      the study arms. Secondary outcomes will include weight, waist circumference, fasting plasma
      glucose (FPG), 2-h glucose, HbA1c, physical activity, diet and metformin adherence.
