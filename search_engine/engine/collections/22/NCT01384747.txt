    
      Prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical study with enrollment of patients over at
      least 18 years of age who require coronary angiography for a clinical indication with
      hypertension defined as systolic blood pressure >140mmHg or diastolic blood pressure >90mmHg.
      Inclusion requires at least one deferred coronary lesion with 1) visually-estimated
      angiographic %diameter stenosis 20-50% or 2) %diameter stenosis >50% without any evidence of
      inducible ischemia. The target vessel for IVUS interrogation must not have undergone
      angioplasty (deferred lesion) nor have more than 50% luminal narrowing throughout a target
      segment. Patients meeting inclusion criteria without any exclusion criteria will be
      randomized 1:1 (Fimasartan 60-120 mg vs placebo). All subjects will be followed up at 1 year
      for serial VH-IVUS and conventional IVUS evaluation. Also, OCT sub-study will be performed in
      selected patients with lesions at least 20 mm distally located from coronary ostium. All
      patients will be blindly assigned to control and Fimasartan once daily as 1:1 ratio and are
      prescribed for 1year.
