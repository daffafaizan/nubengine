    
      This is a multicenter randomized controlled feasibility trial, in which 20 women with breast
      cancer scheduled for neoadjuvant 2 or 3 weekly AC-T(H) chemotherapy will be randomized into a
      combined aerobic and resistance exercise intervention group or a usual care (no exercise)
      control group, during the first 6 weeks (2 or 3 cycles) of chemotherapy. Patients from the
      control group will receive care as usual and are requested to maintain their usual daily
      physical activities. In order to limit contamination (increase of exercise in the control
      group), non-participation and prevent dropout, the control group will be offered the same
      6-week exercise intervention after the tumor biopsy has been taken after 6 weeks.
