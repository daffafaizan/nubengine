      involving rejection, irregular astigmatism, and wound dehiscence) to partial thickness
      transplantations of either the anterior or posterior (endothelial) layers. However this
      technique is not without its drawbacks. DSAEK uses a mechanical microkeratome to cut the
      graft, but vision is limited by the roughness of the cut surface.

      DSAEK can lead to significant refractive error due to the non-uniform shape of the
      microkeratome cut graft, and the roughness of the microkeratome cut surface limits vision to
      an average of 20/31. Optical coherence tomography (OCT)-guided laser shaping and smoothing
      may improve the refractive and visual outcome.
