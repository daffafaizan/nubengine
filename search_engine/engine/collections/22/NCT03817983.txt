      ankylosing spondylitis and non-radiological axial spondyloarthritis. The prevalence of SpA in
      the general population is estimated to be between 0.01%-2.5%. SpA patients have a high burden
      of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which primarily includes Crohn's disease (CD) and
      Ulcerative colitis (UC), with an estimated prevalence of 10%-12%. However, few studies have
      investigated the converse; the presence of IBD cases with undiagnosed SpA. Untreated SpA may
      lead to a significant impact on general health and quality of life; therefore early diagnosis
      and treatment is crucial. Most CD patients will have had a MRE assessment for their CD, which
      also captures the axial skeleton and can therefore be used to screen for evidence of axial
      SpA (axSpA). In this study, MRE images from consenting CD subjects will be reviewed for
      evidence of axSpA. CD patients with evidence of axSpA will then be reviewed in a rheumatology
      clinic to assess more specifically for SpA. This will include completion of patient reported
      outcome measures, clinical examination, routine blood tests, HLA-B27 genotyping and a
      dedicated axial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. The patients will also be consented to
      participate in the second part of the study which will be to compare these 'cases'
      statistically to a 'control' group of age- and sex-matched CD subjects without MRE evidence
      of axSpA.

      This study aims to: (i) determine the validity, sensitivity and specificity of MRE as a
      screening tool for axSpA in CD patients using dedicated axial MRI scans with clinical
      assessment as the gold standard; (ii) devise an algorithm of clinical indices that can be
      used as a screening tool for axSpA in CD cases.
