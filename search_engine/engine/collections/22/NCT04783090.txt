    
      This will be a single center, Phase 1, randomized, double-blind single-dose, sequential SAD
      study.

      This SAD study will consist of up to 5 cohorts (1 cohort per dose level). Each cohort will
      include 8 subjects (6 subjects receiving the active study drug and 2 subjects receiving
      matching placebo).

      A staggered dosing schedule will be used for each dose level administered under fasting
      conditions. Two (2) sentinel subjects (1 active and 1 placebo) will be dosed first (a minimum
      of 1 hour apart) and the remaining 6 subjects will be dosed no sooner than the next day (each
      dosed at least 15 minutes apart).

      Following completion of each dose level, a SRC will review the safety and tolerability data
      as well as the available PK data up to 48 hours in order to make decisions whether to
      escalate to the next dose level, decrease the next dose level, repeat a dose level, or to not
      evaluate any additional dose.
