      patients showed promising results.

      This study is done to confirm the findings from previous studies. Primary objective is to
      determine the overall response rate (complete response [CR] plus partial response [PR]);
      secondary objective of this study is to characterize and quantify the toxicity profile
      associated with clofarabine plus cytarabine treatment.

      A maximum of 35 patients will be treated on this study. They will receive 5 consecutive days
      of clofarabine intra venous infusion (IVI) followed 4 hours later by cytarabine IVI.Patients
      will receive up to a maximum of 4 cycles of study treatment. Next cycle will start
      approximately 4 weeks after Day 1 of previous cycle.No other investigational or commercial
      agents including chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy may be administered to patients
      enrolled in this study with the intention of treating the underlying malignancy

      Patients will remain on study, and be monitored until 4 months have elapsed from the
      beginning date of their last cycle of treatment.
