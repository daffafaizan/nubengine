      difficult to breathe. The most common cause is cigarette smoking, but breathing in other
      types of lung irritants, including pollution, dust, and chemicals, over a long period of time
      may also contribute to COPD. It is the fourth leading cause of death in the United States.
      Symptoms include coughing, excess mucus production, shortness of breath, wheezing, and chest
      tightness.

      Some bacterial infections may worsen COPD exacerbations. Current studies are examining if the
      macrolide antibiotic azithromycin may be beneficial at reducing the frequency and/or severity
      of COPD exacerbations. Azithromycin also has anti-inflammatory properties that may reduce the
      severity of COPD exacerbations by inhibiting the matrix metalloprotease (MMP)-catalyzed
      breakdown of collagen and the subsequent generation of proline-glycine-proline (PGP), a
      substance produced in response to collagen breakdown. An increase in PGP levels may indicate
      an increase in inflammation, which can worsen COPD symptoms. NHLBI's COPD Network Macrolide
      study includes people with COPD who were randomly assigned to receive either azithromycin or
      placebo for 1 year. For this current study, researchers will examine the Macrolide
      participants' previously collected blood samples, sputum samples, and study data, including
      information on COPD exacerbations and azithromycin effects. The purpose of this study is to
      examine the anti-inflammatory properties of azithromycin in people with COPD.
