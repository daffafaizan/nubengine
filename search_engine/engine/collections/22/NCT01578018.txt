      tissue, but also in BAL fluid from patients with benign lung disease. This suggests that
      DCAMKL1 expression might be induced by smoking or benign lung diseases. To examine this
      hypothesis, the investigators will compare DCAMLK1 expression in blood from patients with
      lung cancer to controls who are current or former smokers with benign lung disease.

      Previous work has showed that DCAMLK1 is not detectable in the blood of healthy non smoking
      individuals. To determine whether smoking and or pulmonary inflammation induce DCAMLK1
      expression, the investigators will obtain serum samples from 20 control patients with lung
      disease who are seen in the Chest Clinic at the Oklahoma City VAMC. Smoking histories will be
      obtained for all participants and DCAMLK1 levels will be correlated with smoking status.
