    
      Study Day 1

        -  Start 150 mEq Na+/day diet (POTS patients as inpatients; healthy control subjects with
           CRC provided outpatient diet); consume 1.5-2 liters of water per day

        -  Start a 24h urine collection (for Na+, K+, Cr, fractionated catecholamines)

        -  Blood work

      Study Days 2-5

        -  Continue 24h urine collection

        -  Start STUDY DIET (10 mEq Na+/day or 300 mEq Na+/day in a random order) after 3 meals of
           150 mEq Na+/day are complete; consume 1.5-2 liters of water per day

        -  On Day 5, a 24 hr Holter combined ECG monitor and BP monitor will be placed on the
           subjects.

      Study Day 6

        -  Continue STUDY DIET; consume 1.5-2 liters of water per day

        -  Remove 24h Holter combined ECG monitor and BP monitor from subject

        -  Continue 24h urine collection (for Na+, K+, Cr, fractionated catecholamines)

        -  Admit to CRC in afternoon (healthy control subjects only, as POTS patients will have
           already been admitted). Each subject will spend the night in the CRC and remain supine

        -  NPO after midnight for study next day

      Study Day 7

        -  Awaken early (~6am) to void (still collecting 24h urine)

        -  Patient returns to bed, IV catheter inserted

        -  Posture Study (in morning; between 7-8am ideally)

        -  Blood pressure and heart rate will be measured while supine and then while standing for
           up to 30 minutes

        -  We will draw blood in each body position to measure electrolytes and hormones that
           regulate blood pressure and blood volume

        -  Subjects will rate symptoms during supine period and at end of stand using Vanderbilt
           Orthostatic Symptoms Score (VOSS)

        -  Total Blood Volume (DAXOR)- using injection of iodinated I-131 tagged human serum
           albumin nominally 25 micro-Ci of radiation blood samples drawn through IV catheter
           before injection and for ~30 minutes post-injection (total - 25 ml)

        -  This will be done after supine assessment, but before standing the subject up

        -  Exercise Capacity Test (in the afternoon) Will estimate maximal oxygen consumption (VO2
           max) This test will be conducted on a stationary bicycle. Effort will be gradually
           increase while expired air is measured during exhaustive physical work.

      All procedures are repeated at least a month later with the 2nd level of dietary salt.
      (Randomized to high or low salt in the first phase, the second phase is the remaining level)
