    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, non-randomized clinical study designed to facilitate the
      collection and evaluation of radiographic parameters, pain and function, survival of the
      device,and adverse event data.

      The study will require each site to obtain IRB approval prior to study enrollment. All
      potential study subjects will be required to participate in the Informed Consent Process.

      All study subjects will undergo preoperative clinical evaluations prior to their cementless
      tibia total knee arthroplasty. An immediate postoperative radiograph will be required.
      Postoperative clinical follow-up and radiographic evaluations will be conducted at 6 weeks, 6
      months, 1 year, and 2 years.

      The primary endpoint of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the implant at
      2 years postoperatively using radiographic parameters. Radiographs will be assessed for the
      absence of progressive tibial radiolucencies, as defined in the radiographic protocol.

      The secondary endpoints of this study will evaluate the clinical performance of the implant
      at 2 years postoperatively, based upon:

        -  No revisions for any reason

        -  Oxford Knee Score >38
