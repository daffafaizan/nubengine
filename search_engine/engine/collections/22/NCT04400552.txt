    
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of perioperative oral
      nutrition supplementation (ONS) on nutritional status in malnourished cancer patients
      undergoing elective surgery.

      The specific objectives are:

        1. To evaluate the baseline nutritional status of cancer patients undergoing elective
           surgery

        2. To evaluate the effectiveness of pre-operative ONS feeding on nutritional status in
           malnourished surgical cancer patients

        3. To evaluate the effectiveness of an extended 3 months post-operative ONS feeding after
           discharge versus ONS feeding only post-operatively during hospital on nutritional status

        4. To evaluate secondary outcomes of perioperative feeding such as sleep quality,
           post-operative complications and length of hospital stay

      Study Design: This is a randomised-controlled-open label-parallel group(s)-trial which will
      be conducted on malnourished cancer patients undergoing elective surgery.

      Study duration: The participation duration for each participant is 4 months. The completion
      of the study will take around 30 months.
