      infertility seen at the University of Michigan Health System undergoing ovulation induction
      (OI) with letrozole as part of their standard clinical care. Patients who are undergoing OI
      with letrozole as per standard clinical care will be randomized to urinary luteinizing
      hormone (LH) ovulation predictor kit use versus mid-cycle ultrasound with administration of
      hCG when appropriate for timing of intercourse or intrauterine insemination. Patients who
      have been prescribed letrozole as per routine clinical care will be approached to determine
      willingness to participate in this study. Study period involves up to three ovulation
      induction cycles or until pregnancy occurs.
