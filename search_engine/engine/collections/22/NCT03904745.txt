      on several agents in the last two decades. Beta-adrenergic agonists and non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs have been shown to have no benefit on implantation rates. Vasopressin
      V1a and oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban was first studied on premature labor patients
      and found to be effective.

      Endometrium-originated oxytocin can possibly stimulate myometrium and have a negative impact
      on embryo implantation. Inhibition of oxytocin receptors has been shown to reduce uterine
      contraction frequency in non-pregnant women. Atosiban has been studied on assisted
      reproductive technologies in the last decade and has been shown to be effective on increasing
      implantation and clinical pregnancy rates. However, previous studies have used a 37,5 mg
      total dose of atosiban which was used both before and during embryo transfer. We aim to use a
      single and low dose of 6,75mg atosiban only before embryo transfer, which is simpler and
      cheaper and the medication given to patient is significantly lower. If we can demostrate the
      positive effect of our protocol, it can be suggested to be used routinely in all in vitro
      fertilization cycles. Additionally, our study is an original study in terms of being the
      first randomized clinical trial studying the effect of atosiban on frozen-thawed embryo
      transfer cycles.
