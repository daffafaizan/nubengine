      after the end of the study, were invited to participate in a program of physical activity to
      assess the effect of endurance and resistance training on weight and NAFLD score.
      Participants (100 subjects) were randomized and divided into two groups: the first followed a
      program of endurance activity consisting in a 30 minute walk, 5 times/week; the second
      followed a program combining the just described aerobic exercise with a resistance training
      based on 30 minute of musculation involving all the bigger muscles, 3 times/week. The trial
      lasted six months and subjects underwent liver ultrasonography (to assess NAFLD score),
      indirect calorimetry, bioimpedenziometry, the measurement of anthropometric variables (body
      height and weight) and biological parameters (glucose, insulin, cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
      triglycerides, GOT, GPT and GGT) at the baseline and at the third and the sixth month. The
      aim of the study was to estimate the effect of the two different programs of physical
      activity on NAFLD score. Secondary end-points included: the effect on basal metabolism, the
      modification of fat mass (FM), lean mass (LM) and muscle mass (MM) and on several biological
      markers associated with NAFLD.
