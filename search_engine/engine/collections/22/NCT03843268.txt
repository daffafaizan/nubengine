      crossover trial aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of AMPS Gondola therapy versus Sham
      Gondola therapy in PD subjects. 132 in/outpatients with PD will be recruited. Subjects will
      be randomized in 2 groups, one starting with AMPS treatment, the other with placebo
      treatment. At the end of the first cycle of 6 stimulations over a 3 weeks' time (AMPS or
      Sham), all subjects will undergo a washout period of minimum 6 weeks, then will undergo
      another equivalent treatment cycle (Sham or AMPS); a follow up valuation 14 days after the
      end of each treatment cycle will be performed.

      This project is aimed at studying and documenting the effects of the AMPS treatment given to
      PD patients via the Gondola device in:

        1. Improving gait, reducing bradykinesia, treating Freezing of Gait symptom;

        2. Improving UPDRS II and III scores;

        3. Improving balance. Another goal of the study is to document the safety of the Gondola
           device.
