      The 21 day cycle of treatment will be given for four courses before being reassessed by
      MRI/CT for resectability of their liver metastases.

      Those patients with stable disease or partial response, but are not yet resectable will
      continue for a further four courses of treatment before reassessment.

      Patients whose liver metastases have become resectable will proceed to surgery after a 6 week
      break from the last administration of Capecitabine (8 weeks from the last administration of
      Bevacizumab).

      A further four courses of treatment will be administered post-operatively to commence at
      least 8 weeks after surgery and when the patient is well recovered and healed.
