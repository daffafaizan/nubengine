      antimicrobial resistance, and reduce healthcare costs. However, the optimal strategies for
      the NICU population are unknown and few studies have evaluated the impact of stewardship in
      this population. To determine if 3 randomly assigned bundles of stewardship interventions
      would reduce overall and inappropriate antimicrobial use in the NICU. The investigators
      hypothesized that the bundle using all three interdisciplinary antimicrobial stewardship
      strategies (education, computer decision support and prescriber audit and feedback) would
      more effectively reduce overall and inappropriate antimicrobial use compared to usual care. A
      pre-post intervention study (one baseline year without interventions - May 1, 2009 - April
      30, 2010, followed by two years of interventions - May 1, 2010 - April 30, 2012) was
      performed in 4 academically affiliated, level III NICUs. The sites were randomly assigned to
      usual care, one intervention, two interventions, or three interventions.
