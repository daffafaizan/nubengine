      minute regulation of hormones of the neuroendocrine reproductive axis in normal young female
      volunteers. These studies will initially be performed at base line during isocaloric diet,
      where the stimulation of LH secretion by exogenous insulin will be tested during
      hyperinsulinemic eugylcemic clamp studies.

      The same studies will then be repeated after a period of one month of controlled hypercaloric
      diet, where volunteers will receive an excess of approximately 30% KCal compared to their
      calculated daily energy expenditure. it is anticipated that such hypercaloric nutrition will
      induce a significant decrease in normal insulin sensitivity of these volunteers. Thus, the
      effect of changing whole body insulin sensitivity on the fine regulation of neuroendocrine
      reproductive hormones will be evaluated.
