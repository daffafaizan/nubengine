      negative events and emotions. There is evidence to indicate that one aspect of this
      ruminative behavior lies in an abnormal increase in intra-regional connectivity among
      elements of the default mode network (DMN). It is also widely recognized that depression is
      associated with disturbances of cognition that include deficits in attentional processing,
      including both reductions in processing speed and deficits in selective attentional
      processing that are considered a part of executive function. Thus, there is at least equal
      reason to believe that attention and executive control networks might show changes in
      intra-regional functional connectivity. Given the attentional deficits associated with MDD,
      we hypothesize that there will be a weakening of intra-network resting state BOLD functional
      connectivity (rs-fcMRI) in addition to the strengthened connectivity reported by
      others.Further, we suggest that these shifts in intra-regional connectivity extend to the
      well-recognized anti-correlated activity between these two networks and support the intrusion
      of introspective, ruminative thought on cognitive activities that require externally directed
      attention. To test this hypothesis, we will use fMRI resting state functional connectivity to
      examine shifts in network connectivity prior to and following rTMS treatment for depression.
