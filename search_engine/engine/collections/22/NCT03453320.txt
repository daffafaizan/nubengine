      infusion rate is of interest.

      Plasma volume expansion is measured using hemoglobin as a marker and fluid recruitment of
      tissue fluid is measured as a combination of plasma volume expansion and urinary output.

      Healthy individuals are asked to refrain from eating and drinking the night before the study.
      Two hours before study start, the subjects may take a sandwich and a glas to drink.

      After 15 minutes of rest baseline blood samples are taken. Subjects are randomised to receive
      two rates of albumin solution (Albumin 20%) 3 ml/kg bodyweight at two separate occasions.
      Once with an infusion time of 30 minutes, once with an infusion time of 120 minutes. Between
      the two infusions there will be an interval of 3 to 20 weeks. Randomization is performed to
      chose which rate the subjects start with. 6 in each Group (total 12).

      During each occasion15 blood samples are collected, during a 6 hour period. Hemoglobin,
      plasma Sodium, colloid osmotic pressure and albumin are analysed. The total volume of blood
      collected will be 170 ml at each occasion when an albumin infusion is given.

      Urinary output is measured and Urinary Sodium content is measured. Liberal fluid intake is
      recommended the same day and the next.
