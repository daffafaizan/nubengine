    
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial, using Percutaneous Electrical
      Nerve Stimulation (PENS). PENS is technique to provide a transcutaneous electrical nerve
      stimulation current throughout needling filaments place close to the nerve.

      Study Aims:

      Aim #1: The primary aim of the study is to compare the effect of the immediate, short, medium
      and long-term of PENS on intensity of pain as measured by visual analogue scale (VAS) in
      patients with lateral epicondylalgia with random assignment to two treatments: PENS plus
      exercise program or Sham PENS plus exercise program.

      Aim #2: The secondary aim of the study is to compare the effect of the immediate, short,
      medium and long-term of PENS on pain free grip strength, disability as measured by Patient
      Rated Tennis Elbow Evaluation (PRTEE) and DASH questionnaire and pressure pain threshold
      (PPT) and area and distribution of pain in patients with lateral epicondylalgia with random
      assignment to two treatments: PENS plus exercise program or Sham PENS plus exercise program,
      and determine if psychological factors (fear and avoidance and catastrophism) change with any
      of the treatments and if is related with the primary and secondary outcomes.
