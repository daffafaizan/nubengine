      Bupivacaine in shoulder surgeries. We will use already randomized patients for our
      randomization process. For this study in particular we will use an ultrasound machine to scan
      the diaphragm of any patient who had an Interscalene Block for Total Shoulder Arthroplasy or
      Rotator Cuff Repair. Patients are to be scanned in an upright sitting position and scanned
      from a low intercostal or subcostal approach using the liver or spleen as an acoustic window.
      M Mode will be applied and the range of diaphragmatic movement from the resting expiratory
      position to deep inspiration (sigh test) will be recorded as was the range of diaphragmatic
      movement from resting expiratory position when quickly inspiring through the nose (sniff
      test). The blocks will be done regardless of the study as they are standard of care for pain
      control. The only intervention is ultrasound examination of the patient's diaphragm at
      baseline, 3 hours post block in recovery room and on post-operative day 1, and basic
      spirometry to record FEV1 and FVC via a portable spirometer at the same time points. If
      patients did stay in hospital on postoperative day 2 we would also evaluate their diaphragm
      function.
