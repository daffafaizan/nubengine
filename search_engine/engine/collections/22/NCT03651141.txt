      restrictions due to fascial adhesions. The sciatic nerve can produce symptoms of pain,
      decreased range of motion, and increased resting muscle tone when it is overstretched. The
      nerve can be overstretched after a hamstring injury and cause adhesions on the nerve and
      abnormal mechanosensitivity leading to perceived hamstring tightness.The purpose of this
      study is to investigate the effects of myofascial decompression (cupping) and neurodynamic
      sliding technique for the hamstring on Division I Track and Field athletes who complain of
      hamstring tightness. Research questions will be: how do these techniques affect hamstring
      range of motion and flexibility; isometric strength of the hamstring muscle; muscle
      activation; and rate of force development. The hypotheses of this study are that neurodynamic
      sliding will have an effect on all variables and myofascial decompression will only have an
      effect on range of motion.
