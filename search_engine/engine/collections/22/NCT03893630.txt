      recruited, women will be randomly assigned to either 81 mg or 162 mg per day dosing
      schedules. The randomization scheme will vary based on the body mass index (BMI) with
      separate schemes for women <=30 kg/m2 versus >30 kg/m2. Ultrasonographic assessment of
      biophysical biomarkers will be obtained at 11-16 weeks, 18-22 weeks, and 28-32 weeks
      gestation. Biologic samples of serum and urine will be obtained at the 11-16 week and 28-32
      week visit. Upon delivery, cord blood and a placental specimen will also be obtained.
      Medication treatment will continue until 36 weeks gestation. Pregnancy and neonatal outcome
      data will be recorded.
