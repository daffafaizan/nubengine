      (HPV). They are very common and can affect many different sites including the face, hands,
      feet and genitalia. Although the present therapeutic approaches are more or less effective in
      eradicating the lesions, scars and relapses are very common. Furthermore, at times the
      anatomical location and depth of lesions often make the treatment difficult, time-consuming
      and painful. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new modalities for wart treatment.

      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been developed as a promising new cancer treatment modality,
      which involves the uptakes of a photosensitizer by tumor cells, followed by the activation of
      photosensitizer with approximate wavelength of light. The endogenous conversion of
      5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) to protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) has broadened the use of PDT. The
      mechanisms of the PDT-induced cytotoxic effect relate to singlet oxygen and other reactive
      oxygen intermediates generated by PDT, which give rise to cellular stress and cause cell
      death. Previously, using the homemade LED light source, we have shown that topical ALA-PDT is
      effective for the treatment of warts. However, the excruciating pain induced by ALA and red
      LED could be due to deeper penetration of the ALA formulation or the deeper penetration of
      red light. Thus the pain might be related to the injured nerve fibers underlying the skin.
      This study is to provide evidence of these two green or red LED efficacy in removing the
      warts and also their side-effect of pain.
