    
      Lyzme5 is a nutritional supplement, according to the Dietary Supplement Health and Education
      Act (DSHEA) of 1994. It is composed of B Vitamins along with a non-essential amino acid. The
      individual components of this supplement are individually Generally Recognized as Safe (have
      GRAS status). The manufacturer's objective was to create a nutritional supplement that would
      have the potential to positively impact body weight, and possibly one or more lipid value
      (i.e., total cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides)as well, in overweight individuals who may also
      have minimally elevated cholesterol levels.

      This observational clinical study will seek to recruit 100 volunteers in order to observe
      whether or not the weight-loss potential of Lyzme5, previously observed earlier in three
      volunteers, can be duplicated within a larger group.

      The second objective is to establish whether or not Lyzme5 can positively impact cholesterol
      levels in man.
