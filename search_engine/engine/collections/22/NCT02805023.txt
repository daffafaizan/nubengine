    
      BGC101 is designed to treat peripheral vascular disease in patients suffering from Critical
      Leg Ischemia (CLI) also referred to as chronic limb threatening ischemia (CLTI).

      This part of the study is designed as a placebo double-blind randomized controlled trial
      (CRT) assessing the safety and efficacy of BGC101 in 45 eligible subjects in 2 Arms: Arm A:
      BGC101 treatment and Arm B: Placebo treatment. The Arm A:Arm B ratio is 2:1 A single dose
      treatment of the personalized cells by intramuscular injections into the affected leg takes
      less than 10 minutes.

      Cells from a standard blood draw (with no pre-treatment, bone marrow aspiration, mobilization
      or apheresis) are transformed, within a day, into the investigational medicinal product
      BGC101.

      BGC101, intended for autologous use, is a 'ready-to-use' cell suspension in prefilled
      syringes.
