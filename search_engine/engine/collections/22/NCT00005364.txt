      The study used two well defined African populations from Nigeria to determine the
      contribution of 14 polymorphic genes involved in lipid metabolism in determining quantitative
      lipoprotein-lipid and apolipoprotein levels as these are major risk factors for coronary
      heart disease. The study also investigated how differences in life styles and dietary habits
      modulate the genetic contribution of these quantitative risk factors. Phenotypes in the gene
      products of APOs A-IV, C-II, D, H, J and (a) were determined by IEF and SDS/immunoblotting.
      Genotypes at the B,E, AI-CIII- AIV cluster, lipoprotein lipase, hepatic lipase, LDL-receptor,
      and cholesterol ester transfer protein were determined by polymerase chain reaction
      protocols. The quantitative levels of total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and its
      subfractions, HDL2- and HDL3-cholesterol, triglycerides and LP(a) were used in the genetic
      analyses. Estimates of the effect of alleles at each of the candidate loci on quantitative
      lipoprotein-lipid levels employed the measured genotype approach. The effect of multisite
      haplotypes for RFLP at various loci, where applicable, was also estimated using the same
      method. The interaction of alleles at various independent loci in determining quantitative
      lipoprotein-lipid and apolipoprotein levels was estimated. In addition to the measurements of
      environmental effects, measurements were also made of the genotype-environmental interaction
      in determining quantitative risk factor traits.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
