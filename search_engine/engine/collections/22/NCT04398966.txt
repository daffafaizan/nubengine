      small population of 30 subjects with benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) to investigate the
      effectiveness of prostatic artery embolization (PAE) relative to previous medication alone
      for reducing urinary symptoms due to BPH. Secondary aims will be to assess adverse effects of
      medication vs adverse events secondary to PAE as well as Quality of Life scores on medication
      vs after PAE.
