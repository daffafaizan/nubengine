      requirement and more days of hospitalization. If antenatal corticosteroid therapy is
      necessary for fetal lung maturation after 34 weeks, it remains to be established. The
      systematic review with metanalysis in Cochrane Library includes a small number of late
      preterm babies and no conclusion about effectiveness of corticoid therapy in this setting
      could be drawn. Our hypothesis is that antenatal corticosteroid therapy is effective to
      prevent respiratory disease and morbidity in late preterm babies and this study will be
      carried out to evaluate this question.
