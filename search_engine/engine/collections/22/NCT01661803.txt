      investigators compared the safety, efficacy and quality of using intrathecal hyperbaric
      bupivacaine 0.5% and hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% with clonidine 1µg/kg in paediatric patients
      undergoing surgeries below T8 dermatome.

      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade I patients aged between 3-10 years were
      scheduled for the surgeries below T8 dermatome up to two hrs duration. The patients were
      randomly allocated in - Group A-who received 0.5%of hyperbaric Bupivacaine 0.4mg/kg for 5
      to15 kg or 0.3 mg/kg for more than 15 kg intrathecally.

      Group B-who received 0.5%of hyperbaric Bupivacaine 0.4mg/kg for 5 to15 kg or 0.3 mg/kg for
      more than 15 kg and 1µg/kg preservative free clonidine intrathecally.

      The patients studied across the group did not vary much with respect to age, weight and sex
      distribution.
