      nervosa (AN). Research on the treatment of AN has lagged that of other conditions, even other
      eating disorders such as bulimia nervosa. The focus of this study is on adolescent AN.
      Successful early treatment is likely to reduce the prevalence of chronic AN with its high
      rates of morbidity and mortality and high health care costs. The most promising treatment for
      adolescent AN is a specific form of family therapy called behavioral family therapy (BFT).
      This treatment is focused on the disordered eating behavior that characterizes AN and enables
      parents to refeed their child. Although there have been several small scale studies of BFT
      there has been no controlled comparison with another form of family therapy. Therefore we
      propose to use systems family therapy (SFT) which has been developed to represent the type of
      family therapy practiced in the community.

      One hundred and sixty adolescents of both genders aged 12-18 years meeting DSM-IV criteria
      for anorexia nervosa will be entered to the study. Recruitment is projected to extend for 2
      years. Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the two types of family therapy.
      Family therapy will be given for 36-weeks. For the purpose of the present study, patients
      will be followed for 12-months after the end of family treatment. Hence, each family will
      participate for approximately 2-years, with a total participation time of some 40-hours. In a
      sub-study blood will be drawn from those volunteering for genetic analysis focusing on the
      subset of non-responders to treatments.
