      of 12 participants (9 treatments, 3 placebos) in the morning of Day 15 under fasted
      conditions. The first cohort will receive a 0.1 mg dose. Cohorts will continue to be enrolled
      at the next higher dose level until the highest dose level (3 mg) has been achieved or until
      the study is discontinued due to adverse events or Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Score of >8. A
      0.03 mg dose will also be tested. A 0.01 mg dose will be tested if 4 or more subjects
      experience 1 or more bowel movements within the 24 hour period post dose in the 0.03 mg
      dosing cohort.
