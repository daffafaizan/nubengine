    
      Cohort 1 (n=10, weight > 40kg and age > 18 years and ≤ 45 years ) will undergo intense
      PK-sampling to determine exposures following TOFA dosed at 5 mg BID. TOFA dose escalation
      will not be considered for inadequate response of SLE-CL.

      Cohort 2 (n=10, weight > 40kg and age > 18 years and ≤ 45 years) will be treated with the
      same dose as Cohort 1. No PK sampling will occur for Cohort 2. Enrollment of Cohort 2 will
      only start once Cohort 1 has completed 8 weeks of TOFA and results of PK analyses from Cohort
      1 are available.

        -  Part A (up to week 8) requires stable background medications;

        -  Part B (up to week 24) allows for tapering of corticosteroids (CS) in the setting of
           significant clinical improvement of SLE-CL as defined by a decrease in Cutaneous Lupus
           Erythematosus Disease Area and Severity Index (CLASI) activity score by >50% from
           baseline , and

        -  Part C (until week 76) permits tapering of other background medications in subjects with
           clinical remission of SLE-CL (CLASI activity score=0). TOFA dosing is kept stable during
           Part C.
