      patients with suicidal ideation/attempt prefer to interact with/receive support from peers
      with life experiences of suicide or clinical professionals who might have such life
      experiences or not? (2) Will patients with suicidal ideation/attempt accept a peer-delivered
      safety planning intervention as opposed to one delivered by clinical personnel? (3) Are
      peer-delivered safety plans of equal quality as those delivered by clinical personnel?
