    
      This is a pilot study to describe the immunological responses and clinical outcome associated
      with administration of recombinant human Granulocyte Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor
      (GM-CSF) as surgical adjuvant therapy in patients with malignant melanoma who are at high
      risk for recurrence (Stage II T4, III and IV). The immunological responses include serum
      neopterin levels. In a sub-set of study participants, additional immunologic testing will be
      done, including monocyte cytotoxicity to a melanoma cell line and phenotypic and functional
      markers of dendritic and T cell activation in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The
      clinical end points of the study include safety, time to disease recurrence, time to
      disseminated disease, and survival. Eligible patients are those with high-risk melanoma who
      are clinically tumor free following surgery. Treatment will consist of GM-CSF at 125 g/m2
      once daily (maximum dose 250 g) for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest (28 day cycle) for 1
      year. Clinical status will be monitored until death or until the patient has been tumor free
      for five years, whichever event occurs first. Immunologic responses will be determined
      pretreatment, at the end of the first 14 days of dosing (Day 15), after the 14-day rest
      period (Day 29) and at the end of 14 days of dosing in cycles 6 (Day 155) and 13 (Day 351).
      Clinical outcome will be determined according to patient risk group (ultra-high risk Stage
      IIIC or IV versus high-risk Stage II T4, Stage IIIA and Stage IIIB). The pilot study will
      also assess the association of the immunological responses with clinical response and safety
      by patient risk group.
