      psychological trauma due to maternal deprivation. Midazolam and ketamine are commonly used
      for this purpose. Dexmedetomidine is an alpha 2 -agonist with a more selective action on the
      alpha 2 adrenoreceptor when administered via the nasal mucosa bioavailability of
      dexmedetomidine is too high. Intranasal route is an effective way to administer premedication
      and sedation to children. The oculocardiac reflex is a major complication of pediatric
      strabismus surgery.
