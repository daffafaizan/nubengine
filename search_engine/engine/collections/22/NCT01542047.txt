      inhibitor. Activity against multiple tumors such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and
      neuroendocrine tumors have been documented, and it recently gained FDA approval for the
      treatment of metastatic kidney cancer. Also, an impressive activity as a single agent was
      recently reported in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the neoadjuvant setting, where
      tumor shrinkage occurred in 86% of patients. Encouraging activity has also been seen in
      cervical cancer, ovarian cancer and soft tissue sarcomas. Multi-kinase targeting is an
      approach that may prove beneficial in a number of patient populations. In particular cancers
      such as breast, colon, pancreas etc., patients represent heterogeneous population of small
      groups based on genetic analyses. Some of these populations may benefit when multiple agents
      are given which have similar, but distinct targets of action. Dosages and therefore
      associated toxicities might be reduced by such an approach.
