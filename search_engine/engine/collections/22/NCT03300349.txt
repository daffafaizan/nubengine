      lymphadenectomy in patients with breast cancer in four Spanish hospitals, to determine the
      degree of compliance of these programs and to register the frecuency of lymphedema and
      limitation of mobility of the upper limb in breast cancer patients undergoing axillary
      lymphadenectomy between 2014 and 2016 in the four hospitals.
