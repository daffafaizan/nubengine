      disease and will consist of 2 parts. Part 1 will include 2 sentinel patients with a single
      dosing period followed by a 13-day multiple dosing period. Part 2 will include the 6
      remaining patients with multiple dosing only. This Phase 1b study will investigate the PK,
      safety, preliminary effects of the gut microbiome, and inflammatory biomarkers of EB8018
      following 13 days of consecutive BID oral dosing in patients with Crohn's disease.

      Part 1 of this study will demonstrate a single oral dose of EB8018 that is safe and tolerable
      in patients with Crohn's disease and Part 2 of this study will characterize the PK profile
      when administered as multiple oral doses.
