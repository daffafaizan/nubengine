      nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (electronic
      cigarettes, ENDS). Whether the woman samples NRT or ENDS first will be randomized. Women will
      choose the product they wish to try for a 6-week intervention period for smoking cessation.
      Women choosing NRT will receive a 6-week intervention of a daily nicotine patch plus either
      nicotine gum or lozenges to use (as needed) throughout the day. The ENDS group will receive
      an electronic cigarette device with refills to last the 6-week duration of the study. Both
      groups will receive identical tobacco cessation counseling. As part of the study, each
      subject will complete a survey conducted at baseline, 6-weeks into the study during
      intervention, and upon completion of a 6 week follow-up period in which participants receive
      no intervention. At the 12-week measurement period we will add a qualitative interview that
      will allow us to ask the women whether the methods were acceptable, caused any problems, and
      if so, what the problems entailed.
