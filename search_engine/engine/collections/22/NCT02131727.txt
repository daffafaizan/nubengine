      improve hand hygiene, consisting of a 3-4 minute training video, on-site posters, and hand
      hygiene supplies, can reduce respiratory and GI illness among those in the intervention group
      compared to the control group. The intervention was performed among employees in a Midwestern
      public government setting. Employees in the treatment group received a 3-4 minute training
      video online that was embedded in the baseline survey. Motivational posters from the USDHHS
      encouraging proper hand hygiene were installed in the workplace, along with hand hygiene
      supplies. The control group received a program called "Ask Me 3" developed by the National
      Patient Safety Foundation; the intervention consisted of a 3-4 minute training video to
      encourage clear communication with their health care providers, a brochure discussing the Ask
      Me 3 principles of clear communication with health care providers, and a key-ring with the
      Ask Me 3 communication principles to promote more effective communication with health care
      providers at visits out side of work. The groups were followed monthly through surveys over
      the Internet for an average of three months after baseline to determine if a relative
      reduction in self-reported respiratory / GI infections occurred in the intervention group
      compared to the control group.
