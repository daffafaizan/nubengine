      Asthma is one of the most common chronic diseases of adults, affecting 6% of the U.S. adult
      population and accounting for substantial morbidity and mortality. Despite the availability
      of effective therapy for asthma, morbidity and mortality have increased over the last several
      decades. Asthma specialty care, case management, and patient education are means for
      improving the quality of asthma care and patient outcomes, but cost and inconvenience limit
      the degree to which these are used in asthma care nationally. The principal aim of this study
      is to evaluate the impact of an inexpensive telephone-based home education and disease
      monitoring system on asthma medication adherence and clinical outcomes in adult patients with
      asthma.

      Objective(s):

      We hypothesize that application of TLC to the care of adult patients with asthma will improve
      self-management by enhancing compliance with preventive medication regimens and fostering the
      use of peak flow-based action plans. This, in turn, will improve asthma control, thus
      reducing acute health care utilization and improving quality of life (QOL).

      Methods:

      A randomized controlled trial will be conducted with adult asthma patients identified from
      the VA Boston Healthcare System comprised of the Boston, West Roxbury, and Brockton VA
      Medical Centers and their associated satellite clinics. Patients will be randomized to either
      the TLC-Asthma group or an attention placebo control group. Outcome measurements will include
      medication adherence, QOL, utilization of urgent care services, oral corticosteroid use.
