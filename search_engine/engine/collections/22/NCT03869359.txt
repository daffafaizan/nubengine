      The aim is to assess the effects of gluten-free diet (GFD) compared to gluten-containing diet
      (GCD) in IBS patients and Healthy Volunteers on gastrointestinal symptoms, visceral
      sensitivity, bacterial fermentation, psychological factors and quality of life. The primary
      hypothesis is that GFD decreases gastrointestinal symptoms compared to GCD and that this
      change is accompanied with reduced visceral sensitivity and change in bacterial fermentation.
      The secondary hypothesis is that GFD positively influences psychological factors and quality
      of life.

      IBS patients (Rome IV) and Healthy Volunteers are challenged with gluten in this randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. They start with GFD or GCD and cross over
      to the other intervention (both for 14 days). In between there is a wash-out period of at
      least 14 days. The subjects will get gluten-free meals (lunch and dinner) and have to
      sprinkle powder over the meals, concealed in sachets with either gluten (vital gluten) or
      placebo (rice starch). The subjects will follow a strict GFD during the GFD and GCD periods.
      The subjects will eat and drink as before the study during the washout period.

      Primary outcomes are change in gastrointestinal symptoms, assessed by questionnaires,
      including IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) and Gastrointestinal Symtom Rating Scale-IBS
      (GSRS-IBS). A 50-point reduction in IBS-SSS indicates clinical response. Bacterial
      fermentation (exhaled hydrogen and methane) and visceral sensitivity will be measured using
      the Lactulose-Nutrient Challenge Test. Secondary outcomes are change in psychological factors
      and quality of life assessed by questionnaires, including CSI, HADS, HSPS, IBSQOL, PHQ-15 and
      VSI.
