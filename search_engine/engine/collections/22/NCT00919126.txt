      ago. Several preclinical studies and investigations using xenon as an inhalational
      anaesthetic in humans were performed and reported that this gas has many properties of the
      ideal anaesthetic agent. Moreover, it is known that when xenon is combined with volatile
      anaesthetics or opioids, the required doses of those substances are reduced, resulting in a
      lower incidence of side effects. Patients could benefit from the administration of xenon if
      this inspired concentration would result in reduced doses of co-administered drugs.

      This trial should allow evaluating the propofol consumption required in combination with
      xenon administered in inspiratory concentrations of 50% and 70% to maintain comparable depth
      of general anaesthesia as total i.v. anaesthesia, in ASA III patients presenting increased
      risk of perioperative cardiac complications and undergoing laparotomy or orthopaedic surgery.
