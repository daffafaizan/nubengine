      depression associated with cancer diagnosis showed significant improvement in study endpoints
      reflecting psychological distress, as compared to placebo. The effects of a single psilocybin
      therapy session endured for up to six months with no specific follow-up care. In this study,
      we aim to explore the safety and efficacy of psilocybin therapy in cancer patients, diagnosed
      with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).
