      end of the clearance period, subjects free from malaria parasitaemia were randomized and
      received a loading dose of the study treatment (tafenoquine 200 mg, Mefloquine 250 mg or
      placebo) for tree days, followed by study treatment (tafenoquine 200 mg, mefloquine 250 mg or
      placebo, respectively) once a week for 24 weeks. After the treatment period subjects attended
      weekly follow-up safety visits until week 28.
