      treatment of unresectable, locally advanced head and neck cancer, total of 60 patients with
      above condition will be randomly assigned to two groups: the experiment group (EG) and the
      control group (CG). The EG received multi-point injections of rAd-p53 into tumor on day 1, 8
      and 15 at a dose of 2 Ã— 10^12 viral particles (VP) in a 21-days cycle. Both EG and CG were
      given radiotherapy at a total dose of 60 Gy and chemotherapy (Cisplatin 100 mg/m2 IV on days
      1 plus paclitaxel 30 mg/m2 IV on day 1, 8 and 15). The patients will be treated until disease
      progression, withdrawal from study, or untolerated adverse events. study endpoints are
      efficacy (Progression-free survival, overall survival) and safety variables.
