    
      This is a 3-arm parallel group prospective randomized active-treatment clinical study. A
      total of 75 patients with renal calculi 10-30 mm in maximal diameter measured in abdominal CT
      scan will be recruited in this research protocol. Patient enrollment will be performed from
      patients referred to Urolithiasis Unit of the 1st Urology Department, G. Gennimatas Hospital,
      Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. In all potentially eligible patients full medical
      history, as well as demographic characteristics and drug treatment will be recorded, followed
      by a detailed physical examination and standard laboratory tests.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to receive one of the following endourological
      techniques of nephrolithotripsy: standard PCNL, mini- PCNL or RIRS. All eligible patients
      will be randomised to one of the 3 groups, consisting of 25 patients, with an equal
      allocation ratio (1:1). The randomization sequence will be computer generated by the study
      coordinating team.

      The primary and secondary measurements of the study will be carried in prespecified
      time-points that are listed below:

      Point 0(P0): Screening visit:

      Potentially eligible patients will be asked to provide written informed consent. We will
      record full medical history, concomitant medication, clinical examination, demographic
      characteristics, body weight, height, body mass index (BMI).

      Point 1(P1): 1st day of hospitalization (Monday or Thursday):

      Admission of the patient to the hospital where a routine preoperative control is conducted
      including: routine hematological and biochemical laboratory parameters (Hct, Hb, WBC, PLT,
      fasting glucose, urea, creatinine, serum electrolytes, SGOT, SGPT), chest X-ray and
      anesthesiological preoperative evaluation. Patient is randomized to be treated with one of
      the 3 endourological operations.

      Point 2(P2): Operation day (Tuesday or Friday), 2 hours before the operation:

      Urine sample is collected for measurement of urine biomarkers (NGAL, KIM-1, IL-18) and
      creatinine (baseline values). Blood sample is collected for creatinine measurement and eGFR
      is calculated.

      Point 3(P3): Operation (PCNL, mini-PCNL or RIRS):

      Operation, fluoroscopy time and intraoperative complications are recorded

      Point 4(P4): 2 hours after the operation:

      Urine sample is collected for measurement of urine biomarkers (NGAL, KIM-1, IL-18) and
      creatinine. Blood sample is collected for creatinine measurement and eGFR is calculated. A
      VAS pain score is completed. Urine output is measured. Postoperative complications are
      recorded.

      Point 5(P5): 6 hours after the operation:

      Urine sample is collected for measurement of urine biomarkers (NGAL, KIM-1, IL-18) and
      creatinine. Blood sample is collected for creatinine measurement and eGFR is calculated. A
      VAS pain score is completed. Urine output is measured. Postoperative complications are
      recorded.

      Point 6(P6): 24 hours after the operation:

      Urine sample is collected for measurement of urine biomarkers (NGAL, KIM-1, IL-18) and
      creatinine. Blood sample is collected for creatinine measurement and eGFR is calculated. A
      VAS pain score is completed. Urine output is measured. Postoperative complications are
      recorded.

      Point 7(P7): 48 hours after the operation:

      Urine sample is collected for measurement of urine biomarkers (NGAL, KIM-1, IL-18) and
      creatinine. Blood sample is collected for creatinine measurement and eGFR is calculated. A
      VAS pain score is completed. Urine output is measured. Potential postoperative complications
      are recorded.

      Point 8(P8): 1 month after the operation:

      CT scan is conducted for confirmation of treatment success and stone free status or not.
      Blood sample is collected for creatinine measurement and eGFR is calculated. Potential
      postoperative complications are recorded.

      Point9(P9): 3 months after the operation:

      Blood sample is collected for creatinine measurement and eGFR is calculated. Potential
      postoperative complications are recorded.
