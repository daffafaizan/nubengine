      The main aim of this study is to validate the HPV-Risk assay (Self-screen, The Netherlands)
      followed by multiplex methylation specific quantitative PCR (qMSP, VU University Medical
      Center, The Netherlands) on first-void urine (Colli-Pee Small Volumes (10 mL) device,
      Novosanis, Belgium) of HPV positive women for detection of clinically relevant precursor
      lesions by sampling a cohort of women referred for colposcopy. The number of women in this
      cohort will allow us to clinically validate the use of the HPV-Risk/qMSP assay in DNA
      extracts of first-void samples after optimization of sample volume, internal process control,
      and DNA extraction method (Centre for the Evaluation of Vaccination, University of Antwerp,
      Belgium).
