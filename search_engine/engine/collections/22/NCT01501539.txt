      placement. This study aims to determine if using a foam dressing upon placement will prevent
      its formation, as it has been demonstrated as an effective treatment in healing
      hypergranulation tissue formation post-operatively. Study participants will be randomized
      into one of three treatments after gastronomy tube placement (1) standard care, (2) plain
      foam treatment or (3) silver foam dressing. These treatments will be applied for 30 days
      post-operatively in addition to standard care of cleaning the gastronomy site daily with soap
      and water, if assigned to foam intervention. All study materials are free for duration of 30
      day intervention and participation will not interfere with routine post-operative care of
      gastronomy tube site. The total duration of trial will be 6 months and will not require
      additional study visits outside of routine care. The rate of G-tube dislodgements and
      associated outcomes will also be measured during the trial.
