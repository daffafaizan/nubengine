    
      A total of 216 patients with baseline PET scan were randomized to one of 2 induction
      chemotherapy arms: paclitaxel/cisplatin (TP) on days 1, 22 or FOLFOX (oxaliplatin,
      leucovorin, 5-FU) on days 1, 15, 29. Repeat PET was performed on days 36-42 and changes in
      max standardized uptake value (SUVmax) from baseline were assessed. Using a predefined
      cut-off value of a 35% decrease in SUVmax, PET responders (â‰¥35% decrease in SUVmax) continued
      on the same chemotherapy regimen during radiotherapy, whereas PET non-responders (<35%
      decrease in SUVmax) crossed over to an alternative chemotherapy regimen concomitantly with
      radiation. All patients received external-beam radiation using intensity-modulated
      radiotherapy. The prescribed dose is generally 50-60 Gy in 25-28 fractions, 5 days per week.
