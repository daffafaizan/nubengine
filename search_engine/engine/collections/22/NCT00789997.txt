      Currently this conventional therapy has significant side effects including osteoporosis,
      cataracts,and suppression of the immune system. Studies have suggested that up to 24% of
      inpatients and 27% of outpatients fail this treatment by 4 weeks. During an acute
      exacerbation of COPD, the inflammatory process increases. Studies have shown the TNF-alpha
      cytokines appears to play a major role. Etanercept is a TNF alpha inhibitor. It inactivates
      TNF alpha cytokines by blocking their interaction with their cellular receptors. This study
      will compare the treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD with: 1) Levofloxacin 750 mg daily
      for 10 days + prednisone 40 mg daily for 10 days, or 2) Levofloxacin 750 mg daily for 10 days
      + etanercept 50 mg subcutaneous given on the day of randomization and one week later.
      Patients randomized to group 1 (the control group) will receive placebo subcutaneous
      injections, and patients randomized to group 2 (the experimental group) will receive placebo
      prednisone capsules.
