      BioMonitor) with remote monitoring function (Home MonitoringÂ®). If the device detects and
      reports an arrhythmia, patients will be appropriately examined and treated. Patients
      randomized to the control arm will receive best proven treatment, but no implantable cardiac
      monitor.
