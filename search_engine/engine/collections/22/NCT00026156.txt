        -  Determine the survival of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer who are
           either age 70 and over or who have performance status 2, when treated with sequential
           vinorelbine and docetaxel. (Age 70 and older with Zubrod 0-1 stratum closed to accrual
           as of 2/15/2003.)

        -  Determine the objective tumor response rates, including confirmed and unconfirmed and
           complete and partial, in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the dose delivered and the reported functional symptom status of patients treated
           with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the feasibility of performing pharmacokinetic studies and obtaining
           pharmacokinetic data on these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age and
      performance status (age 70 and over with Zubrod 0-1 vs age 18 and over with Zubrod 2). (Age
      70 and older with Zubrod 0-1 stratum closed to accrual as of 2/15/2003.)

      Patients receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Beginning 2 weeks after the last
      dose of vinorelbine, patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the beginning of courses 2-6, and at week 22.

      Patients are followed at week 22, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 95 patients (55 patients age 70 and over with Zubrod 0-1 and
      40 patients age 18 and over with Zubrod 2) will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months. (Age 70 and older with Zubrod 0-1 stratum closed to accrual as of 2/15/2003.)
