      myoelectric upper limb orthosis and (2) to evaluate the functional effects of a myoelectric
      upper limb orthosis. The investigators plan to recruit 15 Veterans and non-veterans who have
      Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and upper limb impairment, are over 18 years of age and a
      minimum of 6 months from injury. The study requires 29 visits over 22 weeks and is divided
      into four parts: enrollment, orthotic fitting, therapy/training (9 weeks), and home use (9
      weeks). Therapeutic and functional benefits will be evaluated every 2 to 3 weeks over 18
      weeks using simple, short clinical tests.

      Subjects will be enrolled in the study if they meet eligibility criteria assessed at a
      screening visit. Once enrolled subjects will be custom fit with a MyoPro Motion-G
      elbow-wrist-hand orthosis following standard clinical procedures. This process requires up to
      three visits to cast, trial fit and deliver the orthosis. Subjects will then participate in a
      standard-of-care motor learning based therapy protocol in conjunction with the PERL ("Push
      Eat Reach Lift") training program recommended by Myomo, which consists of a 9 week, 18
      session training plan. Every second week, there will be one session that will combine
      therapy/training and outcomes evaluation.

      Once subjects have completed the therapy/training phase and demonstrated competency with
      orthosis use, they will start a 9 week home use program during which time they will be
      contacted by the therapist and seen as needed in the clinic to trouble-shoot any technical
      issues, monitor for adverse events and/or upgrade their home program. Every third week there
      will be one session at the clinic for outcomes evaluation.
