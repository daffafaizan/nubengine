      Health and Science University and Planned Parenthood of the Columbia Willamette. Women will
      be approached about this study after they have made a decision to terminate the pregnancy.
      The women will be blinded and randomized into one of two study arms.

      Group 1: the investigator will apply pressure with the capped needle of the paracervical
      block at the cervical-vaginal reflexion at 4 and 8 o'clock. This will approximate the steps
      involved in a paracervical block without injecting the patient. Following this, the patient
      will receive a 5 milliliter intrauterine infusion of 4% lidocaine using a sterile 3mm Novak
      curette. The infusion will be placed slowly over 3 minutes.

      Group 2: a standard paracervical block (8 milliliter 1% lidocaine at 4 and 8 o'clock at the
      cervical-vaginal reflection) will be placed. Following this, a 3 mm Novak curette will be
      placed in the vagina and held to the external os of the cervix for 3 minutes. The curette
      will not be placed through the cervix and no infusion will be performed. This will
      approximate the steps involved in an intrauterine infusion without injecting the patient.

      During the procedure, women in both groups will be asked to rate their pain at various times
      using a 10 cm visual analog scale (VAS).
