    
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of ER-MAS and topiramate in promoting cocaine
      abstinence among cocaine-dependent patients.

      Primary Hypothesis: The proportion of participants achieving sustained cocaine abstinence
      (via urine toxicology) for three consecutive weeks during the study will be significantly
      greater for the combined pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo group.

      Hypothesis 2: The proportion of urine samples negative for cocaine metabolites will be
      greater in the combined pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo group.

      Hypothesis 3: The pattern of cocaine use (amount of cocaine used per day in dollars and the
      number of using days per week), as measured by the time-line follow-back method, will show a
      greater reduction in use for the combined pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo
      group.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the effect of ER-MAS and topiramate on cocaine craving among
      cocaine-dependent patients.

      Hypothesis 4: Cocaine craving symptoms will be reduced to a greater degree in the combined
      pharmacotherapies group compared to the placebo group.

      Specific Aim 3: To explore a set of related secondary outcomes (treatment retention, global
      functioning, HIV risk behavior) as well as moderators and mediators potentially reflective of
      mechanism of action.
