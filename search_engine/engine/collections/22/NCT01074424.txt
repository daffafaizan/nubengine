      Primary

        -  To develop a serum proteomic profile for cervical cancer using banked pre-treatment
           serum specimens from patients with invasive cervical cancer and to determine if this
           serum proteomic profile has possible utility in cervical cancer prognosis.

      Secondary

        -  To develop a serum proteomic profile for cervical cancer using banked post-treatment
           serum specimens from these patients and to determine if this serum proteomic profile has
           possible utility in cervical cancer prognosis.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Banked serum specimens are used to generate proteomic profiles.
