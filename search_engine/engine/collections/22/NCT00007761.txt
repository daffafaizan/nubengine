      intervention will significantly improve (1) manic and (2) depressive symptom scores, as well
      as Total Treatment Costs as compared to usual care of bipolar patients.

      Secondary Hypothesis: Secondary hypotheses include significant improvement in BDP patients as
      compared to usual bipolar treatment care with respect to functional outcome, quality of life,
      intensity of somatotherapy, patient satisfaction, and provider attitudes.

      Intervention: Usual (psychiatric) Care vs Bipolar Disorder Program

      Primary Outcomes: The primary outcomes are: (1) Manic Symptom Score; (2) Depressive Symptom
      Score; and (3) Total Treatment Costs.

      Study Abstract: Based on highly promising preliminary data, it is proposed to conduct a
      multi-site randomized controlled trial of a high-intensity ambulatory treatment program for
      bipolar disorder against standard office-based, physician-centered care. The major
      characteristics of this program are that it emphasizes (1) aggressive guideline-driven
      pharmacotherapy, (2) continuity of care with identified primary mental health nurse
      clinicians supported by psychiatrist back-up, and (3) patient education to improve treatment
      alliance and illness management skills.

      Patients with bipolar disorder will be randomly assigned to either standard care or the high
      intensity ambulatory program for three years. Outcome variables will cover three distinct
      domains: disease-specific outcome (number, length, and severity of manic and depressive
      episodes), functional outcome (social and occupational role function and subjective quality
      of life), and total treatment costs (direct treatment costs and indirect costs of illness).
      Preliminary data indicate that these domains are related but not redundant. Each of these is
      relevant to patient well-being and to VHA management.
