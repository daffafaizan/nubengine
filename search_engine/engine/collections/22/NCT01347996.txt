    
      Outcome Measures:

      Primary:

        1. To assess the quantitative and qualitative pharmacodynamic effects of Ceplene plus
           low-dose IL-2 (Ceplene/IL-2) by monitoring T and natural killer (NK) cell phenotypes and
           their functionality after the first and third treatment cycles in adult patients with
           acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR1).

        2. To evaluate minimal residual disease (MRD) in AML patients receiving Ceplene/IL-2.

      Secondary:

      To document, in adult AML patients in CR1 treated with Ceplene/IL-2:

        1. Leukemia-free survival (LFS) after a follow-up period of up to two years.

        2. The safety of Ceplene/IL-2 therapy.

        3. The potential relationship of Ceplene/IL-2 effects on T and NK cell phenotypes and their
           functionality to MRD.
