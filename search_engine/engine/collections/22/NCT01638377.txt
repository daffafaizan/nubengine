      treatments being available. A significant healthcare challenge is to find ways to bring
      people who have alcohol dependence into treatment programs. Drinking drivers are a group that
      has been shown to have high rates of alcohol dependence. In Ontario, all convicted drinking
      drivers who want to obtain a drivers license must complete Ontario's remedial program for
      convicted drinking drivers called Back on Track (BOT). In this program, those with more
      serious alcohol-related problems are assigned to a group treatment program. While it is
      likely that many of the individual in this group are experiencing alcohol dependence,
      currently there is no formal linkage to any medical services for these problems. In this
      study, the investigators will provide those in the BOT treatment group with information about
      a 24-week study assessing the effectiveness of naltrexone vs. placebo. This study will also
      assess the feasibility and level of interest among this population to obtain treatment for
      alcohol dependence.
