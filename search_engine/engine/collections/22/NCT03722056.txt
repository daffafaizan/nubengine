      laparoscopy and experienced gained over the years, the safety & feasibility of laparoscopic
      resections of gastric GISTs has been proven but for tumors less than 2 cm. However, with gain
      of experience and skill in laparoscopic surgery, many surgeons have reported a safety &
      feasibility excision of tumors greater than 5 cm. Our current study demonstrates the
      oncologic safety of the laparoscopic approach even with tumour size range up to 12cm, with
      efficacy and recurrence rates similar or superior to historical open surgical controls,
      however, it requires considerable expertise for safe manipulation of the tumour. All these
      resections were accomplished with minimal morbidity, no perioperative mortality, and short
      post-operative stay and comparable long term oncological outcomes.
