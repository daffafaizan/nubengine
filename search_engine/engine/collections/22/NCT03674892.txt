      cavity may have an inhibitory effect on the primary TG interneurons and block the ocular pain
      signaling to the brain.

      The investigators propose a non-randomized, open-label, single arm pilot trial for treatment
      of neuropathic corneal pain (NCP) with ITN with the following specific aims:

      Specific Aims:

        1. To elucidate the efficacy of ITN in ameliorating pain among neuropathic corneal pain
           patients.

        2. To elucidate the safety, efficacy, longevity of ITN in ameliorating pain among
           neuropathic corneal pain patients during a 90-day period with daily use.

        3. To assess quality of life changes by treating neuropathic corneal pain with ITN during a
           90-day period with daily use.
