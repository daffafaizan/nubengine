      bioavailability) of 2 new tapentadol (CG5503) tablet formulations (Test Product 1 and Test
      Product 2) containing 116 mg tapentadol hydrochloride each, as compared to a 116-mg
      tapentadol hydrochloride PR tablet (Reference Product) and to explore the effect of food on
      the bioavailability of the 2 new tapentadol formulations. Participants received a single dose
      of each of the test formulations under fasting or fed conditions and of the reference
      formulation under fasting conditions in a randomized order. There was a wash-out period of at
      least 3 days between consecutive treatments. Blood samples were taken from pre-dose up to 32
      hours post-dose for pharmacokinetic analyses.

      Furthermore, the study compared the safety and tolerability of the test formulations with
      that of the reference. Adverse events and vital signs were documented at screening, pre-dose,
      and up to 32 hours post-dose. Clinical laboratory parameters were determined and 12-lead
      electrocardiograms (ECG) were recorded at screening and at discharge. A final medical
      examination was performed at 2-14 days after discharge following the last treatment.
