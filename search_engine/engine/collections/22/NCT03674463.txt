      for multiple myeloma often cause remissions, but nearly all patients eventually relapse,
      there is an unmet clinical needs for these patients. B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a
      protein expressed by normal plasma cells and the malignant plasma cells of multiple myeloma,
      and it was supposed to be a promising target for r/r MM.
