    
      Together Overcoming Diabetes (TOD) is a culturally tailored, family-based type 2 diabetes
      management and preventive intervention. The program activates family and cultural practices
      that encourage healthy diets and physical activities, promotes coping skills for dealing with
      stress, and reconnects families via a home-based intervention taught by American Indian (AI)
      paraprofessional Family Health Coaches.

      Evaluation of TOD for this trial will happen via Community Based Participatory Research
      (CBPR). The study team will enroll "target" adult caregivers diagnosed with type 2 diabetes
      and their youth, ages 10-16 years at enrollment, with the goal of tapping motivational
      reciprocity between the two generations. The work involves collaboration with five Ojibwe
      tribal communities in the midwestern U.S. to implement a randomized controlled study (N = 280
      family dyads) with a wait-list design respectful of cultural norms of inclusion.

      The study will evaluate effectiveness of the intervention on adult physiological (primary
      outcome = HbA1c), behavioral, and mental health and children's psychosocial, familial,
      behavioral and physiological risk and protective factors for diabetes. The research will also
      identify stress-coping mechanisms that mediate the impact of the intervention on health. A
      novel collaborative, qualitative evaluation technique will map potential "ripple effects" of
      the intervention within families and communities. If effective, the intervention will promote
      dissemination and scaling with tribal health coaches, community involvement, and stakeholder
      (health providers, health and human service agencies) input.
