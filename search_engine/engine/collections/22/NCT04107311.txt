      response to immunotherapy and development of colitis. Microbiome with different profiles are
      also associated with multiple diseases, including gastrointestinal (GI) or non-GI auto-immune
      pathologies. Little is known about the relationship between the microbiome composition or
      fecal calprotectin (fCal) and the development of non-colitis immune-related adverse events
      (irAEs) during treatment with IO combinations.

      Autoimmune conditions and irAEs from immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) drugs both involve
      loss of tolerance to endogenous antigens and produce similar clinical presentations. ICI can
      increase humoral response. However, to date there is no evidence that autoimmune panels are
      correlated with the development of irAEs during IO combination therapy.

      These findings suggest that analyzing the microbiome and autoimmune panels of patients
      treated with IO combinations at multiple time-points may be feasible. In addition, baseline,
      early shift and changes in microbiome and autoimmune panels at time of a serious irAE may be
      correlated with the development of serious irAEs and may change with appropriate
      immunosuppressive regimens.

      We hypothesize that analysing the microbiome and autoimmune panels of patients treated with
      immunooncology (IO) combinations at multiple time-points is feasible. Additionally, we
      hypothesize that baseline, early shift and changes in microbiome and autoimmune panels at
      time of a serious immune-related adverse event (irAE) is correlated with the development of
      serious irAEs and will change with appropriate immunosuppressive regimens.
