      ursolic acid taken orally as a single dose of 40 mg, 80 mg, and 120 mg to determine the
      optimal dose in humans.

      The second phase of this trial will involve 20 PSC subjects assigned to treatment with daily
      oral ursolic acid at the dose determined to be optimal in the first phase of the study. The
