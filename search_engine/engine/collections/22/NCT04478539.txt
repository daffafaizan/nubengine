      as cytokine storm, in particular, aberrant Interleukin (IL) 6 levels that promote numerous
      pathological downstream effects. Hyperinflammation is a well-established trigger of
      multiorgan failure, for example, acute kidney injury. Moreover, recent reports point to a
      link between hyper inflammation and COVID-19 induced coagulopathy as a result of increased
      production of clotting factors by the liver.

      Despite several lines of evidence pointing to a potential clinical benefit of controlling
      hyperinflammation triggered by COVID-19, management of COVID-19 remains mostly supportive
      built around continuous respiratory support.

      To this end, considering the underlying immunological character of COVID-19 disease and the
      high risk of SARS-CoV-2 hyperinflammation to trigger ARDS, hypercoagulability and Acute
      Kidney Injury (AKI) this study aims to monitor selected biochemical, immunological and
      coagulation parameters in combination with radiological imaging to guide clinical practice
      and to tailor therapy consisting of 1) early initiation of blood purification using the
      oXirisÂ® (AN69ST) filter, 2) systemic heparinisation and 3) respiratory support
