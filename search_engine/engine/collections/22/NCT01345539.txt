    
      Patients with oligometastatic disease (defined here as 5 or fewer sites of metastatic disease
      involving 3 or fewer organ systems) are potentially curable with stereotactic radiosurgery
      (SRS) or stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) (collectively referred to as stereotactic body
      radiotherapy or SBRT) to the metastatic disease sites in combination with standard curative
      therapy to the primary site.
