      the treatment of solid tumors. Participants with the following advanced solid tumors will be
      enrolled:

      Cohort 1: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) Cohort 2: non-small cell lung cancer-squamous
      (NSCLC-squamous) Cohort 3: non-small cell lung cancer-nonsquamous (NSCLC-nonsquamous) Cohort
      4: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) Cohort 5: esophageal squamous cell carcinoma
      (esophageal-squamous) Cohort 6: gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma
      Cohort 7: castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) Cohort 8: melanoma

      Participants will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity, investigator decision, consent withdrawal, study termination by the sponsor,
      pregnancy, or death, whichever comes first.
