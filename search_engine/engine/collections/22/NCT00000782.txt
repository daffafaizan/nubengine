      immunized patients can be used as a surrogate marker for new proliferative and cytotoxic
      responses induced by vaccination.

      Patients are stratified into three groups. Fifteen patients previously immunized with
      MicroGeneSys rgp160 antigen in ACTG 137 and not on antiretroviral therapy will receive
      intradermal injections of Immuno-AG rgp160 IIIB (vero cell expressed) in one arm, followed 1
      week later by intradermal injections of MicroGeneSys rgp160 IIIB (baculovirus expressed) in
      the opposite arm (stratum 1). Forty patients who are not previously immunized with rgp160
      will receive intradermal injections of Immuno-AG gp160 IIIB in one arm simultaneously with
      MicroGeneSys gp160 IIIB in the opposite arm; these patients are either not on antiretroviral
      therapy (stratum 2) or currently on antiretroviral therapy (stratum 3). All patients return
      48 hours after each injection for skin test reading.

      PER 4/5/95 AMENDMENT: Patients on all strata will re-enroll to receive Immuno-AG rgp160 MN in
      one arm simultaneously with MicroGeneSys rgp160 IIIB in the opposite arm.
