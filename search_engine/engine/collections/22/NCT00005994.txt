      ondansetron can prevent acute postchemotherapy nausea and emesis in cancer patients. II.
      Assess any potential effectiveness of the intervention on delayed postchemotherapy nausea and
      emesis in these patients. III. Examine the effect of the intervention on patient
      expectations.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by
      center and chemotherapy agent (cisplatin vs carboplatin vs doxorubicin). Patients are
      randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive standard educational
      materials. Arm II: Patients receive specific intervention material in addition to standard
      educational materials. Patients then complete a patient information questionnaire. Patients
      receive ondansetron orally or IV over 10-15 minutes in addition to the first 2 courses of
      chemotherapy. Patients complete a nausea and emesis questionnaire after each of their first 2
      chemotherapy treatments.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
