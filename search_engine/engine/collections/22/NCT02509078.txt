    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To assess the efficacy and safety of early neuromuscular blockade in reducing mortality and
      morbidity in patients with moderate-severe ARDS, in comparison to a control group with no
      routine early neuromuscular blockade (NMB).

      PRIMARY HYPOTHESIS:

      Early neuromuscular blockade will improve mortality prior to discharge home before day 90, in
      patients with moderate-severe ARDS.

      The trial will accrue a maximum of 1408 patients. Patients will be recruited from the
      emergency departments, intensive care units and other acute care areas of the PETAL Network
      Clinical Centers and randomized to the active (NMB) or control. The overall strategy is to
      screen, consent, and enroll early, every newly intubated, acutely ill or post-operative,
      eligible patient at each site, using clinically obtained pulse oximetry and blood gases.

      By preventing active expiration, and/or patient ventilator dyssynchrony, neuromuscular
      blockade may create a more homogenous distribution of airway pressures and tidal volumes,
      preventing barotrauma/volutrauma and "atelectrauma" resulting in less ventilator-induced lung
      injury.
