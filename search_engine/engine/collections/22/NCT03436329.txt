      recurrence and survival. Handling the tumor during a surgery may promote the release of CTCs
      into the bloodstream. Therefore, in a surgery of cancer, interruption of the vein before
      ligation of the artery may be justified. This multi-center randomized controlled trial is to
      assess the impact of the sequence of vessel interruption in lung cancer patients on tumor
      cell spread and patient survival by using peripheral blood CTCs.
