      extubation in patients undergoing craniotomy. For patients who met the inclusion criteria,
      the PCF value will be measured before the removal of entracheal tubes, and the predictive
      value of PCF will be evaluated by ROC curves, as will as the cut-off value of PCF. Logistic
      regression stratified analysis will be used to adjust the influence of other risk factors of
      endotracheal extubation.

      Two subgroup analysis will be carried out. According to state of consciousness, patients will
      be grouped as consciousness and unconsciousness group, and the predictive value of PCF for
      endotracheal extubation will be evaluated seprately in both groups. For patients with
      disturbance of consciousness, only passive PCF value will be measured. For lucid patients,
      inaddition to passive PCF value, the voluntary PCF value will also be measured.

      According to anatomic site of lesion, patients will be divided into supratentorial and
      intracranial groups, and the predictive value of PCF for endotracheal extubation will be
      evaluated seprately in both groups.
