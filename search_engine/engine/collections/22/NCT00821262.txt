      It is commonly believed that the choice of the primary anesthetic agent does not result in
      different outcomes after cardiac surgery. Recent evidence however has indicated that volatile
      anesthetics improve post-ischemic recovery. These results have been summarized in a
      meta-analysis of 22 randomized studies, involving 1922 patients: the use of volatile
      anesthetics was associated with significant reductions of myocardial infarctions (24/979
      [2.4%] in the volatile anesthetics group vs 45/874 [5.1%] in the control arm, odds ratio
      [OR]=0.51 [0.32-0.84], and mortality (4/977 [0.4%] vs 14/872 [1.6%], OR=0.31 [0.12-0.80].

      Furthermore, the use of volatile anesthetics was associated with shorter intensive-care unit
      stay (WMD=-7.10 hours [-11.47; -2.73], and time to hospital discharge (WMD=-2.26 days [-3.83;
      -0.68].

      All the studies of the meta-analysis included low risk patients undergoing isolated
      procedures (mostly coronary artery bypass grafting).

      Objectives

      Investigators are planning a large multicentre randomized controlled study to confirm the
      beneficial cardioprotective effects of volatile anesthetics in cardiac surgery as indicated
      by a reduced intensive care stay and/or death in an high risk population of patients
      undergoing combined valvular and coronary procedures. Secondary endpoints will be: cardiac
      troponin release; incidence of myocardial infarction; time on mechanical ventilation;
      postoperative hospital stay

      Methods

      Various centers will randomize 200 patients to receive either a total intravenous anesthesia
      with propofol or an anesthesia with sevoflurane. All patients will receive a standard middle
      dose opiates anesthesia. All the perioperative management will be otherwise identical and
      standardized. Transfer out of the intensive care will be performed with SpO2 94% or greater
      at an FiO2 of 0.5 or less by facemask, adequate cardiac stability with no hemodynamically
      significant arrhythmias, chest tube drainage less than 50 ml/h, urine output greater than 0.5
      ml/kg/h, no intravenous inotropic or vasopressor therapy in excess of dopamine 5 ug/kg/min,
      and no seizure activity.

      Expected Results

      The reduced cardiac damage (reduction in cardiac troponin release and in the incidence of
      myocardial infarction) will translate into a better tissue perfusion and faster recovery as
      documented by reduced intensive care unit.
