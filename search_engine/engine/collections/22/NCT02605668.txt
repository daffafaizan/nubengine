      action of exposure-based therapies and provides according strategies to improve the
      effectiveness of treatment by optimized extinction. A translational research agenda is
      suggested to examine whether enhanced extinction learning components derived from preclinical
      research, applied within an "intensified" exposure-based treatment, improves outcomes. In a
      multicenter randomized clinical trial, linked to mechanistic subprojects, the investigators
      test in n=620 patients with primary AD allowing for comorbidity whether intensified
      psychological interventions based on augmented extinction learning (IPI) result in faster,
      stronger and more persistent outcomes on subjective, clinical, behavioral, physiological and
      neural indices as compared to an, otherwise identical, standard research treatment without
      explicit enhanced extinction (TAU). The investigators hypothesize that (a) enhanced
      extinction elements (IPI) will result in higher effect sizes, faster recovery, (b) more
      pronounced changes in an array of systems, including elements of extinction learning and in
      objective behavioral measures assessed in intersession exposure trials. The investigators
      also examine moderators of outcome (i.e. type of diagnosis, comorbidity) and explore whether
      IPI is associated with lower health care costs.
