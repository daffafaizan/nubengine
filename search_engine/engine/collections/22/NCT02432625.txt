    
      The purpose of this natural history study is to perform a long-term follow-up of a large
      group of people with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). We will collect information including:

        -  medical history

        -  number of broken bones,

        -  surgeries done

        -  medications taken,

        -  ability to walk,

        -  pain

        -  lung function and breathing

        -  hearing

        -  bone mineral density The overall goal is to improve the health and quality of life of
           people with OI.

      There will be a total of 1000 people with OI in this study.

      We will ask you to come in every year for five years and we will do the following tests or
      ask you about your:

      Birth History and past surgical history, Current medical history, Scoliosis evaluation,
      Walking ability Questionnaire, Dental Quality of Life Questionnaire, Scoliosis and fractures
      Quality of Life Questionnaires, Physical development evaluation, Medications you are using

      We will perform a physical exam, a dental exam, assess how well your lungs are working,
      perform a hearing test, measure your ability to walk and get around, assess your strength and
      if you are able to do certain things for yourself, perform a Walk Test.

      We will take the following X-rays:measure your bone density (strength) with a DEXA scan, take
      an X-ray of your spine, take an X-ray of your hand, take an X-ray of your jaw.

      We will collect the following samples from you:

      We will collect 1 teaspoon blood to study your gene, may collect skin cells with a biopsy,
      and collect 1 teaspoon of blood and 2 teaspoon of urine for future research on OI.
