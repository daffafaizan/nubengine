      Primary

        -  Determine the optimal loading and maintenance doses of selenium necessary to achieve
           selenium concentrations exceeding 15 Î¼M when administered with irinotecan in patients
           with advanced solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine any observed tumor response to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of selenium.

      Patients receive a loading dose* of oral selenium twice daily on days -6 to 0. Patients then
      receive oral selenium once daily on days 1-42 and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22. Courses repeat every 42 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      NOTE: *The loading dose is administered prior to course 1 only.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of selenium until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months.
