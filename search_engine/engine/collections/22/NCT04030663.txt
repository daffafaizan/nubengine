      attemps of puncture which may lead to disappearance of the pulse.

      The aim of this study is to compare the effect of adding papaverine to local anesthetic
      xylocaine versus adding nitroglycerine to it on the diameter and palpability of radial artery
      and if perioperative spasm will decrease significantly with one of these methods.
