      (CC) in patients with reconstructed/ augmented breast.

      Capsular contraction is the one of the most common complications of both esthetic and
      reconstructive breast surgery with an incidence of 0.5-30% and 1-38%, respectively. In
      irradiated patients the incidence is higher, in the range of 30-67%. It appears most commonly
      in the first year but in some patients, belated capsular contracture has been noticed. The
      more severe forms of contraction, Baker grades 3 and 4 with a firm often deformed and painful
      breast, have been shown to recur as often as 67% after capsulotomy

      steroid injection has been demonstrated to be effective for the treatment of this condition.

      20-30 female with grade III\IV CC will be included. Patients will be treated with
      peri-implant US-guided injection of Dexamethasone

      The purpose of our study is to use a longer acting steroid (Dexamethasone) injected intra
      capsular with US-guide. By that getting a better effect on the level of fibrosis.

      This Clinical study will be conducted in the tertiary academic Rabin Medical Center.

      Several measures will be taken, including: capsular contracture grading by two plastic
      surgeons, a VAS-score of breast pain, maximal capsular thickness (MCT) in sonography
