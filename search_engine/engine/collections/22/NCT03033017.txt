      However, there is no agreed upon test of cure, or even what the definition of a cure might
      be. The investigator believes the most reliable test of cure will be an analytic treatment
      interruption (ATI) with time to viremia as a standard measure of the impact of an
      intervention on the degree to which the reservoir has been depleted. This is rational as
      modeling studies utilizing ATI data point to reservoir size as an important predictor of time
      to viremia(1) and other studies have shown that levels of HIV DNA(2) and cell associated HIV
      RNA(3) prior to starting antiretroviral therapy (ART) are associated with time-to-rebound.
      However, these studies used a limited sampling strategy to determine when viremia rebounded
      and it is likely that greater sensitivity in measures of time-to rebound will be needed to
      accurately assess the impact of an intervention. The investigators have tested an ATI
      strategy where plasma HIV is sampled three times each week and ART is resumed once the virus
      becomes detectable. In this small, pilot study, the investigators sampled lymph nodes, GALT,
      plasma, and PBMC before, during, and after the ATI and found the time-to-rebound was 14 days
      (range 5 to 30 days) and that total years of ART exposure was associated with the
      time-to-rebound (4). The investigators propose a similar study that includes more intensive
      blood and lymphoid tissue sampling to identify factors that predict time to-rebound to
      provide a necessary foundation for future studies that utilize a treatment interruption as a
      test of efficacy for curative interventions.
