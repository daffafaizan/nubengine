      Vitrectomy with membrane peeling has developed to be the gold-standard in treatment of ERM.
      Nevertheless, there are about 10% of patients having intraretinal cystoid changes after
      surgery with potential for disturbance of visual acuity. The aim of the study is to assess
      the rate of postoperative intraretinal cystoid changes after pars plana vitrectomy with
      membrane peeling and peribulbar application of triamcinolone acetonide and to examine
      possible risk factors for postoperative intraretinal cystoid changes.
