    
      This is a phase II, crossover, double-blinded, controlled trial in 20 participants with type
      2 diabetes designed to measure the effect of quercetin on glucose tolerance and postprandial
      endothelial function in comparison to placebo and Acarbose. Glucose tolerance and insulin
      excursion will be measured at 0, 30, 60, and 120 minutes following a 100g maltose tolerance
      test (MTT). Each participant will blindly rotate between three single individual doses of
      placebo, quercetin (2g oral), and Acarbose (100mg oral) prior to the MTT on 3 separate
      occasions. Each participant will serve as their own control and comparison for each of the
      interventions.

      Fasting and post-MTT endothelial function will be measured by peripheral tonometry (Itamar
      EndoPAT (Peripheral Arterial Tone) 2000) and reported as reactive hyperemia index (RHI).
      EndoPAT testing will be performed prior to the fasting blood collection and then again at 90
      minutes following the MTT, during each clinical research visit.

      Exploratory data will also be collected on post-MTT increases in gamma-glutamyltransferase
      (GGT).
