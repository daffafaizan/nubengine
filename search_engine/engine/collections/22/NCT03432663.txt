      were candidates for drug cardioversion after first symptomatic episodes of AF.

      The patients were randomized in equal proportions and sequentially placed in one of two
      treatment groups; no patient knew to which group he or she belonged. The first group received
      intravenous amiodarone infusions at doses of 5 mg/Kg for over 30 min, followed by 20 mg/Kg
      until 24 hours was reached. The second group received intravenous amiodarone infusions at
      doses of 5 mg/Kg for over 30 min, followed by 20 mg/Kg every 24 hours for up to 72 hours.

      All patients were continuously monitored using electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms were
      performed within 24 hours after the randomized trial began. The exact time of each patient's
      cardioversion was documented. In addition, general laboratory tests, lipid profiles, thyroid
      profiles and chest X-rays were obtained for all patients.

      A sample size of 30 subjects in each group was calculated. A conversion rate of 60% was
      assumed, according to literature, and an estimated increase to 90% was assumed for the
      experimental group to find differences with a power of 0.8 and an alpha error of 0.05.

      The primary goal was to obtain was a sinus rhythm conversion rate. The secondary goal was to
      obtain a combined complication rate by noting various complications in the patients, such as
      phlebitis, symptomatic hypotension that required vasopressors, bradycardia, nausea, vomiting
      and any organ embolism.
