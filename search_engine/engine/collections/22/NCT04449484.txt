    
      The study will include up to 3 cohorts, with 12 subjects in each, for a total of up to 36
      randomised subjects.

      The study comprises a screening period of up to 49 days, an 8-week double-blind treatment
      period, and a 13-week follow-up period. Each subject will receive three 60 minute iv
      infusions of MEDI1341 or placebo during the 8-week treatment period, with 4 weeks between
      infusions. The overall study duration (enrolment, treatment, and follow-up periods) will be
      up to 28 weeks per subject.

      A Dose Escalation Committee will review data from each cohort to allow progression to the
      next higher dose cohort in the study.
