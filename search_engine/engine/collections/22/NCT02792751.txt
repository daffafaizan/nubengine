      given to provide the patients Ramsey sedation scale as 3 and 4 in Group R (n=25) patients
      whereas it was given to Group B (n=25) patients to provide BIS values between 65 to 85. The
      levels of total oxidant status (TOS), total antioxidant status (TAS), and Oxidative stres
      index (OSI) were measured. Hemodynamic signs, propofol consumption, postoperative recovery
      time were recorded.
