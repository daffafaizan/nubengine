      of surgery, radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, few treatment options currently exist.
      Salvage therapies typically consist of systemic administration of chemotherapy agents, which
      have been shown to have limited effectiveness as median survival in this patient group is
      currently only 6 months.

      One limitation to the efficacy of systemic chemotherapy in the treatment of brain tumors is
      the blood-brain barrier (BBB). To enhance the delivery of systemically administered
      chemotherapy agents to brain tumors, an implantable ultrasound device was developed that can
      be used to temporarily disrupt the BBB. Delivery of pulsed ultrasound, in combination with an
      ultrasound contrast agent, has been shown to temporarily disrupt the BBB for a duration of
      more than 6 hours and allow for a significantly increased penetration of systemically
      administered chemotherapy drugs in pre-clinical studies.

      This study will evaluate the safety of temporary disruption of the BBB during carboplatin
      chemotherapy delivery in patients with recurrent glioblastoma. This study will also evaluate
      the maximum tolerated dose of ultrasound that can be used to disrupt the BBB.

      The use of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI will be evaluated for determining the extent and
      magnitude of BBB opening. Clinical efficacy (Survival) and radiological efficacy (Progression
      Free Survival) will also be evaluated as secondary endpoints.
