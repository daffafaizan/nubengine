      you are consenting to your child having the adenoid (tissue similar to lymph nodes, found in
      the back of the throat) and tonsils removed (if not previously performed), direct
      laryngoscopy (looking in the throat) and bronchoscopy (inspection of the lungs with a long
      tube-like device down the throat), and randomization (½ will be treated further, ½ will be
      observed) into treatment and no-treatment arms if your child is diagnosed with
      laryngomalacia. After starting general anesthesia (putting patient to sleep for procedure),
      the surgeon will perform direct laryngoscopy (look at the throat and voice box) and
      bronchoscopy (look at the entrance to the lungs [trachea or windpipe]). If your child is
      diagnosed with laryngomalacia (flopping of the tissue around the voice box, potentially
      causing obstruction or blockage), 50% will undergo a further treatment (laser
      supraglottoplasty, or removal of tissue at the entrance of the voice box) and 50% will be
      observed. The decision to treat or not treat will be random, as is customary for prospective
      research trials. All children (both treatment arms will receive a 3 week treatment of a
      medicine (a proton pump inhibitor) to reduce the level of stomach acid and prevent potential
      exposure of the larynx (voice-box) to stomach acid. If your child does not have
      laryngomalacia, no further treatment on the larynx (voice-box) will be performed. Next,
      adenotonsillectomy will be performed as is common for the Otolaryngologist performing the
      procedure. Postoperatively, a sleep study will be performed (identical to the preoperative
      study) ideally 3-6 months after surgery, (but up to one year after) to monitor your child's
      progress. Additional laboratory tests or drawing of blood is not routine in this procedure,
      but may be performed as dictated by your child's medical conditions.
