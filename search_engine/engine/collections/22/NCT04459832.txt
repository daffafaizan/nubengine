      OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of variable stretching intervals on neural function and ROM.

      DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial Participants: In this trial, 100 participants will
      participate in the study diagnosed with tight hamstring muscles (defined as the inability to
      extend the knee to less than 20Â° of knee flexion) were randomly assigned to the control group
      or one of the 3 intervention groups Interventions: The three experimental groups will
      stretched 5 times per week for 4 weeks for 15, 30, and 60 seconds, respectively the control
      group did not stretch Main Outcome Measures: The neurophysiological outcome measures included
      peak to peak somatosensory evoked potential for dermatomes L3,L4,L5, and S1. Secondary
      outcome measures included knee ROM. All outcome measures will be assessed immediately after
      the treatment session and 24 hours after the treatment session.
