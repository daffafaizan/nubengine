      developed systematically through reviewing literature, systematic reviews and guidelines and
      appropriate behavioral theories by involving experts and patients. Automated SMS will be sent
      from one computer database at the scheduled date and time. A validated questionnaire will be
      adapted and pre-tested to check for any error. Adequate sample size is calculated for both
      arms with the ratio of 1:1 allocation. Standardized Anthropometric measurement, FANTA
      Household Dietary Diversity Score and WHO TB treatment outcome classification will be used
      for assessing the outcome variables. The data collectors will be trained on the objective,
      screening of eligible participants, the procedure of data collection, and how to assure the
      quality and security of the data based on the protocol. Continuous supervision will be
      employed throughout the data collection and intervention period. The data will be collected
      electronically and will be exported to STATA for analysis. Intention to treat analysis and
      regression analysis model will be employed.
