      randomize 40 participants into each intervention arm. Participants will be randomized to one
      of the two arms: e-cigarettes with nicotine cartridges or e-cigarettes with placebo
      cartridges (0mg). Participants and research assistants will be blind to the allocation of
      nicotine or placebo e-cigarettes as there are no difference in appearance or odor of the mist
      emitted from the e-cigarettes with and without nicotine containing cartridges. Participants
      will be asked to track their nicotine use via text message. All participants will receive a
      20-30 minute behavioral counseling consultation with a trained tobacco counselor. Counselors
      will review each participant's smoking pattern and offer tailored behavioral and
      environmental change strategies including specific smoking reduction strategy options.
      Participants will be given a supply of e-cigarettes and followed for 3 weeks
