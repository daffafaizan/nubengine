      from 3 to 15 years. All of them will be invited to undergo an overnight polysomnography for
      at least 7h in Beijing Children's Sleep Center, meanwhile the parameters about sleep
      including EEG, electromyography, electrooculography, ECG, pulse oximetry arterial oxygen
      saturation (SpO2), chest wall and abdomen motion, oral and nasal airflow, and end-tidal PCO2
      (PETCO2) will be recorded.

      Based on the data we hope to give recommendation of normal PSG parameters of Chinese kids,
      and on this basis,to develop the diagnosis creteria for obstructive sleep apnea syndrome
      which will be more suitable for Chinese children conditions.
