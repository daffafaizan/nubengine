      The implementation of SMS in population-based cancer screening programs will improve
      participation, especially in colorectal cancer screening, will allow a better resource
      management and reduce costs in both programs.

      Specific Hypothesis:

      Sending the reminder SMS will have an impact on participation greater than that obtained with
      the standard reminder (letter) in the colorectal cancer screening program.

      The effect of the colorectal cancer screening reminder SMS will be greater among the
      individuals who have been invited for the first time and not previous participants.

      Participation after receiving the invitation by SMS in breast cancer screening will be equal
      to or better than the letter invitation.

      The alternative that includes sending SMS will be cost-effective in relation to the current
      alternative that you use postal shipping.
