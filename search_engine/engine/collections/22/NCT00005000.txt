      (EFV) in the first regimen (R1). All patients also receive zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine
      (3TC). Patients are further randomized in a factorial fashion and by stratification based on
      HIV RNA level (less than 10,000, 10,000-100,000, or greater than 100,000 copies/ml) to be
      administered a single injection of a neo-antigen (KLH) at Week 12, 24, or 48. Therapy
      continues until switch criteria are met either before or after Week 24. When switch criteria
      are met, patients advance to the next regimen (R2).

      R2 patients previously taking NFV switch to EFV; those randomized to EFV switch to NFV; the
      additional NRTIs change to stavudine (d4T) and didanosine (ddI). Therapy is continued for an
      additional 24 weeks.
