      defecatory disorders and usually considered as an indication for surgery. However, operation
      is not always possible. Existing data suggest that functional component may also be possible,
      despite on the anatomic impairment. The aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of complex
      conservative treatment of functional defecatory disorders in patients with mild to moderate
      grade of pelvic organ prolapse
