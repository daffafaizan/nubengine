    
      Teriparatide 20 micrograms (mcg) per day is currently only available as a subcutaneous (SQ)
      injection and many patients with severe osteoporosis for whom anabolic therapy with
      teriparatide is appropriate are either unwilling or physically unable to self-inject. The
      purpose of this Phase 2 study is to identify a transdermal dose or doses that will be
      comparable to the teriparatide 20 mcg SQ dose from a pharmacodynamic (PD) and safety
      standpoint for use in future Phase 3 studies.
