      2019, 60 patients between the age of 40 and 70 year were divided randomly using a computer
      generated randomization table and opaque sealed envelopes into two groups (30 patients in
      each group) according to the type of block they received: Group (T) received ultrasound
      guided (US) combined ipsilateral transverse abdominis plane (TAB) and ilioinguinal-
      iliohypogastric (ILIH) nerve block. Group (I) received US guided ipsilateral illioinguinal-
      illiohypogastric nerve block only.

      Standard monitoring was used throughout the surgery; heart rate (HR), non-invasive mean
      arterial blood pressure (MAP), respiratory rate (RR) and oxygen saturation (SpO2)documented
      at baseline before the block then at 5-min intervals intraoperative , then during the
      immediate postoperative period at 15 and 30 min, and at discharge from the PACU.

      A nasal prong was applied and supplemental oxygen at 3 l/min of fresh gas flow was given
      throughout the procedure. It was explained clearly to the patients that any pain, discomfort,
      or anxiety would be managed by the administration of local anesthetic (LA) infiltration with
      bupivacaine 0.25% during the operation or by conversion to general anesthesia (GA) if needed.
