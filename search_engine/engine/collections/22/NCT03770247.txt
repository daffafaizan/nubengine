      computed tomographic guided technique of celiac plexus neurolysis for pain management in
      unresectable pancreatic cancer . all patients suffering from pain of pancreatic cancer with
      VAS≥5 undergoing laparotomy and proved to be unresectable either undergoing biopsy or bypass
      surgery will receive celiac plexus neurolysis either intraoperative or post operative CT
      guided . All patients will be managed by systemic analgesic if the block not sufficient . In
      this study we will give the patient the analgesic according to WHO recommendation as starting
      by non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs as diclofenac sodium, if it is not sufficient we
      will give them opioids as tramadol, and for neuropathic pain gabapentin. All drugs will be
      given with escalating dose . Failed block defined as change in VAS between VAS BASELINE AND
      ONE MONTH ≤ 3 may need to repeat the block by percutaneous technique .
