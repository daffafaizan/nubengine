      decreased action and contributes to the molecular derangements associated with priapism.
      Optimizing androgen status may promote regulatory molecular mechanisms that protect against
      priapism. This clinical trial will investigate the potential benefit of precise testosterone
      replacement for ameliorating priapism and improving psychological well-being in hypogonadal
      men with SCD.

      This clinical trial aims to evaluate the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy on the
      frequency of recurrent priapism in patients with SCD. The sub-hypothesis that testosterone
      (T) replacement to achieve serum T concentrations at a target range reduces recurrent
      priapism will be tested. This aim will involve subjective and objective assessments of
      priapism occurrences and erectile ability including priapism inventory instruments,
      standardized questionnaires of erectile function (EF) and quality of life, and Rigiscanâ„¢
      erection monitoring in a 3.5-month pilot investigation.
