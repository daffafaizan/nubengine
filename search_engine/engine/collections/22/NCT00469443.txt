      demonstrated that the addition of Avastin in the combination of irinotecan/bolus 5-FU/LV has
      significant improvement of overall survival. Further analysis of these results showed that
      patients receiving irinotecan in combination with Avastin, as 1st line treatment and
      oxaliplatin with Avastin, as second line treatment, have median overall survival 25, 1
      months, which is the longest survival that has been reported.
