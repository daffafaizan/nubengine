    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      The phase Ib dose escalation study will evaluate MK-3475 in combination with bevacizumab in
      subjects with metastatic clear cell renal carcinoma after failure of at least one systemic
      therapy for metastatic disease. The phase II trial will determine the activity of the
      combination of MK-3475 and bevacizumab in first line therapy for subjects with metastatic
      clear cell renal carcinoma.

      PHASE Ib DOSE ESCALATION INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      Cohort 1 will consist of 3-6 patients who will receive MK-3475 200mg and bevacizumab 5mg on
      day 1 of the 21-day cycle. The drugs are administered 15-30 minutes apart in separate
      intravenous infusions.

      Cohort 2 will consist of 3-9 patients who will receive MK-3475 200mg and bevacizumab 10mg on
      day 1 of the 21-day cycle. The drugs are administered 15-30 minutes apart in separate
      intravenous infusions.

      If none of the 3 subjects experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first cycle of
      therapy, an additional 3 subjects will be enrolled at dose level 2. If all three subjects in
      dose level 2 complete the first cycle of therapy without DLT, 3 more subjects will be
      enrolled to ensure only 0-1 of 6 subjects have a DLT. There will be no further escalation
      beyond dose level 2.

      PHASE II INVESTIGATIONAL TREATMENT:

      The maximum safe dose of MK-3475 in combination bevacizumab (as determined in the phase 1b
      cohort) will be given on day 1 of each 21 day cycle. Treatment will continue until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, subject refusal, or subject death either from progression
      of disease, the therapy itself, or from other causes. Subjects who voluntarily stop the
      study, have progressive disease, or unacceptable toxicities will be followed for a total of
      24 months.

      Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) ≥ 70% within 28 days prior to registration for protocol
      therapy.

      Life Expectancy: 6 months or greater

      The following baseline labs must be completed within 28 days prior to registration for
      protocol therapy:

      Hematopoietic:

        -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 10 9/L

        -  Platelets ≥ 100 × 10 9/L

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9.0 g/dL

      Renal:

        -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 × upper limit of normal (ULN)

        -  OR, if serum creatinine > 1.5 × ULN, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) ≥ 40
           mL/min

      Hepatic:

        -  Total serum bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 2.5 × ULN

        -  OR, AST and ALT ≤ 5 × ULN if liver function abnormalities are due to underlying
           malignancy

      Coagulation:

        -  INR < 1.5 × ULN

        -  OR for subjects receiving warfarin or LMWH, the subjects must, in the investigator's
           opinion, be clinically stable with no evidence of active bleeding while receiving
           anticoagulant therapy. The INR for these subjects may exceed 1.5 × ULN if that is the
           goal of anticoagulant therapy.
