    
      Direct intratumoral injection of metastatic hepatic tumors using an adenoviral vector
      expressing the human recombinant interleukin-12 gene (Adv.RSV-hIL12, also termed ADV-hIL-12).

      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Study the toxicity of escalating doses of adenoviral vector expressing the human
           recombinant interleukin-12 gene, administered by percutaneous intratumoral injection, in
           women with liver metastasis secondary to breast cancer.

        -  Determine tumor responses produced by this regimen.

        -  Determine immune responses induced by this regimen.
