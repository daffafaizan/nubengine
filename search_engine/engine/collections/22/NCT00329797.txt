      Primary

        -  Compare the potential benefit of bisphosphonate therapy comprising zoledronate plus
           vitamin D and calcium supplement vs standard therapy with vitamin D and calcium
           supplement in the prevention of osteoporosis and associated bone fractures in patients
           with locally advanced nonmetastatic adenocarcinoma of the prostate undergoing
           radiotherapy and luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the potential benefit of these regimens on quality of life in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the potential benefit in bone mineral density over a period of 3 years for
           patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is randomized multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to T score
      of the hip by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan (< -1.0 but > -2.5 vs ≥ - 1.0) and planned
      duration of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy (1-2½ years vs > 2½
      years). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and every 6 months during treatment.
