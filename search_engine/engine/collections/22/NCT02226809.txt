    
      Residual neuromuscular block (RNMB) is frequent in the immediate postoperative period and is
      a source of complications, mainly respiratory. This includes recovery delay or hospital
      discharge delays, respiratory insufficiency or infections, unforeseen ICU admissions, and
      prolonged ICU stays.

      The incidence is variable due to multiple factors. Age, gender, surgery, NMBA type and doses,
      temperature, medications, etc.

      In several studies it has been found and incidence between 6-80%. Few studies have been
      focused in evaluating the incidence in the whole country, as representing a global anesthesia
      practice. In Spain the incidence is unknown.

      The investigators hypothesize that a number of patients in the postanesthesia care unit
      (PACU) present with RNMB after general anesthesia using intermediate action NMBA.

      The main objective is to know the incidence of RNMB in Spanish hospitals, by means of an
      observational cross-sectional multicenter study .

      Secondary objectives are to observe the possible relationship with other pre- and
      intraoperative factors.
