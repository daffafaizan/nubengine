      are the standard methods for obtaining tissue samples from tumours of the pancreas. The
      diagnostic accuracy by strict criteria is around 75-80%. A non diagnostic sample causes delay
      and the need for a repeat procedure. To date no significant difference has been found between
      standard FNA and standard FNB needles. A novel opposing bevel design (SharkCore) needle for
      FNB may provide better diagnostic performance. The aim of this study is to compare the
      performance of a standard needle and the Sharkcore needle. Patients attending for routine
      biopsy of a suspected pancreatic tumour will be invited to participate. All participants will
      have 3 samples taken with each needle. The samples from each needle will be processed and
      reported separately with the pathologists blinded as to the report from the other needle.
      Following the procedure participants will be observed as normal in the recovery area and
      allowed home later. Further study participation is limited to 1 telephone call at 7 days.
      Participants will be asked if they have developed any new symptoms since the procedure and
      whether they have had to seek medical attention for this.The risks of the study procedure are
      the same as those of a non study procedure. Both needle types are in routine use in our unit.
      The study will be performed in the endoscopy unit of the Freeman hospital. The study is
      funded by a grant from Medtronic the company who make the Sharkcore needle. The study is
      planned to recruit 108 participants over 10 months with a further 6 months of follow up. If
      the new needle is found to perform better its routine use will potentially reduce the delay
      experienced by patients as well as the cost incurred by repeat procedures.
