      hyaluronic acid (HA) treatments on a 2:1 basis, respectively. Treatment groups will be
      assigned as per a randomization list that will be prepared prior to the start of the study.
      Randomization will be done at Enrollment (Visit 2). Neither surgeon nor subject will be
      blinded to treatment. Subjects will be monitored for 6 months following treatment. Following
      signing the Informed Consent form (Visit 1), subjects who conform to the inclusion criteria
      will answer questionnaires for grading of their symptoms, pain level and overall functional
      performance. Subjects will be evaluated for vital signs, blood hematology, chemistry, INR,
      aPTT and ECG, and will be subjected to a 30-40ml blood withdrawal that will be used for the
      production of autologous RegenoGel-SP. Subjects randomized to receive RegenoGel-SP will
      receive a single, intra-articular injection (Visit 2), while subjects randomized to receive
      HA treatment (EuflexxaÂ®) will be injected with 3 intra-articular weekly injections of (Visits
      2-4). Subjects treated with RegenoGel-SP will attend visits 3 and 4 but will not receive
      treatment. All subjects will return for Observation visits after 6 weeks, 3 months and 6
      months following treatment (Visits 5-7). During treatment and observation visits, subjects
      will be monitored for safety parameters (local and systemic AEs, blood work analysis ) and
      response to treatment using the above questionnaires.
