      phenotype. Disease responsiveness to FDA-approved drugs is also marginal at best.

      A positive correlation between the presence of oligoclonal bands (OCBs) and progressive
      course of MS has been established even when adjusted for ethnicity. It is well documented
      that the CSF humoral immune response, including a higher IgG index is higher in
      African-American MS patients. Although MRI lesions, specifically cord and infra-tentorial
      regions, contribute to disability, the phenotype in African-American populations is also
      probably linked to HLA-antigen complex. No study has ever collected data as it relates to
      ethnic background and MS. The University of Kentucky would be the first institution to
      collect such data.

      This is a prospective study that will collect data from patients with the known diagnosis of
      MS who were later classified as NMOSD from the University of Kentucky's Multiple Sclerosis
      Clinic. Researchers will use REDCap to store data.
