    
      -  Medical Screening Interview: Participants will be asked to answer several questions to
           identify potential medical and non-medical conditions that would preclude the
           self-administration of testosterone.

        -  First Saliva Sample: Participants will be asked provide a saliva sample after they
           completed the medical screening interview.

        -  Testosterone Self-Administration: Immediately following the first saliva collection,
           participants will self-administer spray puffs of either testosterone or placebo.

        -  Relaxation: Participants will be given the opportunity to relax for 30 minutes.

        -  Moral Dilemmas Judgments: Participants will be asked to read a set of 24 moral dilemmas
           that describe situations in which an actor has to make a decision on whether or not to
           engage in a particular action (e.g., sacrifice the well-being of one person to protect
           the well-being of several others). Participants will be asked to indicate whether they
           consider the described action acceptable or unacceptable.

        -  Ear Temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure will be measured before drug
           administration, and again 20 minutes after drug administration. If temperature changes
           more than 2 degrees, heart rate changes more than 20bmp, or if blood pressure changes
           more than 20%, the experiment will be terminated and subjects will be escorted across
           the street to the University Emergency Room.
