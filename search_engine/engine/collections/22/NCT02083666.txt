    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized within dose cohort single and repeated
      dose study with sequential dose escalation.

      Eligible volunteers will be divided into dose cohorts and for each cohort, a new panel of 8
      volunteers will be randomized to receive either SOBI002 (n=6) or placebo (n=2). SOBI002 will
      either be administered subcutaneously or intravenously.
