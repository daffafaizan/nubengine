      surgery. Multiple studies have demonstrated that successful postoperative analgesia also
      reduces perioperative complications and improves patient comfort, thereby providing many
      benefits for the patient. In acute postoperative pain management intravenous lidocaine and/or
      ketamine have been advocated because of their morphine-sparing effect.
