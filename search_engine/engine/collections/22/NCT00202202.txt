      sought to review the impact of restructuring on the satisfaction of service community
      partners with our changed consultation service.

      The consultation service was changed as the result of administrative review,part of a larger
      institution wide process. To review how this change was perceived by agency and individual
      care providers those who had received consult reports from the last fifty consultations were
      surveyed about their satisfaction and compared prospectively to the satisfaction of the
      agencies and individual care providers of clients receiving the next fifty consultations
      delivered in the new format.

      The administrative review had indicated that the consultation reports were unnecessarily
      comprehensive and in the process time consuming and thereby interfered with timely access to
      appointments and involved excessive turn around time in the generation of reports. A new
      streamlined approach using a fill in the blanks type form and brief cover letter and the use
      of a follow up phone call to the main care giver the same day was devised to address these
      concerns.

      Satisfaction in regards to advice received, length of the report, waiting times for the
      appointment and for the delivery of the report,legibility and overall satisfaction were
      surveyed. The satisfaction with telephone feed back was also surveyed.
