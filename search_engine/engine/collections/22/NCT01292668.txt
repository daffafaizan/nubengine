      (pain grade of < 4) during the time period during which 90 +/- 10% photo bleaching of
      protoporphyrin IX (PplX) in the lesion occurs, and which precedes the "high" irradiance
      portion of MAL/PDT. II. To determine the effects of preceding "low" irradiance on the pain
      level of the "high" irradiance portion of MAL-PDT. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To determine the
      effects of irradiance on lesion perfusion. II. To determine PpIX and Total Vit D content in
      blood. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To monitor the clinical outcomes of the treatments for initial
      response and recurrences. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. GROUP I:
      Patients apply methyl-5-aminolevulinate hydrochloride (MAL) cream on the lesions and the
      surrounding normal skin. Beginning 3 hours later, patients undergo laser light treatment for
      3-5 minutes. GROUP II: Patients apply MAL cream on the lesions and the surrounding normal
      skin. Beginning 3 hours later, patients undergo light-emitting diode treatment for 10-20
      minutes. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 5-7 days, at 6-12
      months, and at 24 months.
