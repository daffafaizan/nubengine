    
      Endophthalmitis, a severe inflammatory ocular condition with profound visual impairment that
      can lead to irreversible visual loss, requires immediate treatment.

      The only multicenter randomized trial of different forms of acute endophthalmitis treatment
      was the Endophthalmitis Vitrectomy Study. The study concluded that intravitreal antibiotic
      injection improves visual prognosis, and pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) improves the final
      visual acuity (VA) when performed in patients with light perception or worse VA.

      Our study will evaluate the efficacy of early PPV in acute endophthalmitis and attempt to
      prove its greater effectiveness for combating infection when compared to eyes that received
      only intravitreal antibiotic therapy.

      Primary Endpoint: The final VA, ocular anatomy, retinal layer anatomy, and ERG response in
      the intravitreal injection group will be compared with the PPV group.

      Secondary Endpoint: The final VA, eyeball anatomy, retinal layer anatomy, and ERG response in
      the group that underwent PPV will be compared with and without oral moxifloxacin therapy.
