    
      This Phase 1 dose-escalation study will use a classic dose escalation design to determine the
      MTD of TH-302 when used in combination with sunitinib. The study will be divided into two
      parts completed in succession to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for dose
      expansion.

      Part A:

      The dose of TH-302 will be escalated in cohorts of 3-6 subjects. The initial dose of TH-302
      will be 240 mg/m2. A Dose Level minus 1 and 2 will be built into the study in the event that
      subjects experience excessive toxicity at Dose Level 1. Dose escalation will continue with
      approximately 40% increases from the previous dose level; however lower dose increases of
      20-39% may be implemented after consultation between the Investigators, Medical Monitor and
      Sponsor with the percent increase dependent on the current dose level and the cumulative
      safety data.

      If a subject experiences a DLT, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled at that dose level for
      a total of 6 subjects in that cohort. If no additional DLTs are observed, dose escalation
      will resume. However, if 2 or more of 6 subjects within a cohort experience a DLT, that dose
      will be considered to exceed the MTD. The MTD will then be defined at the next lower dose
      level whereby 6 subjects were treated and < 1 subject experienced a DLT. The maximum dose of
      TH-302 will be 575 mg/m2.

      The MTD will be based on toxicities occurring during the first cycle.

      TH-302 will be administered by IV infusion over 30-60 minutes on Days 8, 15 and 22 of a
      42-day cycle (6 weeks).

      The dose of sunitinib will remain fixed: 50 mg administered PO daily on days 1 to 28 day of a
      42-day cycle (6 weeks). On days when both sunitinib and TH-302 are administered, sunitinib
      should be administered at least 2 hours before or at least 2 hours after completion of the
      TH-302 dose.

      Part B:

      Once the MTD from Part A has been determined, Part B can commence.

      The initial dose of TH-302 will be one dose level higher than the MTD established in Part A.
      The dose of TH-302 will be escalated in cohorts of 3-6 subjects. A Dose Level at the MTD
      established in Part A will be built into the study in the event that subjects experience
      excessive toxicity at the initial dose. Dose escalation will continue with approximately 40%
      increases from the previous dose level; however lower dose increases of 20-39% may be
      implemented after consultation between the Investigators, Medical Monitor and Sponsor with
      the percent increase dependent on the current dose level and the cumulative safety data.

      If a subject experiences a DLT, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled at that dose level for
      a total of 6 subjects in that cohort. If no additional DLTs are observed, dose escalation
      will resume. However, if 2 or more of 6 subjects within a cohort experience a DLT, that dose
      will be considered to exceed the MTD. The MTD will then be defined at the next lower dose
      level whereby 6 subjects were treated and < 1 subject experienced a DLT.

      The MTD will be based on toxicities occurring during the first cycle.

      TH-302 will be administered by IV infusion over 30-60 minutes on Days 8, 15 and 22 of a
      42-day cycle (6 weeks).

      The dose of sunitinib will remain fixed: 37.5 mg administered PO daily on days 1 to 28 of a
      42-day cycle (6 weeks).

      On days when both sunitinib and TH-302 are administered, sunitinib should be administered at
      least 2 hours before or at least 2 hours after completion of the TH-302 dose.

      An additional 10 RCC subjects will be enrolled at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for the
      dose expansion portion of the study.
