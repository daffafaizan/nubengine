      of exhaled air to differentiate active and inactive state of Crohn's Disease (CD). Although,
      the molecules found in this cohort have shown potential to differentiate between CD patients
      in remission or with active disease, the validation of the outcomes has to be performed in
      new population. One crucial pathophysiologic factor in CD is excessive lipid peroxidation
      during oxidative stress, i.e. during overproduction of oxidants compared to the protective
      antioxidants. Oxidative stress is a potential aetiological factor and/or a triggering factor
      in CD. Many volatile compounds including hydrocarbons and aldehydes are produced during
      oxidative stress and they can be non-invasively measured in exhaled air 5, 6. However,
      exhaled breath contains volatile metabolites originating from previous or current uptake of
      environmental contaminants, and more interestingly from metabolism of foreign organisms
      (bacteria, viruses, fungi or yeasts). Therefore, it is important to study not only exhaled
      air but also blood in which blood borne volatile molecules can be measured. Since the current
      study also aims for validating the use of volatile molecules in exhaled air as non-invasive
      markers for disease activity in CD patients, the investigators will compare the outcome of
      exhaled air analysis with currently established non-invasive measure of disease activity,
      i.e. fecal calprotectin.
