      collaterals and retrograde perfusion of the occluded arterial tree. Collateral perfusion
      sustains the penumbra and may lessen stroke severity provided recanalization of the occluded
      artery occurs. Thrombectomy attempts to achieve recanalization of the occluded artery, but
      36% of patients (90/252 in MERCI and MultiMERCI studies) experienced persistent arterial
      occlusion (PAO, defined as TICI flow 0-1). PAO following attempted thrombectomy was
      associated with high mortality, with 53% dead at 90 days. Of the survivors, only 5% achieved
      mRS of 0-2. At present, there are no therapies that have been shown to improve these risks.
      Data obtained from a clinically indicated CT at 24 hours will be used to monitor for safety.

      The safety endpoints for this study will be the proportion of patients who experience:

        -  Mortality and neurological deterioration (defined as an increase of â‰¥4 points on the
           NIHSS) at 5 days post treatment

        -  Change in neurological status and adverse events from baseline through 30 days from
           treatment

      Other endpoints include:

        -  Change in neurological status and adverse events from baseline through 90 days from
           treatment

        -  The incidence of hemorrhagic transformation or other intracerebral bleeding will be
           assessed at 5 days post treatment.

        -  Cerebral blood flow changes associated with device therapy will be assessed through
           multimodal CT or MRI studies acquired at baseline and 3 hours post treatment.

        -  Potential patient benefit will be assessed through collection of neurological indices
           (NIHSS etc.) at baseline, 24 hours post-procedure, day 5 (or discharge), 30 days and 90
           days.
