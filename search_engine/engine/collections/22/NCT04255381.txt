      key innovations: 1) A zone model predictive control strategy that is at the same time very
      safe with respect to hypoglycemia, and can simultaneously and independently be tuned with
      respect to its response to hyperglycemia; 2) Zone control with diurnal blood-glucose target
      zones; 3) Models of insulin-glucose physiology and insulin on board; 4) A system for alarming
      and notification of impending hypoglycemia and technical malfunctions: the Health Monitoring
      System. These features have been evaluated in several clinical trials in adults with
      unannounced meals and exercise.

      The proposed study will evaluate enhancements to our previous system tailored for the special
      needs of pediatric subjects: 1) A control strategy with responses to hyperglycemia and
      hypoglycemia spanning wide ranges, as is typical with children; 2) The use of time-dependent
      zones specific for pediatric subjects; 3) The development of models for young children,
      capturing the greater physiologic variability, and ensuring cautious insulin delivery; 4)
      remote alarming and notification systems that are useful to parents.
