      (MP-MRI) can be a marker for prostate cancer (PCa) aggressiveness and could be used to plan
      treatment. Gleason grade (GG) is a critical predictor of the aggressiveness of PCa, but in up
      to one in three men, the histology of radical prostatectomy specimens is different from the
      histology of Transrectal Ultrasound (TRUS)-guided biopsies. This discrepancy contributes to-
      and is a sign of- poor risk stratification of men with localised PCa.

      The research aims to answer the following questions:

        1. Can image-fusion techniques allow investigators to reliably target abnormal areas seen
           on MP-MRI?

        2. How reliable is pre-biopsy MP-MRI in correctly predicting aggressive disease?

      The investigators envisage that MP-MRI information will reduce unnecessary biopsies and
      over-detection of indolent PCa, while improving the detection of aggressive disease.

      Primary Objectives

      • To determine whether using MP-MRI can improve cancer detection and characterization of
      prostate cancer

      Secondary Objectives

      • To determine whether US/MRI FUSION guided biopsy can reduce the number of false negative
      biopsies.
