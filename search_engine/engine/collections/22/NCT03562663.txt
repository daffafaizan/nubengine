      robotic upper limb training in chronic hemiplegia, leads to clinical improvement in upperlimb
      motor impairment. In chronic stroke patients (>6months post-injury, stable unilateral motor
      deficit) using a within-subjects repeated-measures design we will evaluate the effects of 12
      weeks of robotic upperlimb training (3x/week, 36 sessions, shoulder/elbow/wrist in each
      session) with real or sham tDCS before the robotic training. Clinical improvement will be
      determined by a change in upper-limb Fugl-Meyer (primary), the Medical Research Council motor
      power score (MRC), Wolf Motor Function Test, Barthel Index, and Stroke Impact Scale
      (secondary) outcome measures following the training, and assessed again six months later.

      The investigators further aim to identify and compare the neurophysiological characteristics
      between intervention groups. The relationship between clinical improvement and
      neurophysiological measures pertaining to robotic motor training following stroke are
      presently not described in the literature. By measuring the EMG response from forearm
      musculature to Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation the investigators will establish: (i)
      plasticity associated with training, and (ii) the neurophysiological characteristics of
      patients who respond to training. By understanding how brain excitability changes underpin
      motor dysfunction, and motor recovery, interventions can be more effectively prescribed and
      prognoses established.
