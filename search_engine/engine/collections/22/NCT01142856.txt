      mesenchymal stem cells (MSC's) into the subarachnoid space of a patient with amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis (ALS). Cells will be isolated from adipose tissue by subcutaneous biopsy
      and expanded using an FDA-approved protocol. They will then be injected by lumbar puncture
      into the cerebrospinal fluid. Injection will be completed in the in- patient clinical
      research unit (CRU). the patient will be followed for two years.
