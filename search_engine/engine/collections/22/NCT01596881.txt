      be gathered prior to the study/OCT testing visit. At the single study/testing visit, subjects
      will have their blood pressure and intraocular pressure checked (using numbing drops that
      last 15-20 minutes), undergo vision testing and then have their eyes dilated with standard
      dilating drops. They will then undergo optical coherence tomography testing to determine the
      blood flow of the retinal blood vessels and to take other measurements of the back of the eye
      including thicknesses of the nervous tissue elements of the retina.

      OCT Procedure: The subject will be seated and have their head positioned on a chin rest. They
      will be asked to look at a target (a lighted spot) while a beam of light scans the front part
      of the eye. The light is infrared and will not be visible or cause any sensation. A cotton
      tip swab may be used to help hold the eyelid open temporarily if necessary.
