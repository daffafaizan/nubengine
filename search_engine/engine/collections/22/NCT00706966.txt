    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine whether there is a decrease in the extent of prostate cancer as measured by
           endorectal MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging in patients with symptomatic
           benign prostatic hypertrophy and low-risk prostate cancer treated with dutasteride for 6
           months.

      Secondary

        -  To monitor the effects of dutasteride on serum testosterone, dihydrotestosterone, and
           free and total prostate-specific antigen (PSA).

        -  To monitor the effects of dutasteride on symptom and quality-of-life indices.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral dutasteride once daily for 6 months.

      Patients undergo endorectal MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy imaging at baseline and
      at 1, 3, and 6 months.

      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires using the International Index of Erectile
      Function Questionnaire, American Urological Association Symptom Index, Functional Alterations
      due to Changes in Elimination, and Spitzer Quality-of-Life Index at baseline and at 1, 3, and
      6 months.
