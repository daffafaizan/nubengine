      patients with a lower limb trauma in winter sport resorts. The following initial data
      required are type of immobilization, treatment with LMWH (Low Molecular Weight Heparin), type
      of injury (serious or not) and the rolling of the step (normal or abnormal) or no weight
      bearing.

      A 3 month follow-up by phone will be realized by the Investigation Clinical Center in
      Grenoble. Data about risk factors of thromboembolic diseases, anticoagulant therapy, medical
      history, new event since inclusion (hospitalization, surgery, lower limb trauma or
      thromboembolic events) will be collected.
