      complications and may cause significant morbidity in patients with hematological
      malignancies. Interventions to decrease fibrin deposition have the potential to reduce
      CVC-related thrombosis and infections.

      At present heparin is most often used as locking solution for central venous catheters in
      hematological patients despite a lack of evidence regarding the efficacy and safety.
      Trisodium citrate (TSC) had been shown to be an effective antimicrobial catheter locking in
      hemodialysis patients.
