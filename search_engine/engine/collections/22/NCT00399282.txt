      fatty acids and vitamin E is effective in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis.

      Most of studies on omega-3 fatty acids (omega-3) supplementation in patients with rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) have clearly shown potentially beneficial changes in cytokine and eicosanoid
      metabolism. The overall clinical improvement, however, has been only moderate. One
      explanation is that an increased intake of omega-3 leads to a reduction in the availability
      of antioxidants and an increased generation of lipid peroxides. The majority of the
      anti-inflammatory drugs routinely used nowadays are COX (cyclo-oxygenase) inhibitors.
      Mechanism of COX II inhibitors is similar of omega-3. So, it is difficult to differentiate
      omega-3 net effects in some situations. Existing clinical trials on omega-3 and vitamin E
      (Vit E) are sometimes questioned due to using omega-6 fatty acids as placebo and neglecting
      omega-6 fatty acid intake in the diet. A comprehensive randomized controlled double-blind
      trial would have omega-6 fatty acids served as placebo in patients who are well matched in
      terms of therapies and drugs.

      Comparison(s): Comparison of groups supplemented with omega-3, omega-3 with Vit E, and
      placebo (Medium chain triglycerides: MCT).
