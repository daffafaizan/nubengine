      I. Identification of one of more lesions suspicious for prostate cancer using a novel MRI
      protocol, not identified by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) alone and to determine if the
      lesions identified by MRI demonstrate clinically significant prostate cancer based on
      pathologic findings (ie. Gleason >= 7 or percentage of core involved with cancer > 50%).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Average time for MRI scan per patient. II. Correlation of lesions on MRI to radical
      prostatectomy specimens. III. To determine whether MRI 3 dimensional (3D) T2 half-Fourier
      acquired single turbo spin-echo (HASTE) or sampling perfection with application optimized
      contrast using different flip angle evolutions (SPACE) protocols provide improved rates of
      prostate cancer detection.

      IV. Yield of additional clinically significant prostate cancer diagnoses based on MRI
      targeted lesions on biopsy.

      V. Rate of benign pathology identified by MRI (i.e. false positives). VI. To compare costs
      associated with the use of MRI over TRUS biopsy alone.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo pelvic MRI. Within 1-2 weeks, patients undergo scheduled prostate
      biopsy.
