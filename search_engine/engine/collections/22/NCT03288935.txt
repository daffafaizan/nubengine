      trauma-informed cultural orientation (TICO) interventions, respectively, in reducing
      resettlement distress and increasing coping capacity, which will improve emotional wellness
      and social adaptation and thus resettlement outcomes. This project will also test the
      interaction effects of two-tiered intervention model, discerning effective and ineffective
      components of the intervention model. Differences in effects across intervention conditions
      may inform how improvement in what outcomes or which phase can affect refugees' wellness and
      adjustment over time.
