      residual motor and functional deficits which have an impact on their participation and
      quality of live (Patel et al, 2006). Limitations on daily functioning may lead to physical
      inactivity and a sedentary lifestyle. Sustained physical inactivity (deconditioning) induces
      a reduction in aerobic capacity, which may further increase the risk of cardiovascular
      diseases in these individuals above that associated with stroke itself. Therefore, improving
      aerobic capacity may be essential in prevention of secondary diseases due to lack of fitness
      in the stroke population. Previous studies have also indicated that a critical level of
      aerobic capacity must be met in order to function independently (Cress et al, 2003).
      Therefore, in addition to disease prevention, enhancing aerobic capacity in individuals with
      stroke may also have beneficial effects on promoting functional abilities and independent
      living. It is also known that a limitation in functional performance is mostly associated
      with a restriction in social activities (ICIDH-2-model). Clearly, stroke survivors can
      benefit from counseling on participation in physical activity and exercise training. A recent
      meta-analysis (Pang et al, 2006) showed that there is good evidence to support the use of
      aerobic exercise to improve aerobic capacity in individuals with stroke. However, before
      going on that road, one needs to know more about the level of physical activity and physical
      fitness in the stroke population.
