      tolerance in long survival patients irradiated before for cancer and presenting with partial
      RIP of upper or lower legs.

      We calculated to include 60 patients to show a significant clinical difference between the
      two groups after 18 months of treatment: PENTOCLO [Pentoxifylline 400 (2x/d) + vitamine E 500
      (2x/d) + intermittent Clodronate 800 (2/d, 5d/7)] versus triple placebo, with prednisone 20
      (2d/7) for all patients.

      RIP is assessed before treatment and every 6 months by a standardized sensory-motor
      neurological (SOMA 95 modified by NCI-CTC 99) score used for main criteria at M18, and
      various neurological scales of assessment (Visual Analog Scale [VAS] for pain / VAS for
      paresthesia, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory [NPSI], Overall Disability Sum Score [ODSS],
      muscle testing, Nine hole peg test / Timed 25-Foot Walk), quality of life (SF36, Patient
      Global Impression of Change and Clinical Global impression of Change [PGIC/ CGIC]) and
      electrophysiology.
