      often neglected due to a lack of suitable and safe treatments. This study aims to evaluate
      the effectiveness of music compared to sleep hygiene on sleep quality in a population of
      first-time pregnant women in the final stages of pregnancy. A post pregnancy follow-up will
      be completed to test if potential effects of the treatment might last into early motherhood
      (1-3 months postpartum).
