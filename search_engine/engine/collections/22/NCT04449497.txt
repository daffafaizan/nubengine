      and there has been follow-up on actions outlined in the 2014 World Health Assembly (WHA)
      Resolution on palliative care. The WHA Resolution called countries to action to integrate
      palliative care into their national health strategies and as part of universal health
      coverage (UHC) efforts. Further, important contributions have been made to the literature on
      palliative care overall and at the end of life, such as by the Lancet Commission on Global
      Access to Palliative Care and Pain Relief as well as on quality healthcare.

      Through this research, the Quality of Death and Dying Index will be published and it seeks to
      facilitate monitoring of country-level progress based on domains/sub-domains and indicators
      used to define quality of death and dying in the discourse on end-of-life care, and within
      the context of the contrasting realities occurring worldwide. Examining the various
      trajectories that countries have followed and the experiences of end-of-life care design and
      delivery by countries from different income groups and based on the viewpoint of diverse
      stakeholders will provide critical information for metrics development, namely the 2020
      Quality of Death and Dying Index
