      patients with and without pneumonitis from anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1. Prior experience of the
      investigators of training and validating radiomics signatures combined with their preliminary
      exploratory results presented here, will be used to develop a radiomics signature for immune
      checkpoint-induced pneumonitis in 40 patients with a pulmonary event under anti-PD1 or
      anti-PD-L1 (cases) and 40 patients without a pulmonary event under anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1
      (controls).

      On the basis of the case-control study of patients treated with anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1, the
      investigators will be able to further optimise the model using reinforcement machine
      learning. The model will then be validated in 300 prospective patients.
