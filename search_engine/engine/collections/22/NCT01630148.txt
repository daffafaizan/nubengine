      thromboembolic events (VTE), are two major complications after gynaecological surgeries that
      can result in significant morbidity and mortality. The incidence of VTE after gynaecologic
      surgery varies depending on the method used for diagnosis. The rate of clinical DVT is
      estimated to be 3% after gynaecological surgery if no thromboprophylaxis was used. The rate
      of VTE assumed to decrease to 0.4% if Low molecular weight heparin was used as a
      thromboprophylaxis.

      According to our knowledge there are no published researches on the effect of the new second
      generation Low molecular Weight Heparin Bemiparin as a thromboprophylaxis after benign
      gynaecological surgery in comparison to a control group.
