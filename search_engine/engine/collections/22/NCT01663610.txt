      structure and remembrance of everyday tasks. The automation by smartphones of these tasks
      away from caregivers to the individual is a process that is both time saving and positive for
      the individuals sense of autonomy.

      There is too little research to date to say with clarity that smartphones is this tool for
      most of the patient group but many patients with ADHD report that a smartphone system for
      organisation and remembrance is a key that helps many live a more meaningful life.

      The best way to teach these skills has not yet been proven. There is a clear advantage with
      teaching courses concerning IT in an online setting since hyperlinks and other texts can be
      easily forwarded and the course participants can easily use premade calendars and other
      tools. This research will try to determine if this type of online course is helpful for these
      patients.

      VardagsSMART is an online course which will be compared to a waiting list controll group
      (CONT) which weekly records how they manage their ADHD symptoms.

      The main purpose of this study is to examine whether the VardagsSMART course have a positive
      effect for the patient group. An untreated control group is used to ensure that the effects
      are not only due to spontaneous improvement. The control group will afterwards be offered the
      course without therapist support (SelfSMART), in order to make a preliminary evaluation of
      the importance of therapist support.
