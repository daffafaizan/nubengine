      adjuvant therapy for metastatic colorectal cancer patients. All of six extracts have been
      used in human with a long history, and many literatures reported the medicinal use either
      individually or as ingredients of formulations. MB-6 may provide its therapeutic benefits via
      inhibition of tumor induction or enhancing the efficacy of chemotherapy in colorectal cancer.
