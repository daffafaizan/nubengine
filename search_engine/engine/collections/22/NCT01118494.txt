           Renal B-mode ultrasonography and so on.

        2. Confirm: Sign consent with the patients who meet the inclusion criteria, then these
           patients are included in the study.

        3. Create patients records and complete related-inspections.

        4. Clinical follow-up: Follow-up once every six months, and we will record every patient's
           disease progress every time. Each follow-up, the patient needs to leave 5 ml blood
           samples and 20 ml of urine samples, used for the following study.

        5. Detection, Observation and Evaluation: Patients are divided into two groups according to
           AGT levels: higher than the normal group and the normal group. Observe the changes in
           eGFR of different group. Statistics judge whether AGT can be as a early warning
           indicators of renal function decline.
