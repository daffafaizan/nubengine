      to usual range MAP (40 to 60 mmHg; n = 5) or intervention group MAP (60 to 80 mmHg; n = 5)
      during CPB. MD catheters were positioned in a retrograde direction in the internal jugular
      vein and a reference catheter was inserted into the brachial artery. The relations between LP
      ratio, MAP, data obtained from bi-frontal NIRS and neurological outcome measures were
      assessed.
