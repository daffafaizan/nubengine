    
      A randomised, double blind, placebo controlled study with parallel groups investigating a 6
      week intervention in 6-8 year old school children of phospholipid containing milk drink vs.
      placebo milk drink. Participants were familiarised with the test battery and IQ (Wechsler
      abbreviated scale of intelligence) and colour blindness (Ishihara test) measurements were
      taken prior to the intervention. Milk drink taste testing and milk preference selection was
      also carried out prior to the intervention. The test battery was administered at baseline
      (week 0), midpoint (week 3) and endpoint (week 6), and the milk intervention was given Monday
      - Friday at school shortly before their mid-morning break over a 6 week period. This study
      design, including both the test days and morning milk supplementation, was intended to
      emulate the children's normal routine as far as possible. The milk drink was a supplement to
      the children's usual diet.
