      weeks. Patients will continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable adverse
      reaction, patients' wish or other reason of discontinuation. During follow-up, patients who
      discontinue the study treatment due to progression of the disease will be followed every 3
      months (12 weeks) for further anti-myeloma therapies, progression free survival to the second
      progression and survival, until death or the cut-off date, whichever comes first. Patients
      who discontinue the study treatment prior to documentation of disease progression will be
      followed-up every 4 weeks until confirmation of disease progression, and then every 3 months
      (12 weeks) for further anti-myeloma therapies, progression free survival to the second
      progression and survival, until death or the cut-off date, whichever comes first. After
      progression free survival analysis, patients will be followed yearly for 3 years for
      survival.
