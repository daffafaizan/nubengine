      modulation of immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor
      microenvironment. The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      masitinib in combination with gemcitabine as compared with single agent gemcitabine in
      advanced or metastatic epithelial ovarian cancer patients who are refractory to platinum
      treatment. This is an open-label, randomized, active-controlled, phase 2/3 study. The study's
      primary efficacy measure will be overall survival. Masitinib will be prescribed until disease
      progression (or treatment switch to next line of treatment), death, limiting toxicity or
      patient consent withdrawal. The study design is a two-stage adaptive design, meaning that it
      includes a prospectively planned opportunity for modification of one or more specified
      aspects of the study (for example patient enrollment).
