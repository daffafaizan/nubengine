    
      This is a Phase I open-label, single oral dose and single center study of 14C-labelled GFT505
      and its metabolites in healthy subjects.

      After an overnight fast, subjects will be administered one dose of 14C-labelled GFT505
      containing an equivalent of 120 mg of the compound with 240 mL of non-carbonated water. The
      total amount of administered radiocarbon will be 1.63-1.81 megaBecquerel (MBq) (44.1-48.8
      Î¼Ci).

      Blood, urine, and feces will be collected at scheduled time intervals from before
      administration of the radiolabelled study drug throughout confinement at the clinical center
      and thereafter, if needed. Several samples of expired carbon dioxide will be obtained up to
      48 h after the administration of radiolabelled study drug.

      Radiocarbon will be assayed in all available samples (whole blood, plasma, urine, feces, and
      expired air) by liquid scintillation spectrometry. The metabolic profile of GFT505 will be
      assayed in plasma, urine, and feces. Non-radioactive pharmacokinetics of GFT505 and its
      principle metabolite GFT1007 will be assayed in plasma and urine. Other metabolites will be
      investigated in plasma and urine according to the radioactivity results. Non-radioactive
      pharmacokinetics of GFT505 and metabolites in feces will be investigated according to the
      radioactivity results.
