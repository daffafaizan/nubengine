      Danish birth cohort of men born in 1953 in the Metropolitan area of Copenhagen.

      Test-persons are divided among three groups based on performance in cognitive tests at late
      midlife compared to young adulthood; 1) Positive expected performance, 2) expected
      performance and 3) negative expected performance and sampled from a birth cohort of 11.532
      men.

      Researchers aim to identify factors earlier in life that affect or predict changes in
      cognitive function, specifically of cognitive decline in order to predict healthy vs
      unhealthy cognitive aging, including progression to possible dementia. The objective is to be
      able to predict cognitive decline in aging.

      During the four years of data collection approximately 300-400 participants will be included
      and examined.

      The examinations include cognitive test including Cambridge Neuropsychological test automated
      Battery (CANTAB); sleep, life events and depression questionnaire; blood sample analysis
      including functional analyses of mitochondria and gen analyses such as genome scanning, SNP
      analysis, ApoE Îµ-type; structural and functional changes in the brain measured with magnetic
      resonance (fMRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings of electrical activity and
      visual attention.

      The results from these studies will hopefully point to new avenues for intervention in order
      to change the course of brain aging.
