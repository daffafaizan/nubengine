        -  Determine the response rate in children and adolescents with B-cell non-Hodgkin's
           lymphoma (B-NHL) or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) treated with rituximab
           monotherapy as upfront window therapy before chemotherapy.

        -  Evaluate the effect of rituximab on different histological subtypes of childhood mature
           B-NHL or B-ALL in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Investigate the rituximab response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of rituximab in these patients.

        -  Collect pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data from patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 79 patients will be accrued for this study.
