      maximal hyperemia (increased blood flow) as adenosine, the other vasodilator agent. There
      were only 2 days on study for each subject.

      On Day 1 of the study, subjects were interviewed and had a physical exam, including a resting
      12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) to exclude evidence of silent ischemia or myocardial
      infarction, and other cardiovascular disorders. Subjects were instructed to have a light meal
      at least 4 hours prior to the PET MPI. Subjects were instructed to abstain from
      caffeine-containing products for 24 hours prior to the PET scan. Day 1 of the study occurred
      less than or equal to 4 weeks of Day 2.

      On Day 2 of the study, each subject underwent three PET N-13 ammonia (10-20 mCi) dynamic
      emission acquisitions: resting, regadenoson (0.4 mg/5 mL IV), and adenosine (140
      microgram/kg/min; order of regadenoson vs adenosine was randomized according to subject's
      birth year), and three transmission acquisitions for attenuation correction. Each emission
      acquisition was separated by 50 min to allow for radioactive decay. At the end of the drug
      infusions, subjects were monitored for 5-30 min. Based on the known short biological
      half-lives of these stress agents, the pharmacologic effects of each drug should have
      dissipated by the time the next drug was administered.
