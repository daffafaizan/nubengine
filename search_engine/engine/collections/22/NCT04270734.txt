      neuronal network organization at an early stage or later in the course of development. The
      disruption of the initial set-up could partially explain the prevalence of neurodevelopmental
      risks due to prematurity. The development period between 25 and 33 wGA corresponds to the
      period of very great prematurity and represents a key period of neurodevelopment in terms of
      structural and functional establishment of neuronal networks. One way to address the
      functionality of the neuronal networks is to evaluate the neural response to the exogenous
      stimuli and to interpret the mechanisms and the developmental status of the network in their
      ability to develop appropriate responses.
