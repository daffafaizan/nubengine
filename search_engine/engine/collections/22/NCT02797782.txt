      anti-HBs and an anamnestic response. Recommendations for booster vaccination have been
      proposed in a European consensus statement. Countries like the Netherlands, Germany, Spain,
      France and Belgium recommend a booster dose depending on the post-vaccination anti-HBs titer.
      In the UK, a single booster dose is recommended five years after primary vaccination.

      In Egypt, the routine infant immunization for hepatitis B virus started in 1992, and was
      given at 2nd, 4th and 6th months of age. In the present study the investigators will
      investigate the long term efficacy of hepatitis B vaccination in young adults 20 to 22 years
      after the primary vaccination in Nile Delta of Egypt.
