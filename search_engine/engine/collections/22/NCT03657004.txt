      lung disease. However, despite significant advances in treatment after LTx, comorbidities and
      medical complications contribute to a major extend to the high morbidity and mortality rate.
      Chronic kidney disease is common in patients after lung transplantation, and a large
      proportion of these patients ultimately progress to end-stage renal disease requiring
      dialysis. Chronic calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity is one of the major risk factors for
      the development of chronic kidney disease. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors
      such as everolimus have been increasingly used in combination with calcineurin inhibitors to
      reduce nephrotoxicity. However, whether a mTOR inhibitor based immunosuppressive regime leads
      to lower chronic nephrotoxicity remains unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate whether
      the switch of the standard immunosuppressive regime after LTx with
      mycophenolate/tacrolimus/prednisolon to everolimus/tacrolimus/prednisolon is associated with
      an improved long-term preservation of renal function without increase in rejection rate.
