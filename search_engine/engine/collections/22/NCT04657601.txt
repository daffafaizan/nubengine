    
      This study is a prospective, post-market evaluation of the performance of the DiLumen C2
      Endolumenal Interventional Platform ("C2 device") used as an endoscopic dual balloon
      accessory device used to ensure complete positioning, visualization, and diagnosis in
      endoscopic treatments in the large intestine. The DiLumen Endolumenal Interventional Knife
      ("IK device") and the DiLumen Endolumenal Interventional Grasper ("IG device") are disposable
      instruments used with the C2 device. These devices are cleared by the US Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for commercial use in endolumenal therapies and will be used on-label in
      this study. The overall goal of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the C2
      device and its related instruments. Intra-procedure parameters (procedure timepoints,
      anesthesia use, polyp location and description), final pathology/histology, and general
      complications will also be evaluated. Investigators will also be asked to assess the ease of
      use of the C2Interventional Platform.

      To accomplish this goal, up to 100 subjects will be enrolled at up to 5 clinical sites and
      treated using the C2 device and related instruments. Evaluations will be performed
      pre-procedure, during the procedure, and at discharge. Assessments will include polyp
      classification/pathology, procedure timepoints, final pathology/histology, adverse events,
      and ease of use. As per the FDA cleared product labeling this study will be limited to
      subjects undergoing an endoscopic procedure to remove polyps in the large intestine.
