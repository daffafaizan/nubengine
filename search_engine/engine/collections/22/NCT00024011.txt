      I. Determine the progression-free survival at 18 weeks and overall survival of patients with
      metastatic malignant melanoma treated with PS-341.

      II. Determine the objective response rate of patients treated with this drug. III. Correlate
      p27 levels in tumor tissue with objective response rate in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive PS-341 IV over 3-5 seconds on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 2 years after registration.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
