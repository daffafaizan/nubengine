      schizophrenia who are smokers. The primary intervention is a switch in the subject's
      antipsychotic to aripiprazole, flexibly dosed between 15-30 mg/day. The outcome measures
      include a rating of smoking behavior using the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence, and
      saliva cotinine obtained at baseline and endpoint. Secondary measures include weight, serum
      glucose and lipids, rating of symptom severity using the PANSS, and both ratings and
      instrumental measures of motor functioning. We anticipate enrolling up to 25 subjects to
      obtain the needed 15 completers at the week 8 endpoint.
