    
      Using the Judge-Advisor System, we will recruit clinicians working in palliative care for
      adults. Participants will be asked to complete an online survey and review five patient
      summaries ("vignettes") based on real cases derived from a previous study. Clinicians will be
      presented with key prognostic information and will be asked to provide an estimate of the
      probability that the patient will survive for two weeks (0-100%). After providing this
      initial estimate, participants will receive prognostic advice. While in reality all
      participants will receive the same advice, participants will be randomised into two groups
      and these groups will be informed that the advice is either: (1) provided by an algorithm; or
      (2) provided by a team colleague. Participants will then be given the opportunity to give a
      second, possibly revised estimate in the light of the advice received.
