      surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), used in previous risk prediction models
      (EUROSCORE, CABDEAL, Cleveland), will be compared with new candidate variables:

        1. anamnestic: recent tooth extractions, chronic inflammatory diseases, specific drug use;

        2. biochemical: C-reacting protein, interleukin-6, tumor necrosing factor alpha;

        3. genetical: single nucleotide polymorphisms of 10 genes associated with inflammatory
           response; and

        4. clinical from the 1. postoperative day: systemic inflammatory response syndrome,
           APACHE-III score;

      against their predictive capability of selected clinical phenotypes of inflammatory response
      occuring after surgery, beginning from day 2. after surgery.
