      synergistic effect in patients with advanced ovarian cancer, especially those with Homologous
      recombination deficiency (HRD), because of the decreased ability to repair
      chemotherapy-induced DNA damage. Preclinical studies with PARP inhibitors have shown
      potentiation of the cytotoxic effects of chemotherapeutic agents and a recent phase I study
      has shown the tolerability of the combination and efficacy in recurrent ovarian cancer. In
      this study, encouraging efficacy results were seen in ovarian cancer patients and were not
      limited by Germline BRCA1/2 (gBRCA) Mutations status or sensitivity to platinum therapy.
