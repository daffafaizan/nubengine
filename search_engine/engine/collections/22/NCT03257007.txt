      improved spiritual well-being in adult cancer patients. These beneficial effects may occur
      through present-moment acceptance of unpleasant thoughts, feelings, and circumstances and
      adaptive coping through self-awareness, self-regulation, and self-transcendence. Most
      mindfulness trials in cancer have focused on early-stage survivors; however, preliminary
      evidence suggests that mindfulness may help reduce distress in patients with advanced cancer
      and their family caregivers (FCGs).

      Sixty patients with an advanced-stage solid malignancy and their FCGs (60 dyads) will be
      randomized in equal numbers to receive either the 6-week mindfulness intervention or usual
      care. Both groups will receive standard cancer care throughout the study period. Dyads
      randomized to the mindfulness arm will learn mindfulness meditation practices (e.g., body
      scan, sitting meditation) and mindful communication practices to enhance quality of life,
      support advance care planning engagement, and improve a variety of secondary outcomes.

      The study will use a mixed methods 2-arm randomized design to examine the effects of the
      mindfulness intervention compared to usual care and seek to explain trial results using
      insights gleaned from post-intervention qualitative interviews.
