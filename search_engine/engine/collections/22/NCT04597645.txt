      elastic band intervention group (EB) or control group (CG). Both groups will received a
      baseline: dual X-ray absorptiometry body composition, physical capacity, and serum markers
      examinations. EB will then receive a 16-week progressive elastic band resistance exercise
      training, while the CG will receive usual care. After the 16 weeks from the baseline
      assessment, a followed-up: dual X-ray absorptiometry body composition, physical capacity, and
      serum examinations will be assessed.
