    
      STUDY DESIGN: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of
      the effects of VGB compared to placebo control on the physiological and subjective effects of
      IV infusions of cocaine (cocaine experienced volunteers).

      Subjects will be randomized within each clinical site to one of four groups (placebo control
      or one of three doses of VGB twice daily).During VGB steady state dosing, subjects will
      receive double-blind infusions of saline and cocaine. Subjects will be asked to return for
      follow-up approximately 7 and 14 days after the day of clinic discharge.

      STUDY DURATION: The maximum duration is 56 days, including 14 inpatient days of assessments
      and investigational products administration, and two follow-up visits after clinic discharge.

      SAMPLE SIZE: Twenty-four subjects will be randomized to one of three doses of vigabatrin or
      placebo.

      POPULATION: Volunteer, cocaine-experienced, non-treatment seeking cocaine users, 18 to 45
      years of age.
