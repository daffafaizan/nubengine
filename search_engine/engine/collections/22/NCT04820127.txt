    
      PERSON-AL is a multicentric, interventional, open-label, randomized, parallel-group,
      stratified by centre, study comparing two arms: usual care versus intervention (personalized
      care preceded by a standardized assessment)

      Principal Objective : To evaluate the impact of a personalized intervention for the
      management of agitation due to psycho-behavioral symptoms on the use of scheduled and
      unscheduled hospitalizations at 18 months in patients with AD and related disorders.

      Secondary Objectives:

      A- To evaluate the impact of a personalized intervention at 18 months on:

      For the patient:

        1. Unscheduled hospitalizations,

        2. Severity of agitation symptoms,

        3. The frequency and severity of emerging psycho-behavioral symptoms, other than agitation,

        4. Prescription of psychotropic drugs,

        5. Quality of life.

           For the caregiver:

        6. Distress related to psycho-behavioral symptoms,

        7. All causes hospitalizations,

        8. Quality of life.

      B- Evaluate the medico-economic impact of this personalized intervention, and in particular:

        1. Its efficiency compared to usual management by means of cost-effectiveness and
           cost-utility analyses, from the community perspective and over a time horizon of 18
           months,

        2. The actual cost of patient's standardized assessment and personalized management

        3. The use of care and associated costs for the caregiver and the efficiency of caregiver
           targeted intervention.
