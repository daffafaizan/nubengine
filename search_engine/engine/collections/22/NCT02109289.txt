    
      This study is a 16 week, single center, open label trial, to study the effect of etanercept
      on vascular inflammation of the ascending aorta and carotid arteries in patients with
      rheumatoid arthritis (RA).

      Patients with active RA already receiving methotrexate for at least 3 months will receive
      etanercept for 16 weeks. Etanercept will be administered sub-cutaneously using the dose
      approved in the Canadian product monograph for RA (50 mg every week). Patients will continue
      methotrexate at a stable dose during the study unless a dose reduction or cessation is
      required as judged necessary by the study investigator. Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
      Scan will be performed at baseline and after16 weeks of study treatment with etanercept. At
      the end of the study, all PET Scan images will be analyzed in a blinded manner by the
      Montreal Heart Institute core laboratory.

      Safety will be assessed using adverse events collection and laboratory hematology and
      chemistry analysis (screening and Week 4) and pregnancy test.
