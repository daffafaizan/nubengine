      inappropriate and ongoing activation of the mucosal immune system in response to the presence
      of normal luminal flora. This aberrant response is most likely facilitated by defects in both
      the barrier function and the mucosal immune system of the intestinal epithelium. Syndecans
      are a class proteoglycans that take part in both cell adhesion and growth factor binding. Of
      the four known syndecan core proteins, syndecan-1 (CD138) and one of the best studied of this
      group and is also the relevant to the this study as it is expressed on the basolateral
      surface of columnar epithelial cells of the colon. Syndecan-1 functions as an integral
      membrane protein that participates in cell proliferation, cell migration and cell matrix
      interactions in the GI tract. Evidence for a reduction of syndecan-1 expression in the
      regenerating epithelium that overlies inflamed tissue was reported in both acute and chronic
      inflammation. This protein that is lost from the inflamed mucosal membrane might shed to the
      serum. Elevated serum levels of syndecan-1 may be predictive of disease presence and extent.
