      evaluating symptoms they are currently having. This survey should take approximately 10
      minutes to complete.

      Individuals will then be scheduled for a 30 minute telephone visit to review common emotional
      stressors experienced after Stem Cell Transplant/CAR-T therapy as well as strategies to help
      reduce these symptoms. They will be provided with a pamphlet to review during the visit and
      on their own time afterwards. This visit will be conducted by telephone to avoid extra travel
      to the hospital, and will be conducted prior to admission for Transplant/CAR-T.

      Individuals will then be asked to fill out the same set of surveys at 1 month, 3 months, 6
      months, and 12 months after their transplant/CAR-T therapy. These surveys will be conducted
      during other scheduled clinic visits to avoid additional travel to the hospital.

      An individual's involvement will be complete at 1 year.

      If an individual receives their post-transplant/CAR-T care at a hospital other than DHMC,
      surveys will be mailed to them to complete and return at the same time points.
