      treatment remain limited. Compared to other abusable substances, there has been little
      investigation of pharmacotherapies for cannabis dependence and no effective pharmacotherapy
      for cannabis dependence has been developed yet. As such, the development of effective
      cannabis dependence pharmacotherapy is an important unmet public health need. Lofexidine, an
      alpha-2 agonist, is effective in treating opioid withdrawal and shows promise as cannabis use
      disorder pharmacotherapy, though its use may be limited by a cumbersome (thrice daily) dosing
      regimen. An alpha-2-agonist with a longer half-life, such as guanfacine, may have some of the
      same benefits as lofexidine at comparable doses, but its easier (once daily) dosing regimen
      may promote compliance and treatment retention. The purpose of this study is therefore to
      determine whether guanfacine represents a tolerable, potentially effective pharmacotherapy
      option for cannabis dependence. This pilot study can also provide the basis for subsequently
      conducting a larger study aimed at determining efficacy with the appropriate randomized,
      placebo-controlled design.
