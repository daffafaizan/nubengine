        -  Determine the antitumor activity of doxorubicin HCl liposome in patients with persistent
           or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study.
