      platin-based simultaneous radiochemotherapy (RCT) (Pignon JP et al., Lancet
      2000;355:949-955). However, irradiation dose is still debatable regarding local tumor control
      and late toxicity. Moreover, it is still unclear which combination of different drugs might
      be more effective.

      In recent years, new drugs have been introduced in the field of head and neck cancer. The
      Taxanes, namely Docetaxel and Paclitaxel, have been investigated in several phase
      I/II-studies, and showed promising results concerning locoregional control rates and survival
      data. The RTOG 97-03 trial (Garden et al., J Clin Oncol 2004; 22:2856-64) compared a RCT
      either with Cisplatin/5-FU or Cisplatin/Paclitaxel. In this phase II-study an improvement of
      local tumor control and disease free survival of 15-20% in favour of the Cisplatin/Paclitaxel
      treatment arm was seen.

      Therefore, our phase III-trial compares a standard RCT (70.6 Gy) with Cisplatin/5-FU to a RCT
      with Cisplatin/Paclitaxel and reduced irradiation dose (63.6 Gy). Primary endpoint is to
      proof superiority of the experimental Cisplatin/Paclitaxel treatment arm concerning
      disease-free-survival. Secondary endpoints are locoregional tumor control, overall survival
      and quality of life.
