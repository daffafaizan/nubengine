      T cell numbers between treatment groups. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. Compare post-vaccination
      anti-rabies antibody titers between treatment groups. II. Compare post-vaccination cytokine
      levels, including IL1, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL7, IL8, IL10, IL12, INFgamma, TNFalpha, between
      treatment groups. III. Compare post-vaccination anti-rabies ELISPOT reaction between
      treatment groups. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients
      receive oral lopinavir and oral ritonavir twice daily for 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive no therapy. All patients then
      receive a neo-antigen rabies vaccine.
