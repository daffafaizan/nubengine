      disturbance, and tenderness on palpation at trigger points in the musculoskeletal system.

      Fibromyalgia prevalence is reported between 3% and 9%, and is three times more common in
      women than men. Although pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches play a role in
      the treatment of the disease, the interest in non-pharmacological therapies has recently
      increased. In several studies, it has been shown that almost every fibromyalgia patient has
      applied at least one alternative and complementary medicine method such as Qigong, Tai Chi,
      yoga, mind body interventions, acupuncture, hydrotherapy, balneotherapy or phytotherapy.

      Neural therapy is a regulation therapy that tries to correct this underlying autonomic
      dysfunction. In neural therapy; local painful areas, trigger points and symptomatic segments
      are included in the injection using local anesthetics and the underlying disruptive areas are
      investigated and treated. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy of neural
      therapy in fibromyalgia syndrome which is thought to have a neuroendocrine dysregulation
      disorder.
