      protocol number: 0163/10.

      49 adults with tinnitus and sensorineural hearing loss were randomly assigned into 2 groups.
      Both groups received counseling about tinnitus. One group received hearing aids with only
      amplification and the other group received hearing aids with an integrated sound generator.
      After the fitting process, both groups were told to use the hearing devices 8 hours per day.
      The outcome measures as the tinnitus handicap inventory and psychoacoustics measurements were
      conducted by a blind audiologist that didn't know each group each patient belonged to.
