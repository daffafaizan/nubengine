    
      HYPOTHESIS: Administration of supraphysiologic doses of parenteral AA in the perioperative
      period for patients undergoing liver transplantation will improve Sequential Organ Failure
      Assessment (SOFA) scores, vasopressor usage and biochemical, cellular and clinical end-organ
      damage.

      Specific Aim: Determine the clinical response to parenteral AA supplementation in patients
      undergoing liver transplantation by a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled clinical
      trial.

      Study Design: This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized trial in which 90
      participants will be enrolled at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics (UWHC).
      Participants must meet study eligibility criteria and be scheduled to undergo primary
      deceased donor solitary liver transplantation. Participants will be randomized to receive 8
      doses of 1500 mg AA IV or volume-equivalent placebo every 6 hours for 48 hours, in addition
      to standard medical management.
