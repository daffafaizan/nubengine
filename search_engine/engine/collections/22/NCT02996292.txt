      the 3 dimensional important in order to evaluate the root positions and to investigate EARR
      in multi root teeth, so the research will depend on CBCT to carry out these purposes in our
      study. Beside to compare the duration of alignment among groups.

      Fixed appliances will be applied into three groups as 1. Active self ligating brackets
      (ASLB), 2. Passive self ligating brackets (PSLB), 3. Conventional brackets (CB) until reach
      to wire 19*25 S.S upper and lower. During leveling, thermal activated wires will be used in
      all patients.

      CBCT images will be done before and after leveling and alignment of teeth to compare
      dentoalveolar changes between study groups.
