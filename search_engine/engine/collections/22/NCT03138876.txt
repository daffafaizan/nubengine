      to institution best practice, then consented participants will undergo placement of a large
      size, 20-channel EEG cap from Electro-Cap International with a Natus E-2-2520-26 electrode
      board adapter with initiation of recording. The placement of the EEG cap will be restricted
      to residents formally trained in its placement by an EEG tech. This study will only be
      performed during times when EEG techs are not available onsite for rapid placement of
      standard 21-channel EEG electrodes, such as during night-call shifts.

      Prior to placement of EEG cap, evaluating staff member will request immediate
      standard-electrode EEG. The investigators will record time from neurology consultation
      request to placement of EEG cap as well as time from consultation request to obtaining a
      standard EEG. The investigators will also record time to confirmation or exclusion of NCSE.
      Initial diagnosis or exclusion of NCSE will be performed by on call resident, if the resident
      received prior training regarding EEG cap placement, and attending. Secondary quality
      assessment will be performed by two independent EEG interpreters blinded to clinical history.
      Secondary assessment will be qualified as acceptable or inacceptable interpretation based on
      whether greater or less than 50% of the recording is judged interpretable. Secondary
      assessment will also include interpretation of NCSE by a third independent reader if there is
      disagreement between first two. The number of patients excluded from the study will also be
      recorded, including the reason for exclusion.
