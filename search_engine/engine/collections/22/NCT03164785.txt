      diabetes and is the leading cause of end-stage renal disease. Intensive glycemic and blood
      pressure control, combined with renin - angiotensin system blocking therapy (including ACEI
      and ARB drugs), has to a certain extent, delayed the progression of DKD, but still cannot
      completely block its development. Cordyceps sinensis is a traditional Chinese medicine and
      Jinshuibao Capsule is its artificial preparation, with the effect of renoprotection. However,
      its clinical application in diabetic kidney disease is not well-defined so far. The aim of
      this study is to investigate the potential use of Jinshuibao Capsule on microalbuminuria in
      T2DM.
