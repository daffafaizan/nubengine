      6th (or last) Radium- 223 treatment. Every blood draw prior to Radium-223 treatment At
      baseline, tests include (but not restricted to): Testosterone, vitamin D-25-OH (Calciferol),
      C-reactive protein, Rank Ligand, IL6, BSAF, P1NP and CTX. Patients need to be fasting when
      blood is collected. (2x8,5 ml gel tube; Limited to 100 patients in selected centres). Before
      2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th (or last) Radium-223 treatment, tests include (but not restricted to):
