      Conjunctival Allergen Challenge (CAC) model, which reproduces the signs and symptoms of
      Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis by replicating the natural disease process. Patients
      demonstrating a positive reaction to the CAC at Visit 1 (screening) and Visit 2
      (confirmatory) were randomized to treatment at Visit 3 (Day 0). The test article was
      instilled at Visit 3, with treatment efficacy CAC performed at 24 hours duration of action.
      The test article was instilled again at Visit 4 (Day 14), with treatment efficacy CAC
      performed at 16 hours duration of action. The test article was instilled a final time at
      Visit 5 (Day 21), with treatment efficacy performed at onset of action.
