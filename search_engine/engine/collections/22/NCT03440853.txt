      fatigue, pain and depression among the most debilitating and existing as symptom clusters.
      These symptom clusters can exacerbate one another, and are independent and strong predictors
      of poor health-related quality of life in hemodialysis patients. This study will look at the
      effect of a 12 week stepped care intervention on changes in depression, pain or fatigue and
      health related quality of life.
