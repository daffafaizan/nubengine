      acetate every 4 weeks and testosterone replacement every 2 weeks. Hormone levels are tested
      every other week.

      If luteinizing hormone and follicular-stimulating hormone levels are at or below detection on
      day 56, blood is drawn for a testis-stimulating factor bioassay and subsequent factor
      purification and characterization.

      Volunteers are asked to repeat this 2-month procedure no more than 2 times every 12 months.
