      soft contact lenses as randomized for 2 weeks each. Subjects were assessed using a
      standardised driving simulation for each of the two treatments. A fresh pair of lenses was
      dispensed for the assessment. Subjects also wore lotrafilcon B single vision distance (SVD)
      and comfilcon A MF contact lenses during Period 1 and Period 2 respectively for an additional
      same-day assessment. Habitual correction was worn for an acclimatization drive in the driving
      simulator during Period 1.
