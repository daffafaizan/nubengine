      personal hygiene. In the community, hand hygiene has been known to prevent infectious
      diseases and to decrease the burden of disease. Currently, hand hygiene is considered the
      most important measure for preventing the spread of pathogens in health-care settings.

      There are multiple agents used for surgical hand scrubbing as alcohol, chlorhexidine,
      iodine/iodophors, para-chloro-meta-xylenol & triclosan. Ideally, the optimum antiseptic used
      for scrub should have broad spectrum of activity, persistent effect & fast acting.
      Unfortunately most studies evaluating surgical scrub antiseptics have focused on measuring
      hand bacterial colony counts. No randomized clinical trials have evaluated the impact of
      surgical scrub choice on surgical site infection risk & proven its efficiency.
