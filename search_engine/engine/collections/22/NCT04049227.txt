    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether there are changes in Ki-67 expression from the pretreatment specimen
      (e.g. biopsy or dilation and curettage [D&C]) to the post-treatment hysterectomy specimen
      following treatment with letrozole and abemaciclib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the proportion of tumors with complete cell cycle arrest (CCCA) response as
      measured by Ki-67 expression between the pre-treatment tumor and the posttreatment tumor.

      II. To identify biological characteristics of tumors (e.g. mismatch repair [MMR] status, PTEN
      mutational status, etc.) correlating with decreased Ki-67 expression induced by the letrozole
      and abemaciclib combination.

      III. To determine the frequency of adverse events associated with use of abemaciclib and
      letrozole.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the correlation of the expression of Ki-67 with that of cyclin D1, p16, pRB,
      and PTEN as well as with MMR deficiency.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive letrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD) and abemaciclib PO twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-14. Patients then undergo standard of care hysterectomy on day 15.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and at 2 and 6 weeks
      after surgery.
