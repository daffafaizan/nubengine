      the obesity-related disorders, including T2DM. Some subjects start gaining weight within
      12-18 months after surgery. Weight gain may again increase the risk for developing
      obesity-related disorders. Previous studies have found a link between vitamin D deficiencies
      and T2DM. Vitamin D levels will be monitored during the intervention. Studies have shown that
      patients who underwent GBP experienced a dramatic improvement in quality of life(QOL). After
      reaching maximum weight loss, many will slowly gain weight. For some people that means a
      decrease in QOL. In order to prevent weight gain it may be useful to provide additional
      follow-ups. Participants are randomised into two groups: Group A will receive extra guidance
      and follow-up, while Group B will continue with the existing scheme. Participants in Group A
      will over the next 2 yrs take part in frequent meetings. To assess dietary habits, physical
      activity patterns and QOL, food diaries, physical activity questionnaires and QOL
      questionnaires are used. Anthropometric and blood pressure measurements will be taken and
      blood samples will be collected at regular time intervals before and during the study. The
      results will be used to validate the effect of extra guidance, and to decide if this
      treatment shall be offered to all of our patients.
