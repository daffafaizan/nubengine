    
      This is a biological study for R/R T-ALL/LBL or ETP-ALL patients. Bone marrow and/or
      peripheral blood samples will be subjected to genomic, DSRP profiling and phosphoproteomic
      screening to identify novel potential therapeutic approach and thus, eligibility for
      treatment based on molecular and DSRP data.

      Genomic studies include karyotyping, CI-FISH and sequencing of 72 selected genes recurrently
      involved in T-ALL (by NGS).

      A panel of 80 compounds has been choosen for DSRP profile.

      As soon as genomic and DSRP profiling are made available, local Investigator can submit to
      local ethic committee a request for clinical use of compound hits. Meanwhile, in case of
      leukocytosis and uncontrolled disease, patients will be treated with cytoreductive therapies
      and best supportive care according to guidelines and scientific consensus.

      Every patient will receive a molecularly and functionally informed therapy following the
      therapeutic schedule already defined by in other tumors. Treatment will be selected on the
      basis of integration of genomic and small response data.
