      pelvic drains following radical hysterectomy and node dissection that includes suturing of
      the vaginal cuff and no peritonealization.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, two-arm study. All patients receive radical hysterectomy
      (Rutledge-Piver II-III type) and pelvic lymphadenectomy, without pelvic and parietal
      peritonealization, with suturing of the vaginal cuff and closure of fascia and cutaneous
      layers; lumboaortic node dissection is optional. Patients are randomized during surgery to
      one of two arms: those on arm I receive pelvic drains and those on arm II do not. Those in
      arm I have drains applied in the pelvis, and lymph is collected by vaginal and/or
      transabdominal drains located in both retroperitoneal fossa. Drains are removed when the loss
      is less than 50 mL in 24 hours. Patients in both arms are followed at 2-3 months and 12
      months after surgery.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 214 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
