      disease. It is characterized by degeneration of the dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra
      and striatum, even before the clinical symptoms develop. Although the pathogenesis is still
      unclear, some viruses have been shown to be associated with acute or chronic parkinsonism.
      Recent studies have found that Hepatitis C virus (HCV) can replicate in the central nervous
      system, suggesting a possible link between PD and HCV. At the population and epidemiology
      level, the HCV infection and PD are strongly associated. At the molecular level, both HCV and
      PD have in common the overexpression of inflammatory biomarkers. Neuronal toxicity induced by
      HCV was also demonstrated. The positive association between HCV infection and PD has clinical
      implications for high endemic HCV areas, including Taiwan.

      18F-FDOPA, an analog to L-DOPA, has been used as a positron-emitting compound for PET
      examination of patients affected by PD. It has been shown that putamen 18F-FDOPA uptakes are
      reduced by at least 35% at onset of symptoms, making the 18F-FDOPA PET as an imaging
      biomarker for detecting subclinical and preclinical parkinsonism. Earlier imaging study using
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to investigate cerebral effect of HCV also showed that
      chronic HCV infection had elevated choline/creatine ratios, a biomarker indicating
      inflammatory and infective conditions, in the basal ganglia and white matter.

      The objective of this study is to investigate the evidence of dopaminergic toxicity causing
      by HCV infection using 18F-FDOPA PET and MRS as imaging biomarkers.
