      healthy young individuals but its clinical manifestations are highly variable. Linkage
      analysis is used to localize a gene causing an inherited autosomal dominant disease, such as
      HCM. Linkage analysis requires that large families be evaluated clinically to determine the
      members with and without the disease. For this study, DNA needs to be extracted from blood
      samples of family members. The presence of the disease is determined by history and physical
      exam, 12 lead ECG and 2-D echocardiogram. The likelihood of localizing the gene increases
      with the size of the family and the number of members evaluated. The beta myosin heavy chain
      (beta-MHC) gene has been shown to be responsible for HCM in 10%-30% of affected kindreds.
      Other linage studies have shown that there are at least 3 other genes which cause HCM in
      other kindreds, but these genes are presently unknown. We have identified 13 unique mutations
      in the beta-MHC gene which cause the disease in 17 kindreds. This has allowed us to
      demonstrate skeletal muscle involvement, study the abnormal physiology which is a consequence
      of the mutations, make pre-symptomatic diagnosis, and redefine the natural history of the
      disease. In order to continue our clinical and laboratory studies of this disease over the
      next 3 years, it is our intention to identify 50 additional HCM kindreds, with approximately
      50 members each, that have beta-MHC gene mutations. During this time, in order to map other
      HCM genes, we will also evaluate at least 6 families, of approximately 300 members each, in
      which the disease is not linked to the beta-MHC gene.
