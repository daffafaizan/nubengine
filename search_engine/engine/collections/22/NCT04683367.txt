      2003-5. There were 133 females and 68 males with a mean age 53 Â± 14 years. The index
      laparoscopic operation included 104 cholecystectomies, 55 fundoplications, 36 diagnostic, 5
      appendectomies and one insertion of peritoneal catheter. A careful clinical examination of
      the groin and ventral region was performed on everybody and all patients with clinical
      hernias were excluded. Laparoscopic exploration of the inguinal region was considered safe
      and did not greatly increase the operative time. All patients were informed that hernial
      orifices would be explored during laparoscopy, and a written consent was asked prior to
      surgery. Permission to repair large hernias (> 1 cm) was also obtained before laparoscopy.

      The patients were followed-up 15 years to find out, what percentage of occult, symptomless
      inguinal and ventral hernias were later operated because of harmfull symptoms.
