      major concern in the US already strained health care system in general and in the VA in
      particular. In older adults, obesity exacerbates the age-related decline in physical function
      resulting in frailty, decrease in quality of life, loss of independence, and increase in
      nursing home admissions. The investigators' group demonstrated that weight loss from
      lifestyle therapy improves physical function and ameliorates frailty but the improvement was
      modest at best and most obese older adults remained frail. More importantly, there are
      concerns that the weight-loss induced loss of muscle and bone mass could worsen underlying
      age-related sarcopenia and osteopenia in the subset of frail obese elderly. Metformin, a
      biguanide, is a widely available drug used as first line treatment of type 2 diabetes. Animal
      studies suggest that metformin improves health span and increases lifespan, hence may
      represent a novel intervention for frailty. Because metformin reduces cellular senescence and
      senescence-associated phenotype (SASP), it is believed to retard accelerated aging most
      especially in older adults with obesity. The objective is to conduct a head-head comparative
      efficacy, placebo controlled, randomized controlled trial to test the hypothesis that
      lifestyle therapy + metformin for six months will be more effective than lifestyle therapy
      alone or metformin alone in improving physical function and preventing the weight
      loss-induced reduction in muscle and bone mass in obese (BMI > 30 kg/m2) older (age 65 years)
      Veterans with physical frailty.
