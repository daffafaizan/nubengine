    
      This is a multicenter, non-interventional, cross-sectional study. Consecutive patients with
      metastatic stage IV NSCLC selected for systemic treatment or best supportive care will be
      included in the trial at the time the patient signed the informed consent form (ICF).
      Patients that were selected for systemic treatment, should have received at least their first
      dose and a maximum of one cycle of the same treatment.

      The pneumo-oncologist that treats the patient will fill in the CRF, indicating the systemic
      treatment option and the link with the variable categories that impacted the choice for a
      systemic treatment option.
