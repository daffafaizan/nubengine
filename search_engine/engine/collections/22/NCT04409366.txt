      followed by bone recontouring and minor gingivectomy 4 months postoperatively, if required.
      In CCL, osseous recontouring after sub-marginal incisions was performed, followed by flap
      repositioning. Records were obtained at baseline, 4 months (only in SCL), 6 and 12 months.
      Primary outcome was the precision in achieving a predetermined gingival margin position.
      Other outcomes were changes in the gingival margin position and keratinized tissue width
      (KTW) at 12 months, and patient-reported outcomes (PROMs) using the OHIP-14 tool.
