      sequential administration of exemestane with administration of further tamoxifen until 5
      years of therapy is achieved in postmenopausal women with operable breast cancer who have
      already received 2-3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen. II. Compare the regimens in terms of the
      incidence of contralateral breast cancer and long term tolerability of the regimens in these
      patients. III. Determine the tolerability of each regimen in terms of endometrial status,
      bone metabolism, lipid profile, and coagulation profile in these patients. IV. Assess quality
      of life in these patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Following 2-3 years of
      adjuvant treatment with tamoxifen, patients are randomized to receive either oral tamoxifen
      daily or oral exemestane daily for the remainder of the 5 year period in the absence of
      disease relapse or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at some centers.
      Patients are followed at least every 3 months for the first year of treatment, every 6 months
      for the next two years and then annually thereafter until year 10.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 4400 patients (2200 patients in each arm) will be accrued
      for this study.
