      Participants who are eligible for the study will receive 16 weeks of ABFT treatment. The
      treatment primarily focuses on improving communication and relationships within the family,
      and will also address disordered eating behaviors (e.g., binge eating, laxative use,
      self-induced vomiting). All participants enrolled in the study will receive the same
      treatment. Participants will also complete research assessments throughout treatment, at the
      end of treatment, and 3-months after the end of treatment. Research assessments include a
      battery of questionnaires and interviews.
