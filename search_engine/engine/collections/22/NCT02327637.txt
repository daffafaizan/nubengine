      high risk pregnancies. The definition of bed rest varies between providers, and can mean
      anything from being completely bed-bound for months at a time (sometimes called strict bed
      rest) to walking around within the home a few times a day (sometimes called modified bed
      rest). Recent studies have highlighted potential harmful effects from bed rest. However,
      scientific studies need to be carried out to compare the effects of bed rest and moderate
      activity on the health of mothers and babies.

      PPROM is defined as rupture of membranes prior to 37 weeks gestation prior to the onset of
      labor, and affects approximately 3% of all pregnancies in the Unites States. Women with PPROM
      are routinely managed in the inpatient setting from the time of diagnosis until delivery.
      Therefore, PPROM patients are a closely supervised and easily accessible cohort of women.

      In this study, participating patients with PPROM will be randomized into two groups: bedrest
      or moderate activity. Maternal mood and muscle strength will be assessed at enrollment and
      after delivery to determine whether there are significant differences in these outcomes in
      the two groups.
