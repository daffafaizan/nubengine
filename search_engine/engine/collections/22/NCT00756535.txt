      increases the risk of disability and long-term institutionalization. Immobilization during
      hospitalization can lead to deterioration of muscle strength and falls. Earlier studies have
      shown that strength training is beneficial even in the oldest old. Rehabilitation based on
      strength training exercises can prevent decline in functional capacity and shorten the length
      of hospitalization.
