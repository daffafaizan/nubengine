      or total loss of the use of the arms and legs) have intact brain function but are unable to
      move due to injury or disease affecting the spinal cord, nerves or muscles. Brain-machine
      interface (BMI) technology is based on the finding that with intact brain function, neural
      (nerve) signals are generated even though they do not reach the arms, hands and legs. By
      placing (implanting) sensors on the surface of the brain, individuals can be trained to send
      neural signals which are interpreted by a computer and translated to movement which can then
      be used to control a variety of devices or computer displays. Using neural activity to
      control an external device is referred to as a brain-machine interface (BMI) technology. In
      addition, areas of the brain that are involved in interpreting sensations from the arms,
      hands and legs remain functional after injury. It is therefore possible to send tiny
      electrical pulses through implanted arrays to mimic sensory input that would normally come
      from the arms, hands and legs. The investigators refer to this as "microstimulation."
