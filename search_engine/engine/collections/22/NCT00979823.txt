    
      Specific aim 1: To examine the impact of a simulated case-based learning intervention on
      measures of quality of diabetes care delivered by primary care residents to simulated adult
      patients with diabetes mellitus.

      Hypothesis 1: Compared to delayed SimCare Diabetes learning program group residents, those
      residents in the early SimCare Diabetes learning program group will treat a higher proportion
      of simulated patients to evidence based diabetes goals including glycemic control (A1c < 7%),
      blood pressure control (BP < 130/80 mm Hg), and lipid control (evidence-based LDL,
      Triglyceride, and HDL levels).

      Specific aim 2: To examine the impact of a simulated case-based learning intervention on
      rates of appropriate drug intensification and number of risky prescribing events in the
      management of simulated adult patients with diabetes mellitus.

      Hypothesis 2: Compared to delayed SimCare Diabetes learning program group residents, those
      residents in the early SimCare Diabetes learning program group will have improved rates of
      appropriate drug intensification in simulated assessment cases.

      Hypothesis 3: Compared to delayed SimCare Diabetes learning program group residents, those
      residents in the early SimCare Diabetes learning program group will have a lower number of
      risky prescribing events in simulated assessment cases.
