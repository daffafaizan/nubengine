      childbirth. Despite significant increases in facility-based childbirth, quality gaps at the
      facility have limited reductions in maternal deaths. Infrequent monitoring of women around
      childbirth is a major gap in care that leads to delays in life-saving interventions. Simple
      increases in staffing will not overcome this gap, thus necessitating new strategies.

      This project aims to use a simple wireless monitor to improve the detection of complications
      immediately after childbirth and allow clinicians to provide life-saving interventions when
      needed. Using a hybrid clinical effectiveness-implementation approach women delivered by
      cesarean in Mbarara, Uganda will be recruited to wear a wireless physiologic monitor for 24
      hours after delivery and their delivering obstetricians recruited to use the monitoring
      system, including the receipt of text message alerts should women develop abnormalities in
      physiologic signs. Rates of morbidity and mortality will be compared with a control group of
      women delivered by the same obstetricians. Clinical adoption and implementation will be
      assessed with the RE-AIM implementation framework and semi-structured interviews.
