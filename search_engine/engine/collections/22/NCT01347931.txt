      chronic respiratory insufficiency who require LTOT. Each subject's standard oxygen therapy
      will be used as the control treatment and compared to the test ventilator system during
      selected activities of daily living. Subjects will participate in the study for up to 9 home
      visits, with Visits 1 and 2 each lasting for approximately 4 hours, and Visits 3-9 lasting
      approximately 1-2 hours each. Subjects may discontinue study participation at any time.
