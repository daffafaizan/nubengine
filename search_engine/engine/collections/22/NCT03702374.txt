      supply to its endothelial cells in states of constant hyperglycemia. This entity is
      classified in two main categories: non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy and proliferative
      diabetic retinopathy, the latter is characterized for the presence of neovascularization as
      oppose to the first one.

      Oxidative stress has been considered as one of the main factors in the development of
      diabetic retinopathy. It results from an imbalance between oxidants production and cellular
      antioxidant defenses, which provokes DNA damage in the mitochondrion altering its capacity to
      produce ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate) resulting in what is known as mitochondrial dysfunction.

      Diabetic retinopathy management merely comprises glycemic, lipemic and blood pressure
      control. Secondary intervention includes anti-platelet agents, protein-kinase C inhibitors,
      aldolase reductase inhibitors, laser and vitrectomy. Antioxidant therapy has been used as a
      co-adjuvant for these interventions, as antioxidant substances that complement action and
      efficacy of the established treatment for diabetic retinopathy.

      Diabetic retinopathy is the principal cause of blindness in persons between 20 and 70 years
      of age. Its prevalence is, approximately, 25% 5 years after diagnosis.

      Which is why the investigators intend to prove if the antioxidant therapy is able to change
      retinopathy outcomes in oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and/or grade of
      retinopathy.
