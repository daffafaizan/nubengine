      Study Period-I and IT were separated by a washout period of 14 days. Use of a crossover
      design is appropriate since it enables comparison of treatments within the same subject using
      intrasubject variability thus improving the precision of treatment comparisons. Also use of
      14 days of washout period between successive drug administrations eliminates chances of
      residual drug being present at preceding period (i.e Period 1) to next period (i.e Period
      II).
