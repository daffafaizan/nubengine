      pioglitazone or placebo (an inactive pill). They will be given study medication to take every
      day for 12 weeks (3 months).

      Participants will complete a number of asthma-related questionnaires and a variety of
      pulmonary function tests. Participants will undergo physical exams, an electrocardiogram, and
      blood sampling to measure leptin, adiponectin, markers of inflammation, blood cell counts,
      glucose levels, BNP hormone levels, and liver function.

      To monitor participants throughout the study, follow-up visits will be done at 2, 6, and 12
      weeks after starting study drug. At these visits many of the pulmonary function tests and
      questionnaires will be repeated.
