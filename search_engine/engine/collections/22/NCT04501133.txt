      and medications influencing brain function (n = 25). The investigators will characterize
      inhibition of wrist flexors/wrist extensors with PES, and also use TMS to stimulate the
      corresponding areas in the brain and see if the movement can be reduced through PES. HD-EMG
      will be used to collect data and identify associated motor unit spike trains.

      In Experiment B, the investigators will recruit patients with essential tremor (ET) and/or
      Parkinson's disease (PD) (n = 25 for each pathology). The investigators will repeat the same
      characterization of inhibition of wrist flexors/ wrist extensors with PES and also use TMS to
      stimulate corresponding areas in the brain. Additionally, the investigators will test PES
      conditions as a tremor reduction strategy at the wrist level. The investigators will also
      test PES conditions at the elbow and shoulder joints as a tremor reduction strategy. Finally,
      the investigators will observe and characterize the long-term effects (lasting 24h, 48h, and
      7 days post stimulation) of PES via coherence between HD-EMG and EEG at the tremor frequency.
