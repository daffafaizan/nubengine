      procedures will be recruited for examination at the gastroesophageal junction with our
      developed OCT imaging system. The patients will undergo a clinical EGD procedure including
      endoscopic biopsy. The first step in the procedure follows the standard care with the
      performance of the surveillance endoscopy. The study experimental procedure will then begin.
      This study requires the use of a balloon . The balloon placement method is in accordance with
      current standard clinical practice and involves the insertion of a guide wire through the
      auxiliary channel of the endoscope. The endoscope is then removed, leaving the guide wire in
      place, and the OCT balloon is inserted the required distance (determined during the
      endoscopy) over the guide wire to the GE junction. The OCT balloon will then be inflated and
      will remain in this fixed position throughout the entire procedure. Once the OCT imaging
      probe is in place, OCT image data will be continuously collected over the length of the
      balloon(approximately 5 cm).

      It is expected that the total examination time including insertion and inflation of the OCT
      balloon, OCT imaging and removal of the OCT balloon will add no more than 10 minutes to the
      total length of the EGD.
