      and response to antiretroviral therapy. The Terry Beirn Community Programs for Clinical
      Research on AIDS (CPCRA) was created to conduct studies in HIV infected communities and
      particularly in people of color, women, and injection drug users. This study will collect
      whole blood samples from HIV infected individuals. The samples will be used in future CPCRA
      studies comparing human genetic factors with clinical data from other CPCRA studies.
