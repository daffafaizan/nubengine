      increase in snacking behavior. Both the frequency of snacking during the day and the
      percentage of adults who engage in snacking has risen; national data indicates snacking
      comprises 15-25% of the total daily caloric intake of young and middle-aged adults.
      Unfortunately, current typical snack items are energy rich, providing high intake of
      carbohydrates and sugars, as opposed to nuts that are nutrient rich. In prior work with
      middle-aged adults, the investigators found that consuming tree nuts daily as between-meal
      snacks for a period of 16 weeks significantly reduced intra-abdominal (visceral) fat and
      waist circumference, which was associated with altered plasma fatty acid profiles and higher
      fatty acid oxidation rates. Based on prior findings, the investigators propose to determine
      whether consuming mixed tree nuts as replacement for typical high carbohydrate snacks reduces
      abdominal obesity and waist circumference in millennials at risk for MetS. The overarching
      hypothesis, based on significant preliminary data, is that the quantity and metabolic
      function of abdominal fat is a key intermediary factor by which greater tree nut consumption
      reduces ectopic lipid storage (including the accumulation of intra-abdominal [visceral] fat),
      improves fatty acid and lipoprotein metabolism, reduces systemic inflammation and insulin
      resistance, and thus, reduces risk for MetS in millennial-generation age individuals. The
      hypothesis will be tested by determining: 1) the effect of consuming mixed tree nuts as daily
      snacks for 16 weeks on waist circumference and the quantity of abdominal fat (subcutaneous
      and visceral fat); 2) the effect of consuming mixed tree nuts as daily snacks for 16 weeks on
      circulating fatty acid profiles, glucose tolerance and insulin resistance, circulating lipids
      and lipoproteins, and circulating markers of inflammation; and 3) the effect of consuming
      mixed tree nuts as daily snacks for 16 weeks on abdominal tissue expression of genes that
      regulate inflammation, insulin resistance, and cardiometabolic mediators of MetS risk.
