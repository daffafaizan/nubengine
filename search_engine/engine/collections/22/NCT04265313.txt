      developed both specifically and specifically for this patient group, evaluating the quality
      of life. Regarding the shoulder problems experienced by these patients, there is only one
      item in the literature called "The University of Michegan Head and Neck QOL (UMHNQOL)
      questionnaire" that evaluates shoulder pain. Apart from this, there is no other questionnaire
      in the literature that may adversely affect the quality of life to neck dissection and
      question both neck and shoulder problems together. The Neck Dissection Impairment Index
      evaluates the shoulder-related quality of life in a more comprehensive and more detailed
      manner according to the UMHNQOL questionnaire. The Neck Dissection Impairment Index evaluates
      the components of shoulder related quality of life in a wide range after neck dissection.
      Because the type of age, weight, radiotherapy and neck dissection are the most important
      variables affecting quality of life, patients in the high-risk group (e.g. young individuals,
      patients who have received radiotherapy and modified radical neck dissection) evaluated with
      the Neck Dissection Impairment Questionnaire can benefit from an earlier and more intensive
      rehabilitation.
