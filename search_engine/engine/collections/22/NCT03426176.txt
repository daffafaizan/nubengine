      oxytocin are important regulators of social emotional behavior. Evidence is emerging that
      both systems interact in this domain. To determine the interaction of both systems on human
      social behavior, the present study aims to combine a randomized placebo-controlled
      administration of modulators of both systems (Oxytocin nasal-spray and acute tryptophan
      depletion, ATD) and their combination within a pharmaco-fMRI experiment. To determine effects
      on the neural networks engaged in social emotional processing, healthy male subjects will
      receive single doses of oxytocin (24IU) versus placebo and ATD (75.2g) versus placebo before
      fMRI measures of emotion perception and resting state will be acquired. To control for
      potential effects of pre-medication personality traits as well as effects of medicines on
      mood, subjects will be administered pre-treatment assessing relevant personality traits and
      post-treatment assessments of mood.
