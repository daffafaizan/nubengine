      this a prospective study.Patients enrolled in the study divided into two groups according to
      the day of surgery. The study population was divided into two groups; group (A) Parenchymal
      liver transection was performed by harmonic scalpel (HS) and group (B) Parenchymal liver
      transection was performed by spray diathermy (SD).

      Donors and recipient were followed up after hospital discharge with laboratory investigation,
      abdominal ultrasound, MRCP in selected cases every month for the first month, then every 6
      months and then every year postoperatively. Follow up visits included clinical examination,
      laboratory investigation, doses of immunosuppressive, radiological examination, and doppler
      US.

      The primary outcome was the amount of blood loss during transection. Secondary outcomes were
      operative time, time of transection, speed of transection/minutes , number of ligation used,
      degree of postoperative injury which assessed by daily liver function, WBC, C reactive
      protein, pathological changes at the cut surface, postoperative morbidity (including biliary
      leakage, collection), cost and hospital stay.
