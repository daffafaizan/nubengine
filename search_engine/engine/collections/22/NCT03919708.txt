      for pathology in amblyopia to best assess device sensitivity, while a second cohort will be
      based in a primary care setting to best assess device specificity. The study will be
      conducted in busy, ethnically and economically diverse cites affiliated with the Retina
      Foundation of the Southwest (RFSW) in greater Dallas, TX area. Each child will be screened
      with Rebiscan's RBI device and it's PVS device in sequence, with results compared to the PVS
      as well as a comprehensive ophthalmic examination performed by a certified pediatric
      ophthalmologist in a statistically appropriate subset of screened subjects. Testing times
      will be assessed to compare the efficiency of the PVS and the RBI screening experiences. The
      percentage of children successfully completing the screening process will also be measured.

      The RBI is expected to identify children with amblyopia and strabismus, without referring
      children who will not benefit from early treatment
