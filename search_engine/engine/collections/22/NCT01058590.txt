        1. To conduct a trial evaluating the effect of Adenonsillectomy in infants (1-36 months of
           age), with OSA. Outcome measures will include polysomnographic findings conducted prior
           to and 12 weeks following surgery.

        2. To identify the presence of inflammatory markers (such as, but not only Leukotriene B4,
           Leukotriene C4/D4/E4, Isoprostane-8, IL-6, TNF-alpha, and other pro inflammatory
           cytokines) in the peripheral blood (prior and after therapy), and urine (Leukotriene
           E-4, and others) and correlate their local and systemic expression prior and after
           therapy to the magnitude of therapy-associated response.

      Study Duration: Two years (initial recruitment will be completed within the initial 12 months
      of the study). Assessment of the samples obtained throughout the study will be done at the
      latter part of the study.

      Setting: Soroka University Hospital . The Sleep Laboratory in Soroka UMC, is the only
      pediatric one in the city of Beer Sheva and surroundings, evaluates over 1,000 children/year
      for a variety of sleep disorders, among which >700 are referred for suspected OSAS, among
      them 100 infants< 2 years/ year.

      All children referred for surgery are admitted in the Dept. of Pediatrics where the PI works.
      We intend to approach all the children prior to surgery and offer them to participate in this
      study. Those who are interested will gain a sleep study following surgery to validate (or to
      rull out) the presence of residual OSA and if there is a need, to continue follow up in the
      pediatric sleep outpatient clinic in Soroka UMC.
