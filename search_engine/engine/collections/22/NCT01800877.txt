      condition that causes life-threatening low blood pressure. Low blood pressure makes it
      difficult for the body to deliver blood to all of its organs. The standard treatment doctors
      in the ICU use for their patients is to give medications that help increase blood pressure.
      These medications are called vasopressors. There can be side effects related to using
      vasopressors. The purpose of this research study is to determine if it is better to give
      vasopressors to patients to maintain a higher blood pressure target versus a lower blood
      pressure target. This study is important because the information we find out will help us
      know how best to administer vasopressors in patients with shock in the ICU.
