      moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) which is the major milestone before severe malnutrition.
      This will be based on the modulation of the gut microbiota with adjunct product added to
      standard nutrition flours.

      The purpose of the MALINEA study is to compare three management strategies for Moderate Acute
      Malnutrition (MAM) in children aged between 6 months and 2 years old on recovery defined by a
      weight/size gain at 3 months.

      The 3 groups will be compared on several anthropometric measurements [Weight, length, Mid
      Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC)], clinical characteristics, adherence and tolerance to
      interventions between before and after a 3 months intervention Cognitive development of
      children (Senegal) will also be studied and compared, at inclusion, 3 months and 6 months
      after inclusion.

      The investigators will also investigate the microbiomes of malnourished children at inclusion
      and at 3 and 6 months after inclusion to compare it to the ones of normonourished children.
