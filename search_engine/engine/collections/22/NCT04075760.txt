      from varices bleeding will be defined as the occurrence of hematemesis and/or melena
      requiring >2 U of blood or a decrease of 2 gm/dl of hemoglobin if no blood transfusion is
      given, with the confirmed endocopic visualization of GOV II and IGV I.

      The beta blocker therapy is an effective method for the prevention of the first esophageal
      variceal bleeding; however, the efficacy in preventing first gastric variceal bleeding is
      controversial.

      The investigators aimed to compare the efficacy in preventing the first gastric variceal
      bleeding in patients with documented GOV II and IGV I.
