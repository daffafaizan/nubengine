      vital in open left heart surgery. Bilateral collapse of the lungs during cardiopulmonary
      bypass decreases the duration of the de-airing procedure, decreases residual air emboli
      monitored on Trans-esophageal Echocardiography (TEE) and decreases gaseous cerebral
      microemboli (MES) monitored by Trans-cranial Echo-Doppler (TCD) when compared to expanded
      lungs during (CPB). Induced pulmonary collapse by opening of the pleura and disconnection of
      the patient from the ventilator during CPB decreases the amount of air that can enter the
      pulmonary veins. Not all surgeons wish to induce lung collapse from fraught that it might
      lead to pulmonary ischemia or infection. It is unknown whether collapse of only the right
      lung is as effective as collapse of both lungs.
