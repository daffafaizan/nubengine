      I. To show that extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP)increases skin and gut homing T regulatory
      (T-reg) cells in patients with GVHD clinically responding to ECP.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Response rates of GVHD with extracorporeal photopheresis(ECP)as measured by NIH response
      criteria

      II. Incidence of T-reg cell frequency(%)with various NIH subtypes of chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)

      III. Incidence of T-reg homing subsets(%)with various NIH subtypes of chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo ECP twice a week for 4 weeks and then twice a week every 2 weeks for 8
      weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2, 4, and 6 months.
