      glycaemia are well-established. The impact of diet composition, however, remains poorly
      understood. Hepatic lipid content strongly correlates with hepatic insulin resistance, which
      is a key feature of the pre-diabetic state. The investigators hypothesize that a low
      carbohydrate diet compared to an energy-matched standard diet in morbidly obese patients with
      prediabetes scheduled for bariatric surgery results in greater reduction in liver fat.
