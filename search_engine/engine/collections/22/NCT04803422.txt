      Treatment of complicated appendicitis are usually with a postoperative course of intravenous
      antibiotics. There is need for a study confirming the results of retrospective studies
      showing that a postoperative course of oral antibiotics is not inferior to intravenous
      antibiotics after laparoscopic surgery for complicated appendicitis.

      The PIPA trial will be a prospective, multicenter, cluster randomized cluster crossover
      non-inferiority study designed to test whether a three-day postoperative course of per oral
      antibiotics is non-inferior to a three-day postoperative course of intravenous antibiotics as
      standard care after laparoscopic surgery for complicated appendicitis in regards to the risk
      of postoperative intraabdominal abscess formation within 30-days. Participating hospitals
      will be randomized to either a 6-month period with a per oral antibiotic regime followed by a
      6-month period with an intravenous antibiotic regime, or 6-month period with an intravenous
      antibiotic regime followed by a 6-month period with a per oral antibiotic regime for the
      postoperative treatment after laparoscopic surgery for complicated appendicitis. Primary
      outcome will be the incidence of intra-abdominal abscess by the postoperative day 30.
