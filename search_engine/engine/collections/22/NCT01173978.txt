      previously shown that it is possible to induce a defect in the incretin effect in healthy
      individuals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the insulinotropic affect of the
      incretin hormones in healthy individuals before and after a deterioration of the glucose
      homeostasis. The evaluation is done by infusing GIP, GLP-1 or saline during hyperglycemic
      clamps.
