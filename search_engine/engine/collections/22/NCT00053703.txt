      adolescents with early onset schizophrenia spectrum disorders. This study will compare
      antipsychotic agents with different mechanisms of action in children and adolescents who have
      schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder with active psychotic symptoms.

      Participants are randomly assigned to receive risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa),
      or molindone (Moban) for 8 weeks. After 11/2005, no additional patients will be assigned to
      olanzapine treatment. Patients with significant improvement and without side effects continue
      maintenance therapy for another 44 weeks. Participants who show significant negative symptoms
      after 8 weeks may be started on a mood stabilizer or antidepressant. Weight gain, metabolic
      changes, neurocognition, functional outcome, psychotic symptoms, extrapyramidal side effects,
      and the ability to sustain effective therapy over time are assessed.
