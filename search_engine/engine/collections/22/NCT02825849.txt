    
      BACKGROUND:

      There is a need for new and more effective therapies for patients with intrauterine adhesions
      (Asherman's Syndrome) and persistent thin endometrial lining in in vitro fertilization (IVF)
      treatment programs, particularly for patients resistant to standard therapies

      HYPOTHESIS:

      Platelet rich plasma stimulates cellular processes involved in endometrial regeneration
      relevant to management of a thin lining or intrauterine scarring.

      PRIMARY AIMS:

      - To measure the change in endometrial lining thickness

      SECONDARY AIMS:

        -  To determine if fertility is improved in patients receiving platelet rich plasma (PRP):

           1. In patients with thin lining undergoing frozen embryo transfer (FET), to determine:

        -  clinical pregnancy rate

           2. In patients with Asherman's Syndrome, to determine:

        -  the chance of spontaneous pregnancy

      Any adverse effects of study arm will be monitored and reported as appropriate.
