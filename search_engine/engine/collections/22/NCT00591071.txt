      administration. Rapid action insulin Novorapid HM (Novo Nordisk, Copenhagen, Denmark) will be
      used.

      ICU patient management requires many intravenously administered treatments in a limited
      number of venous lines (catecholamines, sedation, feeding, vascular filling, antioticsâ€¦).
      This situation does not enable to dedicate an infusion line for the intravenous
      administration of insulin. Despite continuous administration of insulin infusion, the
      concomitant administration of other treatments in the same infusion line obviously leads to
      significant variations in the flow of insulin actually delivered, which can lead to
      variations in blood glucose and adjustments secondary to the inappropriate dose of insulin.
      To limit this phenomenon, an OCTOPUS (Vygon, Ecouen, France) type infusion connector will be
      added. The infusion connector is made of 2 infusion lines one of which will be exclusively
      dedicated to insulin therapy subsequently limiting the risk of variations in insulin
      administration flow.

      The determination of the number of subjects to include was carried out by using a 45%
      hospital mortality hypothesis in the conventional glycemic control group. and a 32 % hospital
      mortality hypothesis in the strict glycemic control group.
