      both a High/Habitual protein phase and a moderate protein phase. The Habitual protein phase
      is designed to model resistance trained individual's habitual protein consumption by
      providing 2.2g/kg/d in a controlled diet. The Moderate protein phase is designed to
      investigate the impact of decreasing dietary protein intake to a moderate amount (1.2g/kg/d)
      over five days on protein metabolism. Both phases used the stable isotope
      L-[1-13C]Phenylalanine and metabolic trails were modelled after the indicator amino acid
      oxidation (IAAO) technique.

      High Protein Phase The high protein phase is three days in length, with diet-controlled
      throughout, and a metabolic trail on day 3. Participants will perform whole-body resistance
      exercise on days one and three.

      Moderate protein phase The Moderate protein phase is seven days in length, with MT on days
      three, five and seven. Dietary intake will be controlled throughout the whole phase providing
      either 2.2 g/kg/d of protein (days one and two), or 1.2 g/kg/d (days three through seven).
      Full body resistance exercise will be performed performed on days one, three, five and seven.

      This phase will allow measurement of protein metabolism over five days following a decrease
      in dietary protein intake, and to determine the effect of dietary changes on the IAAO method.
