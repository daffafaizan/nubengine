      of an optimal control of all cardiovascular risk factors. It includes high blood pressure
      reduction, dietetic measures (weight loss - control of dyslipidemia and diabetes - regular
      physical activity), smoking cessation, stress management, … In that way, some authors suggest
      that it is essential for patients at high risk to have knowledge about their own pathology,
      medication, and to better understand the real benefit of specific lifestyle behaviors and the
      importance of blood pressure and glycaemia surveillance … The aim of this randomized
      controlled trial is to evaluate the efficacy of a dedicated therapeutic education program to
      control blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors in general practice patients at
      high cardiovascular risk.

      250 patients are being enrolled. All patients will receive standard care but only 125
      patients (randomized 1 to 1) will receive a structured therapeutic education program.
