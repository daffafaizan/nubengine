      obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Patients with a diagnosis of sepsis, who had received a prior
      polysomnography at Taipei Veterans General Hospital during Jan. 1, 2001 to May 31, 2017 will
      be enrolled. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is defined by an apnea-hypopnea index at least
      5/hr with compatible symptoms. Their clinical record will be reviewed and data including
      demography, polysomnography and details related to sepsis (source of infection, number of
      organ dysfunction at initial diagnosis of sepsis and survival time) will be collected. The
      start of the survival time (follow-up time) is the date when sepsis is diagnosed. The end of
      the survival time (follow-up time) is the date of death or end of hospitalization (date of
      discharge). Survival analyses will be performed.
