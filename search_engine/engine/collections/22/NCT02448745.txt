      control. In Bomi County Liberia, LLINs have been distributed but malaria prevalence in
      children under 5 remains high, with prevalence in study villages found to be 42% in April
      2014. The major malaria vector species are resistant to pyrethroid insecticides approved for
      use in LLINs, and new control measures with non-pyrethroid active ingredients may protect the
      population.
