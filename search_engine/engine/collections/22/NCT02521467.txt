      Free gingival grafts are one of the common treatment modalities used to increase the zone of
      keratinized tissue (KT) around implants or prior to ridge augmentation and root coverage. The
      palatal donor sites had many complications as pain, discomfort and healing by secondary
      intention. Platelets Rich Fibrin (PRF) is a second generation of platelets concentrate full
      of growth factors fasten the healing and decrease the pain.

      Materials and methods:

      Ten patients requiring augmentation of KT participated in this case series. The palatal donor
      sites of 7 of these patients were covered with PRF membranes with a new suturing technique
      without palatal stent, the other 3 had palatal stent. Palatal tissue will examined clinically
      after 3, 7, 10 and 14 days. Considerably very fast healing with 0 pain score was observed
      during one week in the group with PRF.
