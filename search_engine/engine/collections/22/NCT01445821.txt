      (HSCT), peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) will be mobilized with cyclophosphamide (2 g/m2)
      followed by 5-10 mcg/kg subcutaneous filgrastrim daily from day 5 until completion of
      apheresis. Mobilized hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) will be collected by apheresis on day 10
      and cryopreserved without selection or manipulation. There will be an interval of at least 17
      days between mobilization of PBSC and start of conditioning regimen.
