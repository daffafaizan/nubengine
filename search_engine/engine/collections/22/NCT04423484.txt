      aims to evaluate the capacity of units to follow the recommendations in the protocol. It will
      look mainly at treatment compliance and outcome for the children treated. The study will also
      evaluate the improvement in treatment compliance and reporting. This work will help the group
      to evaluate future needs in participating units and help us adapt treatment programmes to
      local conditions.
