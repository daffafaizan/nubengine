      accurately predict which patients will respond to neoadjuvant radiation therapy. The study
      will enroll patients with high-grade sarcomas as identified by preoperative biopsy that will
      be treated with neoadjuvant radiation into the study. The standard of care for these patients
      is to receive MRI scans at pre-treatment and post-treatment time points. Patients in this
      study will receive their standard pre- and post-treatment imaging in the form of PET/MR, with
      PET conducted simultaneously with MRI, and within the context of the study they will also
      receive one additional PET/MR at the end of the second week of therapy. These patients will
      then receive curative intent surgery and be followed in the usual fashion and assessed for
      local and/or distant recurrent disease. The pathology will be assessed for completeness of
      resection and percent of necrosis. On the basis of pathology, patients will be classified as
      responsive or non-responsive to therapy. Quantitative measures from PET and MRI will be
      computed: the change in PET tumor-mean standardized uptake value (SUV) and tumor size as
      assessed by MRI, from pre- to post-treatment, and from pre- to mid-treatment. The image-based
      quantitative measures will be correlated with the pathology outcomes to evaluate
      predictability of the image measures for treatment response. Patients will be followed with
      the intent of further correlating image measures with clinical outcomes.
