      given written informed consent will undergo screening to determine eligibility for study
      entry. If the patient qualifies for the study, they will be randomized in a double-blind
      manner in a 1:1 ratio to receive NasoVAX or placebo. On the same day of qualifying into the
      study, the patient will be administered the investigational drug (either NasoVAX or placebo).

      The patient will return home for the remainder of the study. During this period, the patient
      will be monitored remotely by the study center for clinical status. The patient will also be
      contacted by study center personnel by telephone to ask about use of any medications and
      changes in health including information about any hospitalization.
