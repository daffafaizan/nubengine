      being able to predict postoperative outcomes may allow to better fit peri-operative care of
      cardio-thoracic patients.

      RIPOSTE database aims to prospectively collect baseline characteristics and per-operative
      information in order to test associations with the incidence of postoperative outcomes.

      Baseline characteristics include: age, EuroSCORE 2 and its components (age, gender, New York
      Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, angina symptoms, insulin-dependent diabetes
      mellitus, extracardiac arteriopathy, chronic pulmonary dysfunction, neurological or
      musculoskeletal dysfunction severely affecting mobility, previous cardiac surgery, renal
      function with creatinin clearance, active endocarditis, critical preoperative state, left
      ventricle ejection fraction, recent myocardial infarction, pulmonary artery systolic
      pressure, procedure urgency and weight of the procedure (coronary artery bypass graft, valve
      surgery and/or thoracic aorta)) weight, height, preoperative biology and preoperative
      echocardiography parameters when measured.

      Peroperative information include: cardiac bypass duration, type of procedure, implanted
      device, valve size.

      Postoperative outcomes include: death, postoperative shock, mediastinitis, length of stay in
      intensive care unit, overall length of stay, blood transfusion.
