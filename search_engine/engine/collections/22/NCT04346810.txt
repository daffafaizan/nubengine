      reorganization of the activities and organizations of the intensive care hospital services in
      order to be able to cope with it.

      Caregivers are at the heart of the management of this crisis and are exposed daily to these
      situations of repeated emergencies, an intensification of the pace of work and difficulties
      in care.

      In this context, it seemed important to us to try to quantify this pressure of care, in order
      to be able to offer in second care adapted to caregivers who would like it.

      The assessment of the mental state of the caregivers as well as the collection of the
      feelings and perceptions on the current crisis and its management will be carried out by
      anonymous and voluntary self-questionnaire in collaboration with the service of professional
      pathologies and occupational medicine of the hospital structure
