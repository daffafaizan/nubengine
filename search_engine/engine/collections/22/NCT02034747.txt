      the group that was reduced corticosteroid slowly until 50% lower dose from 4 weeks to 12
      weeks and the group with maintained corticosteroid in stable kidney transplant subjects whose
      regimen was converted from a CyA-based immunosuppressive regimen with corticosteroid to an
      Advagraf®-based immunosuppressive regimen with corticosteroid for kidney transplant subjects
      whose regimen was converted from a CyA-based immunosuppressive regimen.

      The secondary objective is to assess the creatinine clearance rate, acute rejection,
      satisfaction of medication and safety of the group with a 50% reduced dose of corticosteroid
      and the group in which the Advagraf ®-based immunosuppressive regimen with maintained
      corticosteroid.
