      should allow to improve HIV prevention and screening strategies among born-abroad MSM living
      in France. This, in turn, should reduce the burden of HIV in this population in France.

      Multicenter, cross-sectional, two-year study in the region Ile-de-France. The study is based
      on the self-completion of a questionnaire, built after an exploratory qualitative study.

      Constitution of a representative sample of born-abroad HIV-infected MSM from patients
      followed up for HIV in Paris area. Questionnaires will collect data needed to estimate the
      post-migration HIV acquisition rates, and will explore contextual and individual factors
      leading to high exposure to HIV.

      The participants will complete a questionnaire translated into 5 languages (English, Spanish,
      Portuguese, Arabic, and Russian) in order to allow almost all of the participants to answer
      the survey themselves, without assistance. In order to not exclude those who cannot read, or
      those who do not master any of the 6 languages offered, the questionnaire may be administered
      with the assistance of a member of the research team of the associated center, including
      through a telephone interpretation service. A brief eCRF will collect clinical and biological
      data, and historical viral sequences in associated virology departments, when available.
