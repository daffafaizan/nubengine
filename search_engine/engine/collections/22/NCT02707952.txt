      open-label, and active-controlled, wherein HCV treatment-naïve or interferon
      (IFN)-experienced (i.e., DAA treatment-naïve), genotype (GT)1-infected participants without
      cirrhosis were enrolled. Substudy 2 was non-randomized, open label, and enrolled special
      populations of HCV-infected participants [GT1- or GT2-infected subjects with compensated
      cirrhosis, HCV GT3-, 4-, 5- and 6-infected subjects (with compensated cirrhosis or without
      cirrhosis), HCV GT1- and GT2-infected subjects who had failed prior DAA treatments (with
      compensated cirrhosis or without cirrhosis), HCV GT1- or GT2-infected subjects with severe
      renal impairment (with compensated cirrhosis or without cirrhosis)].
