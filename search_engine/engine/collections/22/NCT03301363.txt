      conducted at CRT device implant and prior to subject discharge. Subjects scheduled to be
      implanted with a Quadripolar Pacing System who provide informed consent will undergo
      "Enrollment" and participate in "SCOPE-CRT" study. Enrollment and device implant can occur in
      the same day. Including Enrollment, each subject's participation is expected to be 1-2 days.
      The total duration of the study is expected to be 12 months, including Enrollment. Enrollment
      will include the Informed Consent process, physical examination, and collection of
      demographics, cardiovascular history, medical history, and medications.

      During CRT implant, surface ECG and PV loop recordings will be taken over the different
      programmable MPP settings. Following data collection, CRT device programming will be left to
      the discretion of the physician.
