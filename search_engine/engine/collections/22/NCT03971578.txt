      application to ASD, will be developed and its feasibility demonstrated. The proposed method
      will utilize high rate stimulation to acquire Auditory Brainstem Responses in order to
      determine peak latency and amplitude differences in children with ASD compared to non-ASD.
      Similarly to newborn hearing screening, the output of the screening method will provide an
      automated pass or refer outcome that can be used by a physician to determine if the child
      needs further evaluation.
