      arterial pulse signal using safe, noninvasive, transabdominal near-infrared spectroscopy. The
      optical sensor will obtain fetal pulse oximetry signals. Women will also undergo sonographic
      evaluation to assess distance from maternal skin to fetal tissue and to confirm fetal
      presentation and position. There is no change to standard of care procedures for fetal heart
      rate monitoring. The fetal heart rate that will be monitored with the investigational device
      will be used for research purposes only. Results will not be used to guide or alter patient
      management.
