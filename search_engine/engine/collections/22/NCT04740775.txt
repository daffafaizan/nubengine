    
      LiquiBand® Exceed™ is the "study" device. The study device is an adhesive used to close
      surgical wounds. When the adhesive is applied to the skin, it polymerizes (forms a chemical
      bond) within minutes due to the moisture on the skin's surface and allows the wound edges to
      remain in the correct position. The use of the study device is not "investigational"
      (experimental) because it is already cleared for doctors to use for surgical wound closure in
      the United States of America.

      In this study, LiquiBand® Exceed™ will be used to close surgical wounds following general
      abdominal surgery. Subjects will be followed up for 14-days post surgery, and safety and
      performance of the study device will be evaluated.
