      G-Clb in participants with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)/ small
      lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL) who meet International Workshop on CLL (iwCLL) treatment criteria.
      The study includes screening (30 days), treatment (from randomization until treatment
      discontinuation) and follow-up phase (from treatment discontinuation until Subsequent Therapy
      Phase [if applicable], death, lost to follow up, consent withdrawal, or study end, whichever
      occurs first). Participants without progression will continue disease evaluations until
      disease progression or death. Participants from either treatment arm that develop progressive
      disease may be eligible to receive single-agent ibrutinib until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity (Subsequent Therapy Phase). Participation in this phase of the study is
      not mandatory and is based on investigator's discretion. Study duration is approximately 6
      years. Safety includes review of adverse events and laboratory tests performed over time.
