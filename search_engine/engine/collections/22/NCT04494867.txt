      of mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19, allowing earlier weaning from ventilation,
      and greater overall survival. This prospective, randomized study will include 20 patients
      diagnosed with COVID-19, and undergoing mechanical ventilation for the treatment of
      respiratory failure. Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion with 10 patients (Group A)
      randomized to undergo core warming, and the other 10 patients (Group B) serving as the
      control group who will not have the ensoETM device used. Patients randomized to Group A will
      have core warming initiated in the ICU or other clinical environment in which they are being
      treated after enrollment and provision of informed consent from appropriate surrogate or
      legally authorized representative.
