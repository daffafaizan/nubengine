      closure of the abdominal wall with continuous polyamide (34 patients) or continuous
      polydioxanone (30 patients).

      There was an alarmingly higher incidence of wound dehiscence in the PDS group requiring
      secondary suturing (Nylon 0; PDS 5). Mid-way through the trial, an interim analysis was
      performed which revealed an unacceptably high incidence of wound dehiscence in the PDS group.
      This necessitated a premature curtailment of the study. There was, however, a statistically
      significantly higher incidence of scar pain in the Nylon group (Nylon 9; PDS 1).

      There is a need for a study with larger series, and PDS as a choice of suture for midline
      wound closure cannot be recommended.
