      The purpose of this study is to determine if capsaicin cream offers symptomatic relief to
      patients suffering from Cannabinoid Hyperemesis Syndrome. We hypothesize that the use of
      topical capsaicin may provide effective symptomatic relief more quickly than conventional
      anti-emetic therapy alone thereby decreasing costs for continued drug therapies, repeat
      laboratory testing, radiographic imaging, and specialist consults.

      Primary endpoint:

      Time to resolution of symptoms, clinical improvement in pain score as defined by visual
      analog score.

      Approach and methods:

      Patients presenting to the UVA Emergency Department with chief complaint of nausea and
      vomiting who endorse cannabinoid use via inhalation or consumption. Patients 18 years of age
      and older will be included in the study and patients who have another clear indication for
      nausea/vomiting or cyclic vomiting (infection, appendicitis, pain, etc.) will be excluded.
      Patients who are enrolled in the study will be randomized 1:1 to treatment vs. placebo. All
      patients will be allowed 1L of intravenous fluids and one to two standard anti-emetics. The
      Investigational Drug Services team at UVA will be involved in compounding the capsaicin
      treatment versus placebo and drug/placebo shall remain in place for at least 30 minutes.
      Clinical improvement will be scored based on visual analog score for pain and assessment at
      hourly increments until discharge or admission.
