    
      Palliative Care is a growing medical practice specialty, however the level of physical
      therapist involvement and the particular roles for physical therapy in this evolving
      discipline are relatively unknown.

      The purpose of this study was to explore emerging physical therapy practice in palliative
      care, and the perceptions of physical therapists regarding their care of the functionally
      dependent elderly, including the role and utilization of palliative care intervention in
      current practice, goal-setting practices which may relate to palliative care, and therapists'
      awareness of cultural and psychosocial issues in patient care.
