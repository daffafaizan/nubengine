      number of drugs as steroids which cause several side effects after a long-term
      treatment.Ery-Dex thanks its peculiar way of administration (intra-erythrocyte encapsulation
      and release at very low doses during 1 month)should dramatically reduce side effects due
      steroids, which are dose dependent, and provide an alternative for long-term glucocorticoid
      therapy.
