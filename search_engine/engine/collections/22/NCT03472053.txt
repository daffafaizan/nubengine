      BIO-11006 in Stage IIIB Non Small Cell Lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who are not candidates
      for curative surgery, radiation, or immunotherapy and who are also receiving Pemetrexed and
      Carboplatin as standard of care (SOC). This study will be conducted at ten clinical centers
      in India under an IND from US-FDA and an IND from Indian FDA.

      This is a parallel 2- Arm study in which a total of 60 patients will be randomized. One Arm
      of 30 subjects will receive aerosolized 125mg BIO-11006 BID using Pari eFlow nebulizer in
      conjunction with SOC chemotherapy (Pemetrexed plus Carboplatin). A second Arm of 30 subjects
      will receive only SOC chemotherapy (Pemetrexed plus Carboplatin). The treatment period will
      be three months and nine months survival follow up period (every three months).

      Primary efficacy endpoint will be Progression-free survival (PFS) in patients who receive
      BIO-11006 plus SOC compared to those who receive SOC alone. The secondary efficacy endpoints
      will include: a. Response rate at three months (4 cycles) per RECIST V1.1; (b) overall
      survival; and (c) patient body weight maintenance.
