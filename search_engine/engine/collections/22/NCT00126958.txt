      a conventional follow-up based on regular monitoring for urinary bladder UCC recurrences by
      cystoscopy. In the test arm a proportion of the cystoscopies is replaced by microsatellite
      analysis on voided urine. Both arms will be stratified for clinical and pathological tumour
      parameters as well as for the mutation status of the prognostic FGFR3 gene mutation.
