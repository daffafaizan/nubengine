      most effective therapeutic intervention. Up to two thirds of female patients undergoing
      breast cancer surgery develop chronic post-procedural pain. This can be best understood by
      the fact that chronic post-procedural pain is strongly associated with acute post-procedural
      pain and that even minimal breast surgery can result in significant post-procedural pain.

      Regional anesthesia techniques can improve acute and chronic post-procedural pain outcomes.
      In the prospective double blind placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial, the
      investigators found that the pectoral nerves (Pecs) block type II, as described by Blanco et
      al., provides reliable and effective post-procedural analgesia for patients undergoing breast
      surgery.

      In this prospective follow-up, the investigators evaluate whether the Pecs II block is
      effective in reducing chronic post-procedural pain in female adult patients undergoing breast
      cancer surgery compared to placebo.
