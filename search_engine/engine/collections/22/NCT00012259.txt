      remission, partial hematologic remission, hematologic improvement, partial response, or back
      to chronic phase status, in patients with blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia treated
      with troxacitabine. II. Determine the proportion of patients whose disease returns to chronic
      phase and remains at that level for at least 3 months when treated with this drug. III.
      Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the duration of
      survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive troxacitabine IV over 30 minutes on
      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until relapse.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 14 months.
