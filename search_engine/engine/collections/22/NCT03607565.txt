      Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA) is the golden index for evaluating cerebral blood
      vessels. We introduced a new parameter derived from DSA to evaluate the perfusion in middle
      cerebral artery (MCA) territory to predict the outcomes in anterior cerebral ischemia.

      To study the possible relationship between the new parameter of cerebral perfusion derived
      from DSA and outcomes in cerebral ischemia（modified Rankin Scale）, we intend to
      retrospectively analyze the images derived from patients who undergone the DSA and follow-up
      outcomes（modified Rankin Scale）.
