      being tested to treat pediatric participants who have advanced stage, newly diagnosed,
      classical CD30+ HL. This study will assess the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity,
      as well as recommended dose of brentuximab vedotin in combination with a multiagent
      chemotherapy regimen that is based on a current standard of care (SOC) first-line treatment
      regimen for newly diagnosed HL.

      The study will enroll approximately 59 evaluable participants. The study will be conducted in
      2 phases, Phase 1 and Phase 2. Phase 1 study will enroll up to 12 participants to determine
      the recommended dose. Once the recommended dose is identified additional participants will be
      enrolled into phase 2 so that the total number of evaluable participants will be
      approximately 59, including participants treated at recommended dose in Phase 1. Participants
      will be enrolled in the following 2 dose Cohorts:

      â€¢ Brentuximab vedotin 48 mg/m^2 or 36 mg/m^2 in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine,
      and dacarbazine.

      Phase 1 has completed enrollment and Phase 2 is now open for enrollment.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in United States (US), Italy, Brazil, Japan. The
      overall time to participate in this study is approximately 55 months, including the follow-up
      period. Participants will be followed for a maximum of 30 days following the last dose of
      protocol therapy for a follow-up assessment and will be followed for survival until death or
      study closure, or up to 2 years after enrollment of the last participant. All participants
      will have an opportunity to participate in an optional long-term follow up, for at least 10
      years after participant enrollment.
