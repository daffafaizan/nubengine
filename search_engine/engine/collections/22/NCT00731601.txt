      mortality. Endoscopic therapy significantly reduces further bleeding, surgery, and mortality
      in patients with bleeding peptic ulcers and is now recommended as the first hemostatic
      modality for these patients.

      In the past few years, adjuvant use of a high-dose proton pump inhibitor (PPI) after
      endoscopic therapy has been endorsed in some studies, two consensus statements and two
      meta-analysis. In our previous experience, we used omeprazole 160 mg /day infusion instead of
      8 mg/h in these patients and obtained a good result .

      The objectives of this study are to assess the outcomes of two different regimens of high
      dose of intravenous pantoprazole after endoscopic therapy in patients with peptic ulcer
      bleeding.
