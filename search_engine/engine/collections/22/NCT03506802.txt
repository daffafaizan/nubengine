    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of administering the combination of autologous peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells (PBMC) and CD34+ peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) following a melphalan
      conditioning regimen, both of which have been genetically modified to express NY-ESO-1 TCR.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of delivering the combination of T-cell receptor (TCR)
      transduced autologous PBMC and CD34+ PBSC to patients.

      II. To determine the persistence of NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced PBMC and the progeny of TCR
      transduced PBSC in serial peripheral blood samples.

      III. Objective response rate (ORR).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the use of positron emission tomography (PET)-based imaging using the PET
      tracer 9-4-[18F]fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl)butylguanine ([18F]FHBG) with the goal of determining
      whether the adoptively transferred NY-ESO-1 TCR transduced PBSC home to bone marrow,
      differentiate into T cells and expand in secondary lymphoid organs and extramedullary disease
      sites.

      OUTLINE:

      G-CSF AND PLERIXAFOR MOBILIZED LEUKAPHERESIS: Between 6 months and 3 weeks before infusion of
      cells, participants undergo G-CSF and plerixafor mobilization of CD34+ peripheral blood stem
      cells. Participants receive filgrastim subcutaneously (SC) on mobilization days 1-4 and up to
      mobilization day 8 and plerixafor SC starting on mobilization day 4 up to day 8. During
      mobilization, participants will undergo mobilized leukapheresis to obtain PBSC. Participants
      also undergo an unmobilized leukapheresis on day -5 before infusion of cells in order to
      obtain PBMC.

      CHEMOTHERAPY CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Participants receive melphalan intravenously (IV) on days
      -3 to -2.

      Participants receive LV-NYESO TCR/sr39TK PBSC IV on day 0, and RV-NYESO TCR PBMC IV on day 1.
      Beginning on day 2, participants receive aldesleukin (interleukin-2 or IL-2) SC twice daily
      (BID) for up to 7 days. Participants receive the 18F-FHBG IV, and after 1 hour, undergo
      PET/computed tomography (CT) on days 30 and 90. After day 100, participants receive
      lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 21 days. Courses of lenalidomide repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up monthly after day 90 until
      disease progression and annually for up to 15 years.
