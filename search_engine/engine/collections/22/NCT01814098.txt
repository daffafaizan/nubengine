      prospective (study following participants forward in time), post-marketing, multi-center
      (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study) study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of escitalopram in participants with MDD with associated
      anxiety symptoms. The duration of the study will be 24 weeks at a starting dose of
      escitalopram 10 milligram per day (mg/day). The dose will be flexibly adjusted (maximum 20
      mg/day) after 2 weeks of treatment depending on Investigator's discretion. The study will
      consist of 9 visits: Baseline, Week 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24. Assessments of efficacy
      and safety will be performed at each visit. The primary efficacy evaluation will be done by
      Montgomery-Asbery Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) and Hamilton Anxiety Scale(HAM-A).
      Participant's safety will also be monitored throughout the study.
