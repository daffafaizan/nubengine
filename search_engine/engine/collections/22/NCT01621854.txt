    
      This is a two-part, Phase I, open label study of NUC-1031 as a single agent, administered IV
      weekly on days 1, 8, & 15 (Schedule A) or twice weekly on days 1 & 5, 8 & 12, 15 &19
      (Schedule B) of a 28 day- cycle regimen. An initial dose-escalation phase (Part I) will be
      followed by an expansion cohort phase (Part II) using the preferred regimen from Part I. In
      Part I, sequential patients will be assigned to increasing doses of NUC-1031 in a standard '3
      + 3' design to determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). There will be a review of all
      available data (in particular the safety profile and preliminary PK data through to at least
      the last scheduled day of Cycle 1) following enrolment of the second cohort of both schedule
      A and B to select the preferred administration schedule to take forward for ongoing
      evaluation.

      In Part II (dose expansion) additional patients will be enrolled to receive NUC-1031 at the
      RP2D and dosing frequency determined from Part I of the study. During Part II, further
      information will be obtained regarding safety, PK, PD and preliminary anti-tumour efficacy of
      NUC-1031 at RP2D.

      In both parts of the study, patients may continue to receive NUC-1031 for up to 6 cycles,
      until disease progression, for as long as the participant receives clinical benefit in the
      opinion of the CI, the occurrence of unmanageable drug related toxicity despite dose
      modification or if the study participant declines further treatment.
