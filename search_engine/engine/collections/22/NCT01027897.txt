      can provide insight into developing appropriate dosing regimens. It is even more imperative
      at the present time to maximize PK/PD parameters since there are no new novel antimicrobial
      agents to treat resistant gram-negative infections. This approach allows us to achieve
      superior PD parameters and treat bacteria that would have been resistant to standard dosing
      due to higher minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs).

      Doripenem exhibits time-dependent bactericidal activity and the pharmacodynamic parameter
      predicting clinical and bacteriologic outcomes is the percentage of the dosing interval that
      free drug concentrations remain above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T > MIC) of the
      infecting pathogen Sepsis is known to influence drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as
      a result of changes in hemodynamics, capillary permeability, third spacing, acid-base status,
      serum proteins, and organ function. Moreover, trauma patients tend to be younger with fewer
      comorbidities. They are hypermetabolic and are often given aggressive fluid resuscitation
      resulting in increased renal clearance of drugs and a larger volume of distribution. As a
      consequence of these differences in PK parameters, the calculated PD parameters will likely
      differ resulting in sub-optimal T> MIC. For time-dependent antibacterial agents such as
      doripenem, the T > MIC is one of the most important pharmacodynamic parameters in predicting
      clinical efficacy, therefore it is imperative to evaluate the PK parameters in this
      particular population.
