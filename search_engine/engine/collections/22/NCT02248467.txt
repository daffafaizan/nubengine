    
      Primary objective:

      - Evaluation in obese and hypogonadal patients candidates for bariatric surgery of the effect
      of testosterone replacement therapy in improving the symptoms of LUTS (assessed using the
      IPSS questionnaire) compared to hypogonadal untreated subjects and eugonadal subjects.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Evaluation of the effect of testosterone in obese and hypogonadal patients candidates
           for bariatric surgery in improving metabolic parameters (glycaemia, oral glucose
           tolerance test, HbA1c, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triglycerides, arterial
           pressure, BMI, waist circumference) compared to hypogonadal untreated subjects and
           eugonadal subjects

        -  Evaluation of the effect of testosterone in obese and hypogonadal patients candidates
           for bariatric surgery in improving uroflowmetric parameters compared to hypogonadal
           untreated subjects and eugonadal subjects

        -  Evaluation of the effect of testosterone in obese and hypogonadal patients candidates
           for bariatric surgery on the ultrasound characteristics of the prostate
           (macro-calcifications, intraprostatic arterial velocity, volume of the prostate gland).

        -  Evaluation of the effect of testosterone in obese and hypogonadal patients candidates
           for bariatric surgery on pre-adipocytes isolated from visceral adipose tissue samples
           collected during surgical procedures, as compared to hypogonadal untreated subjects and
           eugonadal subjects.
