        -  Compare 36-month overall survival of patients with metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma
           treated with hormonal therapy and docetaxel vs hormonal therapy alone.

        -  Compare 24-month progression-free survival (biological progression and/or clinical
           progression) in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare costs of these regimens for these patients.

        -  Compare the tolerability of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the toxicity profile of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive hormonal therapy comprising 1 of the following: goserelin alone
           OR goserelin and antiandrogen therapy OR surgical castration. Hormonal therapy continues
           until the development of hormone resistance. Within 2 months after initiation of
           hormonal therapy, patients receive docetaxel IV every 3 weeks for up to 9 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive hormonal therapy as in arm I. Quality of life is assessed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 378 patients will be accrued for this study.
