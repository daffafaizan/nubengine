      painless form of temporomandibular joints dysfunction.

      Material and methods The research material consisted of 72 patients who reported to the
      prosthetic treatment because of temporomandibular joint dysfunction. The study group included
      36 patients with pain form of dysfunction, and control group - 36 patients with painless form
      of disorder. Each patient underwent specialized examination of functional disorders, in order
      to diagnose the type of dysfunction and commissioned to carry out a study of the blood test
      concern with evaluation of the C-reactive protein (CRP) level in the same analytical
      laboratory.
