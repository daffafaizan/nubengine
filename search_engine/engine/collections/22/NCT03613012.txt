      injection or shockwave therapy will be included. After informed consents signed, the age,
      gender, dominant hand and hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) will be collected.
      Each patient will be connected with a multifunctional monitor HXD-1 for 8 minutes to access
      EEG in a quiet environment before pain treatment and 30 minutes after pain treatment. NRS
      will also be recorded before pain treatment and 30 minutes after pain treatment. PI will be
      extracted from EEG by analysts.

      In order to reduce environmental effects, the same quiet research environment will be used
      throughout the study. All data will be obtained and recorded by the same person, and all PI
      will be analyzed and calculated by the same person.

      SPSS 20.0 will be used to analyze the data, Pearson's correlations and Kappa consistency test
      to analyze the validity and reliability of PI. The receiver operating characteristic curve
      will be use to analyze the sensitivity and specificity of PI to evaluating moderate and
      severe pain(NRS≥4). A multiple linear regression equation with PI as dependent variable and
      anxiety score and depression score as independent variables will be used to evaluate the
      influence of anxiety and depression on PI.
