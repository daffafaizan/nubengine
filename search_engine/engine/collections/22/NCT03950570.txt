      that consists of two stages:

      Phase 1: A dose escalation stage to determine the MTD/RP2D of ORIN1001 when given as a single
      agent in up to 30 subjects with advanced solid tumors. In addition, a dose escalation stage
      to determine the MTD/RP2D of daily ORIN1001 in combination with Abraxane given intravenously
      in up to 18 subjects with relapsed refractory metastatic breast cancer (TNBC or ER+ HER2-).

      Phase 2: An expansion stage of ORIN1001 alone (Cohort A: TNBC) and in combination with
      Abraxane (Cohort B: Myc+; Cohort C: ER+ HER2-, and Cohort D: TNBC) to estimate efficacy in up
      to 120 subjects with relapsed refractory metastatic breast cancer.
