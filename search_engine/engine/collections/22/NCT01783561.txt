      effects of caffeine administered in the first 2 hours versus 12 hours of life in infants <29
      weeks gestation. Our primary hypothesis is that caffeine administered in the first two hours
      of life can prevent the need for endotracheal intubation in the first 12 hours of life..
      These evaluations are critical in determining both the safety and efficacy of early caffeine
      therapy.
