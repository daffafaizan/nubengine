      fungi and parasites and developed novel analysis methods to analyze next-generation (NGS)
      sequencing data to rapidly identify infectious agents. This technology suite, known as the
      Explifyâ„¢ platform, holds the promise to improve patient care and efficiently guide provider
      treatment planning for those suffering from infectious disease.

      The PIPSEC trial, developed by pediatric physicians specializing in genomic medicine, is
      intended to facilitate the acquisition of high quality and clinically annotated biospecimens
      for the purpose of research discovery. This project intends to advance metagenomics,
      microbial genetics, bioinformatics and data analytics, for pathogen detection utilizing
      cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) specimens to contribute to the diagnosis of infectious agents
      impacting the central nervous system among pediatric patients. Clinically annotated specimens
      will facilitate continued development and validation of the Explify test and its clinical
      utility for providers treating central nervous system (CNS) infections.

      The primary objective is to assess clinical utility of the Explify test compared to
      concurrent standard of care testing to identify pathogens from CSF fluid within a pediatric
      patient population.
