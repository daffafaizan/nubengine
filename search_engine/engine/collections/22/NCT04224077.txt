        -  a morphological sequence

        -  a reference diffusion tensor sequence covering three lumbar stages (reference DTI),

        -  a diffusion tensor sequence acquired in multiband technique, covering three lumbar
           stages (optimized DTI),

        -  a diffusion tensor sequence acquired in a multiband technique, covering a lumbar stage,
           of higher spatial resolution (centred DTI)
