      Primary Raynaud's phenomenon is a peripheral vascular disorder resulting in vasospastic
      attacks provoked by cold and/or emotional stress. Attacks most often occur in the fingers,
      but may occur in other extremities as well.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Randomized. Patients were assigned to one of four treatment groups: slow release Nifedipine,
      a calcium channel blocker; pill placebo; temperature biofeedback; or electromyograph
      biofeedback from the frontalis muscle. The primary endpoint was reduction in number of
      vasospastic attacks. Other endpoints included: other measures of Raynaud's attacks including
      frequency, severity, duration, response to laboratory-based cold challenge, and quality of
      life.
