      PD-1 antibody in the treatment of cancer, but the clinical research of chemotherapy
      containing adriamycin combined with anti-PD-1 antibody for advanced STS patients is almost
      blank. Regimen containing adriamycin is the standard chemotherapy regimen for advanced STS
      approved by international guidelines. As an innovative PD-1 monoclonal antibody, more phase
      II clinical studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sintilimab in a variety
      of cancers. For patients who fail or cannot tolerate first-line treatment, treatment options
      are still limited. In view of the above problems, this study aims to observe and explore the
      efficacy and safety of chemotherapy including adriamycin combined with sintilimab in the
      second-line treatment of patients with advanced STS, so as to provide more and better
      treatment options for patients with advanced STS.
