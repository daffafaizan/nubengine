    
      Subjects will be asked to come to the Rutgers EOHSI clinical center (Piscataway, NJ) for 5
      study visits. A physical exam to determine eligibility will be done at the first study visit.
      If the subject is healthy and able to produce a sputum sample, he/she will then be scheduled
      for 2 3-hour exposure visits. One exposure will be to clean air and the other exposure will
      be to 0.2 ppm ozone. During the exposures, subjects will be requested to ride an exercise
      bicycle intermittently (approximately every 15 minutes). A follow-up visit for sputum
      collection will be scheduled either 24, 48, or 72 hours after each exposure visit. Blood,
      urine, and exhaled breath samples will also be collected at each visit.
