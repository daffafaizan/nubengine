      participation in aerobic exercise (testing session [s] 1); and 2) magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) to assess brain structure and function, and 3) clinical assessments of motor function
      and activity. The MRI and clinical tests will be completed on s2. Between the exercise test
      and MRI sessions individuals will wear accelerometers for 3 days to index usual activity
      levels. A custom computer program will then assign participants quasi-randomly to either the
      rest or exercise groups stratified on age, sex, and baseline motor function. Cortical
      excitability will be assessed before and after either a single session of priming aerobic
      exercise, or rest, by group (s3). Next, priming exercise will be paired with skilled motor
      practice for 5 sessions (s4-8). Practice sessions will be separated by 48 hours. Importantly
      motor learning will be assessed via delayed, no-exercise retention tests 24-hours (s9) and
      30-days (s11) after the last practice session. Activity levels (3 day accelerometry), TMS and
      MRI measures will be re-assessed after the second retention test (s10).
