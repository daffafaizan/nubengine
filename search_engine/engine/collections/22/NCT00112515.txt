      Primary

        -  Determine the safety of modafinil in cancer patients.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of improving fatigue, in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the efficacy of this drug, in terms of improving mood, cognitive ability,
           functional status, and quality of life, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, pilot study.

      Patients receive oral modafinil once daily for 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients may receive additional modafinil at the discretion of the
      physician.

      Fatigue, mood, cognition, functional status, and quality of life are assessed at baseline and
      in weeks 2 and 4.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months.
