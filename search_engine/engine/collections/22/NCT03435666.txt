      Primary Objective: To demonstrate the bioequivalence between Capecitabine Tablets 500 mg of
      Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, China in comparison with XELODA® (Capecitabine) Tablets 500 mg,
      Distributed by Genentech USA, Inc. following a single oral dose administration in adult
      cancer patients under fed condition.

      Secondary Objective: To monitor the safety and tolerability profile of the subjects exposed
      to the Investigational Medicinal Product.

      Study Design: a randomized, multicenter, open label, balanced, two treatment, three period,
      three sequence, reference replicate crossover, single dose, bioequivalence study under fed
      conditions.

      Number of subjects: at least 39 evaluable patients Mode of Administration for Test and
      Reference product: Patient will be randomized to one of the three treatment sequences i.e.
      TRR, RTR or RRT. Where T-Test drug and R-Reference drug. The study medication will be
      administered in the morning of Day 1 (Period I of the study), Day 2(Period II of the study)
      and Day 3 (Period III of the study).

      Since, the patients are on a twice daily dosing regimen the patients should receive their
      usual dose of capecitabine as per their dosing regimen between each subsequent study periods.
      The drug product used to administer the dose between the study periods can be the same or any
      approved product as that used by the patients for their current dosing regimen. The morning
      and evening doses will be based on BSA.

      Blood collection times: pre-dose blood sample of 03 mL (00.00) will be collected within 5
      minutes before dosing in each period of the study. After dosing in each period (Day 1, Day 2
      and Day 3), the post-dose blood samples of 03mL each will be drawn at 0.17 (10min), 0.33
      (20min), 0.50 (30 min),0.67 (40min), 0.83 (50min), 1.00, 1.25 (1h15min), 1.50 (1h30min), 1.75
      (1h45min), 2, 2.25 (2h15min), 2.5 (2h30min), 2.75 (2h45min), 3.00, 3.50 (3h30min), 4.00,
      5.00, 6.00, 7.00, and 8.00 hours following drug administration.

      Bioequivalence Criteria:

      For Capecitabine, the bioequivalence will be concluded based on within-subject standard
      deviation of reference formulation, termed as SWR.

      Reference - Scale Average Bioequivalence Approach:

      When SWR ≥ 0.294 for any of the primary pharmacokinetic parameters, below mentioned both the
      criteria must be satisfied: The 95% upper confidence bound for (μT- μR)2/S2WR determined must
      be ≤ θ, or equivalently, a 95% upper confidence bound for (μT- μR)2-θ*S2WR must be ≤ 0; and
      the point estimate (test/reference geometric mean ratio) must fall within [0.80, 1.25].

      Conventional Average Bioequivalence Approach:

      When SWR < 0.294 for any of the primary pharmacokinetic parameters, 90% confidence interval
      for the geometric least square means ratio (T/R) of that parameter must be fall within the
      acceptance range of 80.00% to 125.00%.
