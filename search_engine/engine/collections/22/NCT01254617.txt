      I. To determine the maximum-tolerated dose of lenalidomide when given in combination with
      cetuximab in patients with advanced colorectal or squamous cell head and neck cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate response in refractory V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog
      (KRAS) wild-type colorectal and head/neck cancers as monitored by measurable disease by
      Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      II. To measure antibody-dependent cytotoxic activity (ADCC) in patients receiving
      lenalidomide plus cetuximab.

      III. To measure natural killer cell cytokine production in patients receiving lenalidomide
      plus cetuximab.

      IV. To describe fragment c gamma receptor polymorphisms. (Exploratory) V. To describe
      baseline immune cell function. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lenalidomide.

      Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and cetuximab
      intravenously (IV) over 1-2 hours on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 weeks.
