      way to help him.

      The aim of palliative treatment is to improve quality of life and relief symptom,or sometime
      ,extended survival rate.

      There are two types of biliary stent:

        1. plastic stent made from polyethylene or polytetrafluoroethylene

        2. metalic stent braided in the form of a tubular mesh from surgical-grade stainless steel
           alloy and designed to expand to a maximum diameter of 10mm.

      The main drawback of plastic stent is relatively high occlusion rate, but its advantage is
      the lower cost.

      In the reasons of higher occlusion rate , the lower cost of plastic stent versus metallic
      stent that should be stent exchange when occluded, so we would to know about quality of life
      in both group.
