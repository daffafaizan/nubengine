      defined as collection of non-purulent effusion (mucoid or serous) in the middle ear space
      without signs of acute infection. It's synomus are serous otitis media, secretory otitis
      media or glue ear. Adenoid hypertrophy can cause mechanical obstruction of the Eustachian
      tube which plays an important role in the pathogenesis of OME.

      Management of OME consisted of many varieties; 1- Auto inflation, 2- Medical treatment and 3-
      Surgical. Surgical treatment indicated in cases where the effusion does not resolve
      spontaneously or failed medical treatment for 3 months and the main purpose of surgery is to
      restore middle ear aeration. Treatment options are Adenoidectomy with or without Myringotomy
      or Myringotomy and Tympanostomy tube application.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of each surgical option in management of
      otitis media with effusion. This study will be carried out in ENT department of Assiut
      university hospital on 150 child diagnosed as persistent otitis media with effusion due to
      adenoid enlargement and they will be categorized randomly into three groups (50 cases per
      each). Group I will undergo Adenoidectomy alone, group II will undergo Adenoidectomy and
      Myringotomy and group III will undergo Adenoidectomy and Myringotomy and Tympanostomy tube
      application. All patients will be subjected to full ENT examination and audiological
      evaluation. Postoperative evaluation will be done for all patients for 3 months through
      clinical and audiological evaluation.
