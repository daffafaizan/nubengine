    
      Levator ani muscle avulsion is a frequent postpartum trauma imposing a considerable risk of
      pelvic organ prolapse on women in later life. Furthermore, the trauma reduces the
      effectiveness of pelvic reconstructive surgery and has a detrimental effect of the sexuality
      of the affected women. The trauma occurs most frequently in the first vaginal delivery with
      an incidence of 10-30%. However, the risk of levator avulsion in women after vaginal birth
      after caesarean section (VBAC) is unknown although possible increased risk has been
      suggested.

      The aim of the study is to assess the prevalence of levator ani avulsion among women who
      delivered vaginally after a caesarean section and make a comparison with a primiparous
      cohort. The secondary aim is to evaluate and compare the health related quality of life
      regarding pelvic floor disorders and sexuality.
