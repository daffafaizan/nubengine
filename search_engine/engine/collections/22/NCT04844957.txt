      long course of disease, which seriously affects children's physical and mental health and
      quality of life, and the incidence rate is also increasing year by year. But the current
      treatment measures are not ideal, Therefore, we need to look for new biological indicators,
      according to different biological indicators to develop different treatment options, so as to
      improve the current situation of poor treatment of children with POTS.
