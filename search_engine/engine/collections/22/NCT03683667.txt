      five are too short for their age. While dietary data indicate that protein intakes of infants
      and young children are largely in line with requirements, the extent to which requirements
      derived for healthy infants and young children are relevant in the context of frequent
      infections remains an important research question.

      Recent investigations indicate widespread pathogen carriage among Bangladeshi infants, with
      virtually all having at least one detectable pathogen in nondiarrheal stools by six months of
      age. Campylobacter and pathogenic E. Coli predominate in this setting. Enteric pathogens can
      compete with the host for available nutrients or alter nutrient metabolism. Acting via
      environmental enteric dysfunction, they can alter both digestion-through loss of digestive
      enzymes-and absorption of nutrients. Microbial translocation may further alter specific amino
      acid requirements.

      Even in the absence of acute diarrheal disease, enteric pathogen carriage is strongly
      associated with linear growth faltering. Combining the effects of high pathogen burden and
      poor diet, as indicated by low energy and protein from complementary foods, observational
      evidence suggests that the potentially preventable length-for-age Z-score deficit may be as
      high as 0.98.

      The present trial will test the combination of a) protein supplementation in the form of a
      protein-rich blended food or an egg, both fed daily to infants 6-12 months of age, and b)
      azithromycin treatment for enteric pathogens. The primary outcome will be change in
      length-for-age Z-score from the 6 to 12 months. Biochemical, microbiological and clinical
      intermediates will be measured to inform our secondary aims.
