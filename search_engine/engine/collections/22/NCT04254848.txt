      intra-orally. In this study the oral stereognosis is determined by placing objects of various
      shapes in the patient's mouth and having the patient identify the correct form. Several
      studies has proved that oral stereognosis ability (OSA) can be used as a predictor for
      determining the ability of the patients with missing teeth to adapt to a new prosthesis
      placed in the patient's mouth.

      Maxillary tori is a non-cancerous bony swelling found in palate and have high prevalence
      among Malaysian population. Whether OSA is higher or lower in patients with maxillary tori is
      not known.
