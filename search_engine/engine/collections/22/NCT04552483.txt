    
      SARITA-2 is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel, -blinded,
      interventional, treatment clinical trial with two arms, which aims to study the impact of
      nitazoxanide in the early phase of the COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease-19).

      Experimental group: 196 patients received nitazoxanide 500mg 8 / 8 hours for 5 days. Control
      group: 196 patients received placebo 8/8 hours for 5 days.

      Population: 392 Patients with COVID-19, confirmed by RT-PCR (Real Time polymerase chain
      reaction), symptomatic in the early phase of the disease.

      Calculation of the sample size was based on a previous study which demonstrated that 78% of
      Covid-19 patients in group 4 (Hospitalized without oxygen therapy), according to the WHO
      ordinal classification, experienced complete resolution of symptoms after receiving
      placebo.10 In the present trial, patients were classified as group 2 (Symptomatic and
      independent), and a greater degree of recovery as measured by symptom-free days (80%) was
      expected even after placebo. Thus, assuming an 11% increase in symptom-free days in those
      patients who would receive nitazoxanide compared to placebo, we would need approximately 196
      patients per experimental group, admitting a beta error of 15% and alpha error of 5%, for a
      total n of 392 patients. Calculation of the sample size was done by G*Power 3.1.9.2
      (Universität Düsseldorf, Düsseldorf, Germany).
