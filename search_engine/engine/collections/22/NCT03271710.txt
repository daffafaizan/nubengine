    
      The ENTRAP Study is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single-arm, study with
      follow-up to 30 days to determine the acute safety, acute device performance and clinical
      performance of the Vanguard IEP Peripheral Balloon Angioplasty System with Integrated Embolic
      Protection. The Vanguard IEP Peripheral Balloon Angioplasty System with Integrated Embolic
      Protection is indicated for peripheral vascular percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)
      and capture and removal of embolic material during angioplasty for the femoral, iliac,
      popliteal and profunda arteries.

      The Vanguard System has been designed to revascularize iliac and femoro-popliteal PAD while
      protecting against embolization at the same time. It is the first system in which the embolic
      protection filter is coupled on the same catheter as the angioplasty balloon for use in the
      lower extremities. Up to 130 patients will be enrolled into this study and followed for 30
      days after post-procedure. Adult patients with lifestyle-limiting claudication or rest pain
      (Rutherford categories 2 to 3) who meet all eligibility criteria will be approached for
      participation in the trial.
