      episodes of moderate to severe headache accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia, and
      phonophobia. Acute pharmacologic therapy for migraine aims to terminate the attack or reduce
      its severity. Analgesics are commonly used or, if these are ineffective, triptans. Since
      triptans are contraindicated in patients with coronary artery disease, uncontrolled
      hypertension, and cerebrovascular disease alternative medications are required for patients
      where simple analgesics do not work. COL-144 has no vasoconstrictor activity at clinically
      relevant concentrations and might meet this need. COL-144 was effective when given
      intravenously in a placebo-controlled dose-ranging study. This study investigates which dose
      of oral COL-144 is effective in the in acute treatment of migraine headache.
