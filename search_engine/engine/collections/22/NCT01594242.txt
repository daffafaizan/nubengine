      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether administration of bortezomib
      leads to an increase in cellular autophagy, as determined by electron micrographs of
      peripheral blood lymphocytes and primary myeloma cells in patients receiving single-agent
      bortezomib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        1. To determine the optimal timing of autophagy assessments for patients receiving
           bortezomib.

        2. To explore whether high levels of autophagy are associated with resistance to bortezomib
           therapy.

        3. To validate our primary assay by confirming baseline stability of the number of
           autophagic vesicles per cell

        4. To compare results of autophagy measurements in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and
           bone marrow plasma cells
