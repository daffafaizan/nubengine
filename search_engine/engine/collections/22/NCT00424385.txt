      the fact that both agents can be given orally with what appears to be tolerable side effects,
      we hypothesize that combining both agents may provide patients with another effective regimen
      in a disease where therapeutic options are limited. This study is designed to investigate the
      safety of combining Gleevec and Sorafenib as well as feasibility in AIPC patients who have
      failed one or more lines of systemic chemotherapy. Once safety is established, a follow-up
      phase II study will commence to investigate efficacy.
