        -  Determine whether topical tazarotene, administered over a period of 18 months as a
           chemopreventive agent, reduces the incidence of basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) on treated
           skin in patients with basal cell nevus syndrome (BCNS).

        -  Expand and refine chemopreventive strategies in patients with BCNS who are at high risk
           for the development of BCCs.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients apply topical tazarotene cream to the face once daily for 18 months in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity.
