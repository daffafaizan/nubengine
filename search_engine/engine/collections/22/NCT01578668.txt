      are a frequent complication of NSCLC, especially in lung adenocarcinoma. 30-50% or more these
      patients will develop brain metastases at first time or during the treatment. Limited
      treatment options, whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT) combined with or without stereotactic
      radiosurgery (SRS) as the primary treatment approach, are available for brain metastases
      patients with poor survival. So the availability of effective therapies are therefore of
      great importance. Currently, two agents (erlotinib and pemetrexed) are reported more
      effective in lung adenocarcinoma patients with brain metastases. The heterogeneity of NSCLC
      tumors provides a strong rationale for using combination therapy with targeted agents that
      have different mechanisms of action, moreover different combination offering synergistic
      effects. So we investigate if erlotinib plus pemetrexed, cisplatin are effective and safe in
      treating lung adenocarcinoma with brain metastases.
