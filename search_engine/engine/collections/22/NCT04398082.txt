      of patients. Sleep disturbance can cause an increased risk of confusion after surgery,
      increased pain needing some or more medication, untoward events (heart and breathing
      problems), delayed recovery and increased lengths of hospital stay.

      Hospitalization interferes with sleep patterns, causing poor quality sleep due to noise,
      light, pain, medication administration and nursing checks. The circadian rhythm, which is the
      "body clock" is a 24-hour cycle that tells our bodies when to sleep and rise. This in turn
      helps in regulating many physiological processes in the body. Sleep disruption affects the
      body clock, thereby changing hormone levels that may be responsible for poor wound healing.
      This study aims to evaluate sleep problems before disruption post-operatively and also
      evaluate the relation between poor sleep health and quality of recovery utilizing sleep
      health measurements such as sleep quality, sleep timing, and sleep efficiency.

      Objectives of the study:

        1. To examine the associations between specific pre-operative sleep-health parameters,
           predicting poor sleep health, and patient-centered outcomes such as pain control,
           delirium, sleep-related quality of life, and quality of recovery scores in the
           peri-operative period.

        2. To estimate the association between presence of intrinsic sleep disorders and patient
           centric outcomes such as pain control, delirium, sleep-related quality of life and
           quality of recovery scores in the post-operative period.

        3. To validate a set of subjective and objective measures of various sleep health domains
           in the post-operative period.
