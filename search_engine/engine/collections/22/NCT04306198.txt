      incidence is increasing and it is expected to have 6,26 million cases per year worldwide by
      2050.

      Surgical treatment is recognized as the best option in these patients because it allows early
      rehabilitation and decreases mortality and complications.

      Currently, the fixation with a cephalomedullary nail is the most commonly used treatment,
      since it has some mechanical advantages compared to other fixation methods and achieves
      adequate stability allowing early weight bearing and rehabilitation with low failure rates.

      Changes in the design of these implants have tried to reduce the failure rate. The main
      change has been the introduction of the helical blade for cephalic fixation, instead of a lag
      screw. The concept behind this modification is that the blade would have greater fixation to
      the bone and less risk of cut out, because it is supposed to compact the bone around the
      helical blade instead of removing it.

      In spite of some biomechanical studies in cadaveric or artificial models validating this
      biomechanical advantage, clinical series have shown controversial results. Recently,
      retrospective clinical studies have shown similar results with the use of the helical blade,
      and even some studies have shown a higher failure rate compared to the sliding screw.

      Currently there is no prospective evidence regarding the failure rate of these two fixation
      methods. Our objective is to contribute with solid evidence to solve this answer. That is why
      we have designed a prospective randomized study with strict inclusion criteria, follow up and
      radiographic measurements.
