      Group A (physiotherapy as a control, n=58), Group B (ESWT, n=62), Group C (Prolotherapy,
      n=56) and Group D (PRP, n=55). In group A, patients were educated to do stretching and
      eccentric strengthening exercise of wrist extensor muscles. In group B patients were treated
      with 3 sessions of high-energy shock wave therapy ESWT (Evotron, Switech medical,
      Kreuzlingen, CH) in 2 weeks interval. Total energy flux density ranged from 0.1 to 0.14
      mJ/mm2 (1500 impulses). Shockwave was targeted over lateral epicondyle where maximum
      tenderness was located. In group C, injection of 20% dextrose (3cc mixed with 0.3cc of
      lidocaine) to ECRB tendon was done under ultrasound guidance and in group D, 3 cc of PRP
      (Harvest SmartPReP 2 APC 30 Process Kit, Harvest Technologies, Plymouth, MA) was injected
      into ECRB tendon under ultrasound guidance. 22G needle was used for injection in group C and
      D. The primary outcome measure is DASH scoring system which is recorded on the initial, 3rd,
      6th, 18th and 24th month. Secondary outcome measures were ultrasonography (measured on
      initial, 6th and 24th month) and SSS (Subjective Satisfaction Score) measured on initial and
      24th month. After 24 months from the last procedure, all serial questionnaires and
      physician-filled-SSS sheets were gathered and analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance and
      Scheffe post-test. A value of p<0.01 was considered statistically significant.
