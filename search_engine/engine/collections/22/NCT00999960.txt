      prostatectomy , with or without using an online video simulator Design : Prospective
      randomized multicentric study

      Methods: 20 surgeons considered as naive concerning their experience in laparoscopic radical
      prostatectomy will be randomized into two groups :1 group will use the online video
      simulator, 1 group will use usual learning methods except the online video simulator.

      All procedures will be recorded from the beginning till the end.A video review will be
      preformed concerning all the videos in order to identify the total operative time and time to
      perform each one of the operative steps of the procedure.Clinical , biological and
      histological data will be collected in order to compare the two arms.
