      need. Treatment options within this patient population are limited, and inadequately treated
      disease may cause high morbidity, negatively impacting quality of life and leading to
      increased costs for supportive care. To address the unmet needs of these patients, this
      exploratory trial combining pemetrexed with standard-of-care nivolumab, with an
      investigational plan to study clinical and health services outcomes is being proposed.
