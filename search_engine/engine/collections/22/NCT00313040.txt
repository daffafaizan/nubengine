      amounts of physical activity - even that insufficient to produce or maintain weight loss -
      are at significantly reduced risk for health complications including all-cause mortality.
      Interventions for overweight persons targeting increased physical activity rather than weight
      loss as the main outcome of treatment have not been well studied and could represent simpler,
      more sustainable, and more cost-effective approaches in addressing the obesity epidemic.

      METHOD: Pilot randomized controlled trial. Sedentary patients with BMI 25-45, and no major
      contraindications for unsupervised physical activity recruited. Participants randomized to
      receive either brief consultation consisting of 3 in-person meetings, a workbook, and limited
      telephone contact or usual care with their medical provider including access to community
      weight-loss groups/resources. Intervention therapists novice pre-professional students. The
      intervention is manualized and coded for treatment integrity. The main outcome measures are
      Cohen's d effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals for the change in moderate-equivalent
      intensity physical activity/week at 3 months relative to baseline assessed by a blinded
      assessor using the Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Recall. Secondary outcomes include effect
      sizes and confidence intervals for changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and depression using
      the modified Canadian Aerobic Fitness test and Beck Depression Inventory. Analyses to be
      performed by intention to treat. Missing data to be imputed by baseline observation carried
      forward.
