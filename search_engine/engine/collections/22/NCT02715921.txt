      far, exercise training in CF have either required patients travel to a gym or relied on home
      visits or telephone calls. Virtual visits provide a novel and innovative platform to deliver
      a live stream of exercise sessions with two-way video and audio capabilities, allowing
      individualized attention to exercise for CF patient from the comfort and privacy of their
      homes. Applications of tele-exercise, or tele-rehabilitation, have been shown to be as
      effective as in conventional physical therapy following orthopedic surgeries and, in stroke
      patients, to optimize patient outcome by prolonging duration of treatment and preventing the
      observed decline after the termination of therapy. For CF patients, the latter is especially
      important given the impact of hospitalizations for acute exacerbations on exercise tolerance.
      In this particular population, where cross-contamination risks limit use of group exercise
      activity, using two-way video telecommunication allows participation in exercise programs
      while adhering to the standards of CF management regarding infection control.

      This study would be the first to evaluate implementing tele-exercise and remote monitoring
      program on pediatric CF patients. Pediatric CF patients will be enrolled in a six-week
      exercise program that is streamed live from an instructor into their computers at home via a
      HIPAA compliant telemedicine platform. Remote monitoring devices, such as accelerometers and
      wireless heart rate monitors, will evaluate baseline habitual activity and intensity of
      exercise, respectively. The goal of this study is to show that tele-exercise program is a
      feasible and convenient and cost-effective method to enhance CF care.
