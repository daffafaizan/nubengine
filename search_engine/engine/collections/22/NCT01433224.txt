        -  Explore inter-tumoral heterogeneity in DNA methylation by tumor histology.

        -  Determine the genomic methylation pattern in the tumors.

        -  Correlate methylation pattern with tumor histology and clinical characteristics.

        -  Carry out exome capture and massively parallel sequencing on selected germ cell tumors
           (GCTs) and matched normal tissue.

        -  Perform exome capture and Solexa sequencing on a selected set of GCTs.

        -  Validate candidate mutations in an independent set of tumors.

        -  Determine the expression profile of mRNAs, lincRNAs and microRNAs in the tumors using
           RNA Seq.

      OUTLINE: Archived blood and tumor tissue samples are analyzed for genomic methylation
      pattern, exome capture and sequencing, and candidate mutations by methylation-specific PCR
      techniques, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays, and Solexa sequencing methods.
      Results are validated by using pyrosequencing assays and primer-extension assays. Methylation
      pattern is also associated with each patient's tumor histology and clinical data.
