      feasibility of sprayed liquid nitrogen through a catheter via endoscope in subjects with
      radiation proctitis. There will be two groups. Subjects in Group 1 will receive a cryospray
      applied to healthy tissue for 10 seconds. The cryospray will be repeated four (4) times in
      sequential fashion for a total of 40 seconds of cryospray therapy. Subjects in Group 2 will
      receive a cryospray applied to healthy tissue for 20 seconds. The cryospray will be repeated
      two (2) times in sequential fashion for a total of 40 seconds of cryospray therapy.
