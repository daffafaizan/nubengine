      conventional abdominoplasty (AP group) were asked to complete two study-specific
      questionnaires. One questionnaire covered general and specific aspects concerning abdominal
      outcomes and morbidity. The other covered general outcomes such as satisfaction with surgery
      and change of body image, self-confidence, social and intimate relations. In addition, all
      patients performed an abdominal muscle function test.
