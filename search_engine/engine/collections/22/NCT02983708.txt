      source of cell therapy for children with CP, if these cells had a similar neuroregenerative
      potential to bone marrow/cord blood mononuclear cells (MNCs). Multipotent precursor cells
      exist in peripheral blood, and a fraction of elutriated blood cells from normal individuals
      contains MNCs that have the potential to be MSCs. There are several advantages to using
      mPBMCs for cell therapy in children with CP: the G-CSF that is used to mPBMCs has
      neuroregenerative potential; the collection and fractionation of stem cells can be repeated;
      and, the therapy is suitable for most children with CP.
