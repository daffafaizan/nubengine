      influence on survival is unclear. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the wait
      list time on long term disease-free survival in patients scheduled for colorectal cancer
      resection.

      Materials and Methods A prospective, single center study was carried out in patients with
      stage I-III colorectal cancer scheduled for surgery between 2012-2017 at a Colorectal Surgery
      Unit of a tertiary care center. Wait list time was defined as the time from completion of
      diagnostic workup and definitive surgery and divided into 2-week intervals from 2 to 6 weeks.
      The outcome variables were 2- and 5-year disease free survival. Screening for disease
      progression was with carcinoembryonic antigen levels and chest/abdominal computed tomography
      scan. Data was collected prospectively and subsequently analyzed.
