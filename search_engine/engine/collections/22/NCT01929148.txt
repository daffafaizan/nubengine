      myomectomy (LM) (study group), starting from September 1, 2013. Other 77 patients who will
      ask us to undergo LM without the addiction of PBS will constitute the control group. For each
      patient, ovarian reserve modification before and after surgery will be recorded as the
      primary outcome. Specifically, one month before and three months after laparoscopy, on day 1
      to 4 of menstrual cycles serum AMH, FSH and E2 will be evaluated and a transvaginal
      ultrasound examination (Voluson E8 Expert or Voluson-i - GE Healthcare Ultrasound) to assess
      AFC, OV, VI, FI and VFI, will be carried out by the same experienced ultrasonographist
      responsible for the ambulatory of ovarian reserve in each Unit.

      Ovarian reserve modification will be defined as the difference (expressed as Î”) between
      post-operative and pre-operative values of AMH, FSH, AFC, OV, VI, FI and VFI. For each
      surgical procedure, moreover, operative time, variation of hemoglobin level, postoperative
      hospital stay, postoperative return to normal activity and complication rate will be recorded
      as secondary outcomes.
