      increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. Low-volume, high-intensity
      cycling exercise has shown to elicit positive effects on metabolic syndrome risk factors such
      as triglyceride concentrations. The objective of this study was to determine the combined
      effects of a high-protein, reduced carbohydrate diet and high-intensity interval training on
      metabolic syndrome risk factors in women. The second primary aim is to investigate the effect
      of the macronutrient content of the post-exercise meal consumed following an acute bout of
      interval training on postprandial metabolism.
