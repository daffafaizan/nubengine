    
      ZAP-DENGUE is a pilot randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled evaluation of the safety
      and efficacy of five days of intravenous zanamivir treatment to treat vascular permeability
      syndrome which is the main cause of death in dengue fever. Our central hypothesis is that
      zanamivir treatment is safe in patients with dengue infection, will significantly decrease
      serum sialic acid levels, and will result in fewer patients with the development of moderate
      or severe clinical plasma leakage. 74 male and non-pregnant female volunteers age 7 years and
      older from Colombia with a diagnosis of dengue fever with warning signs or severe dengue as
      per the World Health Organization 2009 definition with the presence of fever and positive
      rapid test for the presence of dengue non-structural protein-1 (NS1) will be randomized to
      zanamivir versus placebo. In the treatment group, participants will receive 600 mg for adults
      and 12 mg/kg in children intravenously every twelve hours for 5 days adjusted for renal
      function. In the placebo group, participants will receive placebo normal saline solution
      intravenously every twelve hours for 5 days.

      All patients will receive blood draws for assessment of hematocrit, renal function, and
      biologic efficacy endpoints and clinical evaluation of signs and symptoms of vascular
      permeability (which may include ultrasound and radiograph) and adverse events daily during
      the five days of medication administration and once at follow up at 14 days.
