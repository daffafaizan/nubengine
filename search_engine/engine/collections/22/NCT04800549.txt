      sodium bicarbonate used in oral care on prevention of oral mucositis in children followed up
      due to the diagnosis of cancer. Sodium bicarbonate and black mulberry treatment were compared
      to prevent oral mucositis in 69 children receiving chemotherapy due to cancer. While 35
      children were assigned to the experimental group (sodium bicarbonate + black mulberry
      lollipop application), 34 were assigned to the control group (sodium bicarbonate
      application).
