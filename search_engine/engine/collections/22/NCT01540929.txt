      interests of transparency and because the study represented a post-licensure commitment to
      FDA for ACAM2000Â® smallpox vaccine. However, this study was not a clinical trial and did not
      involve the administration of any vaccine product nor the collection of any product
      performance or adverse event data. Rather, the purpose of the study was to determine the
      success rate for proper completion and use of Department of Defense (DoD) Screening Form 600s
      (SF600s). The SF600 is a form required to be completed prior to smallpox vaccination of DoD
      staff and is used to guide decision-making by DoD vaccination staff regarding offering,
      postponing, or denying vaccination. The study evaluated both the extent to which the SF600s
      were completed correctly and the extent to which they were correctly used to guide
      vaccination decision-making.
