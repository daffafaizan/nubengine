      Greek honey grades differing in floral source and carbohydrate composition. Isoglucidic test
      meals (50g available carbohydrate) and 50g glucose reference were given to 11 clinically and
      metabolically healthy, fasting individuals (27±7 years; 9 women; BMI 24±4kg/m2), in random
      order. GI was calculated using the FAO/WHO method. Capillary blood glucose samples were
      collected at 0,15,30,45,60,90-and-120min. Salivary insulin samples were collected at
      0,60-and-120min. Subjective appetite ratings (hunger, fullness and desire to eat) were
      assessed by visual analogue scales (VAS, 100mm) at baseline and 120min.
