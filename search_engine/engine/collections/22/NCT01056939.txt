      own breathing pattern. Asynchrony during ventilatory care may increase the risk for
      complications, make the weaning more difficult and may affect the survival rates.

      In our study we randomly treat pediatric patients needing ventilatory support with neurally
      adjusted ventilatory assist and pressure controlled or PRVC-ventilation. We are willing to
      find out if there are any special benefits for patients with each treatment mode.
