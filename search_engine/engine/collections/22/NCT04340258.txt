    
      This study is a non-randomized, single-arm, multi-institutional phase 1b/II study including
      patients with locally recurrent head and neck cancer eligible for resection. Patients who are
      identified to be eligible for surgical resection will be screened and consented to receive
      one 200mg IV dose of pembrolizumab followed by salvage surgery. At the time of surgery, they
      will have Cesium131 seeds implanted. Two to six weeks after surgery, subjects will be started
      on 200 mg IV of pembrolizumab to be continued every 3 weeks for 6 months. The phase 1b part
      will enroll 3 patients for a safety run-in, followed by the phase 2 part if no DLTs are seen
      in these 3 patients. Phase 2 will be used to estimate the 2-year DFS in comparison to a
      benchmark selected based on a historical control. For correlative studies, archived tissue
      and surgical specimen will be evaluated by H&E and IHC for immune phenotype. Blood samples
      will also be collected as shown in schema above for correlative studies (blood will be
      collected for correlatives and biomarkers before and after the first of pembrolizumab, before
      starting adjuvant pembrolizumab and at completion of 6 month course of adjuvant
      pembrolizumab). Patients will be followed approximately every 3 weeks during treatment for
      the first 6 months, then monthly for 3 months following treatment and then every 3 months
      thereafter for 24 months for disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).
