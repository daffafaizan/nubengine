      running schedule have been conducted without any firm conclusions. People engaged in
      recreational running or choosing running as a new and active lifestyle needs guidance on
      which running schedules minimize the injury risk, aiding their chance of an active lifestyle
      and possibly reversing the increase in people developing a lifestyle disease. To develop
      running schedules minimizing the risk of injury, an understanding of the mechanisms that the
      different training variables impose on the human body is necessary. The existing literature
      on running intensity and the development of injuries show conflicting result. More studies
      are necessary to ascertain if there is a relationship between the intensity of running. In
      such studies, it is important to include other training variables in the analysis and to
      quantify running exposure using an objective method of measuring the relative intensity and
      absolute volume.
