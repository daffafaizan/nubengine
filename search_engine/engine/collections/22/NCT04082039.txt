    
      The BellomicÂ® M silicone balloon infuser, dual continuous petite type (cebika, Uiwang-si,
      Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea) is a newly designed IV-PCA device that is a 2-channel
      infusion elastomeric pump with two balloon chambers.

      Conventional elastomeric IV-PCA devices were administered with a mixture of drugs in one
      chamber; when severe opioid related side effects occur, the IV-PCA administration is
      suspended by clipping, in this situation, not only the analgesic effect of opioid but also
      the effect of adjuvants could not be applied.

      On the other hand, this newly designed device can be controlled as needed by administering
      adjuvant analgesics or antiemetic agents through another adjustable chamber. It will be
      expected that facilitate the pain management and increased the patient satisfaction and
      recovery.
