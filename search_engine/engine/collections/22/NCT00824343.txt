      The protocol was amended in July 2009. As per the amendment P276-00 will be administered at a
      dose of 144 mg/m2/day from day 1 to day 5 and from day 8 to day 12 in each 21 day cycle till
      progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity.33 patients have been recruited in version 1
      protocol, 38 more evaluable patients need to be recruited in version 2 protocol. Allowing for
      approximately 30% drop-outs, it is estimated that, for enrolling 38 evaluable subjects in the
      study, approximately 54 subjects would be enrolled. As the study has already enrolled 33
      subjects, the sample size for the study to accommodate for same number of subjects (38
      evaluable) in the revised protocol is estimated as approximately 87 (33 + 54) subjects. Hence
      the total sample size (accounting for drop-outs) is 87 patients.
