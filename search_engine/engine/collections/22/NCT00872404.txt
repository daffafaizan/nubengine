      treated every 3 weeks until disease progression(by RECIST criteria) or unacceptable toxicity
      death or discontinuation from the study for any other reason.

      Since, head and neck tumors are easily accessible for iterative biopsy, this study will offer
      the opportunity to get tumor biopsies before and after CP-751,871. Our study will allow
      translational research with biopsies at crucial timing:

      (i) at baseline before any treatment, (ii) during the treatment with CP-751,871 (day 1,
      second cycle two hours after the injection of CP-751,871).

      (iii) for patients with stable disease or partial response, a new biopsy will be performed at
      the time of disease progression to try to understand the mechanisms of tumor resistance.

      The baseline samples will allow an investigation of molecular profiles that reflect an
      inherent inter-patient variability and which will be predictive of response. Although the
      number of patients included is low, these data may contribute to understand the mechanisms of
      response and non-response to CP-751,871. Understanding the mechanisms of response to
      CP-751,871 will help in the rational design of further clinical trials in head and neck
      cancer using CP-751,871.

      The on-treatment samples will help to dynamically monitor the molecular response to
      CP-751,871.

      The study of involved pathways before and after administration of CP-751,871 could be
      performed using IHC, DNA sequence analysis and RNA expression profiling. Plasma samples could
      be also stored for further analysis.
