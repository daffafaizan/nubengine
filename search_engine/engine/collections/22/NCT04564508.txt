      admissions. They account for around 10-50% of the mortality rate, which remains high despite
      extensive research of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign, and national core measures Sepsis is
      defined as "Organ dysfunction that threatens the patient's life caused by the impaired host
      response to infection" septic shock is defined as hypotension and serum lactate level greater
      than two mmol/L, as well as not responding to adequate fluid resuscitation requiring the use
      of vasopressors to maintain the mean blood pressure of 65 mm Hg or higher . Sepsis and septic
      shock are considered medical emergencies .

      Acute hypernatremia is considered one of the features of homeostasis disturbances, which is
      common in septic patients with an incidence reaching up to 47% Finding biomarkers which
      predict the outcome of sepsis is challenging . Since electrolyte imbalance, specifically
      hypernatremia, is one of the commonest problems associated with sepsis and septic shock
      patients [20, 21]. It is, therefore, of current interest to study the evolution of sepsis in
      patients who have been shown to have hypernatremia.

      Recent evidence shows that serum sodium levels may not be completely explained by fluid
      balance or sodium intake . Some studies suggest that sodium is intimately tied to the immune
      system, thus raising the question of whether inflammatory states such as sepsis can play a
      role in the development of hypernatremia
