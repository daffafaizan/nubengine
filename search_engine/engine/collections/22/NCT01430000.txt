      IFN injections because the side effects. The new proposed treatments allows continous low
      doses of IFN to be secreted by the patients himself using his own skin in which the dermo
      fibroblasts are enriched by a human gene of erythropoietin. The "biopump" continues to secret
      the IFN for several months avoiding the spikes of IFN in the plasma which are beleived to
      cause the undesired effects.

      Patients will be able to complete a long treatment with low IFN dose and Ribavirin hoping to
      induce prolonged remission and cure
