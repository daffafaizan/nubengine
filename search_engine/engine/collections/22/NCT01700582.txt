      molecular testing of cancer patients. These platforms routinely assess a panel of biomarkers
      in order to speed up access of French cancer patients to targeted therapies (commercially
      available or through clinical trials).

      Regarding stage IV non-squamous NSCLC patients, 7 biomarkers are assessed including
      activating EGFR mutations, EML4-ALK translocation and EGFR T790M, KRAS, BRAF, HER2 and PI3KCA
      mutations. In 2012, up to 17 to 20,000 patients will be tested on this platform network.

      The objective of the BIOMARKERS-France study is to describe the epidemiological, clinical and
      molecular characteristics of these patients and their tumors and to assess the impact of
      these analyzes on their treatment (ie bio-guided therapy) as well as outcomes (response rate,
      progression free and overall survival).

      This study will collect, in a prospective way, data from a unique national cohort in order to
      guide future decisions regarding biomarker assessments (type? Number? Methods? Etc) in
      connexion with all the other research works currently ongoing in France.
