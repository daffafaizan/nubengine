      IT-project funded through the European Union (EU). The project will develop multiscale models
      of the ageing brain in order to account simultaneously for the patient-specific biochemical,
      metabolic and biomechanical brain substrate, as well as for genetic, clinical, demographic
      and lifestyle determinants. An integrated clinical decision support platform will be
      validated and tested by access to a dozen databases of international cross-sectional and
      longitudinal studies.

      Modeling approaches developed by using the retrospective databases will be tested using a new
      prospective cohort that will be collected in Kuopio as a part of the VPH-DARE@IT project. The
      study population at university of Eastern Finland (UEF) will be a total of 120 subjects: 20
      healthy controls (HC), 20 mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients, 20 vascular
      dementia (VAD) patients, 20 fronto-temporal dementia (FTD) patients and 40 subjects with mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI). This study is referred as VPH-DARE@IT Prospective study in Kuopio
      or "ProsKuopio".
