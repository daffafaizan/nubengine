      and well- being: exercise. Regular exercise is highly recommended by healthcare professionals
      because the whole body benefits, including cardiorespiratory, musculoskeletal systems and
      mental wellbeing. Long-distance running is a popular physical activity with more than 30
      million individuals running marathons each year. The increasing participation of first-time
      runners, including older people, has been linked to a rise in related injuries. The ideal
      dose of exercise is not known and overdosage affects some musculoskeletal tissues and joints
      more than others. Overdoing a specific amount of exercise and the presence of chronic
      injuries may pose a great risk on the joints, leading to serious conditions such as
      osteoarthritis, musculoskeletal injuries, tendinopathy. However, it is not yet clear whether
      a high dose of exercise such as marathon running damages the musculoskeletal system and there
      is a growing need for research in the area of running science to better understand this.

      Aim: This research aims to do musculoskeletal imaging before and after long-distance running
      using 3 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging and to provide evidence on how much exercise people
      should undertake and how to minimise injury.
