      paclitaxel plus trastuzumab or a trastuzumab/pertuzumab-based combination as the initial
      component of neoadjuvant therapy as a pilot for a comprehensive 'omics approach using next
      generation sequencing and protein expression and post-translational modification analysis
      using mass spectrometry (MS) based and Reverse Phase Protein Array-based proteomics. Tumor
      samples will be obtained at baseline and 48 to 72 hours after initial drug treatment to study
      variation in the biological responses to these agents. The study of tumors both before and
      early after the first treatment probes the biological responses to treatment and is rich
      source of predictive biomarkers.
