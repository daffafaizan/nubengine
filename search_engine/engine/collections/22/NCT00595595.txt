      pulp-like tissue as an alternative method to conventional root canal treatment. The objective
      of this study is to identify the methods necessary to regenerate dental pulp-like tissue in
      human teeth. We will collect small (~4X4mm) pieces of oral mucosa that are normally removed
      during surgical tooth extractions, isolate human postnatal progenitor/stem cells and, using
      an in vitro cell culture system, combined isolated cells with various scaffolds and test
      compounds to determine optimal conditions to differentiate pulp-like tissue (eg,
      odontoblasts, fibroblasts, endothelium, etc) grown in segments of human roots.
