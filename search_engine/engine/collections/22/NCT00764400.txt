      therapy protocols for word retrieval impairments experienced by individuals with
      stroke-induced aphasia. One treatment involves errorless naming treatment and the other
      employs verbal plus gestural facilitation of word retrieval. Participants will receive one of
      the two treatments over several months. Before and after treatment the investigators will
      administer several tests and conversational samples to examine changes associated with the
      treatments. The investigators hypothesize that, whereas both treatments will lead to
      improvements in words rehearsed in therapy, communication outcomes in conversation will be
      broader for the verbal plus gestural protocol.
