      cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CF. Current therapies directed at treatment
      of chronic P. aeruginosa infection (e.g. aerosolized tobramycin, azithromycin) provide
      short-term improvement in pulmonary function; however, persistence of the
      infection/inflammation causes the inevitable loss of lung function. PPARgamma is a nuclear
      transcription factor which is known to reduce activation of NFKB, a central mediator of
      airway inflammation in CF. Recent studies demonstrate that PPARgamma expression is reduced in
      patients with CF and may offer a potential therapeutic target to combat airway inflammation
      in CF. Pioglitazone is a thiazolidinedione whose principal pharmacological target it
      PPARgamma. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the
      pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics of pioglitazone and effect on reducing airway inflammation
      in cystic fibrosis.
