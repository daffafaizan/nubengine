    
      Acute otitis externa (AOE) is defined as a diffuse inflammation of the external ear canal,
      which may also involve the pinna and/or the tympanic membrane. AOE is one of the most common
      infections encountered by otolaryngologists, pediatricians and family physicians. The
      reported annual incidence of AOE is between 1:100 and 1:250 in the general population with
      large seasonal and regional variations. Diagnosis of AOE requires rapid onset (generally
      within 48 hours) of symptoms and signs of ear canal inflammation which includes: A) otalgia
      (often severe), itching or fullness, sometimes accompanied by reduced hearing or jaw pain; B)
      tenderness of the tragus and/or pinna; and C) diffuse ear canal edema with or without
      erythema, sometimes accompanied by ear discharge.
