      comparison to ValetteÂ® (Reference) after single dose administration under fasting conditions
      and to assess bioequivalence of Test vs. Reference after single dose administration under
      fasting conditions, determined by use of area under the concentration time curve AUC0-tlast
      and maximal concentration Cmax obtained for ethinylestradiol (EE) and dienogest (DNG).
      Furthermore, a descriptive characterisation of safety and tolerability of the investigational
      products in the study population was performed.
