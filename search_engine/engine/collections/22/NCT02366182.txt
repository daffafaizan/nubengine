      asked about their medical history including detailed history of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)
      and snoring. Physical examination including weight,height &BMI .

      Airway assessment will include:

        1. Maximum mouth opening measured as interincisor gap (mm).

        2. Sternomental distance measured as the straight distance between the upper border of
           manubrium sterni and the bony point of the mentum with the head in full extension and
           the mouth is closed (cm).

        3. Hyomental distance measured from just above the hyoid bone to the tip to the
           anterior-most part of the mentum in both neutral position and with maximum head
           extension (cm). Hence, hyomental distance ratio (HMDR) will be calculated.

        4. Thyromental distance measured as the distance from the thyroid notch to the inner margin
           of the mental prominence when the head is fully extended (cm).

        5. Extended Mallampati Score (EMS) in sitting position with full extension of
           craniocervical junction with phonation (class I: Entire Uvula is clearly visible; class
           II: Upper half of the uvula is visible; class III: soft and hard palate clearly visible;
           and class IV: Only hard palate is visible).

        6. Neck Circumference at the level of the thyroid cartilage (cm).

        7. Condition of the teeth (Protrusion, loose, missing).

        8. Mandibular protrusion test to detect temporomandibular joint mobility measured as
           ability to move the lower teeth in front of the upper teeth.

      Intubation will be considered difficult if the Intubation Difficulty Scale ( IDS) is equal or
      more than 5 .
