    
      INSURE technique meas surfactant administration through intubation-surfactant-extubation. And
      noninvasive ventilation is immediately used after surfactant.

      The differences of modified INSURE compared with INSURE is intubation-surfactant-X-ray
      relieved-extubation. Extubation and noninvasive ventilation is used after the X-ray
      relieving.
