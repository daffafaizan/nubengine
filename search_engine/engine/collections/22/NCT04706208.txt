      of neuropathic pain after SCI are not yet fully understood. Nonetheless, as suggested by
      numerous studies, because of the spinal injury, the inflow of sensory information is
      dramatically altered. Therefore, the brain is missing sensory information or receiving
      incorrect sensory information, which may alter the brain circuitry related to pain sensation,
      which in turn may drive the perception of neuropathic pain.

      Cognitive multisensory rehabilitation (CMR), developed for motor recovery after stroke, has
      shown to be effective for treating adults with chronic pain, i.e., after shoulder impingement
      when compared to traditional physical therapy; or in a case study of severe phantom limb pain
      after below the knee amputation, resulting in such substantial pain reduction that the
      patient could finally be fitted with a prosthesis and walk. CMR is thought to be effective
      because it restores mental body representations by recalibrating sensations in combination
      with a focus on body awareness. Body awareness is often impaired in people with chronic pain
      and with dysfunctions in the sensory and motor networks, such as after SCI.

      This study uses a cross-over study for adults with SCI and a comparison of baseline outcomes
      in adults with SCI vs able-bodied healthy adults to address two aims:

      AIM 1: Determine baseline differences in resting-state and task-based fMRI activation and
      connectivity in adults with SCI compared to able-bodied healthy controls.

      AIM 2: Identify changes in brain activation and connectivity, as well as behavioral outcomes
      in pain and body awareness in adults with SCI after CMR versus standard of care.
