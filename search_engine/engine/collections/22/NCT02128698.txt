      the advantages of bariatric surgery, attention needs to be paid to the possible risks
      following the surgical treatment. Postoperative risks include protein deficiency and
      pronounced muscle mass loss. Indeed, numerous studies indicate a significant reduction in
      lean body mass resulting from protein deficiency after bariatric surgery.

      Dietary proteins have shown to play an important role in body weight regulation. A
      protein-rich diet attains satiety and thereby facilitates reduction in overall energy intake.
      It has also shown to enhance food-induced thermogenesis. Furthermore, a protein-rich diet -
      ideally in combination with exercise - preserves lean body mass and thus resting energy
      expenditure leading to an improvement of long-term energy balance. Therefore, protein-rich
      diets or protein supplements, respectively, might facilitate weight loss, especially body fat
      loss and protect against loss in muscle mass in patients who underwent bariatric surgery. The
      aim of the present randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind pilot study was to test the
      possible benefit of proteins in combination with exercise in patients undergoing bariatric
      surgery, and to examine, whether computer-assisted exercise is advantageous when comparing it
      to a usual exercise program using written exercise instructions. Therefore, we study the
      influence of postoperative protein supplementation in combination with computer-assisted
      exercise on body composition changes, and body weight reduction, as well as physical fitness,
      protein status and muscle function in obese patients after bariatric surgery.
