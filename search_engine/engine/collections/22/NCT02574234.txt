      strongly associated to postoperative cognitive disorders few months after the intervention
      especially in elderlies. No strategy is really efficient to fight against this phenomenon
      that could lead to Alzheimer disease development. In order to prognosticate and characterize
      the potential risk to develop cognitive troubles after a surgery, this study propose to
      evaluate the potential predictive capacity of apelin in a cohort of young and old adult
      undergoing an orthopedic surgery. Apelin is a peptide involved in different physiological as
      well physiopathological pathways. This peptide, involved in osteogenesis and inflammatory
      processes, has also been described to be neuroprotective. Yet, hippocampic neuroinflammation
      has been related in case of postoperative cognitive disorders in human as well as in mice
      model of surgery. Taken together, these results seem to indicate that apelin could be a
      therapeutic target and be predictive of the postoperative cognitive disorders onset.

      This study will measure plasma apelin levels in young and old adult one day before and after
      a programed orthopedic surgery. Moreover, to correlate apelin amounts with inflammation
      processes, protocol will quantify inflammatory cytokines in plasma (IL6, IL1, TNFα). These
      results will be compared to measures of brain b-amyloid deposit assessed by PET-Scan
      technology.

      The follow-up of the patients will be done during 3 months in order to evaluate the
      postoperative cognitive disorders or the cognitive troubles associated to surgery (memory
      fail, decrease of cognitive reserve…).
