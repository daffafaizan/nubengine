    
      This is a first-in-human, single-ascending dose study of PBI-4547 in healthy adult
      participants. PBI-4547 is a synthetic ligand of G protein-coupled receptor (GPR)40 and GPR84,
      which have been reported to play a role in fibrosis in various animal models as well as in
      tissue culture.

      A total of 40 healthy adult participants will sequentially receive 1 of 5 doses of PBI-4547
      (Dose1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) or matching placebo, with each cohort of 8 participants randomized in a
      3:1 ratio to receive PBI-4547 or matching placebo.

      A food-effect cohort will be added after review of the PK results of at least the first dose,
      and the following 2 doses, if needed. In this cohort participants will initially receive the
      study drug under fasting conditions (Period 1) followed by the same dose after the ingestion
      of a high-fat meal (Period 2) after a 14-day washout period.
