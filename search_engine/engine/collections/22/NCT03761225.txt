      combination with docetaxel and prednisone with respect to placebo in combination with
      docetaxel and prednisone in the treatment of first line metastatic Castrate Resistant
      Prostate Cancer (mCRPC). Approximately 580 patients will be randomized in 2 groups with a
      ratio 1:1. The primary outcome measure is progression free survival. Masitinib is a selective
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor that is thought to promote survival via modulation of
      immunostimulation-mediated anticancer effects and modulation of the tumor microenvironment.
