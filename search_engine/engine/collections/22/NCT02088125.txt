      volume incentive spirometry (VIS) and BS.

      Procedures involved two distinct phases: assessment and intervention. In the first day was
      performed assessment of the participants to obtain the following data: anamnesis, initial
      evaluation using the Ashwouth Scale, Barthel Index and Mini Mental State Examination,
      anthropometric data and pulmonary function using spirometry and respiratory muscle pressures.

      Intervention phase was performed in two different days, each day for only one PET techniques
      (VIS or BS), with a minimal wash-out period of one day according to the randomization
      sequence. Optoelectronic Pletysmography (OEP) was recorded during quite breathing at rest and
      during the execution of five maneuvers form each PET technique tested.
