      for 10 sessions in patients with nocturnal enuresis. Eligible patients were randomized to
      receive either real or sham repetitive sacral root magnetic stimulation (rSMS; 15 Hz with a
      total of 1500 pulses/session) for 10 sessions. Evaluation was performed before starting
      treatment, immediately after the 5th and 10th treatment session, and 1 month later, using
      frequency of enuresis/week, visual analogue scale (VAS) and Quality of life. Cortical
      excitability of upper and lower limbs were done before and after the end of sessions.
