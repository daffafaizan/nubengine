      common mental disorders (CMD), and CMD is now the most common single cause of sickness
      absence. Primary care is the area in which most individuals with mental illness seek care and
      also receive care. A Care Manager function at the primary care centre (PCC) where the Care
      Manager is responsible for the support and close contact with patients with CMD and act as
      the "spider in the web" and combine patient support with other measures, have been shown to
      have beneficial effects for depression course. In Region Västra Götaland an implementation of
      the Care Manager function at the PCC has been set out, and the function is now available in
      nearly 100 PCCs in the region. The present study aims to evaluate whether a convergence
      dialogue during sick leave, between the employee and the employer, with the PCCs Rehab
      Coordinator as discussion leader, leads to reduced sick leave time compared to those
      individuals who only have contact with the Care Manager during the period of sick leave. The
      study will be performed as pragmatic randomised controlled trial with randomisation at the
      PCC level. Around 20 PCCs with a Care Manager function for patients on sick-leave with CMD
      diagnosis will be recruited and randomized to intervention where patients in addition to a
      Care Manager contact (12 weeks) will have one convergence dialogue meeting with the work
      place representative during sick leave. Control PCCs will give Care Manager contact 12 weeks
      only.
