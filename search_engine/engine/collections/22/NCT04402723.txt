      the genesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Donafenib is therefore a promising candidate for
      improvement of chemotherapy results in AML. This clinical trial evaluates the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of Donafenib combination with Cytarabine/Daunorubicin for AML in patients
      between 18 and 55 years of age.
