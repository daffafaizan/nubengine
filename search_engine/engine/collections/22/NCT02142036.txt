      in cancer, it is necessary to define rational strategies to make such treatment available to
      Norwegian cancer patients.These targeted drugs are extremely costly and have significant side
      effects, although presumably to a lesser extent than many of the classic cytotoxic drugs
      available. Thus, in the interest of the patient in question and the society in general, it is
      important to give the right drug to the right patient and to the presumably right time in the
      disease course.

      Hitherto, most of the drugs in question are given in the palliative setting, i.e. to patients
      with disseminated metastatic disease. The metastatic lesion may be very different from the
      primary tumor, and hence, it is rational to analyze the tumor to be treated, the metastatic
      lesion(s), for the presence of molecular aberrations, rather than basing treatment decisions
      on molecular features known to be present in a particular tumor type or in the primary tumor.
