      can be used for transbronchial biopsies. This device has the potential to gather larger and
      higher quality tissue samples than the standard method using forceps, and with potentially
      fewer complications than older, larger versions of the cryoprobe.

      This study does not involve randomization or assigning different patients to different
      procedures to compare. Everyone who enrolls in this study will undergo a standard of care
      bronchoscopy with a transbronchial biopsy using the 1.1mm sheath cryoprobe. The only
      difference from the standard of care approach is that the physician performing the
      transbronchial biopsy will use the 1.1mm sheath cryoprobe rather than forceps or another
      currently available larger cryoprobe.

      Patients enrolled in this study will have data collected by research staff for up to 30 days
      after the bronchoscopic biopsy procedure is performed. This 30-day follow-up period is the
      standard of care following bronchoscopic biopsy procedures.
