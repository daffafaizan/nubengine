      two anesthetic techniques (propofol and sevoflurane). The investigators plan to enroll 80
      patients who receive general anesthesia at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center
      Department of Radiology for ABR testing. A sample size recalculation will be performed during
      the study to determine the exact number of subjects necessary for sufficient power. As per
      standard anesthesia practice for this test in radiology department, all subjects will serve
      as their own control, receiving both anesthetic techniques within the same ABR testing
      session. The audiologist will employ broadband click stimulus testing after induction with
      Sevoflurane, after which the patient will be switched over to a propofol infusion and the
      sevoflurane stopped. After the completion of the remainder of the ABR (tone-burst testing),
      the audiologist will repeat the broadband click testing (now while under propofol
      anesthesia), and the results will be recorded. At this point, results will be de-identified,
      with the exception of which ear was tested and the intensity level, and these results will be
      reviewed by a panel of 5 audiologists. These audiologists will be blinded to the anesthetic
      technique and patient information. They will provide a judgment at each intensity level, for
      each ear whether or not a response is present (in a Yes/No format). A study coordinator
      blinded to the anesthetic technique will record the outcome data. The anesthesia providers
      and nursing team will not be blinded.
