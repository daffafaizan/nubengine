      skin (total-skin-self-examinations; TSSE) but research has found that many people are not
      shown how to do this effectively. We are investigating whether a digital app we have
      developed (ASICA) can help people with melanoma to use a hand-held tablet computer to do more
      regular and effective TSSE, and whether this would lead to earlier detection of recurrent and
      new primary melanomas. The ASICA app also uses the internet to enable people to
      electronically communicate the findings of their TSSE to a specialist nurse. All those who
      consent to take part in the study will be randomly allocated into one of two groups. One
      group will use the ASICA app in addition to their normal follow-up, the other group will
      continue to attend their routine melanoma follow-up only. Participants will be recruited from
      two UK sites - NHS Grampian and Cambridge University Hospitals.
