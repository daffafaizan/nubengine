      13-01. Cingal 13-01 was a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, Phase III study that
      enrolled 368 subjects at up to 20 sites in Canada and Europe. The Cingal 13-01 study
      objective was to assess the safety and effectiveness of a single injection of Cingal速 for
      relief of joint pain and symptoms in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The study
      had three arms: the Cingal速 investigational arm, an active comparator arm (Monovisc速) and a
      control arm (saline). Cingal 13-02 is designed to evaluate the safety of an open-label
      injection of Cingal速 in subjects who received a study injection in the Cingal 13-01 trial.
      Sites that enrolled 5 or more subjects in the Cingal 13-01 study were eligible to participate
      in the Cingal 13-02 study. All subjects at these sites who met enrollment criteria had the
      option to participate in the follow-on study.
