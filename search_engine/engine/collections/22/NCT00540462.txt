      most morbidly obese patients (about 80%) with diabetes had a significant improved of sugar
      control. Base on this observation, we will try to find out the role surgical intervention
      (gastric bypass and sleeve gastrectomy) in obese-related diabetes. With restriction of
      stomach volume and with or without duodenal exclusion, this randomized trials will find out
      the role of duodenal exclusion and the role of Ghrenin in obese-related type II DM patients.
      The initial observation of previous morbidly obese patients with type II DM, the DM seems a
      chronic disease which could be treated or controlled by surgical intervention, that's what we
      try to know more.
