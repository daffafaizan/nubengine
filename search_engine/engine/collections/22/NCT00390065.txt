      towards short term improvements in respiratory and neurological outcome at 28 days postnatal
      age or 36 weeks postconceptional age. A two year follow-up in children treated soon after
      birth with NO in the neonatal period, suggests that a significant improvement in
      neurodevelopmental outcome might occur. No long term evaluation on respiratory outcome has
      yet been done. This study aims to evaluate respiratory and neurodevelopmental outcome at 6
      years of age in children born very prematurely, some of them having had Nitric Oxide as a
      rescue treatment for respiratory distress syndrome.
