      care unit that can lead to multi-organ failure and death.

      Its early recognition improves patients' outcome, as well as the establishment of targeted
      guidelines pursuing normalization of macro-circulatory parameters (ie blood pressure and
      lactate).

      However, regional hypoperfusion leading to organ failure can be present before the alteration
      of these parameters, and persist after their restoration.

      Brain lesions are common in critically ill children with cerebral hypoperfusion, since they
      may have impaired autoregulation and permeable blood-brain barrier. Vasoactive and inotropic
      drugs used for hemodynamic resuscitation should restore systemic and regional circulation,
      but may be inadequate on brain perfusion because of i) their variable and unpredictable
      cardiovascular effects , and ii) a strong interindividual variability between patients. As
      such, the impact of this medication on cerebral circulation and oxygenation is unknown.

      Monitoring cerebral circulation and oxygenation during a hemodynamic resuscitation using
      catecholamines is a first step to identify risk factors of an altered brain perfusion, and to
      improve treatment of shock.
