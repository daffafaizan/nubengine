      has been seen in infants. This increase may be due to a continuous growth in the use of car
      safety seats. The objective of this study was to evaluate this hypothesis by comparing
      positioning in a car safety seat with the supine 15 degrees anti-Trendelenburg position.

      PATIENTS AND METHODS - From October 2008 till August 2010 a crossover, randomized, controlled
      trial was performed on 31 infants, aged two weeks to six months old, who were suspected to
      have GERD. Twenty hour continuous esophageal pH monitoring was used to compare both
      positions.

      RESULTS - The results of this trial demonstrated no differences between positioning in a car
      safety seat and in supine 15 degrees anti-Trendelenburg position for the reflux index, the
      duration of the longest reflux episode and number of reflux episodes (PRI = NS; PLRE = NS
      respectively PNRE = NS). Only the difference between the number of reflux episodes lasting
      longer than five minutes was significant (PNRE5 = 0,05).

      CONCLUSIONS - The results of this study suggest that an increase in GERD is not caused by a
      growing use of car safety seats in infants. As the sample size was limited, larger trials are
      needed.
