      initially, and 24 subjects will be enrolled with 12 subjects being randomized to receive the
      low GH dose (0.1 mg/day) treatment and 12 subjects to receive Placebo treatment for 3 months,
      allowing a 10% drop-out rate. The subjects will be taught by either by the Endocrine Nurse
      Specialists to self-administer the GH by subcutaneous injections using a Genotropin pen
      device.

      Visit 1, Initial Screening Assessment (as out-patient)

        -  Physical examination, weight, height, and waist circumference measurements

        -  Fasting blood glucose levels

      Visit 2, Baseline Assessment (as in-patient)

        -  Physical examination, weight, height, and waist circumference measurements

        -  Fasting blood tests for glucose, insulin, C-peptide, free IGF-I, total IGF-I, IGF-2,

      Any extra blood remaining from the samples of blood drawn may be banked indefinitely with
      confidential identifiers, and may be given to researchers in the future to examine for other
      potential causes of diabetes and heart diseases in adults. These blood samples, however, will
      not be used for genetic studies.
