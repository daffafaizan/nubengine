      reduces abdominal visceral fat and protects against insulin resistance. This study was done
      to learn if DHEA replacement therapy decreases abdominal obesity and improves insulin action
      in humans.

      Participants were randomly assigned to receive 50 mg per day of DHEA or a placebo at bedtime
      for 6 months. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and oral glucose
      tolerance tests at the beginning and conclusion of the study. Other tests included
      measurements of hormones and lipids.
