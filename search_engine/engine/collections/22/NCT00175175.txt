    
      Patients with hip fractures have suffered the most devastating consequence of osteoporosis;
      and yet, they are rarely if ever tested or treated for the condition, even though they remain
      at high risk of recurrent fracture.

      We hypothesize that, compared with usual care, an allied health professional-run osteoporosis
      service (case management) will be able to increase testing and treatment of osteoporosis in
      patients at high risk of fracture.
