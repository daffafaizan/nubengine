      non-clinical populations suggest that Aerobic Exercise (AE) training is effective in
      increasing both aerobic fitness and cognitive functioning. However, these associations have
      not been studied among individuals with schizophrenia, despite the presence of highly
      sedentary lifestyle in this population To elucidate this putative link, the present study
      will evaluate the influence of AE on cognitive functioning and daily functioning in
      individuals with schizophrenia using a single-blind, randomized clinical trial. Outpatient
      individuals with schizophrenia receiving treatment will be randomly assigned to AE training
      or Treatment As Usual (TAU). Participants in the AE training will undergo a 12-week, 3 times
      per week, 1-hour AE sessions. All participants will continue their regular psychiatric and
      medical care. Assessments of neurocognitive and daily functioning abilities, along with
      symptom severity, and physiological and behavioral measures of aerobic fitness will be
      completed before and after the 12-week program.
