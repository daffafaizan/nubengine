    
      We wish to consent 75-100 subjects at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta.

      If subjects take part in this study, the following will happen:

        1. Prior to discharge, the parent/guardian will be given a home feeding log and

        2. Parents will bring the feeding log to regularly scheduled clinic visits. Clinic staff
           will also weigh the child and measure head circumference at each clinic visit.

        3. The investigators will look at the child's medical record to obtain other information
           including diagnosis, surgery, oxygen saturation levels and medications.

        4. The parent/guardian will be asked to fill out a questionnaire about their stress and
           uncertainty caring for their baby after heart surgery. They will be asked to fill out
           the same questionnaire 3 times:

             -  First time will be before they leave the hospital after the baby's surgery, while
                still a patient on the Cardiac Step Down Unit (CSU).

             -  Second time will be at the Sibley Heart Center Cardiology clinic after they have
                been home for approximately 4 weeks.

             -  Third time will be at the Sibley Heart Center Cardiology clinic after they have
                been home for approximately 12 weeks or at the time of the routine cardiac cath
                prior to their second stage surgery.

      It should take about 15 minutes to fill out the questionnaire. The questionnaire is the only
      research procedure.

      The data from the feeding log and clinic visits will be submitted to Cincinnati Children's,
      the primary site for this study.
