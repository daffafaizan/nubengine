      interventions, MME or TE.

      Schools randomized to TE represent "usual care" and will continue the current curriculum. The
      MME arm will build upon the traditional usual curriculum at the medical school. The MME is a
      multi-modal educational intervention of a series of interactive learning components focused
      on integrated weight management counseling. This MME intervention for weight management
      counseling uses the 5As model based on the updated American Heart Association (AHA) /American
      College of Cardiology (ACC) /The Obesity Society (TOS) and updated NHLBI guidelines.
