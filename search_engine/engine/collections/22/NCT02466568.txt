      Phase I: Investigators plan to enroll participants in cohorts of 6 and monitor side effects
      over a 21 day period to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nivolumab, which will
      be given in combination with GM.CD40L. This is being done since this study involves a
      combination of treatments that have not been studied in humans before and to find the best
      dose for the Phase II part of the study.

      Phase II: Investigators plan to compare any clinical benefit in the participants who receive
      the combination of GM.CD40L vaccine with nivolumab, to participants that receive only
      nivolumab.
