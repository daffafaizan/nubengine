      lactating women who receive 2 different Intramuscular injections of ketamine on two separate
      days at least 5 days apart: 0.5mg/kg and 1.0mg kg.

      Women are required to have been breast feeding for at least 3 months and be healthy and on no
      medications. Support is provided for the entire time at the site and for any at home pumping.
      During the period of ketamine's influence, subjects are reclining and with 2 Investigators.
      The initial subject's data will determine the length of time for pumping--most likely 12
      hours as ketamine and the active principle metabolite have half-lives of less than 3 hours.
      Determination of concentration of ketamine in breast milk is being done at the UCSF Clinical
      lab with quantification of metabolites that are inactive as well. This research is of benefit
      by providing lactating women information on potential exposure of infants/children to
      ketamine. It will serve as a guide as KRF conducts research on postpartum depression and for
      women at large using ketamine for psychiatric indications.
