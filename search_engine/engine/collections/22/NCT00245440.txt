        -  To assess the impact of therapy with telithromycin vs. azithromycin on the oral
           microflora in patients with acute maxillary sinusitis at day 42 and to compare the
           duration of colonization with resistant oropharyngeal flora in patients treated with
           azithromycin vs. telithromycin.

        -  To also compare the two treatment groups for rate of reinfection within 6 weeks and the
           susceptibility pattern of the organisms appearing during the reinfection and differences
           in development of resistance and the associated changes in symptom responses.
