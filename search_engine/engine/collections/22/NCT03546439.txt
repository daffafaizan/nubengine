      following cardiac catheterization procedures. There is extensive literature available
      supporting the use of these devices for arterial access site closure, showing reduced time to
      hemostasis, earlier ambulation and reduced length of hospital stay in comparison to manual
      compression which is the traditional approach to achieve access site hemostasis. In contrast,
      there is not significant evidence supporting the use of these devices for closure of femoral
      venous access site, partly due to limited use of VCD in cardiac electrophysiology procedures,
      such as catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter. Another alternative to
      manual compression, the Figure of 8 stitch has also been used to achieve vascular closure
      follow catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, however it has not been
      studied formally.

      The aim of this registry is to better understand the 'real-world' utilization of VCD or
      Figure of 8 stitch(F08S) in cardiac ablation procedures and to understand any potential
      difference between VCD or F08S and manual compression. The outcomes of interest are vascular
      access site complication rate, time to ambulation and patient perception of pain and overall
      satisfaction, which is assessed via a survey. The hypothesis of this registry is that there
      will be an increased patient satisfaction and decreased rate of vascular and bleeding
      complications with use of either Perclose Proglide system or Figure of 8 stitch for venous
      closure post atrial fibrillation ablation and atrial flutter ablation procedures in
      comparison to standard manual compression.

      The design will be a prospective observational registry collecting data on patients who
      underwent catheter ablation for atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter, including
      administration of a patient survey.
