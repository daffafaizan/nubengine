      Children's Hospital, BCH, China) with a 2-year follow-up of patients Index joints (ankles,
      elbows and knees) of young Chinese boys with hemophilia A will be evaluated as follows:
      physical examination every 6 months using the Hemophilia Joint Health Score [HJHS],
      ultrasound imaging (gray-scale and color Doppler ultrasound [US]), and by laboratory (serum)
      at baseline, at 6, and 24 months. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of index joints will
      be obtained at baseline, and 24 months. Features that will be captured either quantitatively
      or semantically in the imaging scans will be aggregated to generate "imaging phenotypes"
      which will be associated with clusters of co-expressed genes (metagenes) and clinical data.
