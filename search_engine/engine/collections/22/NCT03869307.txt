      hypermobility with one or more secondary symptomatic musculoskeletal manifestations such as
      chronic shoulder pain and shoulder instability. The evidence for treatment is sparse, but
      current clinical management of this patient-group with persistent shoulder symptoms is a
      combination of non-specific physiotherapy modalities and exercise prescription. There is some
      evidence suggesting that strength training may be valuable for treatment of this
      patient-group. The intervention consisting of heavy shoulder strengthening exercises has
      recently been tested to be feasible, and since clinical improvements were seen, the
      intervention is ready to be studied in a randomised controlled trial. Therefore, the aim of
      this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a heavy shoulder strengthening exercise
      programme and general advice as compared to shoulder stability exercises and general advice
      (current standard care) in patients with HSD and persistent shoulder symptoms. The primary
      hypothesis is that a heavy shoulder strengthening exercise programme is superior to standard
      care.

      Sample size considerations: a clinically significant effect of 252 points or more out of 2100
      points (SD = 350 points) between the two groups over the 16 weeks is desired, which with a
      two-sided significance of 0.05, a power of 0.9, and 16% dropout, requires a total of 100
      patients. In case 100 patients are not included within 24 months, a stopping rule will be
      applied as soon as at least 76 patients are included, corresponding to a power of minimum
      0.8.
