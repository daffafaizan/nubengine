      become an emerging problem in Botswana. Past research suggests that multivitamin and selenium
      supplementation slows the progression of HIV disease. The purpose of this trial is to
      evaluate the effectiveness of supplementation with multivitamins and selenium in HIV infected
      individuals in Botswana.

      This trial will last 2 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to 4 groups: a
      combination of multivitamins with selenium, multivitamins alone, selenium alone, or placebo.
