      PCI patients. There is no study that the NAC nor sodium bicarbonate would help in preventing
      CIN in CRF patients who need enhanced CT scan in ED.

      Our intention was to investigate the effect of NAC or sodium bicarbonate in preventing the
      aggravation of renal function in chronic renal failure when enhanced computed tomography scan
      is checked in emergency room.
