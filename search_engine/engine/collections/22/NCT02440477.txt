      the study. data checks will be also examined by "clalit health services". the investigators
      are obliged to enter all the data into logs provided upfront by the organisation. All the
      data obtained will be stored in an original folder intended for inspection and all encounters
      with volunteers will be documented in the computerized medical file of the volunteers.
      Standard operating procedures will be followed by the regulations expected by "clalit" health
      services and the Israeli ministry of health. After the first 10 volunteers of the study a
      reliability and validity statistical analysis will be made to assess the sample size
      estimated. Missing, unavailable, "non-reported" or uninterpretable data will be excluded from
      the final analysis.Data will be analyzed using the Statistical Package for the Social
      Sciences Version 15 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Results of measurements of each test will
      be analyzed for mean, standard deviation (SD) and range. Categorical variables will be
      described percentiles/median. Changes of variables in the same subject will be analyzed using
      a paired T test for continuous variables and Mann-Whitney test for categorical variables. In
      addition, the correlations between variables will be calculated using ICC. P values smaller
      than 0.05 (p<0.05) will be considered significant
