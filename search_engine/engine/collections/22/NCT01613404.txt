      by chance), 1-year study, in academic and community-based nephrology clinical practices that
      will examine the impact of a facility nurse case manager. In this study a group of patients
      guideline- based, algorithm- driven approach to hemodialysis initiation with targets (as per
      Canadian Society of Nephrology and/or International guidelines) will be used with facility
      nurse case manager and in control group same approach will be used without facility nurse
      case manager. Patients will be treated with any approved erythropoiesis stimulating agent for
      the correction of anemia, according to guidance in the current approved product monographs.
      All treatments will be prescribed by the physician according to actual clinical practice or
