      ability of a 5HTR2C agonist (lorcaserin) to increase and antagonist (ziprasidone) to reduce
      cortisol response to mental and metabolic stress in men carrying the rs6318 C allele and
      women in the rs6318 CC genotype of 5HTR2C. Lorcaserin is serotonin receptor agonist indicated
      for use as a weight loss drug. Ziprasidone is an antipsychotic indicated for treatment of
      bipolar disorder. Subjects will be treated with a single dose of each drug, 1 to 2 weeks
      apart, followed by a mental stress test and an oral glucose tolerance test with multiple
      blood draws. Each subject will also receive a placebo drug during one of the study visits.
