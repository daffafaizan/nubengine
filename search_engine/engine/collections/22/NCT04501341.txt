      pancreatic beta cell degeneration and dysfunction due to glucotoxicity and lipotoxicity.
      Several studies have shown that the immune system plays a significant role in the
      pathogenesis of T2D. Bone-marrow mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) and umbilical-cord
      tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) via its immunomodulatory properties have the
      potential to improve insulin resistance condition and pancreatic beta-cells dysfunction thus
      improve the glycemic control and insulin requirement in T2D patients. In this pilot study, we
      plan to recruit 15 T2D patients with total daily dose of insulin >= 0.5 unit/kgBW/day to
      receive BM-MNCs (5 subjects) or UC-MSCs injections (10 subjects). These subjects will be
      closely followed up for 12 months for evaluation of primary and secondary outcome.
