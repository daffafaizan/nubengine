    
      BICATOR is a multicentre (8 centres), randomised, double-blind and placebo-controlled
      clinical trial aimed at evaluating the effect of atorvastatin in reducing progression of
      aortic dilation in patients with BAV. The primary outcome is to determine whether
      atorvastatin is effective in reducing aortic dilation in BAV and secondary outcome is to
      define if atorvastatin treatment slows the progression of aortic valve degeneration (valve
      calcification) in a 3 year follow-up period. 220 patients will be included (110 atorvastatin
      - 110 placebo).
