      dilatation or surgical resection of the strictured bowel. Sirolimus (rapamycin), a
      macrocyclic antibiotic with immunosuppressive and antineoplastic properties, has been
      reported as promising rescue therapy for refractory CD. This study aims to evaluate the use
      of sirolimus for stricturing Crohn's Disease. Patients in this study will receive a
      continuous dosing schedule of oral sirolimus 2mg daily for six months. Clinical responses
      were defined as the ability to tolerate the regular diet with vegetable fiber combined with a
      reduction of ≥ 75% in overall target score and a score of less than two points for each item.
