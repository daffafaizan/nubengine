      adult patients (age â‰¥ 18) with type 2 diabetes who will track relevant clinical data over 6
      months. Participants will be asked to use a wireless glucose monitor, a cellular body scale,
      and a wrist-worn accelerometer, and respond to short bi-weekly text message-based surveys on
      medication adherence for 6 months. Data generated from the devices will be plotted as
      trajectories that will allow us to conduct trajectory analyses and identify missing data
      points and trends leading to attrition, in order to assess the feasibility of having patients
      engage in this type of self-monitoring for 6 months. A subset of 20 patients will be
      interviewed via telephone at the end of their 6 month self-monitoring period to discuss their
      adaptive challenges and successes over the study period. The investigators will present the
      trajectories of their data during patient interviews using a visual that we will e-mail or
      postal mail, depending on patient preference. This will facilitate discussion of the
      challenges participants face in self-management and adaptive practices participants use.
      Following the 6 months of self-monitoring, we will conduct interviews with health care
      providers in which the investigators will present the data trajectories and explore ways to
      achieve continual communication and address real-time challenges with diabetes
      self-management.
