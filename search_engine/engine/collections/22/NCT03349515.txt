      either povidone-iodine (group A) or balanced salt solution (BSS) (group B) eye drops
      instilled into their eyes during anesthesia just prior to strabismus surgery. After induction
      of anesthesia and insertion of an LMA while the patient was at a steady state of anesthesia
      and spontaneously breathing sevoflurane in oxygen, 3 drops of either povidone-iodine or BSS
      was instilled into each eye (right eye first). Respiratory rate was determined by measuring
      the peak-to-peak interval on the capnograph. This is similar to calculating heart rate by
      measuring the R-R interval on an ECG. HR, BP, SaO2, EtCO2, and expired sevoflurane were
      measured in each patient. Medical history information collected included history of prior
      surgeries, co-existing diseases, or apnea. Appropriate statistical analyses were performed
      for comparisons between the groups with respect to respiratory rate, HR, BP, expired
      sevoflurane, and co-existing diseases.
