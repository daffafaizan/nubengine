      focused on increasing physical activity. The group sessions will include participating in
      physical activity as well as group discussions on the barriers and opportunities for
      increasing physical activity in their daily life. The 12-week program covers educational
      topics related to physical activity (e.g. overcoming barriers to activity, exercising safely,
      relapse prevention strategies) and the program gradually increases the amount of physical
      activity completed during the group sessions over the course of the 12 weeks. Over a 3-month
      wait period, individuals in the wait-list control group will be offered monthly sessions on
      health and wellness topics before being offered the physical activity program. Measurement
      visits will occur at baseline, at the end of the12-week program, and approximately 12-weeks
      after the end of the intervention. During the measurement sessions participants will complete
      assessments related to their physical activity and other health behaviors.
