      hospitalizations, two lost duty days per event, and 9,300 ambulatory hospital visits per year
      (60% hyponatremia, 40% dehydration) (Carter et al., 2005; DoD, 2008). Diarrhea is a major
      infectious disease threat which requires aggressive i.v. fluid replacement in 30% of U.S.
      troops deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan (Brown et al., 2009). It is also important to
      recognize that the management and outcome of the 662 severe or penetrating traumatic brain
      injuries (TBI) reported for the military in 2009 (DoD, 2010) may be hindered by dehydration
      (Clifton et al., 2002). Fluid and electrolyte imbalances also contribute to heat illness
      (Carter et al., 2005) and can substantially impair combat fighting effectiveness (Dupont,
      2003).

      The importance of developing a valid assessment measure of human hydration status for
      clinical and field use is recognized by the military community as a high priority medical
      technology gap (MOM ICD v1.3, 2008). In far forward locations (levels I-II), orthostatic
      testing or gross symptoms are most commonly used to estimate hydration status (Manning et
      al., 2007). However, level I-II methods share symptoms with numerous other maladies and are
      insensitive until dehydration is severe or becomes debilitating (Levitt et al., 1992; McGee,
      1999). Definitive hydration assessment in rear roles of medical care (levels III-V) requires
      invasive serial blood and/or urine measurements (Feig, 1977; Mange, 1997). Thus, a
      field-expedient technology that provides an accurate, non-invasive assessment of hydration
      status would improve medical triage by allowing better fluid-electrolyte management by medics
      in theatre (point of care), and by medical personnel in the rear levels of care (treatment
      and return to duty).
