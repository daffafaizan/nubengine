    
      This is a phase I/II study with the primary purpose to determine the safety of immunization
      with Ad5 [E1-, E2B-]-CEA(6D), in patients with advanced or metastatic CEA-expressing
      malignancies. The secondary objectives are to evaluate CEA-specific immune responses to the
      immunizations and to obtain preliminary data on clinical response rate. The study population
      consists of patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic malignancy that
      is CEA positive who were previously treated with standard therapy known to have a possible
      survival benefit or refused such therapy. The study will determine the safety of three dosage
      levels of Ad5 [E1-, E2B-]-CEA(6D) vaccine (phase I component), and the maximally tolerated
      dose of Ad5 [E1-, E2B-]-CEA(6D) vaccine (phase II component). The study drug is Ad5 [E1-,
      E2B-]-CEA(6D) given by subcutaneous (SQ) injection every 3 weeks for 3 immunizations. We will
      evaluate safety in each cohort at least 3 weeks after the last patient in the previous cohort
      has received their first injection. A dosing scheme will be considered safe if <33% of
      patients treated at a dosage level experience DLT (e.g., 0 of 3, ≤1 of 6, ≤3 of 12 or ≤5 of
      18 patients).
