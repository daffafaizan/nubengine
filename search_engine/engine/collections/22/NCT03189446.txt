      Endometrial cancer is commonly treated with surgery. The patient must have already had
      surgery including hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) prior to being considered eligible for
      this study. The surgery may also include removal of pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes.
      Following the surgery, the doctor will identify if the patient has factors related to the
      cancer which places the patient at a greater risk for the cancer returning.

      Prior to participating in this study there are exams, tests or procedures to find out if the
      patient can be treated in the study. Most are part of regular cancer care.

      Treatment:

      All patients will receive radiation therapy followed by three cycles of dose dense paclitaxel
      and carboplatin chemotherapy. Radiation therapy will be delivered either by LDR or HDR
      brachytherapy and must be specified at the time of enrollment. The vaginal brachytherapy
      should be started within 12 weeks of surgery (within 2 weeks of enrollment). Chemotherapy
      should start within 3 weeks of initiating brachytherapy.

      Study participation will be up to two years.
