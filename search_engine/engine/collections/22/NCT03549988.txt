      inflammatory bowel disease and response to treatment. Current methods for measurement of FC
      require bringing stool samples to the laboratory or physician's office. The test is either
      not readily available or is expensive for patients. Some patients also find it inconvenient
      to collect, transport and travel to return the sample.

      A prior study in our institution showed that only 77% of patients returned samples for
      processing. Therefore, a home-based kit may offer greater uptake by patients as samples do
      not need to be returned to a lab or physician's office. Regular monitoring of patients at
      home may allow the detection and prediction of flares before the appearance of symptoms. With
      earlier treatment, the risk of complications may be minimized and the quality of life for
      people living with this disease may be improved.
