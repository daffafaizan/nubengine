      significant number of ST users recognize the importance of quitting, many either do not want
      to quit or feel it is impossible. For these individuals, tobacco reduction may be an
      important transitional goal, either prior to quitting or as a treatment endpoint. However,
      approaches to help ST users reach this goal have not been studied. This study will assess the
      effectiveness of using tobacco-free snuff in reducing levels of exposure to tobacco and
      associated toxicity, as well as enhancing motivation to either quit or sustain lower levels
      of nicotine intake.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either treatment with tobacco-free snuff or
      treatment without it. All participants will be encouraged to reduce nicotine intake by 50%
      during the first four weeks and by 75% the following four weeks. Participants receiving the
      tobacco-free snuff will be asked to alternate the use of their usual brand of ST with
      tobacco-free snuff in order to achieve the targeted reduction. Participants not receiving the
      tobacco-free snuff will only be informed to try to cut down their tobacco use to the targeted
      reduction. Study visits will occur once weekly during the 8-week treatment period.
      Assessments will include vital signs, physiological measures related to tobacco use, and
      measures of motivation and self-efficacy to quit ST. The number of participants who either do
      not complete treatment, reduce nicotine intake, or quit completely will be assessed at the
      Week 8 study visit and at follow-up visits, which will be held at Weeks 12 and 26.
