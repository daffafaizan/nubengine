      compliance with the assigned therapeutic regimen, the participant received additional
      therapeutic intervention or initiation of an alternative antihyperglycemic medication
      following study drug discontinuation (rescue therapy). Participants who received rescue
      therapy were included in the analysis population, but only measurements obtained prior to the
      beginning of rescue therapy were included in specified analyses.
