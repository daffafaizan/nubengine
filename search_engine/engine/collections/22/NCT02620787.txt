      infection and 6 healthy volunteer control participants. The study will take place in an
      inpatient unit at Hartford Hospital for all patients and in the Clinical Research Center at
      Hartford Hospital for all healthy volunteers. All participants will receive 3 to 6 doses of
      oral tedizolid 200mg once daily. A microdialysis probe (Mdialysis Inc., N. Chelmsford, MA)
      will be inserted into the subcutaneous soft tissue near the margin of the wound (patients) or
      in the thigh (healthy volunteers). The microdialysis probe is perfused with lactated Ringer's
      solution and samples are collected for the 24 hours following the final dose (i.e., 48-72
      hours). A peripheral intravenous catheter will be inserted into an arm vein to collect blood
      samples simultaneously with microdialysis samples. Concentrations in tissue are compared with
      blood to determine percent penetration.
