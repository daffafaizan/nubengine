      antibodies against glutamic-acid decarboxylase (GAD-Ab). GAD is the rate-limiting enzyme for
      the synthesis of gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) from glutamate and is expressed by inhibitory
      neurons of the central nervous system. Neurological syndromes with anti-GAD antibodies
      (GAD-Ab) are often non-paraneoplastic. They mainly include limbic encephalitis (LE),
      cerebellar ataxia (CA) and stiff-person syndrome (SPS). Although the pathogenic role of
      GAD-Ab is controversial, most patients have high serum levels and GAD-Ab are also detected in
      the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) along with other inflammatory abnormalities such as oligoclonal
      bands. GAD-Ab may also be present in the serum of T1DM patients, as pancreatic beta cells
      also express GAD, but usually at much lower titers than those of neurological patients.
      Organ-specific autoimmune diseases, such as T1DM and autoimmune thyroid disease, are common
      among patients with GAD-Ab and neurological syndromes and in their relatives, suggesting a
      shared genetic predisposition to autoimmune disorders. This is also supported by family
      reports of neurological syndromes with GAD-Ab and some HLA associations described in SPS.

      The aim of this study is to describe the different autoimmune organ-specific diseases present
      in patients with GAD-Ab and their relatives, along with to identify families with higher
      aggregation of autoimmune diseases and establish potential ways of inheritability.
