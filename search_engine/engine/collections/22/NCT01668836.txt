      group of calorie restriction or resveratrol so that in 24 individuals (12 women and 12 men)
      will be given a hypocaloric diet (1000 calories per day) and the remaining 24 individuals (12
      women and 12 men), a daily pill of 500mg of resveratrol. In the two moments, after the
      washout period and before the intervention (baseline) and after 30 days of intervention
