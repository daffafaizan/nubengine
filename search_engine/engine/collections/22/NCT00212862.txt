      prospective, observational multicenter registry of approximately 1200 adult cancer patients
      receiving treatment with EST; eg, epoetin alfa or darbepoetin alfa. The planned duration of
      the DOSE Registry is three years. Based on initial results, the registry sponsor may elect to
      extend the duration of the registry.This study does not specify treatment protocols, require
      any particular assignment of patients to treatment protocols, or in any other way require
      participating physicians to alter their practice patterns. Participating physicians are
      instructed to continue to treat all patients according to their own best clinical judgment,
      but to submit information on baseline patient characteristics, treatment patterns, and
      clinical outcomes. Baseline determinations will include patient demographics, tumor and
      treatment type, hematologic parameters, and patient reported outcomes. Data will be collected
      over the 16-week study period with regard to EST treatment, hematologic outcomes and patient
      reported outcomes.
