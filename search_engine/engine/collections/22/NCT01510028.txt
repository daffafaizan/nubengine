    
      Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an inherited, autosomal recessive disorder of lipid
      metabolism characterized by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme, arylsulfatase A
      (ASA). MLD is a rare disease that occurs in most parts of the world. The estimated overall
      incidence of the disease in the western world is approximately 1 in 100,000 live births that
      varies by geographic location. There are no approved therapies for MLD.

      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study designed to evaluate the safety of
      up to 3 dose levels (10, 30, or 100 mg) of HGT-1110 administered via an intrathecal drug
      delivery device (IDDD) every other week (EOW) for a total of 38 weeks (20 injections, Weeks 0
      to 38) to children with MLD. The study also includes the assessment of HGT-1110 drug product
      produced with a revised drug substance manufacturing process (referred to as Process B) in a
      fourth cohort (Cohort 4). Approximately 24 patients will be enrolled and will receive
      treatment of HGT-1110. Patients will be sequentially enrolled into 4 dose cohorts,
      approximately 6 patients each. Patient enrollment will be staggered in this study to
      facilitate adequate safety monitoring per dose cohort.
