      intraoperative intravitreal conbercept (IVC) injection in pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with
      silicone oil tamponade for severe proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Methods. These
      patients were randomly assigned to three groups: Group 1 received an IVC injection 3 to 5
      days before surgery; Group 2 received an IVC injection at the end of surgery; and Group 3
      received an IVC injection 3 to 5 days before PPV as well as an IVC injection at the end of
      PPV. Follow-up examinations were performed for at least six months after surgery.
