      antibioprophylaxis alone or antibioprophylaxis plus circumcision. Circumcision will be
      performed at the time of valve resection. Children will undergo a cystogram between 1 and 4
      months to control valve resection. They will be followed for two years and the number of
      febrile UTIs in each group will be compared. The diagnosis of febrile UTI will be confirmed
      by urethral catheterisation or suprapubic aspiration. A DMSA scan will be performed at the
      beginning and end of the study to determine whether children who have presented febrile UTIs
      show deterioration of their DMSA as compared to those who did not present febrile UTIs.

      At 24 months follow-up, "impact on family scale" survey (IOFS) whose main objective is to
      evaluate the impact of family support for a child with posterior urethral valves will be
      proposed parents.
