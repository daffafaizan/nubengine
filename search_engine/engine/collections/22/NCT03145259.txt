      generate data for establishing rate of drug delivery comparisons between diclofenac epolamine
      patches and diclofenac sodium solution in healthy adults and to determine skin
      concentrations. This study supports FDA's continuing effort to identify the most accurate,
      sensitive, reproducible and efficient methods to evaluate topical dermatological drug
      products.
