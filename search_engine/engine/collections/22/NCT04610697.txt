      planning, strategic thinking, problem-solving, and inhibiting inappropriate behavior. Such
      deficits are transdiagnostic and often underlie behavioral incidents, undermine reintegration
      into the community, and increase recidivism risk. Despite this, forensic programs usually do
      not include executive function training.

      One approach to train executive functions is cognitive remediation, which consists of
      behavioral exercises engaging cognitive skills, supported by coaching. In various mental
      health conditions, cognitive remediation has been repeatedly associated with improvements in
      cognitive, functional, and clinical outcomes, with small-to-moderate effect sizes. Thus, it
      should be clarified whether this approach can lead to similar improvements in forensic
      populations.

      In the present trial, we investigate whether 12 hours over 6 weeks of computerised cognitive
      remediation administered using tele-health can improve executive functions relative to an
      active control condition in a sample of 30 forensic inpatients (Aim 1). We further examine
      the effect of cognitive remediation (vs. active control) on other variables that are critical
      for forensic rehabilitation, namely aggression, therapeutic noncompliance, daily functioning,
      and mental health (Aim 2). Lastly, we explore whether any effects persist 12 weeks following
      cognitive remediation (Aim 3).

      Cognitive remediation is an evidence-based inexpensive training method that could be
      integrated into forensic healthcare practice. In the long term, the expected cognitive,
      functional, and clinical improvements associated with cognitive remediation have the
      potential to result in shorter hospitalisations and reduced recidivism rates.
