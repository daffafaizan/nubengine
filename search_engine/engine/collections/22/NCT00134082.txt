      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of rituximab and high-dose cyclophosphamide
           followed by vaccine therapy comprising an allogeneic vaccine that expresses Hodgkin's
           tumor antigens and sargramostim (GM-CSF) (KGEL vaccine) as salvage therapy in patients
           with relapsed Hodgkin lymphoma.

        -  Determine the immunologic response to this vaccine in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 3-year relapse-free and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the patterns of cellular immune reconstitution in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV on days -10 and -7 and then on days 29, 36, 43, and 50 (weeks
      4-7) and high-dose (transplant-dose) cyclophosphamide IV on days -3 to 0 without stem cell
      rescue. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously once daily beginning on day 6 and
      continuing until blood counts recover. Patients also receive vaccine therapy comprising an
      allogeneic vaccine that expresses Hodgkin's tumor antigens and sargramostim (GM-CSF) (KGEL
      vaccine) intradermally on day 1, and weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24.

      After completion of high-dose cyclophosphamide, patients are followed every 3 months for 3
      years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
