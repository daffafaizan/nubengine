      I. Determine the efficacy and safety of bortezomib (as a chemosensitizing agent) in pediatric
      patients and young adults with primary refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) or HL in first
      relapse.

      II. Determine the response rate in patients treated with bortezomib, ifosfamide, and
      vinorelbine ditartrate (vinorelbine tartrate) (IVB) and compare the response rate to the
      historical response rate in patients treated with ifosfamide and vinorelbine ditartrate
      alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate (complete and partial response) and induction success
      rate after 2 or 4 courses of therapy and the reinduction rate (complete response) after 4
      courses of therapy.

      II. Determine the proportion of patients able to mobilize sufficient hematopoietic stem cells
      (CD34+) after 2 courses of IVB.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, pilot study.

      Patients receive ifosfamide intravenously (IV) continuously over days 1-4, vinorelbine
      tartrate IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1 and 5, and bortezomib intravenously on days 1, 4, and
      8, and filgrastim (G-CSF) by vein or subcutaneously beginning on day 6 and continuing until
      blood counts recover or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested. Treatment cycles
      repeat every 21 days for up to 2 or 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo autologous PBSC harvesting according to institutional guidelines after the
      second course of therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and
      then annually thereafter.
