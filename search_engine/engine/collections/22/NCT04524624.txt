      great progress in the diagnosis and treatment of cerebrovascular diseases.CDSS can use
      computer technology to simulate and extend expert knowledge and empirical evidence in a
      timely and efficient manner. The combination of AI and CDSS is a potential solution to the
      shortage of medical resources and can improve the quality of and promote the standardization
      of medical services. At intervention sites, neurologists will receive support on use of the
      AI-based CDSS.

      Aim: To evaluate the effectiveness of an AI-based CDSS for stroke management in patients with
      acute ischemic stroke within 7 days of symptom onset.

      Intervention: An AI-based CDSS for an integrated management of patients with acute ischemic
      stroke. The strategy includes automatically identifying acute stroke lesions and lesion
      patterns, automated classification of stroke subtypes and mechanisms, evidence-based alerts,
      and guideline-recommended secondary stroke prevention strategies.

      Eighty eligible hospitals in china, stratified by hospital capacity (secondary grade or
      tertiary) and economic-geographical regions (eastern, central, and western), will be
      randomized into either the CDSS group or the usual care group.
