      into two groups. The first group, received conservative treatment with lid hygiene, warm
      compression, and dexamethasone/tobramycin ointment for at least 20 days. The second group, in
      addition to the conservative treatment, received a mixture of probiotic microorganisms once a
      day up to 3 months. Chalazia were classified according to their size into three groups: small
      (â‰¤2 mm), medium (2-4 mm), or large (>4 mm). When conservative treatment (with and without
      probiotics supplementation) failed to resolve the lesion, invasive methods were used,
      (intralesion steroid injection in medium size chalazion and surgical incision and curettage
      for the largest ones).
