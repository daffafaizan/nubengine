      (dialysis or transplant) which at this time, is inevitable in patients with CKD. NKA is
      composed of autologous, homologous selected renal cells (SRC) formulated in a Biomaterial
      (gelatin-based hydrogel). SRC are the biologically active component of NKA. Proof of
      principle for SRC as the biologically active component of NKA was established in multiple
      models of CKD. Based on nonclinical efficacy and safety data, a single NKA dose will be
      delivered to patients in this FIH clinical trial. This dose provides a minimum of a 1.5-fold
      safety margin over doses delivered safely in nonclinical studies. In addition, this dose
      demonstrated efficacy in a nonclinical disease model.
