      Prevalence of LBP is about 20 to 30%. LBP is the most frequent disease and causes a lot of
      the medical and social costs. Recently the traditional drug therapy, exercise therapy has
      been developed and various non-surgical treatments have been developed. Surgical techniques
      are also rapidly evolving. In Korea lumbar spine surgeries were performed in accordance with
      the national practice guidelines presented by the Health Insurance Review and Assessment
      Service. Many patients who do not meet the surgical criteria undergo the non-surgical
      treatment, but there is no reliable research data for a systematic and cost-effective results
      of non-surgical treatment. It will be a big part of the future medical expenses because there
      is no guideline for the expensive procedure.
