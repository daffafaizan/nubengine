    
      Patients with central serous chorioretinopathy are recruited from the Department of
      Ophthalmology at the Medical University of Vienna. All patients undergo ETDRS visual acuity
      measurement, Pelli-Robson contrast examination, Amsler-Grid testing, questionnaire testing,
      ophthalmologic examination, SD-OCT and polarization-sensitive OCT, fundus autofluorescence,
      fluorescein angiography, indocyanine-green angiography, fundus photo and microperimetry.
      Patients are re-examined after an interval of 6 weeks until subretinal fluid is entirely
      reabsorbed to gain further insides in etiology, course and prognosis of this disease.
