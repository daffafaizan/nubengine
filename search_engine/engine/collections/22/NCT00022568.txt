        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine in patients
           with metastatic melanoma.

        -  Determine the clinical toxic effects of this vaccine in these patients.

        -  Determine the safety of this vaccine in these patients.

        -  Determine the clinical response of these patients to this vaccine.

        -  Determine evidence of host anti-melanoma immune reactivity in these patients after
           treatment with this vaccine.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine once every 4 weeks for a total of 3
      vaccinations. Patients with stable or responding disease may receive an additional course of
      vaccinations.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of recombinant vaccinia-TRICOM vaccine until
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that
      at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at each vaccine administration, and at study
      completion.

      Patients are followed at 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12
      months.
