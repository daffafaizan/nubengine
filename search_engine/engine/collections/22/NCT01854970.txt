      otolaryngology and gastroenterology departments of Bordeaux teaching hospital. A first
      clinical, endoscopic and pH-impedance evaluation will be made, after at least 15 days of
      interruption of any proton pump inhibitors (PPI). After 8 weeks' treatment by double PPI
      doses (esomeprazole 40 mg bid), another clinical and pH-impedance evaluation will be
      realized. The characteristics of the patients who respond to the treatment will be compared
      to non responders. The subjects will also have an initial laryngoscopy, an oesophageal
      manometry allowing the location of the lower sphincter of the oesophagus and the upper
      sphincter of the oesophagus for positioning the catheters.
