    
      This is a single center, open-label, randomized, 5-period, 10-sequence study designed to
      assess each treatment in 30 healthy subjects enrolled in the study. The five treatments
      tested using a single oral administration will be: (1) Oral Suspension Type 1, 300 mg Oral
      Tablet, Oral Suspension Type 2 all under fasted conditions and (2) Oral Suspension Type 2,
      300 mg Oral Tablet under fed conditions. Each dose is followed by at least a seven-day
      washout period. The sequence and period arrangement will be constructed based on the Williams
      design to ensure the study is balanced with respect to first-order carry-over effects.
