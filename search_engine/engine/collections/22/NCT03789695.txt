      receiving dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) compared to patients taking warfarin. The planned
      trial is a prospective phase IV randomized trial in which patients with AF, T2DM and CKD will
      be randomized to groups receiving either dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) or warfarin. The main
      goal of the study is to assess the differences in annual eGFR reduction between patients
      receiving dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) or warfarin for 24 months. The difference in annual
      eGFR reduction will be estimated using the SMPI parameters (mixed model of repeated
      measurements). Secondary goals are as follows: - to evaluate the progression of albuminuria
      during treatment with dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) or warfarin based on the combined
      endpoint; - to evaluate the dynamics of the albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) in urine during 2
      years of treatment with dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) or warfarin; - to evaluate bleeding
      episodes, acute cerebrovascular accident, and systemic embolism in the dabigatran etexilate
      (Pradaxa) and warfarin groups; - to compare glycemic control (HbA1c) in patients receiving
      dabigatran etexilate (Pradaxa) and warfarin
