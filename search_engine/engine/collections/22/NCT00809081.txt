      These postoperative complications could delay postoperative resumption of adequate oral
      intake. The use of TPN significantly increases postoperative complications, especially those
      associate with infections. However, method of Nutritional support (Enteral feeding or total
      parenteral support)after pancreaticoduodenectomy is controversial.

        1. To evaluate whether early enteral nutrition may be decreased the postoperative
           complications

        2. To evaluate whether enteral feeding improve nutritional status after
           pancreaticoduodenectomy

        3. To determine the optimal method for postoperative nutritional support
