      concurrent chemoradiotherapy in advanced, previously irradiated or metastatic head and neck
      cancer. II. Determine the toxicity and response to cisplatin, paclitaxel and radiation
      therapy in these patients. III. Determine the toxicity of amifostine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive paclitaxel by continuous infusion on
      days 0-3. Amifostine IV is administered over 5 minutes on days 1-5. Radiation therapy is
      administered once daily on days 1-5. Cisplatin IV is administered on day 5. Patients receive
      no treatment on days 6-13. Treatment is repeated every 2 weeks for up to 7 courses in the
      absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly
      during the first year, every 2 months during the second year, then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 16-46 patients.
