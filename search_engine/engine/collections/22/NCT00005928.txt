      atherosclerosis and may contribute to stiffening of arteries that increases the risk of
      myocardial infarction and stroke. Therapies that reduce vascular inflammation may reduce
      cardiovascular events. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor therapy reduces
      cardiovascular events in patients with coronary artery disease (CAD), potentially by reducing
      vascular oxidant stress and activation of genes that encode protein mediators of
      inflammation. However, we found that ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with CAD had no
      overall significant effect on serum levels of cell adhesion molecules VCAM-1, ICAM-1, and
      E-selectin (surrogate markers of vascular inflammation), although some patients showed a
      reduction in levels, suggesting either that these surrogate markers of vascular inflammation
      may not accurately reflect reduction in vascular inflammation, or that only a subset of
      patients have biological responses that might reduce their cardiovascular risk. The purposes
      of this protocol are to determine 1) the effect of ACE inhibitor therapy on vascular
      inflammation in patients with coronary artery disease as assessed by MRI of the carotid
      arteries, and 2) whether serum markers of inflammation correlate with reduced vascular
      inflammation and thus may be suitable surrogates for determining success of ACE inhibitor
      therapy.
