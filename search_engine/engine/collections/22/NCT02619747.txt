    
      This is a multi-centre, randomised, open-label, placebo-controlled, two-period crossover
      study. After signing a written informed consent (ICF), patients will undergo a screening
      period of up to 10 days (Visit 1) which will require the patient to return to the clinic on
      several occasions. At the start of the screening process patients will have 24 hour (h) pH
      monitoring which will include one standardised refluxogenic meal after a 4 h fast. The 24 h
      pH monitoring results will be used as a key criteria for patient eligibility and to provide
      the patients with diagnostic information on their symptoms. After 24 h pH monitoring,
      eligible patients will be supplied with Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachet to
      take as required for symptom relief between visits (up to 2×10ml sachets four times daily: 30
      minutes after breakfast, 30 minutes after lunch, 30 minutes after dinner and immediately
      before lying down for bed, stopping dosing at least 24 hours prior to Visit 2).

      Patients who satisfy the study entry requirements within 10 days of consent, will be
      randomised to receive either two Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachets (2×10ml) or
      two placebo sachets (2×10ml) following placement of a pH electrode after a 4 h fast and a
      standardised refluxogenic meal at Visit 2.

      Upon completion of the Visit 2 4-hour post-dose pH monitoring period patients will be
      re-supplied with Compound Sodium Alginate Oral Suspension sachets to take as required for
      symptom relief (up to 2×10ml sachets four times daily: 30 minutes after breakfast, 30 minutes
      after lunch, 30 minutes after dinner and immediately before lying down for bed, stopping
      dosing at least 24 hours prior to Visit 3) for 7 ± 2 days. Patients will return for Visit 3
      after 7 ± 2 days. Visit 3 will consist of repeat pH catheter insertion (4 hour fast followed
      by refluxogenic test meal consumption) and pH monitoring, receiving the alternative
      randomised treatment at Visit 3.
