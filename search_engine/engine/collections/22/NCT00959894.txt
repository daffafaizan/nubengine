      older who have taken less than or equal to 10 days of prior antiretroviral therapy and have
      never taken etravirine, dapivirine (TMC120), or rilpivirine (TMC 278) in the main study.
      There will be approximately 40 subjects who enroll in the main study that will be in the
      metabolic sub-study and approximately 20 subjects (10 pre-menopausal women and 10 men) who
      enroll in the main study that will be in the genital secretions PK sub-study.

      Procedures (methods): For the main study subjects will take etravirine 400 mg once daily
      orally with fixed-dose tenofovir/emtricitabine (Truvada) one tablet once daily. For the

      the study except for the week 4 study visit where women will have the cervicovaginal sample
      at time 0 and at 24 hours collected by study staff. For the metabolic sub-study, waist
      measurements and dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scans will be performed at entry,
      week 24, and week 96, and 2-3 teaspoons of blood to check lipids, insulin, and glucose will
      be taken at entry and weeks 12, 24, 48, and 96.
