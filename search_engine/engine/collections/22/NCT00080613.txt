      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in postmenopausal women with locally advanced
           hormone receptor-positive breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant and adjuvant
           exemestane.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the response rate by mammography, ultrasound, MRI, and positron emission
           tomography scan in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Compare the expression of hormone receptors and epidermal growth factor receptors
           (including HER2/neu) in patients prior to and after treatment with this drug and
           correlate these results with clinical response rates.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral exemestane once daily for 16 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. After 16 weeks, patients undergo surgery and then
      continue exemestane once daily for a total of 5 years (including the 16 weeks before
      surgery).

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years after surgery and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
