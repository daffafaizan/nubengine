      prevents a premature surge of luteal hormone (LH), ultimately leads to suppression of the
      pituitary gland and high levels of estrogen observed during induced cycles result in
      inhibiting effect on the implantation of human embryos.

      The luteal support in in-vitro-fertilization (IVF) cycles can be prolonged using human
      chorion gonadotropin(hCG) and/or progesterone.

      Since it has been noted that the use of hCG was related with higher risks of the onset of
      ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS), progesterone is nowadays a product of choice in
      luteal support.

      Currently vaginal progesterone is widely used, since the classic oral progesterone results in
      low bioavailability and lower pregnancy rate and the intramuscular progesterone (IM-P) daily
      injections are painful and may cause abscesses, inflammatory reactions and local soreness.

      However, standard protocol for luteal phase support has not been established (i.e. optimal
      dosage, route or duration).

      Dydrogesterone is a retroprogesterone with good oral bioavailability. Oral administration is
      clear advantage, due to expected higher patient compliance and better tolerability than
      currently used vaginal or IM-P.

      We hypothesize that dydrogesterone has the same efficacy as vaginal progesterone but better
      tolerability due to less side effects.
