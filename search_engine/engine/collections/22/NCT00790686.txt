      The chronic strictures of the ureter are usually treated by double J stents. They allow the
      emptying of the kidney and avoid the deterioration of renal function. Unfortunately, double J
      stents have to be replaced every 6 month and are at the origin of irritative lower urinary
      tract symptoms and lumbar pain which corrupt the quality of life of the patients.

      Ureteral stricture could also be treated with MEMOKATH 051. These new ureteral stents seem
      not to require iterative changes and also not to cause irritative symptoms and lumbar pain.
      MEMOKATH 051 could therefore allow to reduce the number of changes and to ameliorate the
      quality of life of the patients.

      Main objective:

      Main objective is to assess effectiveness and tolerance of the MEMOKATH Â® 051 in the
      treatment of chronic strictures of the ureter.

      Resume:

      Patients usually treated with double J stents will be included. The double J stent will be
      replaced by a MEMOKATH 051 stent under general anesthesia during a cystoscopy.

      After this procedure, the patients will have medical examination, blood exams, radiography
      and renal sonography at 1 month, 3 month and every 6 month during a 3 years follow up period.

      If a problem of tolerance or effectiveness is diagnosed, the ureteral stent MEMOKATH 051 will
      be changed or replaced with a double J stent and an adverse event will be declared.
