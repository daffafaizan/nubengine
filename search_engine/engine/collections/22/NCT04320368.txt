      inclusion and exclusion criteria: 1) CN, 2) AD and 3) VCI. We will follow up with each of
      them subject at designated time points up to 2 years. We will collect demographic, medical,
      imaging (MRI and PET scans), genetic information and various biological samples (blood,
      saliva, urine and feces) during the study period. This study uses a case-control study
      design. The matched cases will have similar age, gender and education levels. By studying the
      relationship between risk factors of AD and VCI, we will establish norms and parameters in
      the Chinese population.
