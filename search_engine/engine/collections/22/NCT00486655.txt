      laparoscope through a 1.5-2.5 cm incision in the umbilicus and then 2-3 additional 0.5 cm
      incisions for additional instrumentation. While post-operative complication rates for this
      procedure are small, wound infection, particularly of the large incision, is one of the most
      common post-operative complications. There is also a risk of a post-operative hernia at these
      incision sites.

      A less invasive surgical technique that reduces the size or number of laparoscopic incisions
      offers the potential clinical benefits of eliminating wound infections, hernias and
      decreasing post-operative pain following laparoscopic gall bladder removal.
