      infants (≥ 34 SSW) within the first 72 hours of life and compare this data with the size of
      the most recommended available face masks:

      VBM Germany:

      external diameter smaller mask: 50 mm, external diameter bigger mask: 70 m

      Laerdal:

      external diameter smaller mask: 50 mm; external diameter bigger mask: 60 mm

      Fisher&Paykel:

      external diameter smaller mask: 50 mm; external diameter bigger mask: 60 mm

      Therefore the investigators want to collect the following information from the participants:

      Picture of the participant´s face (2D and 3D-Image) birth weight, head circumference, mode of
      delivery, gestational age, singletons/ twins/ triplets, date of birth
