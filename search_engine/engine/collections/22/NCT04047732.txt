      enrolled upon obtaining consent and meeting entry criteria. This study is an intra-patient
      comparison of KB105 and placebo-administered Target Areas. Patients will be evaluated for
      safety, and Target Areas will be assessed individually with the IGA and VIIS scales. Target
      Areas will be imaged and evaluated for safety and efficacy. Subjects will be on-trial for
      approximately 3.5 months.
