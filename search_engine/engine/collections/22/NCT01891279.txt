      bowel anomalies (gastroschisis or omphalocele) can have inability to adequately digest and
      absorb enteral feedings resulting in prolonged Parenteral Nutrition (PN) dependence for
      nutrition and growth. Prolonged PN dependence can result in Parenteral Nutrition Associated
      Liver Disease (PNALD) and intestinal failure requiring small bowel or small bowel/liver
      transplantation for survival.

      After bowel resection, the bowel has an ability to compensate for significant loss by going
      through a process called intestinal adaptation. Enteral feeding is the key factor for
      initiating and maintaining the adaptation of the intestine.

      Whole protein formulas or partially hydrolyzed formulas provide either the full protein or
      dipeptides/tripeptides respectively, and are thought to confer the best benefit in inducing
      intestinal adaptation and increasing paracrine stimulation. However, in small studies of
      adults and children with SBS,an amino acid based (elemental) formula demonstrated improved
      feeding tolerance and ability to wean off TPN. In a small study, babies fed breast milk or
      elemental formula appeared to have shorter duration of TPN.

      This is a randomized, blinded clinical trial to determine if elemental formula, Elecare® (vs.
      partially hydrolyzed formula, Pregestimil®) is better tolerated and allows a higher
      proportion of neonates with small bowel resection or congenital bowel anomalies to
      successfully wean off TPN.
