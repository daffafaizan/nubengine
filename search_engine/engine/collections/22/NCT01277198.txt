      equipment in laparoscopic surgery, however, it is not clear whether using flexible equipment
      is really helpful in performing pyelolithotomies and the clearance rates using flexible
      equipment varies 71% to 100%. Therefore, authors plan to investigate the usefulness of
      flexible cystoscopy in performing laparoscopic pyelolithotomies and ureterolithotomies by
      comparing operative results of a single surgeon's experience.
