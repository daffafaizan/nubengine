      recipients who are 8-18 years of age and who can understand English, and who are expected to
      be in hospital or in clinic daily for 5 days. This will be a multi-center RCT in which we
      will randomize children to either undergo daily symptom screening for 5 days with symptom
      reports provided to the healthcare team or standard of care. The primary outcome will be the
      self-reported day 5 total SSPedi score (range 0-60; higher worse). Secondary outcomes will be
      the day 5 self-reported individual symptom, pain and QoL scores, and documentation of
      symptoms and provision of interventions for symptoms over the 5 day trial. We will enroll 345
      participants over 4 years from 7 Canadian centers
