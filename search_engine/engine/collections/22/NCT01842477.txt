      scaffolds and molecular signals (growth or differentiating factors) in order to form hybrids
      constructs. For bone reconstruction purposes, human MSCs have been seeded and cultured on
      porous calcium phosphate ceramics in osteogenic media. Some clinical studies with low numbers
      of patients have been reported using this approach but the outcomes were inconsistent with
      low efficacy in bone regeneration. The reasons of the limited clinical success may be due to
      several bottlenecks in the multidisciplinary field of bone tissue engineering. The
      association in vitro of biomaterials and osteoprogenitor cells raises technical challenges
      and regulatory and ethic issues for the implementation of clinical trials, whereas the
      expansion of MSCs is now possible in GMP Facility.

      The expected results are to obtain bone consolidation thus healing of delayed union or
      non-union, as proven by imaging techniques, without using bone graft. This will prove the
      efficacy of the proposed IMP based on pluripotent MSCs expanded in a GMP facility and mixed
      with granulated biphasic calcium phosphate in the surgical setting before implantation. No
      expected complications related to the procedure are expected. Changes in serum levels of bone
      turnover markers will be described.
