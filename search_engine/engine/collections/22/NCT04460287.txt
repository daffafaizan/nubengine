      invited to proceed to phase 2 of the trial.

      Phase 2, double blinded, randomized trial. Based on the outcome of the FFQ in phase 1 of the
      proposed trial, the 120 babies with the lowest habitual dietary intake will be allocated to
      diet in a random order for one month. Blood samples will be collected via dry blood spot kits
      at the start, middle and end of the diet along with faecal collection every day.
