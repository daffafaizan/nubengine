      baseline living in small-scale farming households in Chipata District, Zambia. As part of a
      cluster-randomized trial titled "Food Constraints, Yield Uncertainty and 'Ganyu' Labor"
      funded by IZA-DFID (PI: G Fink), 3,100 farming households in approximately 180 rural villages
      in Eastern Province are currently enrolled in a two-year study, which aims at assessing the
      effect of food loan programs on agricultural productivity. The study described here uses the
      "Food Constraints" population as a sampling frame; all households enrolled in the "Food
      Constraints" program that have a child between 6 and 18 months are invited to participate in
      this add-on trial. We anticipate that there will be around 600 eligible households recruited
      for this study. Study duration is about 18 months. Selected households will be visited for
      study enrollment and a short baseline assessment in September 2014, at which time the two
      interventions will also be rolled out. Final impact of the interventions will be assessed one
      year later, in September 2015.
