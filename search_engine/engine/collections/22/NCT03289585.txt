      Suppurativa, and to find out how the disease affects quality of life. The investigators will
      utilize a compilation of validated questionnaires including the Beck Depression Inventory
      form, Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI), Skindex, SF-36 health survey, the Quality of
      Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire- short form (Q-LES-Q-SF) and the
      Employment/Productivity Health Economic Questionnaire as well as other relevant clinical
      data. The investigators will additionally collect a modified Hidradenitis Suppurativa Lesion,
      Area, and Severity Index (HS-LASI) (or other appropriate disease severity score as determined
      by the team) from the physician of each enrollee. The investigators hope this information
      will help improve treatment for this skin condition.
