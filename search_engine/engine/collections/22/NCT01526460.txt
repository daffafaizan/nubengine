    
      An initial assessment of platelet reactivity in response to the TRAP (thrombin receptor
      agonist), ADP and arachidonic acid (respectively, indicative of the response to clopidogrel
      and aspirin) will be performed with impedance aggregometry (MultiplateÂ® analyzer system).
      Patients with a increased residual platelet reactivity to ADP test (AUC > 47) will receive a
      different antiplatelet therapy and will then be excluded from the study, the other will be
      randomized to 3 groups of treatment.
