      serves as a key mechanistic link between the host environment and the innate immune system in
      the gut. It is widely believed that one cause of IBD stems from abnormal sensing of commensal
      bacteria. The research will shed light on the molecular mechanisms used by gut barrier
      epithelial cells in sensing commensals and regulating inflammatory responses in the gut. This
      will provide a new mechanism towards which more mechanisms derived probiotics could be used
      to abrogate intestinal inflammation. It is hoped that these agents would eventually serve as
      non-toxic alternatives or adjuncts to currently available therapeutics for IBD. The research
      protocol will involve the collection of feces, either by self-collection or through
      colonoscopic washing.
