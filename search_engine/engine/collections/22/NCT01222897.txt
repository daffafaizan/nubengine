      to the study subjects. Thirty minutes after start of this breakfast, a single oral dose of
      Valacyclovir hydrochloride 1 gram of either test or reference investigational product was
      administered during each period of the study (on day 01 and 04), along with 240 mL of
      drinking water at ambient temperature under low light condition and under supervision of
      trained study personnel. Both test and reference products were administered to all the study
      subjects, one in each period (except subject number 14 who dropped out from the study and
      subject number 37 who was withdrawn from the study).

      During the course of the study, safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters, serology and urine analysis) at baseline. Adverse event monitoring was done
      throughout the study. Laboratory parameters of hematology and biochemistry (except blood
      glucose and cholesterol) were repeated at the end of the study.
