      randomized divided into 3 groups. Group A (50 cases) will be implanted 600mg sustained
      released 5-FU into liver incisal margin after tumor is resected. Group B (50 cases) will be
      implanted 600mg sustained released 5-FU and 60mg sustained released cisplatin. Group C (50
      cases) will be the controlled one which will not be implanted any chemotherapeutic drugs. All
      patients will accepted TACE 30 days after liver resection. We will follow up all patients
      until they are dead or missed connected. Related adverse reaction will be recorded. Total
      survival time (TST) and disease free survival time (DFST) will be calculated too. At the end
      of the study we will compare the difference of adverse reaction, complication, TST and DFST
      between the 3 groups. According to the result we will estimate these drugs' antitumor effect
      and safety.
