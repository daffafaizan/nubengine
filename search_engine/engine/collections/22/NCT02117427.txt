      delivered via TARGTEPO. The targeted doses will be determined according to 3 cohorts as
      follows: Group A (18-25 IU/Kg/day), Group B (35-45 IU/Kg/day), Group C (55-65 IU/Kg/day). The
      objective is to evaluate safety and biologic activity of TARGTEPO treatment when maintaining
      Hb levels within the target range of 9-12 g/dl. Biological activity assessments will include
      duration of TARGTEPO secretion as measured by serum EPO levels above baseline
