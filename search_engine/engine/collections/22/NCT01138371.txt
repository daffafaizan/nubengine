      specifically low density lipoprotein (LDL) - in the development and progression of
      atherosclerosis. A continuing relationship between cholesterol level and coronary morbidity
      has been established. The initial approach for managing elevated cholesterol includes
      lifestyle interventions, namely eating a low fat diet, weight loss in overweight patients,
      and regular aerobic exercise. Once lifestyle interventions have been applied, pharmacologic
      therapy becomes a mainstay of therapy, conventionally with a statin followed by adjunctive
      medicines as indicated. Certain populations that are refractory to aggressive
      pharmacotherapy, however - such as patients who have familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) -
      necessitate alternative means of lipid management. Therapeutic considerations in these
      patients include LDL apheresis and a number of rare procedures such as partial ileal bypass,
      liver transplantation, portocaval shunting, and possibly gene therapy in the future.

      The anti-inflammatory effects of LDL apheresis and its effects on endothelial function are
      not well known. Considering several pathways of atherogenesis, and inflammation as a central
      mechanism thereof, LDL apheresis may theoretically provide synergistic benefit of lipid
      lowering as well as proinflammatory agent lowering that can lead to significantly decreased
      atherogenesis. This study looks to address these questions by assessing the effects of LDL
      apheresis on inflammatory and lipid markers.
