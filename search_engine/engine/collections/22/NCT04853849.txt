      provide first-line behavioral modification therapy for overactive bladder (OAB). This digital
      platform provides daily contact with the user to maximize compliance. It allows a provider to
      administer behavioral modification treatment while minimizing in-office visits.

      The investigators expect that a proportion of participants using Cece will experience
      significant and satisfactory improvement in their voiding symptoms, to the point where no
      further treatment is necessary. Others will require additional treatment with the usual
      therapies such physical therapy and medications, per clinical standards.

      Participants will download CeCe to their smart phones and interact with the program for 8
      weeks. Participant consent and specific instructions will be provided during study enrollment
      and through the app. Study outcomes are collected through the program via in-app
      questionnaires and voiding diaries.

      A total of 50 participants will be recruited. They will be compensated a total sum of $175;
      $50 at completion of an initial set of questionnaires, $50 at completion of 4 week follow-up
      questionnaires, and $75 at completion of 8 week follow-up.
