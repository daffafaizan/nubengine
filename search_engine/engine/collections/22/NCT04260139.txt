      staging and cancer outcomes. It has been proposed that the more central the mesenteric
      vascular ligation, the greater the nodal yield. However, the optimal number of harvested
      nodes is still a matter of debate. We prospectively evaluated the relation between specimen
      properties such as lenght, area, tumor location and pedicle length to the number of harvested
      nodes and rate of node positivity.
