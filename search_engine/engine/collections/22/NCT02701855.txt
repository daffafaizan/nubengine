      major role of large and small arteries elasticity on cognitive aging. It will benefit from
      the recent innovative accurate and non invasive techniques such as MRI for central large
      arteries and adaptative optics for retina arterioles imaging.

      Study population is the following:

        -  60 patients with hypertension and no MCI,

        -  50 patients with hypertension and stable MCI, without dementia

        -  50 patients with hypertension and progressive MCI, without dementia

      Every patients will perform a medical interview and examination, an MRI (brain + aorta),
      adaptative optics imaging, a cognitive tests and a blood test.

      Primary outcome is to determine the relationships between retina micro-vascular remodeling
      and cognitive function in this population.
