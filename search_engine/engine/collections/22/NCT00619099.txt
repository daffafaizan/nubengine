    
      This is a randomized open-label Phase 2 efficacy and safety study of two (2) subcutaneous
      (SQ) dosing schedules of decitabine in subjects with Low or Intermediate 1 Risk MDS. This
      study will be conducted in up to 6 study centers in the United States.

      The primary efficacy outcome is the overall improvement rate. These two doses will be
      administered subcutaneously. The probability that one schedule is superior to the other will
      be estimated, and the level of toxicity for each schedule will also be evaluated.
