      patients at risk of sudden cardiac death. In order to allow for a more continuous follow-up
      and reduced complication rates of patients with ICD, new devices including remote-monitoring
      (home-monitoring) features of patients with ICD have been developed. BIOTRONIK Home
      Monitoring service enables the doctors to safely follow up their patients with implanted
      cardioverter-defibrillators in a remote fashion, with fewer in-clinic consultations. This may
      result in a more efficient follow-up and cost-savings for the health care payer.

      The objective of the current study is to investigate the cost-effectiveness and effectiveness
      of home-monitoring compared to standard care.
