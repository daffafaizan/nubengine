      in adults undergoing hemodialysis (HD). The investigators primary objective is to determine
      if receiving cognitive training (tablet-based brain games), exercise training (stationary
      foot pedal), or combined cognitive and exercise training preserves executive function
      relative to those with standard of care . The secondary objectives are to compare the rates
      of end stage renal disease (ESRD)-specific clinical outcomes and patient centered outcomes
      among those receiving CT, or ET, or CT+ET relative to those in SC. The investigators will
      formally test whether receiving CT or ET will preserve executive function and receiving
      combined CT+ET will preserve executive function better than CT or ET alone.
