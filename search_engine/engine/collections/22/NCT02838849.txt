      signing the informed consent. The protocol was composed of two phases. The baseline phase
      lasted 7 days, when participants reported their usual diet on a food dairy in the first 3
      days, between Sunday and Tuesday. Calculation of nutrient intake was performed using ADS
      nutri software (UFPEL, Pelotas, Brazil). Participants approved for the next phase were then
      randomized to fiber and fiber+water groups, which lasted 14 days. During this period
      participants were asked to report their intestinal habits including bowel movements,
      graduation of straining and subjective stool consistency. Participants were instructed to
      rank straining using a Likert scale from 1 (minimum) to 5 (maximum), and the Bristol scale
      for stool consistency. In the last day of treatment phase (Saturday) participants collected
      feces and urine of 24 hours, and responded a symptoms questionnaire. Food and liquid intake
      were recorded on a diary during the last 3 days of treatment for comparison with the baseline
      phase stage.
