      Therma-Scan. The First Sense Breast Exam® test is an adjunct to a mammogram. Currently,
      mammography is the standard of care in screening for breast cancer, and manual thermology is
      an adjunctive screening method. All of the study costs will be incurred by the sponsor and
      the subject will incur no costs to participate in the study. The First Sense Tester is a
      non-significant risk device where the tester's imaging camera makes no contact with the
      subjects during the entire procedure.
