      influence and efficacy of intramuscular (IM) Botulinum Toxin Type A (BTA) injection in
      patients with painful hallux valgus with the use of total contact insole.

      Fifty feet with painful hallux valgus will be collected. Informed consent is obtained
      according to the hospital's medical ethics and the human clinical trial committee. The feet
      will be randomized into 2 groups: Group A (n=25, treatment group) and Group B (n=25, control
      group). Clinical diagnosis of hallux valgus is made based on observation of great toe lateral
      deviation. Inclusion criteria were hallux valgus with angle of at least 20Â°, single or
      bilateral hallux valgus. To obtain the hallux valgus angle, foot roentgenography in AP and
      sesamoid views under the weight bearing condition will be obtained. The angle formed by lines
      drawn to bisect the first metatarsal bone and the proximal phalanx of the great toe will be
      measured. The exclusion criteria include history of foot operations, rheumatoid and gouty
      arthritis, and any contraindication to BTA administration. Subjective data such as the Foot
      Function Index will be collected.
