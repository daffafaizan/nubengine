      of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy in stage IV selected oligometastatic patients, by
      looking at acute and late toxicity. Investigators also want to verify what is the impact of
      local control in irradiated metastatic foci in the context of the systemic disease, how local
      control can affect disease free survival and overall survival, and moreover quality of life
      of patients treated.
