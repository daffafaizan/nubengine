    
      This is a prospective, multi-center, randomized, open-label parallel arm study involving
      patients with proven or probable invasive endemic fungal infection to ascertain the
      pharmacokinetics, safety, efficacy, and tolerability of oral SUBA-itraconazole or
      itraconazole. Patients will receive randomized open-label study drug (either SUBA-
      itraconazole 130 mg twice daily or itraconazole 200 mg twice daily) over a 42-day period and
      then continue on their assigned open-label therapy until day 180.

      The study sample size will be 80 evaluable patients - target enrollment (three arms:
      approximately 40 histoplasmosis, 20 coccidioidomycosis, 20 other endemic fungal infections).
