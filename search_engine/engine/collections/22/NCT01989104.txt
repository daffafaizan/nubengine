    
      Procedure - 1 visit - (approximately 3 hours in total)

      Day of Testing: Participant must be FASTED - No food for 4 hours before visit. All of the
      study procedures involving the participant will be completed in a single testing session
      (one-day - approximately 3 hours) at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. If preferred,
      two visits on separate days can be scheduled to complete the protocol.

        -  Screening questions (approximately 3-5 minutes)

           o Participants (or their legal guardian) will be asked to answer several screening
           questions to determine their eligibility for participating in CADENCE-KIDS.

        -  Height and weight measures data collection (approximately 10 minutes)

             -  Height will be measured.

             -  Body weight and body fat percentage will be measured using a specialized scale.

             -  Waist circumference will then be measured using a measuring tape.

        -  Instrument attachment, treadmill walking, free-living activities (approximately 140
           minutes)

             -  Participants will be fitted with 10 devices (Digi-Walker Pedometer, NL-1000
                Pedometer, StepWatch Activity Monitor, SenseWear Armband, GT3X+ accelerometer,
                GENEActiv Accelerometer, Actical Accelerometer, ActivPal Accelerometer, Polar Heart
                Rate Monitor, K4b2 Portable Metabolic Unit) to measure/monitor physical activity
                throughout the testing session.

             -  Participants will then complete several low intensity free-living activities while
                their physical activity and oxygen uptake are concurrently assessed. Specifically,
                participants will rest in a chair, watch a portion of a child-friendly movie while
                seated in a chair, and color in a coloring book while seated in a chair. Each
                activity will last for 5 minutes and a 2 minute rest will occur between each
                activity.

             -  Participants will then complete a series of walking bouts on a treadmill while
                their physical activity and oxygen uptake are concurrently assessed. The walking
                bouts start at 0.5 miles per hour and end at 5 miles per hour (0.5 miles per hour
                increments). Treadmill testing stops when the participant finishes the bout where
                they naturally select to jog/run, or following the completion of the last bout at
                5.0 miles per hour, whichever occurs first. A 2 minute rest will occur between each
                treadmill bout.

             -  Participants will then complete three additional free-living activities where
                physical activity and oxygen uptake continue to be concurrently measured.
                Specifically, participants will step up and down on an aerobic step at 88 beats per
                minute, dribble a basketball, and perform jumping jacks at 126 beats per minute (63
                jumping jacks per minute). Each activity will last for 5 minutes and a 2 minute
                rest will occur between each activity.
