      Minneapolis Staple Foods Ordinance) that establishes minimum stocking criteria for a wide
      array of healthy foods as a requirement of food store licensing. Recent calls to action from
      the Institute of Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other
      authorities have identified improving access to healthy foods as a primary strategy for local
      governments to use in advancing obesity prevention efforts, but policy initiatives in this
      area have been limited. In this study, the impact of the Minneapolis Staple Foods Ordinance
      will be evaluated by assessing objectively measured changes in: (a) food environments among
      small- to mid-sized, urban food stores, including availability, promotion, advertising,
      quality, price, and placement of both healthy and unhealthy foods and beverages, (b)
      nutritional quality of consumer purchases at small food stores, including assessment of
      energy density and calories via customer intercept surveys and direct observation of
      purchases and (c) home food environments, including availability of healthy and unhealthy
      foods/beverages and an overall home food obesogenicity score, among households that
      frequently shop at small- to mid-sized stores. These changes will be assessed pre-policy
      implementation, as well as 4-, 12- and 24-months post-policy implementation, in two Minnesota
      cities: Minneapolis and St. Paul, (our control community). The proposed scope of work in this
      study is important because its takes advantage of a unique opportunity to evaluate an
      innovative local policy addressing a recommended action area for obesity prevention that
      aligns with key recommendations by leading obesity prevention authorities. To our knowledge,
      the Minneapolis Staple Food Ordinance is the only policy of its kind in the US, and as such
      it could serve as an important model policy for other local governments if it is successful.
