      intake, body weight, body composition, activity levels, and metabolic rate. The exercise
      doses will reflect current recommendations for: 1) general health (8 KKW), and 2) weight loss
      (20 KKW). A non-exercise control group will also be recruited. The primary outcome variables
      are: 1) energy intake, and 2) the discrepancy between expected weight loss and observed
      weight loss. Energy intake will be measured using doubly labeled water and laboratory-based
      food intake tests. Secondary outcome variables include resting metabolic rate, activity
      levels (excluding structured exercise), and body composition. Following a comprehensive
      baseline assessment, participants will be randomly assigned to the 8 KKW, 20 KKW, or control
      group in a 1:1:1 ratio. Additional assessments will be conducted at week 4, with another
      comprehensive assessment at week 24. The week 4 assessment is important to determine if
      endpoints change in the short-term, but not long-term.
