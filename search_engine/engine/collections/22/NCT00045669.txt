        -  Determine the antitumor activity of imatinib mesylate, in terms of objective response
           rates (partial and complete responses) and duration of overall response, in patients
           with unresectable and/or metastatic adenoid cystic, lymphoepithelioma-like, or
           myoepithelial salivary gland cancer.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

        -  Correlate the activity of c-kit and downstream kinases in pre- and post-treatment
           tumoral biopsies with clinical course in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the effect of treatment with this drug on tumor samples from these patients in
           terms of proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis.

        -  Correlate the steady state levels of this drug achieved with clinical and laboratory
           correlative endpoints in these patients.

        -  Determine whether early changes in metabolic activity correlate with molecular changes
           and predict outcome to therapy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate twice daily. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease receive
      treatment for up to 6 months.

      Patients are followed within 3 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-19
      months.
