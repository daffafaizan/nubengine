      (treatment group) or standard care alone (control group). To prevent bias, randomization will
      be stratified by recency of symptom onset to ensure that both the treatment and control
      groups are balanced with respect to it. Within each of these 2 strata, permuted-block
      randomization will be done to keep the number of treatment and control patients balanced. Due
      to the necessary monitoring of the patients randomized to receive immunosuppression therapy,
      treatment cannot be blinded. Approximately 1 year after the last patient has been randomized,
      the observed times from randomization to the composite endpoint (death, transplantation, or
      LVD placement) will be compared in the treatment and control groups.
