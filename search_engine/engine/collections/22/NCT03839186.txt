      clinical research, the number of subjects to be enrolled in the study group are 200 cases.
      The basic information of the study was included in the study before the operation. During the
      operation, the investigators need a collection of participants's arterial blood and monitor
      the hemodynamic index and anesthesia depth by bispectral index(BIS) . Further moreï¼Œthe
      investigators will follow up the participants' condition after operation.Dividing the
      patients into different groups according to their clinical features.The relationship between
      vital signs and the depth of anesthesia was analyzed and compared between different
      groups.Blood samples collected during the operation were detected by gene test. Comparing the
      results of genetic testing and clinical data analysis, then the investigators will find the
      differences in the expression of the gene polymorphisms of anesthetic drugs in the
      circulating function.
