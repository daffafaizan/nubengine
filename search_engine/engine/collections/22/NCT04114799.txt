      brain surgery. Adequate perioperative management guided by hemodynamic monitoring can help to
      reduce the risk of complications and thus potentially improve outcomes.

      This study compares fluid management algorithms based either on invasive detection of fluid
      responsiveness using pulse pressure variation (PPV) and systolic pressure variation (SPV)
      values (Aisys GE monitoring system) in group A, or on noninvasive measurement of
      haemodynamics (stroke volume variation (SVV), cardiac index (CI) and systemic vascular
      resistance (SVR) values) (ClearSight, Edwards) in group B.
