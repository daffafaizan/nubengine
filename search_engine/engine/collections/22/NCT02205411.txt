      will be compared to the HeartMate II and HVAD devices.

      Patients that meet the study criteria will be randomized 1:1 to either the HeartAssist 5® VAD
      System (treatment group) or control group (HeartMate II and HVAD). The physician will have
      the option to choose which control device to implant.

      The primary objective of the study is to show non-inferiority of the HeartAssist 5®
      (treatment group) to the control group.
