      with a characteristic radiographic appearance often described as "dripping candle wax". As a
      result of these bony formations, patients report mild-moderate pain that interferes with
      their routine activities. It is usually diagnosed on radiographs but bone biopsy may be
      performed to exclude other osteosclerotic diseases and/or osteosarcoma. Deformities,
      limb-length discrepancy, muscle atrophy, neurological deficit have been reported as
      complications. A subset of patients have somatic mutations in MAP2K1.

      The cause of this disease is not known in all patients, the natural history poorly described
      and there is no clearly-defined systemic therapy. We propose a prospective observational
      study to investigate the natural history and pathogenesis of the disease. Subjects will
      undergo standardized initial evaluation and medically indicated testing. Skin biopsies may be
      performed to test for known mutations related to melorheotosis, and if negative affected bone
      and/or skin may be sent for genetic testing for acquired somatic mutations in genes that
      control bone homeostasis. Enrolled subjects will be followed every two to three years for
      assessment of disease progression and receive testing and treatment. The study of this rare
      bone disease offers the potential to generate new insights, provide answers as well as
      generate new questions into the biology of the skeletal and mineral metabolism.
