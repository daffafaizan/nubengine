      times a week, visit 1 at eight weeks followed by 4 weeks of washout, Visit 2 at 12 weeks
      followed by eight weeks of training three times a week, and a final Visit 3 at 20 weeks.

      At the screening visit, volunteers will be asked to perform tests included in the short
      physical performance battery (SPPB) (gait speed, chair rise, balance). If the participants
      score is ≤ 9 or ≤ 2 in any of the three tests included in the SPPB they will be eligible for
      the intervention phase. At the baseline visit several questionnaires will be obtained and
      participants then will proceed with muscle function tests (SPPB, jumping mechanography, grip
      strength, timed-up-and-go test).

      Participants will then be randomized into one of two groups. The first group will receive
      vibration + loading treatment for the first 8 weeks, the second group will receive sham
      treatment (loading only). After 8 weeks both groups will go through a 4 week wash-out period
      and then crossover will occur. The first group will now receive sham treatment (loading only)
      while the second group will receive vibration + loading treatment. The participants will
      train for 10 minutes, 3 times a week, during the active 16 total weeks.
