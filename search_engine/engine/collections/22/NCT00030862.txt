        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with previously untreated
           locally advanced unresectable or metastatic esophageal cancer treated with irinotecan
           and cisplatin.

        -  Determine the dysphagia relief in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours and irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and
      8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
