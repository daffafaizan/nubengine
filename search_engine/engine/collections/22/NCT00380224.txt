    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study of bifeprunox in the
      treatment of outpatients with schizophrenia, with olanzapine as the active comparator.
      Subjects must be stable for 3 months or more of treatment with olanzapine at baseline. There
      will be 2 treatment arms in this study, approximately 60 subjects per arm. After
      randomization and blinding, each subject will either remain on olanzapine or switch to
      bifeprunox. Assessments, including body weight and waist measurements, will be made at each
      study visit.Subjects will participate in the study for approximately 11 weeks. After a
      screening period of 6 to 14 days, eligible subjects will be treated for 8 weeks. Subjects who
      do not enter the long-term extension will return for a follow-up visit 7 days after
      discontinuing the use of test article. Subjects who do enter the long-term extension will
      have a 7-day taper/titration period after the 8 weeks of double-blind treatment.
