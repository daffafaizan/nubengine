    
      This study is intended to confirm the accuracy of the SHERLOCK 3CGâ„¢ Diamond TCS with the
      addition of MODUS II (SLM2) software to eliminate the need for post-procedural chest x-ray
      (CXR) in adult subjects with cardiac abnormalities that alter presentation of the P-wave.
      Atrial fibrillation will be the primary target while data on pacemaker driven rhythms and
      other arrhythmia types will also be collected to explore overall performance.
