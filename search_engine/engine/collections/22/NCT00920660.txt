    
      This is a prospective, single center, non-therapeutic clinical study of SRT2104 administered
      orally as 250 mg capsules. Randomized, double-blind study to evaluate and compare the
      sensitivity of systemic biomarkers, such as ex-vivo LPS-induced TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, and
      IL-1beta, to treatment with four-single oral doses of SRT2104 (250 mg, 500 mg, 1000 mg, and
      2000 mg), prednisolone (30 mg), and placebo in healthy adult volunteers. Twenty (20) subjects
      (males and females of non-childbearing potential) aged 18-60, who fulfill the
      inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be enrolled in this study to achieve a minimum of 15
      evaluable subjects. Each subject will participate in 6 treatment periods. For each treatment
      period subjects will fast for at least 10 hours overnight. After pre-dosing procedures,
      subjects will consume a standard, non-high-fat (approximately 650 kcal with approximately 30%
      of calories derived from fat) meal 15-30 minutes prior to receiving test material. During the
      first five treatment periods, subjects will receive a single dose of SRT2104 or matched
      placebo; during the last treatment period, subjects will receive 30 mg open-label
      prednisolone. Assessments will be performed until 24 hours post dose in each treatment
      period.

      Subjects will be asked to sign the informed consent form(s) at the screening visit. If
      eligible and willing to participate, subjects will enter into the study. Subjects will be
      required to attend the research unit in a fasted state (at least 10 hours without food) on
      six separate occasions (treatment visits) during the study. There will be at least a 7-day
      washout period between treatment visits.

      During the first five treatment visits, subjects will receive one of the following five
      treatments:

      A. 250 mg SRT2104 administered as eight oral capsules (one active SRT2104 250 mg capsule +
      seven placebo capsules) B. 500 mg SRT2104 administered as eight oral capsules (two active
      SRT2104 250 mg capsules + six placebo capsules) C. 1000 mg SRT2104 administered as eight oral
      capsules (four active SRT2104 250 mg capsules + four placebo capsules) D. 2000 mg SRT2104
      administered as eight oral capsules (eight active SRT2104 250 mg capsules + zero placebo
      capsules) E. Eight placebo capsules

      During the last treatment visit, subjects will receive 30 mg of open-label prednisolone
      tablets.

      Subjects will be required to return to the research unit 24 hours after dosing in each
      treatment period in order to gather the required PK and PD samples. Subjects will be asked to
      return to the study center for an End of Study safety assessment 7 to 10 days after the last
      treatment visit.
