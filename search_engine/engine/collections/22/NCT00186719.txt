      uncertain. Recently there has been description of specific changes (that is reduction) in the
      number and activity of certain key immune cell types - dendritic cells- as a result of
      cigarette smoke exposure. This work was done in animal models and we would like to develop
      methods that will allow us to examine if similar changes occur in humans who smoke. Reduced
      number and activity of dendritic cells would be expected to lead to increased incidence of
      infection - a common problem in patients with COPD.

      Since dendritic cells come to the lung from the bloodstream, and one can detect them in the
      circulation, we will look at the dendritic cells that are present in the peripheral blood.
