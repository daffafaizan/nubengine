      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with grafts from an HLA-mismatched
      family donor. Antithymocyteglobulin (ATG) has been widely used to prevent acute GVHD (aGVHD)
      in haploidentical HSCT. Notwithstanding, immunosuppressive effect of ATG, which may also
      increase the risk of opportunistic infections, necessitates the use of the lowest possible
      dose. Till now, the optimal dose of ATG is not known. Here, the investigators compared the
      outcome of patients receiving haploidentical HSCT treated with two different doses of ATG.
