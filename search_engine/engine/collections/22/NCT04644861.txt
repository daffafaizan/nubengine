      our country. These patients are at risk of sarcopenia which can lead to an increasing risk of
      falls and hospitalization, loss of autonomy, and morbi-mortality. Twelve weeks adapted
      physical activity program can manage sarcopenia in elders. One of the difficulties to propose
      such a program to elders patients is the difficulty to reach the program center due to
      mobility deficiency. Our hypothesis is that proposing an adapted physical activity in a
      primary health care center, in the city of the patient, could help the participation.

      Eligible patients addressed by their general practitioner will perform 4 months adapted
      physical activity program in the CAPA-CITY center (MSPU La Providence).

      The inclusion will be realized by the sports doctor of CAPA-CITY. At M2, sport doctor and
      adapted physical activity teacher will meet the patient to readapt the program taking in
      count his particularity and wishes.

      At M4 M6 and M12, an independent global evaluation will be realized by training nurse and
      clinical research associate.
