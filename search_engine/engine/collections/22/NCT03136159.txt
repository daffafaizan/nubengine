      effects of an adherent soft silicone anti-microbial occlusive foam silver-impregnated
      dressing in preventing surgical site infection (SSI) in women delivered by primary cesarean
      section (CS). We sought to determine if the incidence of SSIs, would be lower in patients who
      received a silver-impregnated dressing as compared to those who received a standard dressing,
      when used as part of the overall hospital protocol for reducing SSIs. Given the addition of
      adjunctive azithromycin antibiotic prophylaxis for those who labored or had rupture of
      membranes prior to undergoing a non-elective CS right at the time of initiation of the study
      to our institution perioperative bundle, we also elected to undertake further analyses of
      observational data on those with the same study inclusion criteria receiving standard
      dressing undergoing primary CS with subcuticular skin closure during the same time period,
      rather than limiting comparisons of our outcomes solely to our historical SSI rates. In order
      to have this comparison group, patients who declined participation in the experimental groups
      were selected as our non-randomized control group, given fiscal restraints precluded
      conducting a randomized clinical trial (RCT). Demographic, labor, delivery, intraoperative
      and postoperative characteristic data were collected in a de-identified fashion. Medical
      record review and data entry were conducted by trained research personnel. All study
      procedures were approved by the Investigational Review Board.
