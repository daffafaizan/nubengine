      life. Treatment options for MS fatigue include central nervous system stimulants and
      amantadine. These medications are of limited efficacy, are often poorly tolerated, and can be
      expensive. Ginseng may represent a novel approach to treating MS fatigue. Ginseng has been
      tested in clinical trials for its ability to improve mental alertness and fatigue. However,
      there have been no published clinical trials addressing the effects of ginseng in subjects
      with MS, even though many people with MS use ginseng and report deriving benefit from it.

      This double-blinded, placebo controlled crossover pilot study will determine the safety and
      tolerability of ginseng in subjects with MS and will gather preliminary data on the efficacy
      of ginseng vs. placebo for the treatment of MS fatigue. Additionally, the project will
      collect information on the impact of ginseng on cognition, stress, actigraphy, salivary
      cortisol, differential cytokine response, and quality of life.
