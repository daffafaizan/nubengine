      euploid blastocysts is routinely performed.

      This is a single centre retrospective study in patients undergoing a PGS cycle. The aim of
      the study is to assess the results obtained in a PGS programme after the implementation of a
      new biopsy timing and transfer policy. Results obtained in PGS cycles with blastocyst biopsy
      and frozen-thawed embryo transfer were analysed in comparison to cycles with cleavage stage
      biopsy and fresh blastocyst transfer.
