    
      The study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of doses escalated by
      cohort. Volunteers will be randomized to receive active study drug or placebo twice daily
      (BID) for 14 days. This study will be staggered in timing with the single rising dose study
      (Protocol AUS-CT01) being conducted concurrently, such that the lowest dose cohort of this
      multiple rising dose study may begin after evaluation of safety and pharmacokinetic data from
      the first 8 subjects randomized to the 10 mg dose cohort of the single rising dose study and
      safety data from the 8 Subjects randomized in the 20 mg dose cohort of that study.
