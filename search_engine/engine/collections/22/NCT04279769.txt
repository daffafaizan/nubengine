    
      Study CX-280-202 is a Phase 1b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple
      ascending dose escalation study of CB-280 in adult subjects with cystic fibrosis and chronic
      infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and biological activity of CB-280 in approximately 32 adult patients with
      cystic fibrosis. There are four planned sequential dose escalation cohorts of 8 subjects
      each, randomized 6:2 to receive CB-280 or matched placebo at doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg,
      or 400 mg administered twice daily for 14 days. Intermediate dose levels may be evaluated
      based on emerging safety data at the planned dose levels.
