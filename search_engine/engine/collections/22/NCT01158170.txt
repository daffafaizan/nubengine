      Primary

      Determine the effectiveness of prophylactic cranial radiotherapy in patients with advanced
      non-small cell lung cancer that is responsive to gefitinib or erlotinib hydrochloride.

      Secondary

      Determine the progression-free survival in patients treated with this regimen. Determine the
      overall survival in patients treated with this regimen. Determine the safety and tolerability
      of this regimen in these patients. Determine the psycho-neurological effects of this regimen
      in these patients. Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients with good response( CR/PR) to
      EGFR-TKI(Erlotinib or Gefitinib) are randomized to receive EGFR-TKI plus PCI or EGFR-TKI
      alone,stratified according to prior chemotherapy regimens (first line vs second line), and
      disease response status.

      Group 1: Patients undergo prophylactic brain radiotherapy. Group 2: Patients undergo
      observation. Patients complete quality of life questionnaires periodically.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.
