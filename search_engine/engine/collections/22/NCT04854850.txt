      currently a medical device.

      The device offers a convenient novel non-invasive, non-habit-forming solution to improve
      performance and recovery under stress in children and adults by delivering gentle wave-like
      vibrations to the body that improve autonomic nervous system balance in real time (Siegle &
      Rabin et al., under review). Apollo vibrations activate touch receptors in the skin and are
      perceived as safety signals by the brain resulting in decreased stress, improved recovery,
      focus, and energy.

      A total of 30-40 patients will be enrolled and followed for 1 month, with baseline data
      collected before using Apollo and follow-up data collected after using the device. This
      clinical trial is open-label, meaning that all participants will receive Apollos and no
      placebos will be used. All participants will be allowed to continue underlying
      immunosuppressive and Raynaud therapy at stable doses during the trial. Since this is a pilot
      study, future larger controlled trials will be necessary to clearly demonstrate drug
      effectiveness.
