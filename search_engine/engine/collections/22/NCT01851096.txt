      mutant EGFR, and are also hypothesized to help maintain the malignant phenotype of mutant
      EGFR in lung adenocarcinoma. Treatment of EGFR mutant cell lines with the Hsp90 inhibitor
      geldanamycin results in cellular degradation, decreased levels of pAKT/cyclin D1, and
      increased apoptosis. Furthermore, Hsp90 inhibitors hamper growth of tumors in nude mice with
      gefitinib-resistant H1975-xenografts in vivo.

      Clinical data showed that mono-therapy with some Hsp90 inhibitors provides stable disease and
      some patients have partial remissions as best responses in heavily pre-treated non small cell
      lung cancer patients.

      SNX-5422 is a pro-drug of SNX-2112, a potent, highly selective, small-molecule inhibitor of
      the molecular chaperone Hsp90. Inhibitors of the chaperone protein Hsp90 are of current
      interest because of the central role that Hsp90 plays in the maturation and maintenance of
      numerous proteins, for example HER2 and mutated EGFR, that are critical for tumor cell
      viability and growth.
