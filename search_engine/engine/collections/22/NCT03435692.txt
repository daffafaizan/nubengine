      hip subluxation requiring surgical intervention. Pain after major hip surgery in children is
      severe, yet there is no agreement on the most effective method for pain control.
      Post-operative pain modalities including lumbar epidural catheters (LEC), lumbar plexus
      catheters (LPC) and intravenous patient controlled analgesia (IV-PCA) have been described.
      IV-PCA has historically been the standard of care in spite of its numerous associated side
      effects. Regional anesthesia modalities have gained popularity because of superior pain
      control with lower opioid requirements.

      In this study, the investigators describe the first prospective randomized controlled trial
      comparing lumbar plexus catheter to alternatives for post-operative pain management in
      children after major hip surgery. The investigators hypothesized that LPC would be as safe
      and efficacious as LEC and IV-PCA with the added advantage of a decreased length of stay. The
      investigators primary aim was to compare hospital length of stay. Secondary aim was to
      compare pain scores, opioid consumption and opioid-related side effects.
