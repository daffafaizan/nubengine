      involvement of multiple organs including the brain, lung, spleen, and kidney. This results in
      multiple clinical complications, including ischemic stroke, pulmonary hypertension,
      autosplenectomy, as well as albuminuria and chronic renal disease. Several recent studies
      have confirmed the association of both albuminuria and renal dysfunction with
      echocardiographically-defined pulmonary hypertension and other vasculopathic complications in
      SCD, suggesting that they may share a similar pathophysiology. Despite the high prevalence of
      albuminuria in patients with SCD and the known association of renal failure with increased
      mortality, the pathophysiology and treatment of albuminuria in this setting remain poorly
      defined.

      The treatment options for nephropathy in SCD are limited. Although Angiotensin converting
      enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are the "standard of care" in the treatment of patients with
      proteinuria, there are to date no controlled, long-term studies confirming their efficacy and
      safety in this setting.

      In this study, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin in SCD
      patients. At the completion of this trial, the investigators will have an improved
      understanding of the contribution of endothelial dysfunction to the pathophysiology of
      albuminuria in SCD. If the data support the hypothesis that atorvastatin is safe and
      effective in this population, the investigators plan on carrying out adequately powered
      studies to more definitively evaluate its safety and efficacy in the treatment and/or
      prevention of albuminuria in SCD.
