    
      The ADRIE study is an observational study on the clinical relevance of platelet reactivity in
      aspirin and clopidogrel treated cardiovascular patients.

      Main objective:

        -  to determine if platelet reactivity, assessed by specific and non-specific tests, is
           predictive of ischemic events during the 3-year follow-up.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  primary outcome in each pre-specified sub-group : patients with coronary artery disease,
           ischemic stroke or peripheral arterial disease as main qualifying disease at entry,

        -  to determine if platelet reactivity, assessed by specific and non-specific tests, is
           predictive of bleeding events during the 3-year follow-up,

        -  to investigate potential determinants of platelet reactivity at entry in the study
