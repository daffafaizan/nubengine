      undergo an MRI session that will last approximately 2 hours. The structural MRI will be used
      when the participant is at rest. During the functional MRI (fMRI), a computer screen inside
      the scanner will display four tasks the participant must complete: (1)Gambling Task, (2)Risk
      & Ambiguity Task, (3)Reading Emotion from the Eyes (REE) Task, and (4)Emotional Counting
      Task.
