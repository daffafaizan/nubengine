      the safety lead-in portion of this trial we will define the optimal dose of cabazitaxel when
      given in combination with lapatinib for patients with HER2-positive MBC and CNS metastases.
      The Phase II portion will further assess intracranial response rate in patients with
      HER2-positive MBC and CNS metastases. Toxicity and progression free survival (PFS) will be
      obtained and evaluated. The trial will be conducted at multiple study sites by SCRI
      Development Innovations.
