      company. The arms include two control groups (one from each company), two intervention groups
      using a standard health promotion intervention, and two intervention groups that constitute
      using an activated consumer intervention. The standard intervention includes educational
      offerings to address health behaviors. The activated consumer intervention offers shorter
      education sessions and includes decision tools and skills development for working with heath
      care providers to better manage health and clinical conditions. Variables include health risk
      assessments, clinical measures such as lipids, blood pressure, body mass index, and tobacco
      use, perception of health care consumer practices, claims costs, and absenteeism analysis.
