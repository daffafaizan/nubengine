      their insurance through employment at Geisinger with reduced health insurance premiums over
      the course of the following year, if members register for the program and have their health
      measures on file by the enrollment deadline and are then able to meet their health goals by
      the respective due date. In spite of the potential savings to health plan members and the
      wellness program's potential to motivate engagement in healthy activities (with consequent
      improvement in health outcomes), about 23% of eligible existing GHP members did not enroll
      during the primary 2019 enrollment period, even after receiving promotional email
      communications and reminders. Therefore, the current study was developed to test whether a
      revised version of a standard welcome email is more effective than the standard email in
      increasing myHealth Rewards login and enrollment rates. The standard welcome email is what
      would typically be sent by GHP to encourage enrollment among new hires; it mentions the
      benefits of enrollment (maintaining good health and saving money on insurance premiums), the
      average premium savings, the ease of the registration process, and the deadline for
      registering and having health measures on file, plus it provides registration steps and
      hyperlinks for registering and finding free health screenings where health measures can be
      collected and registered at one convenient time and location. The loss frame email recommends
      that GHP members not "throw away" a precise monetary amount in savings by not participating
      and that they can therefore avoid missing out on substantial gains (i.e., savings) by taking
      action. It is hypothesized that, on average, the loss frame email will increase enrollment
      compared with the standard email, among this population of new hires for whom this is only
      the second time that they have been informed about myHealth Rewards. Findings will help
      inform how best to increase enrollment in a wellness program among health plan members who
      are new to the system.
