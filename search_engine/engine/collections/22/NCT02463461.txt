      documented. It has been proposed that adequate sleep, as well as good sleep quality, is vital
      for wellbeing. (1). Some have suggested that sleep curtailment has paralleled the increased
      prevalence of cardiometabolic disease including obesity (2), type 2 diabetes mellitus (3, 4),
      hypertension (5, 6) and more. Sleep researchers face a major challenge since there are
      multiple methods for sleep assessment, all of which have advantages and disadvantages.Whilst
      polysomnography (PSG) is considered to be the gold standard for sleep assessment, there are
      some limitations including laboratory attendance for the participant and sleep scoring
      variance. Sleep questionnaires are widely utilized, particularly in large epidemiological
      studies, but are susceptible to inaccuracies and some have not been validated against PSG.
      Wrist actigraphy has provided researchers with an attractive equivalent and there are now
      multiple commercial manufacturers available. Actigraphic devices are usually worn on the
      non-dominant wrist and the instrument is used to monitor wrist movements through the use of
      an accelerometer and a memory chip. Wrist actigraphy is useful in the detection of sleep,
      wake, and activity.
