      serious clinical challenge to surgeons and other treating physicians. These infections
      frequently involve implanted foreign materials (stabilizing orthopaedic hardware), making
      infection of these sites much more likely than if foreign materials were not involved.
      MBN-101 has broad spectrum antimicrobial activity against orthopaedic wound pathogens.

      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center study to assess the
      safety and tolerability of escalating doses of MBN-101 to treat orthopaedic infections during
      revision surgery, (a) with or without orthopaedic hardware, and (b) with or without removal
      and replacement of orthopaedic hardware.
