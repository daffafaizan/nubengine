      â‰¥10% of persons 70 years of age or older. There is a growing body of evidence that dyspnea in
      patients with heart failure is not only related to low cardiac output and pulmonary venous
      congestion, but also to functional and structural alterations of the lungs.Pulmonary
      hypertension is a well-known complication of heart failure, but recent evidence suggests that
      the alveolo-capillary membrane is also affected, at least in subgroups of patients with heart
      failure.

      Damage to the alveolo-capillary membrane is reflected by a low diffusion capacity of the
      lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO).

      In this study we aim to describe the alteration of lung function and obtain morphometric data
      of the capillary bed of patients with heart failure.
