    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the clinical benefit rate (confirmed complete or partial response or stable
      disease for 4 or more cycles) of ponatinib (ponatinib hydrochloride) in fibroblast growth
      factor receptor (FGFR) aberrant advanced biliary cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate progression free survival, overall survival, and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA19-9)
      response rate of these patients.

      II. To estimate the adverse event profile of ponatinib.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Establish preliminary correlations between FGFR2 fusions and evidence of any clinical
      benefit.

      II. Assess preliminary evaluation of FGFR2 pathway perturbation with ponatinib. III. To
      describe patient-reported health-related quality of life and symptoms.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ponatinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for at least 2
      years.
