      high risk by USPSTF criteria vs universal receipt.

      Hypothesis: Women considered high risk by USPSTF criteria will have better adherence to low
      dose aspirin than women randomized to universal receipt.

      Study Design: Randomized trial

      Population: English or Spanish speaking women between 10-20 weeks of gestation receiving
      their care at Women & Infants Hospital, with a plan to deliver at Women & Infants Hospital

      Once enrolled, patients will then be randomized to USPSTF criteria to determine if they
      qualify for aspirin or to universal aspirin receipt. Once randomized, patients will undergo
      video pill counts at multiple intervals in their prenatal care (monthly).
