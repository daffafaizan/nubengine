      instructional set regarding effects of a DN technique on pain perception. This instructional
      set will be randomly allocated to each patient.

      Participants in the positive expectation group will be told that DN procedure: "is a very
      effective form of treatment used to treat neck-shoulder pain and it is expected to reduce
      your perception of pressure pain". Participants in the neutral expectation group will be told
      that DN procedure: "is a form of treatment used to treat neck-shoulder pain that has unknown
      effects on your perception of pressure pain".

      DN intervention An experienced and trained physical therapist will provide DN to all the
      subjects. This researcher will be blinded to the specific expectation instructional set the
      participant receives. Participants will receive one session of DN treatment for the active
      Myofascial Trigger Points(MTrP) located at the upper trapezius muscle. They will be placed in
      a prone position on the examination table. Solid filament needles of 0.30 mm diameter and 40
      mm length will be used. The needle will be inserted into the skin over the palpated MTrP
      using pincer palpation, and slowly advanced perpendicularly until it reaches the MTrP and a
      twitch response is elicited.
