      I. To determine the toxicity and feasibility of photodynamic therapy using pulsed laser
      therapy and oral aminolevulinic acid in treating patients with oral leukoplakia.

      II. To define the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of photodynamic therapy
      using pulsed laser therapy and oral aminolevulinic acid in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of photodynamic therapy using pulsed dye laser and oral
      aminolevulinic acid by examining clinical response at 1 and 3 months.

      II. To determine quantitative histologic response at 3 months. III. To explore the
      association of response with specific molecular and biologic markers (i.e., DNA ploidy,
      proliferation using Ki-67, apoptosis using TUNEL, cyclin D1, and p53).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of long pulsed dye laser light.

      Patients receive aminolevulinic acid* orally (PO) 3-4 hours before undergoing photodynamic
      therapy using pulsed dye laser on day 1.

      (Note: *Patients in cohort 1 and a latter cohort [to be determined during the course of the
      study] do not receive aminolevulinic acid before photodynamic therapy.)

      Patients undergo biopsies of target lesions and clinically uninvolved mucosa 4-8 weeks before
      beginning therapy and then at 3 months for biomarker studies (DNA ploidy, p53, Ki-67, cyclin
      D1, and TUNEL assay). Blood is collected on days 1, 2, 14, 28, and 84 for toxicity
      assessment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 84 days.
