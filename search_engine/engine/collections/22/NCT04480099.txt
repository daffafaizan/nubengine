    
      Peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL）is a distinct and heterogeneous histopathologic subtype of
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), accounting for ~10%. Patients with PTCL still have poor treatment
      response and prognosis under conventional CHOP regimen. There is no standard of care for
      those patients. Targeted drugs are warranted in this group of patients to improve survival.
      This prospective，multi-center，open-label, controlled study will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of targeted drug in combination with CHOP in treatment of newly diagnosed peripheral
      T-cell lymphoma.
