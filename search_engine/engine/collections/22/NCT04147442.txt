      especially in noise. Besides speech difficulty, people with hearing loss also report a
      reduced enjoyment of music. The hearing aid settings used for amplifying speech often have
      adverse effects on music.

      For this study, the sponsor will carry out testing with participants with hearing loss to
      compare dedicated music programs. The current study will compare the standard music program
      available in the software to one that is fine-tuned for each subject. The hearing aids that
      will be used for the study are certified by the European Conformity and have been on the
      market for almost one year. The goal is to determine whether musicians will perceive a
      difference and prefer a fine-tuned music program over the default music program in real-life
      situations.
