      world, including parts of the Americas, Asia, and Africa. In recent years there has been a
      rapid spread of drug resistant malaria which makes it necessary to develop new antimalarial
      treatments. In animal studies, GSK932121 is shown to be able to kill the malaria parasite and
      is fully active against drug resistant malaria parasites. It is hoped that information
      collected on this study will lead to an improved treatment for malaria.

      This is a first time in human fusion study which has 3 parts:

      Part A - single dose escalation/ food effect: a study where the study drug is given once
      only- first at the lowest dose of in a group of participants and the dose increased only if
      the previous dose is found to be safe. It also looks at the effect of food on the study drug
      in the body Part B - repeat dose escalation: a study where the study drug will be given daily
      for up to 7 days - first at a lower dose in a group of participants and the dose increased
      for the next group only if the previous dose is found to be safe and Part B - drug-drug
      interaction: a study where the study drug will be given daily for up to 7 days at a dose
      determined to be safe in previous groups of participants and looking at the effect of the
      study drug on other specific approved medications (such as rosiglitazone--a diabetic
      medication and rosuvastatin--a cholesterol lowering medication) in the body.

      Safety will be assessed by measurement of vital signs, cardiac monitoring, spirometry,
      collection of adverse event assessments, renal biomarkers and laboratory safety tests.
