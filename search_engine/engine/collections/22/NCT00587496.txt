      of ocular herpetic keratitis by about 40-50 %8, and treatment with valacyclovir, a more
      soluble prodrug of acyclovir, reduced the risk of transmission of genital herpes9, 10, 11.
      For this study, we will use the dose of valacyclovir that was shown effective in reducing the
      risk of transmission of HSV-2.9 The dose of 325 mg aspirin three times a day was chosen based
      on our experience with mice and other laboratory animals12. If it is effective and well
      tolerated at this dose, in future studies we will attempt to use lower doses and determine if
      they too may be effective.
