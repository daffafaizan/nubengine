    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of polysaccharide-K (PSK) when given with HER2-directed
      immunotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effect of PSK on natural killer (NK) cell functional activity when given
      with HER2-directed immunotherapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the effect of PSK when given with HER2-directed immunotherapy on: serum
      levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine and/or chemokines; intermolecular epitope spreading;
      serum transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta levels; progression free survival (PFS) and
      overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine intradermally (ID) once monthly for 3
      months, trastuzumab (or trastuzumab and pertuzumab) per standard of care, and placebo orally
      (PO) twice daily (BID) for 4 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive HER2 ICD peptide-based vaccine ID and trastuzumab (or trastuzumab
      and pertuzumab) as in Arm I and polysaccharide-K PO BID for 4 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 9 months and then twice
      annually for 3 years.
