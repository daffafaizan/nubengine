      has shown the rate of patency as 95.7% at 1 year and 88.6% at 4 years. Pooled analysis has
      shown a 4.5% rate of renal artery occlusion during 12 month follow up with 2.3% going on to
      dialysis and 1.4% requiring permanent dialysis. 1.8% of patients can go on to have mesenteric
      stenosis though these have been due to technical issues with the stents.

      Studies have previously shown that the patency of vascular grafts can be improved by bonding
      heparin bonding to the surface of a graft material. For example in surgical bypass a Dacron
      graft bonded with heparin outperformed a conventional PTFE graft in terms of patency and
      clinical outcomes. Endovascular stent grafting with heparin bonded PTFE has also been shown
      to be superior to PTFE alone with a primary patency of 86.4% vs 79.9% in femoropopliteal
      disease. A recent trial has demonstrated impressive patency of 73% in long segment
      femoropopliteal disease (TASC C and D lesions) using a self expanding version of the heparin
      bonded, covered, Viabahn stent graft. Heparin bonded stent grafts have shown promise in
      preserving patency of other vessels. A pilot study demonstrating the safety of using the
      Viabahn Bx in FEVAR will support the rationale for larger studies of this question including
      randomization between conventional and heparin bonded stent grafts.
