    
      MPS II is a rare X-linked recessive genetic disease caused by mutations in the
      iduronate-2-sulfatase (IDS) gene. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with recombinant
      idursulfase (ELAPRASE®) is the only approved product for the treatment of Hunter syndrome;
      however, ERT as currently administered does not cross the blood brain barrier and is
      therefore unable to address the unmet need in MPS II patients with CNS (neurocognition and
      behavior) involvement. RGX-121 is designed to deliver a healthy gene to cells in the CNS and
      iduronate-2-sulfatase (I2S) may then be secreted by transduced cells which may cross-correct
      non-transduced cells by taking up the functional enzyme. This is a Phase I/II, multicenter,
      open-label, single arm study of RGX-121. Approximately 6 children (≥ 5 years to < 18 years of
      age) who have severe (neuronopathic) MPS II could be enrolled into a single dose cohort and
      will receive a single dose of RGX-121 administered by IC or ICV injection. Safety will be the
      primary focus for the initial 24 weeks after treatment (primary study period). Following
      completion of the primary study period, participants will continue to be assessed (safety and
      efficacy) for up to a total of 104 weeks following treatment with RGX-121.
