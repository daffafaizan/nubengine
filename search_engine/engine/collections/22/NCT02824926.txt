      either with single or multiple Tinea Pedis lesion(s). Sixty (60) patients will be enrolled,
      but each foot with lesion(s) will be considered as one (1) sample. Therefore, if a patient
      has bilateral lesions, one foot will be allocated to investigational product (Dapaconazole)
      and the other foot will be allocated to active control (Ketoconazole). Randomization will
      determine which foot (right or left) will be treated with Dapaconazole or Ketoconazole.
