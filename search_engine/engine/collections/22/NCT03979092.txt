      objective measure are used. Principal Investigator or trained part-time undergraduate student
      research assistants will recruit nursing students in scheduled identical sessions. Informed
      consent will be obtained after an explanation of the nature, purpose, and potential risks of
      the study according to the information sheet.

      Pre-test was conducted before starting the IP-ACLS training on Day 1; post-test 1 was
      conducted immediately after the IP-ACLS training on Day 2; post-test 2 was conducted 1 month
      after the IP-ACLS training before or after their scheduled lecture break. The students were
      asked to complete the self-report questionnaire in approximately 10-15 min before and after
      2-day IP-ACLS workshop and 1 month follow-up.

      Assessment of Interprofessional Team Collaboration Scale (AITCS), General Self-Efficacy Scale
      (GSE) and Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ) were used to measure collaborative skill,
      self-efficacy and emotion regulation using self-administration.

      The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to check whether the scores followed normal
      distributions. Independent sample t test was used for normally distributed data, whereas
      Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-normally distributed data to compare the AITCS, GSE and
      ERQ scores in two groups.
