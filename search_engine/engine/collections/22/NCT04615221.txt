      different approaches, including transcriptomics on a prospective cohort of patients with
      different types of samples: blood, smear and biopsy. A microbiota study will also be carried
      out. 3 groups will be studied: 1 group of 10 patients benefiting or having benefited from a
      uterine transplant, 1 second group made up of their 10 donors, 1 group of 10 control women
