    
      A closeness-of-fit algorithm utilizing vector transformations of astigmatism is designed and
      applied to 50-years of clinical international refractive experience.

      As a part of new and follow up comprehensive eye examinations, patients and parents consented
      to confirm the cycloplegic refraction to other portable refractive tools.

      The ability of photoscreeners "2WIN" ("Adaptica," Padova italy), "PlusoptiX A12" (Nuremberg,
      Germany) and "Retinomax" (Righton, Tokyo, Japan) to match actual refraction is assessed
      utilizing the new algorithm.

      This algorithm could then be applied to batches of donated spectacles distend by charitable
      organizations worldwide if portable auto refracting devices are employed.
