      I. To estimate the progression-free survival hazard ratio of the combination of weekly
      paclitaxel with Reolysin (wild-type reovirus) to weekly paclitaxel alone in patients with
      persistent or recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

      II. To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events associated with treatment with
      weekly paclitaxel alone and weekly paclitaxel with REOLYSIN as assessed by Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with
      weekly paclitaxel alone and weekly paclitaxel with REOLYSIN.

      II. To estimate (and compare) the proportion of patients who respond to the regimen on each
      arm of the study (according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 with
      measurable patients and by cancer antigen [CA]-125 for those patients with detectable disease
      only).

      III. To characterize and compare progression-free survival and overall survival in patients
      with measurable disease (RECIST 1.1 criteria) and patients with detectable (non-measurable)
      disease.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15.

      ARM II: Patients receive paclitaxel as in arm I and wild-type reovirus IV over 1 hour on days
      1-5.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
