      approximately every 13 weeks. Subjects will undergo safety assessments at these visits, which
      may include a physical exam, ECG, vital signs, and clinical labs. Adverse events and
      concomitant medications will be recorded. Medication compliance will be monitored and the
      subjects will be given additional study drug as appropriate.
