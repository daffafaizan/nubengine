      prospective, population-based cohort study of risk factors for cardiovascular diseases, other
      chronic diseases and metabolic conditions in a sample of men from eastern Finland. The
      baseline examinations were carried out between 1984 and 1989, when 2,682 men (82.9% of those
      eligible) who were 42, 48, 54 or 60 years old were recruited. The first cohort consisted of
      1166 men who were 54 years old, enrolled in 1984-1986, and the second cohort included 1516
      men who were 42, 48, 54 or 60 years old, enrolled in 1986-1989. The baseline examinations
      were followed by the 4-year examinations (1991-1993), in which 1038 men from the second
      cohort (88% of the eligible) participated. At the 11-year examinations (1998-2001), all men
      from the second cohort were invited and 854 men (95% of the eligible) participated. These
      examinations were also the baseline for 920 postmenopausal women (78.4% of the 1173 eligible
      women) from the same area, aged 53-73 years. During the 20-year examination round, all men
      from the first and second baseline cohorts and all women were invited to the study site, and
      a total of 1241 men (80% of the eligible) and 634 women (81.0%) participated.

      ASSESSMENT OF DIETARY INTAKES Food consumption has been assessed with an instructed food
      recording of four days, one of which was a weekend day, by household measures. A picture book
      of common foods and dishes was used to help in estimation of portion sizes. For each food
      item the participant could choose from 3-5 commonly used portion sizes or describe the
      portion size in relation to those in the book. In order to further improve accuracy,
      instructions were given and completed food records were checked by a nutritionist together
      with a participant. Nutrient intakes were estimated using the NUTRICAÂ® 2.5 software (Social
      Insurance Institution, Turku, Finland). The databank of the software is mainly based on
      Finnish values of nutrient composition of foods.

      OUTCOME ASSESSMENT Registration of the incidence of major chronic diseases and deaths during
      the follow up is based on the national registries (Hospital discharge registry, Cause of
      death register, Social Insurance Institution of Finland register for reimbursement of
      medicine expenses) by use of the Finnish personal identification code (social security
      number), and/or on findings at the re-examination rounds (such as fasting plasma glucose or
      2-h oral glucose tolerance test to define type 2 diabetes in addition to data from the
      national registries).
