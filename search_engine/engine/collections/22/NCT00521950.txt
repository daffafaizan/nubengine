      induction of remission and long term treatment of (ulcerative) colitis and Crohn's disease
      when treatment with 5-aminosalicylates and corticosteroids fails. ADRs to immunosuppressive
      treatment, including myelosuppression and hepatotoxicity, are frequently (15-30%) observed.
      Genetic variation in the TPMT gene results in 10-11% of the general population in reduced and
      in 0.3-0.6% to negligible TPMT enzyme activity. In IBD patients, this genetic variation
      predicts 25-40% of the haematological ADRs necessitating tempering of thiopurine dose or
      discontinuation of treatment.

      Pharmacogenetics aims at providing optimized drug treatment to patients by maximizing
      efficacy and minimizing adverse drug reactions (ADRs) based on genetic testing. Despite the
      proven value of pharmacogenetics in clinical practice, its use in medical care is still
      limited.

      The best-established example of a pharmacogenetic test is genotyping of thiopurine
      S-methyltransferase (TPMT) in the treatment of patients with immunosuppressive thiopurines.
      Nonetheless, it is not used on a large scale in clinical practice so far, which might be due
      to: insufficient information transfer from research to clinic; lack of cost-effectiveness
      analyses (CEAs); lack of availability of (or access to) fast and/or cheap genotyping; or lack
      of test reimbursement by health insurance.
