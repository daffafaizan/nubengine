      several years ago, and is claimed to reduce postoperative pain and increase ambulation. With
      this technique, after making the transverse skin incision, the fascia is opened vertically
      and to the left of the linea alba. The left rectus abdominis muscle is then pushed laterally,
      and the abdominal cavity is entered. The uterine incision in performed as usual. Due to the
      reduced incision size, a special spatula is used to facilitate extraction of the fetal head
      in some cases. No urinary catheter is used during or after the operation, and fluid
      administration is restricted during the procedure. The patient is encouraged to get out of
      bed 3-4 hours post surgery. This technique for performing a cesarean section will be compared
      with the traditional (Misgav Ladach technique) in terms of post-operative pain, need for
      analgesics, ambulation, neonatal outcome, and perioperative complications.
