      trial of patients undergoing induction of labor for preeclampsia. Once the decision to induce
      will be taken, the participants will be randomized to receive either intravaginal IMN (40mg)
      or identical appearing placebo placed every 4hrs in the posterior vaginal fornix X 3 doses.
      IMN or placebo will be discontinued when active labor occurs or when the physician decides to
      proceed with augmentation with oxytocin or AROM. Participants will be induced using the
      investigators routine induction agents, Misoprostol (25 mcg every 4 hrs for maximum of 6
      doses) and an intra-cervical foley bulb will be inserted with 2nd dose of IMN or placebo.
      Regarding management of labor, physician decides when to proceed with augmentation with
      oxytocin or AROM.
