        -  Investigate inter-individual variability in the pharmacokinetics of selected anticancer
           drugs in infants and children age < 2 years on current dosing schedules.

        -  Compare drug exposures and degree of pharmacokinetic variability in children < 2 years
           with data obtained from published studies in older children.

        -  Relate inter-individual variability in pharmacokinetics and drug exposure to clinical
           toxicity and response.

        -  Use pharmacokinetic data in conjunction with clinical information obtained following
           treatment to investigate the suitability of current dosing regimens in infants and young
           children.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age in months (0
      to 6 vs 6 to 12 vs 12 to 24).

      Patients receive carboplatin, cyclophosphamide, or etoposide according to the dosing regimen
      detailed in the clinical protocol on which the child is being treated.

      Blood samples are collected from patients receiving 1 of the 3 drugs by central venous
      catheter periodically during treatment to measure pharmacokinetics of the specific drug.
      Additional blood samples are collected for DNA extraction and polymorphism analysis in
      CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and other metabolizing enzymes in addition to the determination of the
      genetic variation in multiple drug resistance.
