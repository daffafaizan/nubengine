      Consent Form (ICF) through the final contact. After a screening phase of 28 days, each
      subject will receive the treatment. Treatment on trial will continue until disease
      progression is confirmed by the investigator/site radiologist, unacceptable adverse event(s),
      intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment, investigator's
      decision to withdraw the subject, subject withdrawals consent, pregnancy of the subject,
      noncompliance with trial treatment or procedures requirements, or administrative reasons.

      The study treatment may be continued after radiological progression of disease at physician
      discretion and if improvement of symptoms or not new symptoms were reported by the patient
      despite the radiological progression of disease.

      Subjects who attain a complete response may consider stopping trial treatment if they meet
      criteria for holding therapy.

      After the end of treatment given the potential risk for delayed immune-related toxicities,
      safety follow-up must be performed up to 90 days after the last dose of avelumab
      administration.

      The extended safety follow-up beyond 30 days after last study drug administration may be
      performed either via a site visit or via a telephone call with subsequent site visit
      requested in case any concerns noted during the telephone call.

      Subjects who discontinue for reasons other than disease progression will have post-treatment
      follow-up every 12 weeks for disease status until disease progression is confirmed by the
      investigator/site radiologist, initiating a non-study cancer treatment, withdrawing consent,
      or becoming lost to follow-up. All subjects will be followed by telephone for overall
      survival every 12 weeks until death, withdrawal of consent, or the end of the trial.
