      types of medical infections (examples include the cold virus and diarrhea). Because zinc has
      been shown to improve the immune system's function, some doctors provide mineral supplements
      such as zinc to their patients in the Intensive Care Unit. However, there are no studies to
      show how effective zinc is or that have evaluated what dose(s) of zinc are safe in patients
      with severe sepsis/septic shock. Nor have studies examined if tolerable doses for septic
      patients can improve how the immune system functions.

      If zinc is shown to improve how the immune system functions during sepsis, it could be used
      in the future as part of the treatment regimen for patients with sepsis.
