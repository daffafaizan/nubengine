      confers high proliferative, vasculogenic and regenerative capacity in vitro and in vivo.
      thereby suggesting that CD133+ cells may induce vasculogenesis, improve limb perfusion,
      prevent tissue loss and restore ambulatory function in patients with critical limb ischemia.
      Although several small, randomized trials have been conducted so far demonstrating safety of
      autologous cells of bone marrow origin for the treatment, the reported benefits were found to
      be variable. A meta-analysis of autologous bone marrow derived cell therapy for critical limb
      ischemia trials suggested that application of autologous stem cell transplantation in curing
      limb ischemic patients does not have obviously effectiveness in the improvement of ankle
      brachial pressure (ABI) of the limb ischemic patients. But it can dramatically reduce the
      rate of amputation.

      Therefore, in the present study, the investigators aim to evaluate the therapeutic potential
      and safety of transarterial infusion of g-csf-mobilized CD 133(+) cells when combined with
      PTA in treatment of below the knee PAD in diabetic patients.
