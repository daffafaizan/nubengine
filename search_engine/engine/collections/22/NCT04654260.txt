    
      This is a randomized controlled study of BTIA versus a supportive therapy control condition
      in 126 adolescents (ages 12 to 18 years) with a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and
      significant levels of disruptive behaviors such as aggression, anger outbursts, and
      oppositional behavior. BTIA consists of 15 ninety-minute weekly sessions that will be
      conducted with the teens and their parents by therapists using a structured, detailed manual.
      The effects of BTIA on the reduction of behavioral problems will be rated by an experienced
      clinician who does not know which treatment each participant is receiving (a "blinded"
      evaluator). Study participants will receive a thorough diagnostic assessment of autism
      spectrum disorder and other forms of psychopathology that may co-occur with ASD. In addition
      to testing the effects of BTIA on disruptive behavior, the changes in adaptive functioning,
      or children's ability to function competently in their everyday environment, will be examined
      before and after treatment.
