      the other with respect to each of the three domains of complications, cost, and
      patient-centered outcomes. The overall goal of the study is to determine which clinically
      relevant factors may impact the choice of LH compared to AH. The results of the study may be
      useful for clinicians, patients, hospital administrators and health policy makers.
