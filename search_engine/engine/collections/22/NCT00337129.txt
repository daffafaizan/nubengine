        -  Evaluate the response probability (confirmed, complete, and partial responses) in
           patients with metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck
           treated with E7389.

        -  Estimate progression-free and overall survival probability in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive E7389 IV on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
