      risk scores (PRS). Broadening the scope of genomic risk testing beyond monogenic diseases,
      PRS combine information from hundreds or even millions of genetic loci, each with a very
      small effect size on the risk of common complex disease. The result is a continuous
      quantitative risk factor for susceptibility to conditions such as coronary artery disease
      (CAD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and breast cancer. Compared to rarer monogenic disease
      variants, PRS have greater transformative potential for public health and healthcare in their
      ability to identify much larger proportions of the population at significantly elevated risk
      for disease, facilitating evidence-based prevention and management. Moreover, their
      prediction ability has vastly improved compared to earlier PRS that included only a limited
      number of genetic variants. However, while the associations between PRS and a wide range of
      common diseases are well established (clinical validity), the potential impact of this
      information on patient health outcomes (clinical utility) remains contested and understudied.

      This study will examine the effectiveness and implementation outcomes from the use of PRS for
      6 common diseases that are screened for by PCPs and have established prevention strategies:
      CAD, AFib, T2D, colorectal cancer, prostate cancer, and breast cancer. This trial has two
      aims:

      Aim 1: Conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine the clinical effectiveness of
      PRS among patients at high genetic risk for at least one disease, measured by changes in
      clinical management (process outcomes) and time to diagnosis of prevalent or incident disease
      (clinical outcome) over 24 months.

      Aim 2: Measure high-priority genomic medicine implementation outcomes, including primary care
      provider (PCP) knowledge and beliefs about PRS, patient activation in healthcare, medication
      adherence, and costs.
