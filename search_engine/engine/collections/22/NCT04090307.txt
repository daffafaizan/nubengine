      better maternal and neonatal outcomes than those in TC. The objective is to conduct a
      randomized trial to determine the effect of TLC group prenatal care on birthweight and
      neonatal body composition, maternal healthy lifestyle and diabetes-related outcomes, delivery
      and neonatal outcomes, and psychosocial stress and depression.
