           may predict death and ventricular arrhythmias better than left ventricular ejection
           fraction in patients with myocardial infarction and heart failure.

        2. In patients who receive internal cardioverter defibrillator(ICD) the main aim is to
           investigate if mechanical dispersion may predict ventricular arrhythmias better than EF.

      3) No interventions,only evaluation of the measurements obtained with transthoracic
      echocardiography.

      4) Follow up for 3 years
