      electrodes in order to identify their seizure onset zone. During this procedure, direct brain
      electrical stimulations is a standard clinical practice to assess seizure sensitivity and for
      functional mapping. However the efficiency of these stimulations can be questioned and could
      potentially be improved. Indeed, only two typical frequencies are commonly used in our
      epilepsy centre, 1Hz and 50Hz, without clear clinical or scientific justification for these
      specific frequencies.

      This study aims at assessing if extending the range of stimulation frequencies of the usual
      clinical frequencies could improve the definition of the seizure onset zone and hence the
      presurgical planning. We will maintain the usual stimulation frequencies (standard clinical
      stimulations condition) and add new frequencies to the protocol (research stimulations
      condition). The choice of these new frequencies will be based either on the spontaneous
      frequency of the onset of the patients' typical seizures or on physiological frequencies
      depending on the brain structures stimulated (i.e., theta in the medial temporal lobe).

      The protocol will be proposed to all patients undergoing a stereo-electro-encephalography
      (SEEG) in our epilepsy center and the efficiency of the two conditions (standard clinical
      stimulations condition vs research stimulations condition) will be compared. The efficiency
      will be assessed as any epileptic event, recorded in the intracerebral EEG or symptom induced
      by the stimulations. This project will last 36 months. 20 patients will be included.
