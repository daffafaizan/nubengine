    
      This is a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, monocentric study. We plan to
      recruit 180 obese adult patients scheduled for bariatric surgery in a the french university
      hospital of Caen.

      Exclusion: contra-indications for any aminoamide local anesthetic (allergy, severe hepatic
      disease) and for intravenous lidocaine (porphyria, atrioventricular conduction disturbances,
      uncontrolled seizure disease), long term opioid consumption, need for a post-operative
      follow-up in an intensive care unit, combined surgical procedure excepting cholecystectomy,
      pregnancy.

      Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either a saline placebo or lidocaine
      continuous infusions during surgery. Morphinic consumption will be assessed from the end of
      the procedure until the third day after surgery. Secondary criteria will concern
      post-operative recovery, pain and postoperative nausea and vomiting, other medical and
      surgical complications, and toxicity. Plasma lidocaine concentrations will be measured in
      patients who had received lidocaine in order to determine the safety and efficiency of our
      infusion protocol.

      Our analysis will be a superiority one, alpha risk is 5% and beta risk is 20%, in intention
      to treat, with no intermediate analysis.
