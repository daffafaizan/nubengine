      appointment is made for cystoscopy for suspicion of bladder cancer (BC) or to confirm BC
      diagnosis.

      Participants will be asked to spend 21 to 30 days in this study. The study will be conducted
      during the time from when the participant is diagnosed with bladder cancer to when they
      undergo a surgical procedure for the treatment or removal of their bladder cancer. The
      surgical procedure is done as a part of their regular medical care. Participants will be
      asked to come for 1 additional visit as part of this research study at the midpoint between
      their biopsy and surgery.
