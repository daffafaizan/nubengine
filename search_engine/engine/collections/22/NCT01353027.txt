      filamentous single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. Since 1976 several Ebolavirus
      outbreaks have occurred with fatality rates ranging from 57% to 90%, with most of these
      outbreaks traced to single EBOV species; EBOV-Z. No effective therapy is currently available
      for Ebolavirus.

      AVI-6002 is an experimental combination of 2 phosphorodiamidate morpholino antisense
      oligomers with positive charges on selected subunits (PMOplusâ„¢). These oligomers specifically
      target viral messenger RNA encoding 2 Ebolavirus proteins thought to be important in viral
      replication and host immune suppression. The present study is designed to characterize the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of escalating single-administration doses of
      AVI-6002 in healthy human subjects.
