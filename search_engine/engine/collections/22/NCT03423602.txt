    
      This study will be a prospective, multi-centred, non-randomized study to investigate the
      safety and performance of the PerQsealÂ® in 75 patients in approximately 10 European
      investigational sites.

      The study shall not be blinded prior to, during or post the procedure. All patients
      undergoing an endovascular procedure requiring an arteriotomy created by 12 to 20 F sheaths,
      via the common femoral artery will be screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If
      the patient meets the requirements of the clinical investigation, they shall be invited to
      participate, provide informed consent and shall subsequently be assigned a subject number.

      All subjects shall have an immediately post procedure, ~24 hour, 1 and 3 month follow-up
      assessment. Safety data from the follow-ups will be assessed by the Data Safety Monitoring
      Committee on a continuous basis.
