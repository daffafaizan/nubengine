      receptor-ligand interaction is a major pathway hijacked by tumors to suppress this immune
      control.

      Pembrolizumab is a potent and highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody designed to
      directly block the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands and is registered for the
      treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma of locally advanced or metastatic
      NSCLC in adults. In an earlier study it's effect has been shown in mismatch repair deficient
      tumors.

      Ataluren is designed to allow the protein making apparatus (the ribosome) in cells to skip
      over a premature stop codon (PTC), allowing the cells to translate the sequence downstream of
      a premature termination codon (PTC) in mRNA transcripts. This may result in the translation
      of additional out-of-frame code, which is available in abundance in dMMR tumors. We argue
      that this may result in new target peptides for the immune-system to recognize cancer cells.

      The investigators hypothesize that the formation of these peptides by Ataluren can enhance
      the effect of Pembrolizumab anti-PD1 therapy.

      Therefore the investigators designed a Single Center, open label, Phase I-II trial designed
      to test the safety and efficacy of the combination of Ataluren and Pembrolizumab for the
      treatment of metastatic mismatch repair deficient and proficient colorectal adenocarcinoma
      and metastatic mismatch repair deficient endometrial carcinoma.
