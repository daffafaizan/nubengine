      but only a minority of these Veterans seek care through VA mental health services. Research
      suggests that some older Veterans with psychological distress under-utilize mental health
      services due to perceived stigma of treatments focused on mental health symptoms. However,
      prior research with civilians, including one study of Veterans with PTSD, suggests a
      strengths-focused intervention that provides group training in compassion meditation may be
      effective in reducing negative emotions and increasing positive emotions and well-being. The
      proposed project is designed to examine the feasibility of this approach with Veterans ages >
      55 years with anxiety or depression. The information from the study will guide and support
      development of a larger-size, more definitive study, planned as the follow-up after this
      project. If successful, this line of research could open the door to a novel and effective
      treatment that widens acceptance by older Veterans with psychological distress.
