      certain types of breast cancer patients. These treatments may be performed for prophylactic
      mastectomy but also have been demonstrated to be oncologically safe in patients with specific
      criteria for early stage breast cancer. Currently, the two-stage tissue expander/implant
      (TE/I) technique is the standard breast reconstructive option for breast cancer patients
      selected for immediate, skin-sparing mastectomy, however there are significant disadvantages
      as this technique requires two separate surgeries and multiple office visits to complete that
      may affect a patients quality of life. Medically safe compounds such as acellular dermal
      matrix have been developed that have the potential to support breast implants without
      requiring numerous tissue expansions and consequently providing the potential for a one-stage
      breast implant/reconstruction procedure for immediate, skin-sparing mastectomies.

      To examine patient satisfaction, quality of life and overall aesthetic outcome achieved using
      the acellular dermal matrix facilitated one-staged breast reconstruction at 2 weeks, 6 & 12
      months following completion of the reconstruction. Hypothesis 2: Patient satisfaction,
      quality of life and overall aesthetic outcome achieved using the acellular dermal matrix
      facilitated one-stage breast reconstruction is superior to that following the standard
      two-stage tissue expander/ implant breast reconstruction technique in selected mastectomy
      patients.

      To determine the short and long-term operative complication rates associated with the use of
      dermal matrix in one-stage immediate breast reconstruction following skin-sparing mastectomy.
      Hypothesis 1: The use of acellular dermal matrix in one-stage immediate prosthetic breast
      reconstruction is associated with decreased short and long-term postoperative complications
      compared with the traditional two staged tissue expander/implant procedure.
