    
      This is a Phase I/II, multi-center, open-label, randomized, parallel group, pharmacokinetic,
      pharmacodynamic study of the AG1000-6.5 and AG1000-12.5 transdermal contraceptive delivery
      systems (TCDS) in healthy women followed as an outpatient for up to three 28-day cycles (12
      weeks or approximately 3 months). During this study, subjects will receive active treatment
      with the LNG TCDS patches for 11 weeks, followed by one week of post-treatment assessment.
      The TCDS is designed for one week of patch wear. This study will be conducted by the National
      Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) in its Contraceptive Clinical Trials
      Network (CCTN) at 6 sites in the USA and will enroll approximately 120 women.

      This study will enroll approximately 120 subjects, who will be randomized across all sites
      into the two treatment groups (~60 subjects at each dose level). The randomization schedule
      will be further stratified to ensure enrollment of approximately 50% of subjects with BMI >32
      kg/m2 and <40 kg/m2 and approximately 50% of subjects with BMI <32 kg/m2 for each dose level.
