      assistance with medical care, reinforcing the parent's willingness to live. Some Chinese
      children aware of their parents HIV diagnosis do exhibit emotional and social dysfunction;
      however, adequate support from caregivers (e.g., grandparents or even their HIV+ parents) can
      improve the children's quality of life and academic performance. There is a clear need for
      practical interventions to address parental distress around HIV disclosure in China, where
      cultural norms often emphasize family identity and cohesion and underscore the need for
      family-based programs, which have been shown to be feasible and efficacious for HIV-affected
      families.
