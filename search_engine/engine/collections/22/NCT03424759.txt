      patients with uncommon EGFR mutation. The primary endpoint of the study is objective response
      rate. Recently, a retrospective analysis reported that overall response rate of EGFR TKI
      (gefitinib or erlotinib) treatment was about 10% or less in Korean NSCLC patients with
      uncommon EGFR mutation other than del19, L858R and T790M (9).

      In this study, we expect an objective response rate of about 30% for the experimental arm
      (AZD9291 therapy) compared to that of about 10% in the historical control based on previous
      studies. A sample size of 33 efficacy-evaluable patients would provide a power of 90% for
      testing the null hypothesis of 10% ORR vs. alternative hypothesis of 30% using a single-arm
      exact binomial test with a 1=sided significance level of 5%. The experimental therapy will be
      rejected if 6 or fewer patients out of 33 respond. Allowing for a follow-up loss rate of 10%,
      the total sample size is 37 patients.

      Patients will be treated 80 mg/day of AZD9291 orally (1 cycle for 21 days). Subjects (with
      the exception of subjects with insulin dependent diabetes) must fast for ≥1 hours prior to
      taking a dose to ≥2 hour post dose. Water is permitted during this fasting period. Cycles
      were repeated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or until the patient or the
      investigator requested therapy discontinuation. If the efficacy will be proven, the patient
      could receive the treatment continuously.
