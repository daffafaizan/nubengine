    
      Background:

        -  The evaluation of the cells of the immune system and HTLV-1 infection have been a
           central focus of the Metabolism Branch for the past 30 years.

        -  Blood obtained by apheresis or blood drawing, skin biopsies and other tissues will be
           evaluated for abnormalities related to immunity, HTLV-1 infection and the immune system.

        -  Advances in the characterization of acquired genetic changes in tumor samples has

      led to insights for the development of targeted therapy of malignancy

      Objectives:

        -  To characterize the molecular biology and immunological features as well as the clinical
           course of individuals with suspected or known disorders of the immune system or cancer

        -  To define the nature of the immunological, genetic and epigenetic abnormalities in the
           cells of participants with immunodeficiency diseases associated with infections and/or a
           high incidence of malignancy and in participants with cancer.

        -  To obtain whole blood, plasma and leukocytes, as well as skin, lymph node and bone
           marrow biopsies on participants with immunodeficiency or cancer to investigate the
           immune system.

      Eligibility:

        -  Subjects with cancer.

        -  Subjects with immunodeficiency.

        -  Subjects with HTLV-1 infection.

      Design:

      -This is a natural history study that permits tissue acquisition for analysis of the immune
      system and HTLV-1 infection.
