      premature infants should be fed during a blood transfusion. The effects of a blood
      transfusion on superior mesenteric artery blood flow velocity and the post-prandial hyperemia
      are not known.

      We hypothesize that the post-prandial change in mesenteric blood flow velocity (BFV) will be
      the same before as after a packed red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion among anemic premature
      infants.

      Sixty anemic infants (25-32 weeks GA, feeding >= 60 cc/kg/day) will undergo pre- and
      post-feed superior mesenteric artery Doppler studies both before and after a blood
      transfusion. Infants will be stratified by current weight into two groups (< 1250 grams and >
      1250 grams). In each weight stratum the infants will be randomized to feeding or NPO during
      the PRBC transfusion. Randomization will be by block design, with block sizes ranging from
      two to six infants. The investigator performing the Doppler studies will remain masked to the
      feeding assignment of the infant.

      The primary outcome for the study is the superior mesenteric artery blood flow velocity
      response to feeding between anemic and non-anemic states among premature infants. Our
      secondary outcome is the effect of feeding on BFV between anemic and non-anemic states in
      these infants. Statistical analysis will include paired and unpaired Student t-tests and
      regression analysis.
