      will (1) improve production of new T cells at 1-2 yr of age; (2) improve T-cell memory
      responses at 1-2 yr of age to vaccines given early in infancy (birth - 14 wk); and (3) alter
      intestinal colonization early in infancy (6, 11 and 15 wk) and at 1-2 yr of age to increase
      Bifidobacterium and other healthy bacteria and decrease Proteobacteria and other harmful
      bacteria. Because the "secretor status" of the mother affects the carbohydrate content of the
      breastmilk, which can in turn affect Bifidobacterium growth in the infant gut, the "secretor
      status" of the mother will be determined. Furthermore these differences in composition of the
      intestinal bacteria will be associated with greater immunologic responses to oral and
      systemic vaccines.

      Specific Aim 1: Determine if VAS or placebo at birth affect the blood concentration and
      thymic output of na√Øve T-cells at 1-2 yr of age. Specific Aim 2: Determine if VAS or placebo
      at birth affect T-cell mediated responses at 1-2 yr of age to vaccines given early in
      infancy, including serum and intestinal antibody levels, vaccine-specific proliferative
      responses by T cells and cytokine production by T cells. Specific Aim 3: Determine if VAS or
      placebo at birth affect the relative abundance of healthy intestinal bacteria and common
      harmful bacteria in the feces at 6, 11, and 15 wk of age and at 1-2 yr of age and determine
      if relative abundance of these bacteria correlates with vaccine responses shortly after
      vaccination (6, 11, 15 wk) and later in infancy (1-2 yr). As part of Aim 3 the "secretor
      status" genotype (FUT2 gene) of the mother will be determined from a cheek swab DNA sample.
