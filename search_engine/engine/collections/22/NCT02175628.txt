      breast cancer could provide substantial clinical benefit by improving diagnosis, preventing
      over-treatment, and reducing healthcare costs. Acoustic angiography is a new type of contrast
      enhanced ultrasound imaging which is specifically sensitive to microvascular structure and
      density. It evaluates tumor micro-vasculature and may provide a powerful prognostic tool for
      the diagnosis of breast cancer, and eventually for treatment evaluation.

      Sixty patients who are to have a clinical surgical breast biopsy based on results from
      pre-study standard of care (SOC) imaging will be recruited from the UNC Breast Clinic for
      participation in the study. The primary objective of this single arm study is to compare the
      sensitivity and specificity of acoustic angiography with traditional b-mode ultrasound in the
      distinction of malignant versus benign breast lesions. Secondary objectives include a
      comparison of area under the curve (AUC) for acoustic angiography versus b-mode ultrasound,
      comparison of radiologist preference for the two imaging techniques for each of 3 lesion
      characteristics, and quantification of vessel tortuosity based on acoustic angiography
      imaging results. These metrics will be used to develop a predictive model of malignancy which
      will subsequently be compared to results from radiology review.
