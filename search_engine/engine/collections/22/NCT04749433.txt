    
      This is a Phase 1 study of safety and tolerability of an investigational radiotracer drug
      called
      [5-cyano-N-(4-(4-[11C]Methylpiperazin-1-yl)-2-(Piperidin-1-yl)Phenyl)Furan-2-carboxamide]
      ([11C]CPPC). A radiotracer is a substance that chemically marks certain structures in the
      body. In this case, [11C]CPPC highlights structures expressing colony stimulating factor
      receptor (CSF1R), a receptor that is expressed on microglial cells. A safety and tolerability
      study is looking to see if there are any unanticipated, possibly harmful, effects of the use
      of the radiotracer in humans. However, ultimately, the investigators would like to know if
      this drug can be used to make better images of the brain for patients with amyotrophic
      lateral sclerosis (ALS), which could help doctors better understand the disease and help take
      care of patients with ALS. This study will use a radiotracer to look for a chemical receptor
      which ALS patients have more of in the brain. After receiving the radiotracer, participants'
      brains will be scanned with a positron emission tomography (PET) imaging machine.
