    
      Participant outcome variables will be assessed weekly for the first month after baseline.
      This will include the primary dependent variable (i.e., depressive symptoms), but will also
      include variables that will be explored as potential mechanisms of change (i.e., mindfulness,
      decentering, rumination, worry, self-compassion, and dysfunctional attitudes). The final
      weekly assessment will represent the Post-Intervention assessment.

      Brief follow-up assessments of the primary dependent variable will be given 1-month and
      2-months after the final weekly questionnaire. There will be a 3-month assessment that
      measures potential mechanisms of change in addition to the primary dependent variable.

      After the 3-month follow-up, the Waitlist Control condition will be given access to the
      intervention. All participants (i.e., in both conditions) will be asked to complete another
      month of weekly questionnaires. These questionnaires will be identical to the first set of
      weekly questionnaires, and will allow mechanisms of change to be evaluated in the Waitlist
      Control condition.
