      and the development of resistance to acyclovir for patients requiring repeated treatment
      presents a therapeutic dilemma for physicians. SP-303T has good in vitro activity against
      resistant strains and offers a convenient and inexpensive means of drug administration in
      comparison to the use of intravenous medication.

      Patients receive 14 days (and up to 42 days) of treatment with topically applied SP-303T.
      SP-303T is applied directly onto herpes simplex virus lesions three times daily in a quantity
      sufficient to thinly cover the entire lesion, which may then be covered with an appropriate
      dressing, if needed. At the end of the treatment period, patients enter a follow-up period of
      2 weeks.
