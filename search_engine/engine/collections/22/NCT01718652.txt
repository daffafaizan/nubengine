    
      This study will be an open label (all volunteers and study staff know the identity of
      assigned treatments), single-center, multiple-dose study to determine how cyclosporin (a drug
      which reduces the activity of a patient's immune system) affects the pharmacokinetics of
      canagliflozin (a drug currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
      mellitus). The study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, an open-label treatment
      phase, and an end-of study (or follow-up) phase. Each volunteer will participate in the study
      for approximately 47 days.
