      diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease and recently irritable bowel syndrome. The
      conventional test methods of permeability is sugar absorption test which is neither reliable
      and practical. Confocal laser endomicrosopy is a newly developed device which allows in vivo
      and real time observation of gastrointestinal mucosa. In our preliminary study we found that
      the commonly used contrast agent, fluorescein sodium shew differences of leakage into colonic
      crypt lumen among different patients. The fluorescein leakage might be due to abnormal
      colonic permeability, so we planed to compare the fluorescein leakage under confocal laser
      endomicroscopy with conventional sucralose absorption test.
