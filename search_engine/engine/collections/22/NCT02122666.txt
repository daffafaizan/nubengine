      muscle. It is a translation of previous research done in mice studying the effects and
      functions of certain key enzymes involved in lipid metabolism found to be associated with
      insulin resistance. These enzymes are fatty acid synthase (FAS), choline/ethanolamine
      phosphotransferase 1 (CEPT1) and sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA). Based on
      the investigators research, it appears that the activity and function of these enzymes
      determines the ratio of certain phospholipids in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), namely
      phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC). Furthermore, the investigators
      have found that the ratio of these phospholipids correlates with the mouse's sensitivity to
      insulin.

      Based on the muscle biopsies of four healthy persons, it was found that human muscle contains
      similar phospholipids and phospholipid ratios to mice. It is hypothesized that these
      phospholipid signatures may be predictive of the metabolic status of humans as well. The
      specific aims of this study are to determine if the composition and function of the
      sarcoplasmic reticulum is altered in persons with the metabolic syndrome compared to lean
      controls. This knowledge could provide new understanding of impediments to effective therapy,
      novel biomarkers of disease progression, and innovative treatment targets for diabetes.
