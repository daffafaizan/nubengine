      myelin-specific CD4+ T cells, as secretion of pro-inflammatory IFNγ, are believed to play a
      major role in the pathogenesis. The myelin-specific T cells that mediate tissue destruction
      in MS are believed to become activated outside the central nervous system (CNS) in lymphoid
      tissue and when they cross the blood brain barrier they will re-encounter their antigen.
      Immune deviation is the redirection of the immune response from most often Th1 like responses
      to Th2 like responses, even though the opposite can also occur. Vitamin A or Vitamin A-like
      analogs known as retinoids, are potent hormonal modifiers of type 1 or type 2 responses but a
      definitive description of their mechanism(s) of action is lacking. High level dietary vitamin
      A enhances Th2 cytokine production and IgA responses, and is likely to decrease Th1 cytokine
      production. Retinoic acid(RA) inhibits IL12 production in activated macrophages, and RA
      pretreatment of macrophages reduces IFNγ production and increases IL4 production in antigen
      primed CD4 T cells. Supplemental treatment with vitamin A or RA decreases IFNγ and increases
      IL5, IL10, and IL4 production by increase of retinoic acid receptor and retinoic x receptor .
