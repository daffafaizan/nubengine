    
      This study is a randomized controlled, Phase II, three-arm study of Umbilical Cord Blood
      Mononuclear Cell (MC001) transplant into the injured spinal cord in combination with either
      6-week course of oral lithium carbonate or placebo followed by the locomotor training for up
      to 6 hours a day, 6 days a week, for 3-6 months.

      A total of 27 subjects with chronic complete spinal cord injury (SCI) will be randomized to
      one of the three treatment groups. The subjects assigned to Group A and B will receive 6.4
      million UCBMNC (MC001) transplanted into the dorsal root entry zones above and below the
      injury site exposed by a laminectomy. Subjects in Group A and B will be treated with oral
      lithium carbonate or placebo for six weeks in a double blind manner. All subjects will
      receive 3-6 months of intensive locomotor training.
