    
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate whether a one-session behavioral
      activation intervention for depression can successfully reduce depression and improve asthma
      or urticaria disease-relevant outcomes (medication adherence, doctor's visits, substance
      abuse) in clinical patients with asthma or urticaria who report heightened levels of
      depression and are seen in the UMMC Allergy Clinic.
