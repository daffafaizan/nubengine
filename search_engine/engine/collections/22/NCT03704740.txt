    
      This is a multi-national, multi-center, randomized, double blinded, parallel-group study to
      assess the immunogenicity and safety of NBP607-QIV compared to Agrippal which are indicated
      for active immunization for the the prevention of influenza disease. Total of 675 subjects or
      above (450 subjects for NBP607-QIV arm and 225 subjects for Agrippal arm) of 6 to 35 months
      of age are enrolled. Each subject is administered with single or two doses of vaccines
      depending on previous vaccination history, and randomly assigned in 2:1 ratio.

      Stratified randomization for trial site and age strata is used to achieve the balance of
      treatment assignment.

      Total of three or five visits are scheduled depeding on dosing schedule. For subjects
      assigned to single-dose vaccination schedule, blood sampling is conducted for immunogenicity
      assessment before and 4 weeks after single vaccination at Visit 1 and 3 respectively. Safety
      is monitored 3 days, 4 weeks after vaccination through Visit 2* and 3 (* telephone contact).
      For subjects assigned to two-dose vaccination schedule, blood sampling is conducted before
      first vaccination and 4 weeks after second vaccination at Visit 1 and Visit 5 respectively.
      Safety is monitored 3 days, 4 weeks after each vaccination through Visit 2*, 3, 4*, and 5 (*
