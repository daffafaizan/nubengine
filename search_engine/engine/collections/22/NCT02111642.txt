      with pelvic organ prolapse planning to have prolapse surgery with 1 of 4 fellowship-trained
      Urogynecologists at the National Center for Advanced Pelvic Surgery at MedStar Washington
      Hospital Center in Washington, DC. Women will be recruited prior to their preoperative
      counseling sessions during routine office visits and/or by telephone. After obtaining
      informed consent, women who agree to participate will be randomized to preoperative
      counseling sessions where an online risk calculator tool for the development of postoperative
      de novo stress urinary incontinence is or is not used. This tool is accessible at no cost
      from the following website: http://www.r-calc.com/ExistingFormulas.aspx?filter=CCQHS. At the
      time of these sessions, participants will decide whether to have a midurethral sling placed
      at the time of their prolapse repair to prevent development of stress urinary incontinence
      after surgery. After making this decision, all participants will complete the validated
      Satisfaction with Decision Scale to assess their satisfaction with their decision regarding
      midurethral sling placement. This validated 6-item self-administered questionnaire with a 5
      point response scale takes approximately 3 minutes to complete. Participants will complete
      the Satisfaction with Decision Scale a second time at the time of their 2 week postoperative
      visit. Three months after surgery, participants will complete the Satisfaction with Decision
      Scale a third time, along with other validated quality of life questionnaires.
