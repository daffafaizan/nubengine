      the many potential predisposing factors, sepsis and pneumonia represent the two main causes
      of ARDS. In spite of an increase in survival in recent years mortality in patients with ARDS
      is still estimated around 30 to 40%. In this context, development of effective preventive
      strategies in patients at high risk of development of ARDS is of paramount importance.
      Unfortunately, the results of studies evaluating prophylactic regimens for ARDS have been
      mostly disappointing.

      The gaseous molecule carbon monoxide (CO) has been traditionally viewed as a toxic metabolic
      and industrial waste. However, recent studies have demonstrated an important physiologic role
      of CO in many biological systems. Specifically, strong anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and
      anti-thrombotic effects of CO gas administration and heme oxygenase activation (the enzyme
      that generates endogenous CO gas) have been demonstrated in several animal models.

      Previous studies conducted in our department have demonstrated that bronchoscopic
      instillation of endotoxin (LPS) in healthy volunteers elicits a compartmentalized pulmonary
      inflammatory response, serving as an excellent model to evaluate interventions directed
      towards suppression of lung inflammation at its earliest stages.

      In the current single blinded, randomized, placebo controlled study, we are planning to
      evaluate the effects of inhaled carbon monoxide on local pulmonary inflammatory responses
      following endotoxin administration. Healthy subjects will undergo local endotoxin
      instillation, breathe CO or room air through a mask for 6 hours, and then a repeat
      bronchoscopy with lavage will be done at 6 hours to assess the ability of CO to suppress
      local inflammation in the lung.
