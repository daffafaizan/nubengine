    
      This is a phase I, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention) and
      parallel-group (each group of patients will be treated at the same time), randomized (the
      study medication is assigned by chance) study in healthy male participants, to investigate
      the pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of 100 micrograms of JNJ-42396302, JNJ-53773187 or
      JNJ-42692507. The study consists of 3 phases, ie, screening phase (21 days prior to first
      dose of study medication), a treatment phase, and a follow up phase. In the treatment phase,
      participants will be divided into 3 treatment groups with 6 participants each, to receive a
      single dose of 100 micrograms of JNJ-42396302, JNJ-53773187 or JNJ-42692507 following an
      overnight fast of at least 10 hours. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical
      laboratory tests, physical examination, vital signs and electrocardiogram will be monitored
      throughout the study. The total duration of the study will be approximately 4 weeks.
