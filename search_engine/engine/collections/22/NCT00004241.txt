      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of
      17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) in patients with advanced epithelial
      cancer, malignant lymphoma, or sarcoma.

      II. Determine the significant toxic effects associated with this drug in these patients.

      III. Determine the response in patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the
      pharmacokinetics of 17-AAG and 17AG in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive treatment according to 1 of 2
      schedules.

      Schedule B: Patients receive 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) IV over 1-2
      hours twice weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Schedule C: Patients receive 17-AAG IV over 1-2 hours twice weekly for 2 weeks. Courses
      repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both schedules, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 17-AAG until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients receive
      treatment at the MTD.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
