      defects in the synthesis of glycans, glycoproteins or other glycoconjugates. Congenital
      disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a family of inherited disorders caused by defects in the
      synthesis of glycans, glycoproteins or other glycoconjugates. Glycosylation of proteins is
      crucial for a proper organ morphogenesis and for an appropriate coagulation system
      functioning. The neurological system is commonly affected in this type of disorders but cases
      of CDG with normal neurological development have been recently described. The group of
      Experimental Hematology and Clinic Oncology of the University of Murcia (Spain) recently
      described a rare disorder of glycosylation (ALG12-CDG) as the cause of antithrombin
      deficiency in a patient of 19 years with a history of repaired ventricular septal defect.

      On the other hand, population studies have shown an increased incidence of thromboembolic
      events in patients with congenital heart disease when compared to the general population. The
      identified genetic defects involved in the development of congenital heart diseases have
      variable or incomplete penetrance and in most cases the molecular basis is completely
      unknown.

      The investigators postulate that a CDG might be behind the development of some forms of
      congenital heart disease and contribute to the greater prevalence of thromboembolic events in
      this patient population.
