      anesthesia. During alertness, surgery and anesthesia the quality of AEP recordings may be
      reduced by artefacts. This poses the question to what extent AEP are sensitive for muscular
      artefacts. High frequency artefacts can have its seeds in muscles and in technical
      instruments in the operating room. Therefore, the study will take place under the terms of
      laboratory.

      The present study was designed to measure the influence of muscular artefacts on AEP under
      propofol sedation with or without local anesthesia in the area of the electrodes.

      If artefacts influence AEP, which are used to measure anesthesia, it is particularly
      interesting with regard to clinical application. AEP as a measure of "anesthetic depth" may
      not only reflect brain, but also muscular and high frequency activity. Therefore, while using
      muscle relaxants, the AEP of an awake patient may indicate deep anesthesia, because muscle
      signals are absent.
