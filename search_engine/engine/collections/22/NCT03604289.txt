      cardiovascular disease. Importantly, obesity is associated with endothelial dysfunction and
      elevated sympathetic tone, vascular and autonomic derangements known to elevate blood
      pressure and increase cardiovascular risk. The renin-angiotensin system may explain
      cardiovascular complications in obesity. Angiotensin-(1-7) is a beneficial hormone that is
      reduced in obesity and restoration of this hormone improves endothelial function and reduces
      sympathetic activity in animal models, which may contribute to its blood pressure-lowering
      effects. The investigators will test the hypothesis that angiotensin-(1-7) improves
      cardiovascular function in humans with obesity hypertension. This hypothesis will be tested
      in a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. The investigators will
      measure the effects of acute intravenous angiotensin-(1-7) infusion on endothelial-mediated
      vasodilation in the brachial and coronary arteries and on blood pressure and muscle
      sympathetic nerve activity with direct microneurography recordings in obese hypertensive
      humans.
