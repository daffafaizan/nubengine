      the study. If during the clinical study the minimum number of patients established in the
      protocol is exceeded, new samples will continue to be registered until the end of the
      established period.

      The sample selection mechanism is by consecutive recruitment during the study period (in
      order of arrival at the medical office). Patients are operated bilaterally in a period not
      exceeding 15 days and it will get the variables of both eyes. A simple random sampling will
      be used for the choice of single eye data per patient.
