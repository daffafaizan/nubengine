    
      Thirty consecutive patients who presented at the Dentistry College of Federal University of
      Juiz de Fora (Brazil) were selected, requiring a single-tooth extraction of premolar, canines
      or incisors in maxilla. All of the patients included at this study signed a free and informed
      consent form, agreeing to participate voluntarily in this research. The study was approved by
      the Research Ethical Committee of the University of Juiz de Fora under the form 1.731.395.

      The patients were randomly allocated in three groups according the following treatments:

        -  Group 1: Closure of the socket by primary intention through a palatal pedicle
           subepithelial connective tissue flap by the technique of Khoury & Happe (2000) (Figure
           1);

        -  Group 2: Filling the socket with a synthetic bone substitute of biphasic calcium
           phosphate (Bone CeramicÂ®, Straumann) and covering it with a palatal pedicle flap by the
           technique of Khoury & Happe (2000) (Figure 2);

        -  Group 3: Sealing of the socket with a provisional ovoid pontic of acrylic resin (Figure
           3).

      As response factors were performed evaluations of study casts and tomographic analysis for
      dimensional stability evaluation of the sockets at immediate postoperative and after four
      months of the surgical procedures.
