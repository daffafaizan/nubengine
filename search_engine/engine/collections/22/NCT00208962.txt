      in adults who have leukemia or lymphoma that is unlikely to be cured with regular anticancer
      drugs or radiation treatments. Intensive treatment with high doses of chemotherapy followed
      by a bone marrow transplant (BMT) from an HLA-(tissue-type) matched related donor would
      provide the best chance for cure of this leukemia or lymphoma. However, the success of BMT
      from relatives is limited in patients who are older than 50 years and/or have organ
      dysfunction by substantial complications due to the high dose chemotherapy related toxicity,
      graft-versus- host disease (GVHD), and relapse. Patients eligible for this study have an HLA
      matched sibling, but a BMT from the sibling would carry a high risk for severe side effects
      due to the patient's age, and/or organ dysfunction.

      Researchers are evaluating a new treatment for adult patients with leukemia and lymphoma
      which involves regular dose chemotherapy and blood stem cell transplantation from an
      HLA-matched relative, with injections of donor immune cells (a type of white blood cells)
      given if you later relapse. In this study, the safety and feasibility of this treatment
      strategy are being investigated.
