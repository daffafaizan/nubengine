      practice. There would be no change in the standard and usual anesthetic care including
      premedication, anesthetic induction, intraoperative anesthetic management, and intraoperative
      monitoring. Our usual anesthetic routine includes:

        1. Intravenous or oral premedication with midazolam

        2. Inhalational or intravenous induction based on the preference of the patient

        3. Facilitation of endotracheal intubation with a dose of rocuronium with placement of
           intraoperative monitors including an arterial cannula

        4. Maintenance anesthesia to include desflurane titrated to maintain the bispectral index
           at 40-60, fentanyl 2-4 µg/kg followed by a remifentanil infusion to maintain the mean
           arterial pressure at 55-65 mmHg.

        5. Tranexamic acid to limit intraoperative bleeding

        6. As needed, agent to control blood pressure to maintain the MAP at 55-65 mmHg if
           remifentanil in doses up to 0.3 µg/kg/min are ineffective.

      As needed, clevidipine will be started at 1 µg/kg/min and titrated up in 1 µg/kg/min every
      1-2 minutes to achieve an MAP at 55-65mmHg. Vital signs including heart rate will be recorded
      every 1 minute until the target MAP is achieved and then at 15 minute increments after that.
