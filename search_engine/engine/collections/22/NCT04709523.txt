      of the alveolar bone in the posterior regions of mandible.

      All patients were informed about treatment protocol of the study and also, the risks and
      benefits associated with participation. Each patient provided written informed consent prior
      to enrollment.

      Randomization was performed after the dental implant surgeries and the patients were randomly
      assigned to one of the study groups:

      Test group included 22 patients treated with GBR using i-PRF-enriched bovine-derived
      xenograft + resorbable membrane Control group included 22 patients treated with GBR using
      bovine-derived xenograft + resorbable membrane All patients underwent two-stage surgical
      protocol that performed by the same experienced surgeon. Following implant placement,
      i-PRF-enriched bovine-derived xenograft for the test group and bovine-derived xenograft alone
      for the control group was carefully positioned with light compression around the implants.
      Finally, the resorbable membrane was placed to cover the augmented area.

      As the second stage of surgery, healing caps were placed and the implant-supported fixed
      prosthesis were completed in approximately one to two months.
