    
      This is a Phase 1 and open-label study. The study consists of Screening Phase (less than or
      equal to (<=) 28 days before Day 1), Treatment Phase (Day 1 up to Day 78) and Follow up Phase
      (10 to 14 days after last study drug intake or, if an adverse event occurs, 30 to 35 days
      after last study drug intake). Treatment phase will consist of three Oral Contraceptive (OC)
      cycles (each cycle consists of 21 days of ethinylestradiol/norethindrone followed by 7
      pill-free days). The duration of the treatment phase, including the OC-free period of Cycles
      I and II, will be 78 days. Blood samples will be collected for measurement of pharmacokinetic
      (Pk) parameters. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
