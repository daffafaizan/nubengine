      wheat, rye and barley proteins that cause damage to the villous structure in the small bowel.
      The active disease is characterized by the induction of gluten-dependent autoantibodies to
      transglutaminase type-2, which are sensitive and specific non-invasive markers of
      gluten-sensitivity. Gluten-free diet normally leads to clearance of antibodies from serum in
      6-12 months. Persistent seropositivity is a problem in patients who only incompletely exclude
      gluten or frequently transgress the diet. In such cases, damage of the small bowel may
      persist and complications may occur at higher frequency. The central hypothesis to be tested
      is that enzyme treatment designed to degrade a certain amount of gluten before absorption in
      the gastrointestinal tract will lead to a clinically meaningful decrease in auto-antibody
      levels in these patients.
