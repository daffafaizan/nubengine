      consolidation. This approach has significantly improved survival in newly diagnosed APL
      patients. However, approximately 30% of patients relapse. Recently, an approach involving the
      combination of oral ATRA and arsenic trioxide has been tested. The prognosis for relapsed
      patients is very poor. This study seeks to investigate NRX 195183 monotherapy in patients who
      have failed or are resistant to or are intolerant of any prior therapy.
