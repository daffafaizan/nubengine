    
      This is a Phase 2 open-label, single-arm design study with dose escalation by subject cohort
      and with the potential for individual titration (dose increase or decrease) within each
      cohort. The study is designed to monitor the PTG-300 safety profile, to obtain preliminary
      evidence of efficacy of PTG-300 for the treatment of chronic anemia in Î²-thalassemia and to
      evaluate the appropriate dosing regimen for PTG-300 in the target population
