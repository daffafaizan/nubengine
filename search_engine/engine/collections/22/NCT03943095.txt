      arm, parallel design, stratified (by maximum Baseline Schiff sensitivity score of the two
      selected test teeth), Phase II, exploratory clinical study in healthy participants with DH.
      It is hypothesized that the combination of two antisensitivity active ingredients with
      complementary modes of action (potassium nitrate: nerve desensitization; stannous fluoride:
      dentin tubule occlusion) will deliver superior anti-sensitivity efficacy, compared to either
      active alone.
