    
      This is a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing cruciate-retaining
      total knee arthroplasty with the Attune S+ fixed bearing TKR system. Patients will be
      randomized to two study groups:

        1. Neutral mechanical alignment;

        2. Anatomical alignment.

      The principal objective of this study is to compare migration patterns between mechanical and
      anatomic alignment surgical techniques for the Attune S+ CR-FB knee system using model-based
      RSA over the first 2 post-operative years.

      Secondary objectives include; comparison of 2-year migration values against published
      thresholds for adequate short-term fixation, comparison of functional and health status of
      subjects following surgery, comparison of intra-operative soft-tissue releases, incidence of
      complications and adverse events, and to assess several health economic parameters relating
      to the surgery.
