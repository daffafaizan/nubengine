      extends to the olfactory domain, a phylogenetically more ancient sense. Exposure to axillary
      sweat from healthy volunteers undergoing an emotional stressor task evokes a strong vicarious
      stress response on the behavioral and neural level.Particularly, anxious individuals have
      been shown to exhibit a heightened sensitivity to social chemosensory stress cues (axillary
      sweat). The neuropeptide oxytocin (OXT) exerts anxiolytic and anti-stress effects in visual
      and auditory modalities, however, it still elusive whether OXT also modulates the processing
      of stress-associated chemosignals. Axillary sweat were obtained from an unrelated sample of
      30 healthy men undergoing the Trier Social Stress Test and ergometer training as
      control.Subsequently, subjects completed a forced-choice emotional face recognition task
      composed of stimuli with varying intensities (neutral to fearful), while they were exposed to
      both sweat stimuli and a non-social control odor (raspberry) after OXT or placebo
      administration, respectively. The investigators expect that OXT selectively diminishes
      chemosensory-induced behavioral biases and neural responses to stress-related odors.
