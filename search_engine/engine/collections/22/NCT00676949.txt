      profile analysis by the use of cDNA microarray in the previous studies. The investigators
      have determined the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides respectively derived from KOC1,
      TTK, CO16(URLC10), DEPDC1, and MPHOSPH1 showed strong INF-gamma production when stimulated
      with the appropriate targets expressing the appropriate protein and HLA-A*2402. Furthermore,
      when vaccinated these peptides, specific CTLs were determined after the vaccination.
      Therefore the investigators focused on the prevention of further expansion of the solid
      tumors highly expressing these 5 proteins using these 5 peptides.
