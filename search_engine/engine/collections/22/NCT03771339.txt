      However, continuous epidural technique had some concerning side effects such as hemodynamic
      instabilities, urine retention, motor/sensory disturbances/weakness, and mobilisation
      comfort, it could also cause hypotension which could affect graft success. Quadratus lumborum
      (QL) block had lesser side effects thus could be an option for postoperative analgesia,
      however there are no study showing the safety and success rate of QL block techniques for
      patients who underwent kidney transplant surgery.
