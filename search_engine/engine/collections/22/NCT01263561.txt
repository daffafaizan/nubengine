      month) and late post-operative (from 1 month to 1 year) periods. In addition complications
      will be evaluated as severe (defined as a permanent reduction in vision or complications
      requiring a surgical intervention) and not severe (complications which resolve with
      conservative management). As an individual subject may have more than one complication, the
      number of complications will be compared between the two surgical groups.
