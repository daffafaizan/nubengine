      of different types of autoantibodies in patients receiving ICI for the first time. The rate
      of clinical autoimmunes diseases development will also be recorded and correlated with
      autoantibodies prevalence before and during ICI treatment.

      Results will help to determine the rate of biological and clinical autoimmune events induced
      by ICIs in unselected patients and will help to clarify autoimmunity screening strategy in
      this setting.
