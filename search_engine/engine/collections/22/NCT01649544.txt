      medium- and long-term efficacy of this technique. Despite a diffusion and utilization of the
      technique in clinical practice, the efficacy of the ultrasound technique has not been
      compared, in a standardized manner, with amiodarone, which is the only anti-arrhythmic agent
      that has shown good efficacy in maintaining post-operative sinus rhythm following cardiac
      surgery. We propose to undertake an open, prospective, randomized, multicenter study
      evaluating the efficacy of treatment with ultrasound (EPICOR) in the maintenance of sinus
      rhythm following mitral surgery in two parallel groups, one group with ablation via
      ultrasound "EPICOR" and a control group treated with "amiodarone", including a long-term
      follow-up of 18 months. The strategy in this study necessitates the use of amiodarone in the
      two groups during the first 2 months followed by a cardioversion in the cases of persistent
      AF 2 months following surgery in both groups, with a cessation of amiodarone therapy in the
      ultrasound group and maintenance of therapy in the control group. The parallel treatment with
      amiodarone in the two groups following the surgical intervention is necessary in order to
      avoid confounding factors in the analysis. In effect, AF during the postoperative period is
      frequent and may be considered to be secondary to a number of factors, such as the surgery
      itself, inflammation, temperature, metabolic disturbances, pericardial effusion, etc. This
      approach is justified, because if the benefit associated with the peri-operative ultrasound
      technique is validated, this would allow for a reduction in the use of anti-arrhythmic
      agents, which are associated with side effects, along with a decrease in long-term morbidity
      via the resulting maintenance of sinus rhythm. In addition, the technique of ablation via
      ultrasound could, among others, replace the surgical technique of reference (Cox surgery) for
      which the principal inconvenience is the prolongation of the time of surgery, resulting in an
      elevated peri-operative morbidity. Therefore, the principal objective of the study is to
      compare, at 18 months, the efficacy of surgical treatment with ultrasound (EPICOR) on the
      maintenance of sinus rhythm following mitral valve surgery in comparison with amiodarone.
