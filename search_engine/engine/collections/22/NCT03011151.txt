      gastrointestinal dysfunction, gastric dysmotility and loss of epithelial barrier integrity,
      occur in critical illness. Specifically, the investigators will examine whether an increase
      in PAR2 agonist levels, zonulin and serine proteases, are associated with gastric dysmotility
      and loss of epithelial barrier integrity in critical surgical illness in children. The
      investigators will examine GI function, gastric motility and epithelial barrier integrity,
      and PAR2 agonist levels, zonulin and serine protease, in participants before surgery and
      after surgery. Specifically, children undergoing posterior spinal fusion, a known significant
      inflammatory trigger, and with planned admissions to the intensive care unit will be
      enrolled. Gastrointestinal function and PAR2 agonist levels will be tested non-invasively in
      blood and stool.
