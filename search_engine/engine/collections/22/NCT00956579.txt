      typically developing or with an autism spectrum disorder.)

      To study how sensory information is processed by the brain, we primarily use an instrument
      called MEG (MagnetoEncephaloGraphy), which measures the magnetic brainwaves emitted by our
      brains. The device does not have any output (i.e., there is no magnetic field); it only
      measures the waves produced in the brain.

      We measure those waves as the participants in the study listen to, view, or otherwise
      experience simple, non painful, stimuli. For instance, participants may listen to words while
      sitting in the MEG room, and watching a movie with the sound turned off.

      We then combine this information with pictures of the brain from MRI (Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging - when available), to get an idea about both the anatomy and the function of the
      brain, so that we can study how the brains of populations with autism spectrum disorders or
      language disorders may be different from those of typically developing populations.
