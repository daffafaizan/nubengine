      over the last two decades. There is a paucity of data exist about the bioavailability of
      postoperative administrated beta-blockers. One study reported adequate plasma levels of
      Propanolol after administration via nasogastric tube but not after oral administration in
      patient undergoing thyroid surgery.Thus it is possible that patients maintained on oral beta
      blockers may in fact be experiencing a withdrawal syndrome. Because of the importance of
      avoiding withdrawal of beta blockers, intravenous administration may be the only alternative
      in cases where oral administration fails to achieve adequate plasma levels perioperatively.
      Furthermore, due to changes in pharmacodynamics, intravenous dosage may be the optimal way to
      achieve tight hemodynamic control. There is, however, no data on the post-operative
      hemodynamic effects of orally administered beta blockers in patients on chronic beta
      blockers.
