      define anatomical abnormalities. The use of magnetic resonance imaging has grown in response
      to this need. Young children, however, are unable to cooperate sufficiently to allow the scan
      to occur; this necessitates the use of general anaesthesia.

      The optimal anaesthetic management of children in this situation is complex. Imaging of an
      acceptable quality depends on a low (normal) heart rate which is relatively constant during
      the scan and frequent breath holds to avoid respiratory artefacts. Children undergoing such
      scans commonly have significant cardiac and non-cardiac disease. A technique, currently used
      at Alder Hey Hospital, is to use intravenous agents to provide anaesthesia: commonly a
      mixture of the intravenous anaesthetic propofol and the potent opiate remifentanil. The
      patient's own ventilation is suppressed by the use of remifentanil which also reduces heart
      rate and heart rate variability. Controlled ventilation is provided via a ventilator and
      endotracheal tube. Adequate doses of remifentanil are required to ensure suppression of the
      patient's ventilation whilst excess doses are avoided to reduce the risk of adverse effects
      (primarily arterial hypotension) and ensure rapid recovery.

      Remifentanil dose has been studied during surgery(3-6), however this is a unique indication
      and optimal dosage has not been formally studied. In particular the absence of any
      stimulation from surgery is likely to mean that substantially lower doses of remifentanil
      will be required.
