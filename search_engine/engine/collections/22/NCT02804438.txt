      patients who have been assigned, by the attending physician, to have regular pupillary
      assessments, and in whom staff nurses are performing pupillary assessments with the
      pupillometer. While a sample size estimate would be considered inappropriate for registry
      development, power analysis techniques were used to examine the potential of this registry to
      generate adequate information to begin to fully describe normative data for pupillary exams.
      Using the assumption that the desire is to understand neurological pupil index (NPi) and size
      differences within 0.1, and that the spread of data would be approximately normally
      distributed, a minimum of 3,250 observations is required (alpha = 0.05, beta = 0.80). It
      must, however, be repeated that this is simply a rough estimate. The registry data generated
      will, in fact, be the source of data from which future studies will be powered.
