      1will enroll 8 subjects at each of 4 dose levels (up to 32 subjects). Cohorts will be
      staggered so that appropriate safety monitoring and follow-up can be performed for each
      subject at each dose level.

      Safety monitoring will be based upon review of AEs, ECGs and clinical laboratory test results
      prior to escalation to the next dose level.

      At the first dose level, 6 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive a single dose of WCK
      2349 at 1800 mg and 2 subjects will be randomly assigned to placebo. If this dose is
      tolerated by subjects, and safety data allows, the next group will be initiated in the same
      fashion at a dose of 2200 mg. If this dose is tolerated by subjects, and safety data allows,
      the next group will be initiated in the same fashion at a dose of 2600 mg. If this dose is
      tolerated by subjects, and safety data allows, the next group will be initiated in the same
      fashion at a dose of 3000 mg. Based upon safety data, the highest safely tolerated dose in
      Part 1 will be utilized as the supratherapeutic dose in Part 2.
