      research staff who are not involved in the study collect the data. The treating clinicians
      are not blinded to the assignment group.

      The primary measurement are pain scores, PAED scores, coughing score ( a 4-point scale:1= no
      coughing,2=minimal coughing, one or two times, 3= moderate coughing,3-4 times, 4 = severe
      coughing, more than 5 times), and extubation time. The secondary measurements are the time to
      discharge from the post-anaesthesia care unit, and the number of postoperative desaturation.

      A sample size of 30 was determined by analysis based on the assumption of the decline of
      extubation time from other similar study and α=0.05,β=0.2.

      The continuous variables were presented as means ± SD and the categorical variables were
      expressed as frequency.

      The outcome of interest is extubation time decline.
