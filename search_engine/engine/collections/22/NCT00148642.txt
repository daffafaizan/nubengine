      infections.Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) develops in a significant percentage of
      patients who have been ventilated for at least 48 hours, and is associated with high
      morbidity, mortality,and financial costs. Silver is a well-characterized antimicrobial agent,
      and is the active agent in multiple medical products used to reduce or control infection.
      Bard has developed a proprietary antimicrobial ETT, manufactured with a hydrophilic coating
      containing a fine dispersion of silver salts.

      This study compare the incidence and time to onset of VAP in patients intubated for >=24
      hours with a proprietary silver-coated ETT versus those intubated for >= 24 hours with a
      standard non-coated ETT.
