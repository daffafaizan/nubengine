      support and individual education (the latter of which was designed to mimic usual care).
      Participants in the peer-support (intervention) arm will be encouraged to attend two
      peer-support sessions, with one session occurring immediately prior to beginning CPAP and the
      other occurring two weeks later. Participants in the individual education (comparator) arm
      will begin CPAP without attendance at any peer-support sessions.
