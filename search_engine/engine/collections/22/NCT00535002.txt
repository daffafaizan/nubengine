      despite knowledge of the repercussions of continued drug-use. Stress and cocaine cues produce
      craving and ultimately relapse in cocaine dependent individuals. Pre-clinical research has
      demonstrated sex differences in response to cocaine-conditioned cues and cocaine-primed
      reinstatement, which correlates well with reduced plasma progesterone levels. Interestingly,
      this is consistent with a growing body of clinical literature indicating that progesterone
      may decrease the reinforcing properties of stimulants in women. Gender differences in the
      response to a social stressor and cocaine cues in cocaine-dependent individuals have been
      demonstrated in human laboratory studies, however, the interaction of stress and cues and the
      effect of hormonal status on response have not been explored. This study examines the role of
      hormonal status on the response to cocaine-related cues with or without a pharmacological
      stressor (yohimbine) in cocaine-dependent women and men. As a further integration of the
      research focus this study also explores the relationship between impulsivity and craving.
