      endodontic treatment in primary teeth. They will be submitted to anamnesis, clinical and
      radiographic exams for identification of eligibility criteria for the study. These patients
      will be divided randomly into 2 groups: G1 - pulpectomy with working length method performed
      through radiography (n=100) and G2 - pulpectomy with working length method performed with the
      aid of an apex locator (n=100). Endodontic treatment will be done by a single trained
      operator. After definite restoration and final radiography, an evaluation of the obturation
      quality will be performed by another blinded operator, who will evaluate the appropriate
      obturation length. The clinical treatment success and the radiographies will also be analyzed
      during a period of 24 months through clinical and radiographic exams, also by a blinded
      operator.
