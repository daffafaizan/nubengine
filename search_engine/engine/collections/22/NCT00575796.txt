      for which multiple treatments may be required. While several studies have shown evidence of
      short term tumour control with chemotherapy, the progression-free survival at 5 years is
      unsatisfactory. In addition, several regimens currently used for this condition are
      associated with significant risks of side effect and long term toxicity.

      We have piloted in a single arm study the feasibility and efficacy of Vinblastine for
      children with recurrent and refractory low grade glioma, who have failed at least one line of
      treatment (chemotherapy and/or irradiation). Preliminary results show promising activity with
      minimal toxicity.
