      (MTD) and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D). This will be conducted following a modified
      Bayesian Optimal Interval Design (mBOIN) design. For the purpose of dose escalation,
      dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) will be collected and assessed for a period of 28 days (the
      DLT evaluation period).

      A phase 2 dose expansion part will follow the phase 1 dose escalation. In phase 2, patients
      will be stratified according to whether they have platinum sensitive or platinum-resistant
      SCLC. Phase 2 will assess the long term safety and tolerability of nivatrotamab as well as
      the clinical activity of nivatrotamab when administered at the obtained MTD/RP2D in phase 1.
