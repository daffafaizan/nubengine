      individuals with MS manage their pain. We conducted a time series design in which MS subjects
      received all four treatment conditions in two orders (randomly assigned): (1) Control
      (education intervention-CONT),Self-Hypnosis Training (HYP), Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      (CBT), HYP-CBT(a combination of HYP and CBT) and (2) CONT, CBT, HYP, HYP-CBT. Subjects
      attended 16 60-minute treatment sessions conducted by one of the study's psychologists either
      at the UW,HMC or in the subject's home. Each subject received four treatment sessions of each
      treatment module listed above. Primary outcome measures were collected via the telephone and
      mail by research personnel blind to the treatment condition before treatment, immediately
      after treatment ends and one month after treatment ends. Secondary outcome measures were
      collected at the same assessment points via pencil and paper interviews completed by
      subjects.
