      years after transfusion in the recipient, has been observed in approximately 10-15% of
      transfused trauma patients. Previous studies suggest that the microchimeric cells include
      multiple immunophenotypes of leukocytes (CD4+, CD8+, CD15+, and CD19+) and that they can
      persist for decades, features suggestive of hematopoietic engraftment.

      In this study, ten subjects known to have long-term microchimerism will undergo either
      leukapheresis (a blood filtering procedure) or collection of a 500 mL whole blood sample (the
      amount of a standard blood donation). These samples will then be analyzed to determine
      whether the microchimeric (donor) cells include hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+) and
      precursor cells in the red blood cell, white blood cell, and platelet lineages.
