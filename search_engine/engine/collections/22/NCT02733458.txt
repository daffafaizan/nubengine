      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) with relatively high incidence in China. Radiotherapy alone for
      stage IE/IIE diseases has good response rate but with high relapse rates, ranging from
      20-50%. The combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy improved the long-term survival for
      patients with stage IE/IIE diseases. But the optimal treatment schedule has not been
      established. This study is designed with two cycles GELAD chemotherapy, followed by 50-56Gy
      radiotherapy, and completed with additional two cycles GELAD chemotherapy. The efficacy and
      safety of this sandwiched chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of stage IE/IIE ENKTCL will be
      measured.
