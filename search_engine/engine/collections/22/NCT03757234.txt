      study. Based on review of the efficacy and microbiology data, the DMC modified the
      randomization algorithm, and no further participants were enrolled in the following treatment
      arms after May 2019: the omadacycline 200 iv/100 iv, omadacycline 200 iv/300 po or 100 iv,
      and omadacycline 200 iv/450 po or 100 iv arms. After this change, participants were
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the omadacycline 200 iv/200 iv or levofloxacin arms.
