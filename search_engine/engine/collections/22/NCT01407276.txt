    
      In Part I, three panels of 6 participants each will be enrolled with varying degrees of renal
      disease (mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment) based on their estimated glomerular
      filtration rate (eGFR). Each of these panels will be matched with a corresponding panel of
      equal number of healthy, age-, race-, BMI- and gender-matched control participants. All
      panels will receive a single oral dose of 3-mg omarigliptin, followed by plasma sampling and
      urine collection. In Part II, 6 participants with end stage renal disease (ESRD) requiring
      hemodialysis will receive a single 3-mg oral dose of omarigliptin immediately following
      hemodialysis (HD) (Period 1) and 2 hours prior to HD (Period 2).There will be approximately 1
      month between Period 1 and Period 2. A corresponding panel of equal number, healthy matched
      control subjects (age, race, BMI, gender) will also receive a single 3 mg dose by mouth.
      Omarigliptin dose administration will be followed by plasma sampling for both panels.
