      I. The primary goal of this study is to estimate the rate of grade 3 or higher acute
      toxicities observed during a 6 month period following CyberKnife radiosurgery for gynecologic
      cancers.

      II. To evaluate clinical response to radio-surgery for gynecologic tumors.

      III. To assess general and site specific quality of life (using SF-12, FACT-En, FACT-O,
      FACT-Cx or FACT-V) and to evaluate patient's level of pain.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. As a secondary objective, toxicities during the 2 years following CyberKnife radiosurgery
      will also be described.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 3 fractions of CyberKnife stereotactic radiosurgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months.
