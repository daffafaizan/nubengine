      patients in medical intensive care unit.In the intervention group, patients fulfilling
      inclusion criteria and not presenting any of the exclusion criteria will receive high-flow
      nasal cannula (Optiflow Airvo2, Fisher & Paykel Healthcare Ltd., New Zealand) after
      extubation. The oxygen concentration (FiO2) will be set to reach an oxygenation target
      similar to control patients (see below), while the gas flow rate will be set at 50 L/min.In
      the control group, patients fulfilling inclusion criteria and not presenting any of the
      exclusion criteria will receive standard oxygen therapy including nasal cannula or oxygen
      mask after extubation. The FiO2 will be set to obtain a arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2)
      between 92% and 98% (or between 88% and 95% in hypercapnic patients). NIPPV or intubation
      will be applied in both group if respiratory distress noted. High flow nasal cannula will be
      tried before NIPPV or intubation in the control group patients.
