      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of the
      combination of selinexor, carfilzomib, and dexamethasone in relapsed and relapsed/refractory
      multiple myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine safety and tolerability.

      II. Determine the efficacy, as measured by the rates of stable disease or better (including
      minimal response, partial response, very good partial response, complete response, and
      stringent complete response).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of selinexor and carfilzomib.

      Patients receive selinexor orally (PO), carfilzomib intravenously (IV), and dexamethasone PO
      QD or IV. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months for 2 years.
