      cancer, etc. Recently, an endoscopically applicable radiofrequency probe, HabibTM EndoHBP
      catheter, was approved for clinical use. It uses bipolar electrical energy for tissue
      coagulation and can be easily applied during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography
      (ERCP). Endobiliary radiofrequency can destruct the tumor tissue and has potential benefit
      for controlling tumour growth. Several cohort studies have been published and the feasibility
      and safety of such technique has been proved.

      The aims of this study is to conduct a randomised, controlled, multicentre clinical trial to
      compare the effect of endobiliary RFA plus biliary stenting with only biliary stenting in
      patients with unresectable cholangiocarcinoma or ampullary carcinoma.

      The objectives are

        -  To evaluate whether endobiliary RFA prior to biliary stenting can improve the patients'
           survival as compared to the only stenting therapy.

        -  To assess the impact of RFA on the stent's patency.
