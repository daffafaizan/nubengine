      supplementation on endometriosis symptom remediation. Adolescent and young adults females
      aged 12 to 25 years with a surgically-confirmed diagnosis of endometriosis will be eligible
      for study participation. Subjects will be excluded if they have concurrent chronic illnesses
      that affect gastrointestinal absorption of nutrients (e.g., celiac disease, IBD, cystic
      fibrosis), a history of renal stones, are pregnant, or non-English speaking. Once consented,
      subjects will be randomized to one of 3 treatment assignments: 1) vitamin D3 2000 IU daily
      (n=30), 2) fish oil 1000 mg daily (n=30), 3) placebo (n=30) and will take these daily for 6
      months. Baseline nutrient intake from food and supplements will be assessed using the Food
      Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ). The 142 item survey assesses usual dietary intake during the
      past year. Validated rating scales including the visual analog scale (VAS), SF-36, and the
      World Endometriosis EPHect questionnaires will be used to measure pain and overall quality of
      life. The SF-36 measures 8 health concepts relevant across disease groups, including
      limitations to physical or social activities because of health problems, vitality, and
      general health perception. Patients will complete a full review of medication usage, past
      medical history, family history, and other lifestyle factors. Anthropometrics will be
      measured, and vital signs obtained. Measures will be repeated at 3-month intervals for a
      total of 6 months. Blood will be drawn at baseline, and at 6 months to measure levels of
      fatty acids, vitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and calcium.
