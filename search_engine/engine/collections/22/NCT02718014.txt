      post-menopausal women with periodontitis following non-surgical therapy.

      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Periodontal status was measured by Periodontal index (PRI), and oral
      hygiene status was measured by plaque index (PI). Both the parameters were measured at
      baseline i.e before Scaling and Root Planing (SRP) and after 3 months intervals post
      treatment. SRP was done in both pre&post menopause groups.
