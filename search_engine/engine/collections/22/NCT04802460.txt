      office hysteroscopies using a 100mm Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).

      A secondary aim will be to monitor heart rate for patients using virtual reality versus the
      controls during the procedure. Another secondary aim will be to time the length of the
      procedure as it is possible if pain perception is reduced, the procedure can be completed
      faster. Lastly, we would also want to evaluate both patient and surgeon satisfaction of the
      procedure with or without virtual reality by using a satisfaction questionnaire to assess for
      patients satisfaction with the procedure, with the VR intervention, perceived realism of VR
      game, and measure simulator sickness related to the VR game.
