      Given the favourable activity of fluoropyrimidines (5Fluorouracil) which inhibit thymidylate
      synthase (TS) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the investigators hypothesized that TAS-102 may
      demonstrate efficacy in NPC through targeting TS as well as an additional mechanism of
      incorporating trifluridine triphosphate into DNA.

      OBJECTIVES OF TRIAL

        1. To determine the clinical efficacy of TAS-102 in recurrent and metastatic NPC

        2. To assess the safety and tolerability of TAS-102 in the study population of R/M NPC

        3. To study the pharmacokinetics of TAS-102 in the study population of R/M NPC

        4. To study potential predictive biomarkers for clinical benefit from TAS-102
