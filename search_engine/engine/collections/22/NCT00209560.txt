      dose levels of AQUAVAN® Injection and fentanyl citrate injection will be investigated to
      produce a desired sedation level in patients undergoing minor surgical and/or therapeutic
      procedures. A desired sedative dose/dose range and dosing paradigm will be identified based
      on pre-set criteria using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (OAA/S).
      The desired sedative dose/dose range and dosing paradigm of AQUAVAN® Injection is defined as
      one that consistently provides mild to moderate sedation (Modified OAA/S between 2 and 4
      inclusive) in majority of patients who are pre-medicated with fentanyl citrate injection.

      Midazolam is the most widely used i.v. agent for minimal-to-moderate sedation. The dose range
      of midazolam to induce minimal to moderate sedation was based on standard clinical practice.

      [new paragraph] All patients were pre-medicated with fentanyl citrate as an analgesic.

      The outpatient setting has become increasingly popular for various types of medical
      procedures requiring sedation. In outpatient minor surgical procedures, sedation agents are
      used to provide mild-to-moderate sedation and are used with other medicines for pain
      management. Surgeons have searched for alternative treatments to use in the outpatient
      setting that would provide a faster recovery time with minimal post-procedure amnesia. This
      injection is used following pretreatment with fentanyl citrate for pain management.
