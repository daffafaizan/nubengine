      Each subject came to the Liege University Hospitals' isokinetic lab. Each session began with
      strapping the subjet into the isokinetic machine, making sure that all the settings were
      adapted to the subject. Then, each subject underwent a concentric and eccentric isokinetic
      test of their lower limbs (dominant or non-dominant side depending on their group). Subjects
      then received either anodal tDCS, of sham tDCS. Neither the evaluator or the subject knew
      which they were receiving. Immediately following tDCS, there was a another isokinetic test,
      and 30 minutes after the second test, a subjects underwent a third test.
