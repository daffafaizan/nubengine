      (cohabiting caregivers and people with dementia) across 5 countries. Caregivers allocated to
      the music or reading intervention groups will be given three 2-hour training sessions in the
      allocated intervention. They will be asked to deliver the intervention to the person they are
      caring for 5x weekly for 3 months. Data will be collected prior to implementing the
      intervention, during the intervention (via diaries kept by the caregivers), after the last
      week of implementing the intervention and 3-months after implementing the intervention.

      The investigators will explore whether caregiver-delivered music or reading activities
      improve behavioural and psychological symptoms for people living with dementia. The
      researchers will also seek to find out the impact on other aspects of both the person with
      dementia and their caregiver's quality of life and well being. Additionally, costs associated
      with the care of the person with dementia will be evaluated to determine cost-effectiveness
      of delivering a music intervention.
