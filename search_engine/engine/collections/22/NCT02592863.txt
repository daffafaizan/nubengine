      the inner ear. Studies have shown that when the blood flow is decreased to the inner ear,
      patients will become dizzy and off balance. This study will use validated instruments to
      evaluate the effectiveness of Trental in patients that present to our providers with vertigo,
      dizziness, or imbalance and meet inclusion criteria. They will be blinded and randomized to
      treatment or placebo, which they will take for ~12 weeks. Patients will completed validated
      surveys 3 times (beginning, middle and end of study) as well as account for the number of
      times they have fallen and if they have missed any work due to their symptoms.
