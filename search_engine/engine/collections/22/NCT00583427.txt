      addition to the regular medications the subject is on. There will be no change in these other
      medications. The subject will also be asked to have blood tests each month to follow kidney
      function. The frequency of these tests is the normal/standard frequency for persons with MPGN
      II/DDD and is neither increased nor decreased because of participation in this study. The
      study will occur over 6 months for each subject.
