      administered in multiple oral gel doses to adolescent and adult dental subjects. Subjects
      will be assigned to three study cohorts and receive 2 different volumes of C16G2 Gel or
      Placebo. Prior to commencing enrollment of subjects 12-17 years of age, a safety only cohort
      of 4-8 adolescent subjects will receive 4 study drug administrations on Day 0. A safety data
      review will be performed by the Medical Monitor on Days 1 and 5. If no safety concerns are
      identified, enrollment of adolescent subjects receiving 7 days of study drug administration
      will be initiated in Study Arms 1 & 2. Enrollment of adult subjects in Study Arms 1 & 2 may
      start before the Adolescent Safety Only Cohort is initiated. Before dosing of study drug,
      eligible subjects will undergo professional dental prophylaxis on Day 0. Microbiology will be
      assessed by measuring S. mutans and total bacteria counts.
