    
      Hypothesis: Polycaprolactone / Tricalcium Phosphate (PCL / TCP) Orbital Implant is as
      effective in the reconstruction of the Orbital walls as Titanium Mesh

      In this study we will be conducting a randomised trial to compare implants made of 2
      materials for Orbital reconstruction

        -  Polycaprolactone / Tricalcium Phosphate (PCL / TCP)

        -  Titanium

      Patients to be recruited :

        -  80 randomised equally into the 2 groups

        -  age range: 21 -70

        -  includes orbital wall defects from trauma confirmed by Computer Tomographic (CT) scans,
           after osteotomies

        -  excludes patients with Diabetes Mellitus, known allergies to polycaprolactone & its
           analogues, know allergies to Tricalcium Phosphate & its analogues, infections
           generalised & around the orbital region

      Trial Duration : April 2010 - March 2015

      Follow up:

        -  postoperative 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months

        -  Computer Tomographic (CT) scan of Orbits immediate postoperative and at 12 months
           appointment

        -  all patients will be seen & assessed in the Plastic & Ophthalmology outpatient clinics
           by Principal Investigator (PI) and collaborators

      End point :

        -  endpoint for follow-up is 12 months

        -  all patients are assessed for assessed for diplopia, enophthalmos, exophthalmos, visual
           acuity, mobility of the globe, contour symmetry

        -  all patients will have a Computer Tomographic (CT) scan of the orbits at 12 months to
           assess the bony orbit & orbital volume

        -  patients will be discharged from follow up at 12 months if asymptomatic

        -  patients with complications will exit the protocol & will be treated on their merits eg.
           infection - removal of implant, etc
