    
      As part of the Conditions of Approval of Cartiva SCI for the treatment of first MTP
      osteoarthritis, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires additional long term data to
      evaluate the long term safety and effectiveness of Cartiva including the durability and
      survivorship of the implant. This Post-Approval Study (PAS) addendum is intended to
      supplement the initial 24 months follow up period and provide additional long term safety and
      effectiveness data on Cartiva
