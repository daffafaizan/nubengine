    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, single site study that uses an fMRI
      measurement to assess brain activation during attention and reading tasks and the effects of
      atomoxetine in reducing symptoms of ADHD in participants with ADHD and comorbid dyslexia.
      Similar assessments are performed in two additional groups of participants with ADHD only and
      dyslexia only to determine to what extent symptomatic change in the comorbid ADHD & dyslexia
      is achieved independently by atomoxetine effects on either condition. A healthy control group
      of non-ADHD, non-dyslexia subjects (20) will be included to monitor practice effects &
      effects of treatment that may be interpreted as normal maturation. The healthy control group
      will not be treated with any study medications.
