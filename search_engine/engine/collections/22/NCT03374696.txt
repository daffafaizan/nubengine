      Research shows that reasons behind increased chlamydia include youths taking more sexual
      risks, due to altered attitudes and sexual behaviors. Since only condoms protect against both
      sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and unwanted pregnancy, the goal of the World Health
      Organization (WHO) chlamydia prevention program is to increase condom use. Research suggests
      that school is the most important arena for sex education, reaching all youths early in life,
      when many values on sex and relationships are instilled. International studies on theater in
      sex education indicate effects like increased knowledge on the topic, and partially changed
      attitudes and behaviors among youths. Furthermore, several studies show that youths feel
      theater is a good method for sex education and a supplement to standard education.
