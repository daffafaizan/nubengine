      atmosphere prior to Target-controlled Infusion (TCI). Forty eight TCI, using 50 μg/ml or 20
      μg/ml of remifentanil diluents, were performed targeting 4.0 ng/ml of effect site
      concentration (Ceff), with or without PRIMING. Using simulations, the gravimetrical
      measurements of the delivered infusates reproduced actual predicted concentrations.
