      - To evaluate changes from baseline in LVM at V5 (24M)

      2.Secondary objectives

        1. To evaluate changes from baseline in LV global longitudinal strain at V5 (24M)

        2. To evaluate changes from baseline in E/E' (E: early diastolic LV inflow velocity, E':
           early diastolic mitral annulus velocity) at V5 (24M)

        3. To evaluate changes from baseline in LV volumes, a stroke volume index and LV ejection
           fraction at V5 (24M)

        4. To evaluate a rate of disease progression

             -  In case of Aortic stenosis (AS), to evaluate changes from baseline in Aortic Valve
                Area (AVA), Vmax, Mean Pressure Gradient (PG) and Valvulo-arterial impedance (Zva)
                at V5 (24M)

             -  In case of Aortic regurgitation (AR), to evaluate changes from baseline in Vena
                contracta at V5 (24M)

        5. To evaluate changes from baseline in blood pressure at V2(6M), V3(12M), V4(18M) and
           V5(24M)

        6. To evaluate a cumulative incidence rate for each visit time point

             -  Death, Cardiovascular(CV) death, Heart Failure(HF), Myocardial Infarction(MI),
                Hospitalization, Aortic Valve Replacement(AVR)

        7. To evaluate outcomes of adverse events, physical examination, vital signs (pulse) and
           laboratory tests (hematological examination, blood biochemical examination, urine test
           and pregnancy test)
