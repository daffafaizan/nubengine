      after implantation and at 3 and 6-months follow-up. AV-delay optimization will be performed
      using aortic VTI measured by continuous wave Doppler in a modified 4-chamber view. During
      optimisation aortic VTI will be measured at different heart rates reached by increasing
      atrial pacing 10, 20 and 30 beats above intrinsic heart rate (IHR).
