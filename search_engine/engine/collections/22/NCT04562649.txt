      antiretroviral therapy (ART) which has transformed HIV from a terminal diagnosis to a
      manageable chronic condition. Despite widespread availability of ART in the United States
      (US), many of the country's approximate 1.1 million PLWH are not fully benefitting from ART
      due to poor adherence. These suboptimal HIV health outcomes occur at a time when clinicians
      have limited time and the US healthcare system remains fragmented, further exacerbating the
      challenges inherent in the lives of underserved, marginalized groups, such as PLWH.
      Therefore, the development and evaluation of interventions using a cadre of community health
      workers (CHW) holds promise for addressing these challenges in the US. This study addresses
      limitations in current research on CHW interventions to improve viral suppression and ART
      adherence. The investigators propose to build on strong preliminary data to strengthen a
      community health worker (CHW) intervention using an existing mHealth approach, and provide
      further information regarding the successful wide-scale implementation of this combination
      intervention.
