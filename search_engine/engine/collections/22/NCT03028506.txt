      sugar and food logs were at least 75% complete. By calculating carbohydrate amounts at meals
      and snacks, as well as classifying meals and snacks as high fat, we will examine the
      correlation to higher preprandial blood glucose values and large for gestational age infants.
      Preprandial glucose levels will be reviewed, questioning whether the biggest contributor is
      the composition of the previous meal or additional snacks between meals.
