      variants, (2) 30 same-sex unaffected siblings, (3) 30 ADHD probands without DAT1 gene
      variants, who were age-, sex-, and IQ-matched to Group 1, (4) 30 same-sex unaffected siblings
      of Group 3, (5) 30 age-, sex- and IQ-matched TD controls for each of 4 groups (Groups 1, 2, 3
      & 4).

      The assessments include psychiatric interviews, self-administered questionnaires (CBCL and
      SNAP-IV for ADHD and behavioral problems; the SAICA for school and social function),
      neurocognitive assessments (WISC-III-R or WAIS-III for intelligence, Conner's CPT for
      sustained attention, inhibition, and vigilance, CANTAB for executive functions and
      visuo-spatial memory), and MRI assessments (Structural MRI, DSI and rsfMRI).

      Brain Imaging: (1) Structural MRI (T1- and T2-weighted images), DSI and rsfMRI data will be
      acquired on a 3T MRI system with a 32-channel head coil. DSI employs a pulsed-gradient
      spin-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence by applying 102 diffusion gradient vectors and
      the maximum diffusion sensitivity = 4000 s/mm2, and rsfMRI is a 6-minute scan using a
      gradient-echo EPI sequence with 180 volumes. (2) Structural connectivity analysis: DSI
      tractography will be performed using in-house software (DSI studio,
      http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org/Home). Tracts-of-interest in the frontostriatal circuit and
      the frontoparietal circuit will be identified, and tract-specific analysis will be used to
      analyze the microstructural integrity along individual tract bundles. (3) Functional
      connectivity analysis: SPM8 program and in-house MATLAB codes will be used for analyses of
      rsfMRI data. Region-of-interests (ROIs) will be placed in the nodes of the corresponding
      circuits according to an anatomical template (WFU_PickAtlas 3.03). These ROIs will serve for
      tract determination in the tractography procedure and for seed regions in which BOLD signals
      are extracted for regression analysis among nodes.
