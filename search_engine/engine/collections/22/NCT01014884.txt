      interventions that focus on five key areas: care transitions, self-management, care
      coordination, pharmacy and prevention, all designed to support high-risk Medicare members and
      their relationship with their primary care providers. If the study proves to reduce
      hospitalizations in the senior population, it could provide important guidance for future
      efforts to reduce the cost and improve the quality of care for seniors with chronic
      conditions.
