        -  Establish a tissue/specimen bank of biologic specimens collected from patients with
           proven or suspected head and neck cancer.

        -  Establish a database to link materials acquisition and pathologic and clinical
           information on these patients.

        -  Correlate clinical-pathological findings on these patients with future scientific
           studies using the patient database.

        -  Test new hypotheses as they emerge.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, multicenter study.

      Patients enrolled on active Radiation Therapy Oncology Group clinical trials undergo biopsy
      or surgical resection of head and neck tumors or premalignant lesions at participating
      institutions. Tissue and other specimens collected at the time of biopsy or surgery are
      submitted to the Head and Neck Cancer Tissue/Specimen Bank which acts as a central repository
      for processing, storing, and preserving patient specimens for translational research. Tissue
      samples include paraffin-embedded blocks or fresh or frozen samples of normal squamous
      mucosa, tumors, or premalignant lesions of the upper aerodigestive tract. Other specimens for
      tissue banking include serum, plasma, and lymphocytes isolated from peripheral blood, as well
      as samples of patient saliva. Cells obtained from tissue bank specimens may also be used to
      establish cell lines for future research.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An unlimited number of specimens will be accrued for this study.
