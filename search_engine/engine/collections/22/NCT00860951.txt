      tools are called brain computer interfaces (BCIs). BCIs would let a person use brain signals
      to operate technology. The investigators want to make a BCI that can be used to operate
      commercially available technologies for communication, environmental control or computer
      access. The BCI would replace a keyboard to let people operate these technologies without
      moving. However, the investigators need people to test the BCI so that the investigators can
      see how well it can replace a keyboard. The investigators want to understand how well it can
      work so that the investigators can make it useful for people who are paralyzed. The
      investigators will ask people to use the BCI to do things like make a communication system
      speak or type words on a computer.
