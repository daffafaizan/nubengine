      They will be exposed to Oxford St. or to Hyde Park for 2 hours each, at a walking pace. Real
      time exposure to PM2.5, carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide will be made each time. Health
      outcome measurements will be made before and after exposure to each street. Statistical
      analyses will be made to examine the effect of diesel exposure on changes in health outcome
      measures.
