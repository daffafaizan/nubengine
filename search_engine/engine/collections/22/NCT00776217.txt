      two-period, single-dose, crossover, bioavailability study on loratadine formulation comparing
      loratadine 10 mg orally disintegrating tablets of Ohm Laboratories, Inc. (a subsidiary of
      Ranbaxy pharmaceuticals Inc, USA) with Claritin® Reditabs® 10 mg tablet (containing
      loratadine 10 mg) of Schering- Plough Healthcare Product Inc, in healthy, adult, male, human
      subjects under fasting condition.

      A single oral dose of loratadine 10 mg orally disintegrating tablets was orally administered
      under low light condition during each period of the study under the supervision of a trained
      Medical Officer. Subjects were instructed to let the tablets completely dissolve on the
      tongue before swallowing the saliva and then, 240 mL of water was administered 30 seconds
      after drug administration.

      During the course of the study safety parameters assessed were vital signs, clinical
      examination, medical history and clinical laboratory safety tests (hematology, biochemical
      parameters and urine analysis) at baseline. Laboratory parameters of hematology and
      biochemistry were repeated at the end of the study.

      A total of 80 subjects were randomized to receive a single oral dose of the test or reference
      formulation for loratadine 10 mg. Seventy-four subjects completed both the periods of the
      study.
