      reported incidences varied from 15% to 20%. The development of postpartum depression produces
      harmful effects not only on mothers, but also on infants and young children. Prenatal
      depression or high depression score is an independent risk factor for the development of
      postpartum depression.

      Ketamine is commonly used as an general anesthetic. In addition, low-dose ketamine is
      recommended for antidepressant therapy. We hypothesize that low-dose ketamine has a
      therapeutic effect on parturients with prenatal depression. However, evidences in this aspect
      are insufficient. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether low-dose ketamine
      administered during cesarean delivery can decrease the incidence of postpartum depression in
      parturients with prenatal depression.
