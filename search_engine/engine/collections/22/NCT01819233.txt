        1. Investigate the feasibility of a clinical trial administering ionizing radiation with
           concurrent caloric restriction (CR) for the treatment of breast cancer.

           SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

        2. Investigate measurable changes of patient characteristics and tissue and serum from CR
           conditions to determine a metric for evaluating this treatment in future studies.

      OUTLINE:

      Beginning 2-4 weeks after completion of lumpectomy, patients receive food diaries to complete
      for 7-10 days. Dietary counselors then give patients guidelines for dietary modifications to
      reduce caloric intake by 25% of their normal diet. Patients follow caloric restricted diet
      for 10 weeks (2 weeks prior to radiation therapy, during 6 weeks of radiation therapy, and at
      least 2 weeks after radiation therapy). Patients undergo radiation therapy once daily (QD) 5
      days a week for 6 weeks.
