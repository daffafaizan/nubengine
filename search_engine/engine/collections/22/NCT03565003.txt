    
      Dose escalation study phase is designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      according to a 3+3 design and recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and to characterize the
      safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics (PK) profile of JAB-3068. Other dose regimens may
      be explored based on the analysis of emerging PK and safety data. at this study phase,
      JAB-3068 dministered orally once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) or once every other day
      (QOD) in 28-day treatment cycles to adult patients with advanced solid tumors,
