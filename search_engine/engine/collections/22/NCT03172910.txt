    
      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled assessment of the efficacy and safety
      of ciraparantag administered to healthy volunteers measuring clotting times using WBCT as
      determined by the manual testing method. All subjects will undergo screening up to 36 days
      prior to enrollment.

      All enrolled subjects are to receive a single dose of 20 mg rivaroxaban in the morning on
      Days 1-3. On Day 3 (3.75 hours post rivaroxaban), subjects who have a minimum increase in
      clotting time of 25% (as measured by WBCT) are randomized and will receive a single IV dose 4
      hours after the rivaroxaban dose, followed by serial testing of manual WBCT.

      Subjects are enrolled sequentially in up to 4 ciraparantag dose cohorts. There will be a
      safety review after completion of treatment in one cohort and prior to initiation of
      treatment in the subsequent cohort.
