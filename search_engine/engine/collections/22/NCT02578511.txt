      The primary objective is to determine the maximum-tolerated dose of IXAZOMIB (MLN9708)
      (maximum of 4 mg, which is the recommended phase II dose for IXAZOMIB (MLN9708) in
      combination with standard maintenance therapy with POMP/D (methotrexate, 6- mercaptopurine,
      vincristine, prednisone/dexamethasone) and to assess the tolerability of POMP/D and IXAZOMIB
      (MLN9708) maintenance in adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, lymphoblastic
      lymphoma (LBL) or mixed phenotype acute leukemia (MPAL) in complete remission (CR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE

      To determine the three-year progression-free survival (PFS) of patients treated with oral
      IXAZOMIB (MLN9708) and standard maintenance regimen. Progression-free survival will be
      measured from the start of induction to disease relapse.

      STUDY DESIGN

      The maximum-tolerated dose of single agent IXAZOMIB was 1.76 to 2.0mg/m2 when given on a
      twice a week schedule1 and > 2.34 mg/m2 to 2.97 mg/m2 on a weekly schedule in previous
      studies.

      Three patients will be treated per dose level unless dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is
      observed. The starting dose of IXAZOMIB will be 3 mg orally on days 1, 8 and 15. If no DLT is
      seen in the first three patients, the dose will be increased to 4 mg on days 1, 8 and 15 in a
      classic 3 +3 phase I design. We will not attempt to increase the dose beyond 4 mg orally
      which, if achieved with acceptable toxicity, would be accepted as the recommended phase 2
      dose (RP2D). Zero of three DLTs would allow escalation to the next dose level. One of three
      DLTs will require expanding to six patients; one of six DLTs will allow escalation again. Two
      DLTs will require dose de-escalation. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) will be the highest
      dose administered at which no more than one DLT was observed.
