      common or occur repeatedly in different types of cancers. For some of these alterations there
      are drugs, called targeted drugs that specifically counteract the alteration. In certain
      cancer types, these targeted drugs are very effective at fighting the cancer.

      A tumor specimen that has been obtained previously or is planned to be obtained as part of
      clinical care will be used to perform tumor profiling. Additional procedures to obtain tumor
      will not be performed. An expert panel will review the results of the tumor profiling tests
      and determine whether a cancer-causing alteration is present and whether an individualized
      treatment recommendation can be made. If consent to sharing of the tumor profiling results
      and individualized treatment recommendation is provided then a study physician will discuss
      the profiling results and the individualized treatment recommendation with the primary
      oncologist. In addition, the primary oncologist will receive a letter detailing the tumor
      profiling results and the individualized treatment recommendation.
