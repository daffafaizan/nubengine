      technology), with the rich medical history available in Electronic Health Records (EHR) will
      allow a truly customized, interactive, and automated personal healthcare assistant. This
      technology will be validated in patients who have chronic heart failure (HF). Half of the
      study patients will receive an Amazon Echo Dot (Alexa) enhanced with a HF Care custom Alexa
      Skill that is patient-specific, or Alexa+. Data on patient interactions with the device will
      be followed for three months. The control groups will receive standard of care (SOC) HF
      management. Both study and control groups will receive regular follow up from the HF nurse
      and data from all hospital or clinic visits will be captured from the EHR.
