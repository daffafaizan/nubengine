      subjects with low starting levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) who receive adequate doses
      of vitamin D are the most likely to benefit. Vitamin D supplements are being widely
      recommended, however the amount of vitamin D needed to achieve the desired level of
      25-hydroxyvitamin D in the circulation varies widely among individuals. In this randomized,
      placebo-controlled trial, we will determine whether treating older adults with low starting
      25OHD levels for one year with up to 1600 IU per day of vitamin D3 will improve muscle
      performance (e.g., lower extremity muscle power) and reduce muscle wasting (defined as
      reducing nitrogen excretion). Subjects in the vitamin D group will initially take 800 IU of
      vitamin D3 daily. If they have not achieved the desired level of 70 nmol/L after 4 mo, their
      dose will be doubled to 1600 IU per day for the remainder of the one-year study. The maximal
      dose of vitamin D3 to be taken in this study,1600 IU per day, is lower than the current safe
      upper limit of 4,000 IU per day set by the Institute of Medicine. Up to 100 healthy men and
      women, age 60 years and older will participate in this study. This investigation should
      increase our understanding of the impact of supplemental vitamin D on muscle performance.
