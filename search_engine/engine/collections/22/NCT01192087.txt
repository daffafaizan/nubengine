      cystic carcinoma of the head and neck. Especially combined treatment with intensity-modulated
      radiation therapy and heavy ion (C12) boost to the primary tumor or previous tumor bed could
      be established as the treatment of choice in this disease.

      Unfortunately, therapeutic results in the treatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma are still
      hampered by the occurrence of distant metastases (predominantly in the lungs) which, though
      progressing comparatively slowly, still limit the patient's life expectancy. Most adenoid
      cystic carcinomas (> 80%) though, exhibit over-expression of EGFR receptors and hence provide
      an approach for systemic treatment. In this prospective phase II trial, the application of
      the EGFR antibody cetuximab will be evaluated in combination with the established treatment
      of intensity-modulated radiation therapy plus C12 heavy ion boost.

      The trial aims at evaluation of toxicity and feasibility of the combined treatment, as
      primary endpoint, as well as local control and disease-free survival as secondary endpoints.
