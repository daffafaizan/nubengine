      adolescent depression and what is practiced. Moreover, while there is evidence that
      measurement-based care can improve outcomes for adults with various mental health conditions,
      there is limited information on this framework in adolescent depression.

      Objective: Our study aims to enhance the implementation of evidence-based care (using the
      NICE Clinical Practice Guidelines as a template) combined wtih measurement-based care through
      the use of an Integrated Care Pathway (ICP) in adolescents with depression.

      Hypothesis: As this is a pilot study, our hypotheses centre around feasibility. We
      hypothesize that: (1) we will recruit at least 30 participants to the ICP treatment arm and
      30 participants at the "treatment-as-usual" arm at a different site (2) that baseline
      measures will be fully completed by 95% of adolescents recruited, (3) that baseline measures
      will take 2 hours to complete for adolescents and 1 hour to complete for caregivers, (4) that
      a mean of 90% of the key aspects of the treatment protocol are followed in the ICP group (5)
      that 80% of participants recruited will complete measures at the end of the 20-week interval
      and that (6) 90% of the youth, caregivers and clinicians who partake int eh study will attend
      a focus group to provide qualitative feedback on their experience.

      Design: This is a non-randomized controlled clinical trial. Randomizing at the individual
      level is not possible - the intervention is implemented at the clinic level; so the effect of
      the intervention on one youth within a clinic would influence the care of other youth at the
      clinic.

      Sampling: Participants are recruited from psychiatric clinics at 2 sites. Each site will
      recruit to their respective treatment arm.
