        -  Compare outcome data in children with advanced unilateral retinoblastoma with historical
           controls in order to determine whether post-enucleation chemotherapy with or without
           radiotherapy improves outcome.

        -  Determine the disease-free and overall survival of children with unilateral
           retinoblastoma with no adverse histological features who undergo observation after
           enucleation.

        -  Determine the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups
      according to histological features.

        -  Group 1 (no adverse histological features): Patients are observed and monitored for the
           development of orbital recurrence and metastatic disease.

        -  Group 2a (deep choroidal invasion and/or retrolaminar invasion of the optic nerve and
           disease in the anterior chamber): Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour,
           vincristine IV, and etoposide IV over 4 hours on day 1, and, if necessary, intrathecal
           cytarabine on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses.

        -  Group 2b (invasion of the cut end of the optic nerve): Patients receive carboplatin IV
           over 1 hour, vincristine IV, and etoposide IV over 4 hours on day 1, and, if necessary,
           intrathecal cytarabine on day 2. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses. Patients
           also undergo orbital radiotherapy 5 days a week for 4 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.
