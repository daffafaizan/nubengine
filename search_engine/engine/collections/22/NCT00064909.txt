      quantify regional cerebral blood flow (CBF). Recently, new vessel proliferation and formation
      (angiogenesis) has been observed in autopsy and biopsy specimens from patients with multiple
      sclerosis (MS). Newly formed MS lesions, showed strikingly increased numbers of new vessels
      and similar patterns were observed in and around older lesions, areas of remyelination (new
      myelin formation on axons, shadow plaques) and normal-appearing brain tissue. The purpose of
      this study is to compare CBF of MS patients, to age- and gender-matched healthy controls. CBF
      will be measured while subjects are inhaling room air and the increase in CBF while inhaling
      a mixture of room air and a known concentration of carbon dioxide (hypercapnia) will be
      compared. If significant new vessels growth has occurred in the brains of MS patients then
      this new vessel formation (neovascularization) may be reflected by a change in CBF. Comparing
      the CBF response to hypercapnia will determine if the newly formed vasculature includes
      properly functioning blood vessels. Normal cerebral blood vessels are exquisitely sensitive
      to the carbon dioxide in arterial blood and an increase in carbon dioxide causes CBF to
      increase through dilatation or relaxation of the muscles surrounding the blood vessels. In
      the future, changes in the hypercapnia-induced CBF response between MS patients and controls
      may help to monitor the treatment of the disease.
