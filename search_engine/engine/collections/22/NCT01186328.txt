      effective at blocking survivin and inhibiting survivin protein expression. Survivin plays
      pivotal roles in tumor formation by inhibiting cell death and regulating cell cycle
      progression. The primary objective is to study EZN-3042 in children with relapsed acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients will receive 2 doses of EZN-3042 (and intrathecal
      cytarabine, conditionally) prior to initiating systemic therapy with vincristine,
      doxorubicin, prednisone and PEG-asparaginase. Patients with CNS 1 or 2 will also receive
      intrathecal methotrexate, and patients with CNS 3 will also receive triple intrathecal
      therapy (methotrexate, hydrocortisone, and cytarabine). Blood and bone marrow specimens will
      be drawn to measure minimal residual disease (MRD), pharmacokinetic levels of EZN-3042 and
      survivin expression. The study will follow a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. We
      hypothesize that EZN-3042 will be safe, tolerable and biologically active, when given both
      alone and in combination with standard re-induction chemotherapy.
