      implanted at main vessel, a closure of the side-branch may occur. The re-wiring of the
      side-branch in these conditions may be difficult or even impossible. To facilitate the
      re-wiring maneuvers the operators use the jailed wired technique. For this technique a
      guide-wire is introduced in the side-branch before main vessel stent implantation; after the
      stent deployment the wire remains jailed between the vessel wall and the metallic structure
      of the stent. If the side-branch became occluded, this wire is a good landmark of it is
      position, facilitating the access with a new wire. However, the rupture of the wire has been
      described in some cases, during the retrieval maneuvers.
