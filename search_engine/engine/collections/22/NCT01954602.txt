      contrast-assisted method, in which a catheter or sphincterotome is introduced into the
      papilla in the direction of the bile duct and a contrast medium injected to confirm that the
      duct has been cannulated.

      The biliary guidewire cannulation technique consists of the introduction of a guide-wire into
      the bile duct instead of contrast injection as the first maneuver.

      The benefit of this technique, compared with classic contrast cannulation, has been
      demonstrated in several studies which show similar results and have been analyzed in a recent
      meta-analysis, including 5 studies and 1762 patients, and demonstrating that the use of the
      guide-wire technique significantly improved the primary cannulation rate from 74.9% to 85.3%.
      More importantly, significantly reduced the incidence of PEP from 8.6% to 1.6%.

      There are several variations of this technique; the tip of the sphincterotome is inserted
      initially a few millimeters through the papillary orifice and then introduce the guide-wire
      to the target ("touch technique"). Another variation is direct cannulation with the
      guide-wire hovering a few millimeters through the catheter or sphincterotome ("no touch
      technique").

      To date, there are no randomized controlled trials comparing the two above described way to
      access to biliary duct regarding efficacy and rate of complications.
