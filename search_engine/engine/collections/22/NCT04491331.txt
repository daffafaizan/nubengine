      volume, with little changes in heart rate. Mean arterial pressure (MAP) could be maintained
      by increased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) in the majority of patients.

      The aim of this study is to describe hemodynamic changes in two different surgical prone
      positions in 10 healthy non-anesthetized volunteers (flat position and using a support system
      allowing a free abdomen) by non-invasive measurement of hemodynamics (ClearSight, Edwards)
      and indirectly evaluated intra-abdominal pressure using ultrasound. The ClearSight system
      provides advanced hemodynamic parameters (cardiac index CI, stroke volume SV, stroke volume
      variation SVV, systemic vascular resistance SVR, mean arterial pressure MAP) from a finger
      cuff.
