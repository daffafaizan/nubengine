      asthma. Volunteers will also be asked to discuss their beliefs about asthma. Everyone in the
      group will be given an opportunity to answer questions. Volunteers can decide that they no
      longer want to participate in the group discussion at any time.

      The discussion will last from 1.5 - 2 hours. The focus group discussion will have a maximum
      of 10 people.

      We will be audio and video taping the discussion so that we do not miss any information that
      volunteers share with us. The audio and video tapes will not be shared with anyone outside
      our staff.

      Volunteer participation in this study is voluntary and there will be no negative consequences
      if volunteers decide not to participate. Volunteers are also free to withdraw from this study
      at any time. Withdrawal or refusal to participate will not affect health care services or
      other rights.
