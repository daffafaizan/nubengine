      immunomonitoring of serum levels of adalimumab. After ileocolic resection surgery, patients
      will have a therapeutic optimization of their adalimumab (HumiraÂ® or biosimilar) treatment,
      based on their serum residual rate of adalimumab.

      Patients in the control group will receive a standard post-operative follow-up, which is
      based on clinical and biological recurrence.
