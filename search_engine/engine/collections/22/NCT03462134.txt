      with a non-obstructive meniscal tear are under scrutiny for years. Despite the most recent
      publications recommending to apply non-operative treatment (exercise therapy, injections,
      drugs) instead of APM in this patient group, the expected decrease in number of operations is
      slower then expected. Orthopaedic surgeons therefore seem unconvinced by the evidence to
      change practice.

      For this reason the investigators conducted an international survey amongst orthopaedic
      surgeons in which the investigators aimed to (1) determine the ability of orthopaedic
      surgeons to predict the outcomes of APM and physical therapy (PT) in middle aged patients
      with a non-obstructive meniscal tear, and (2) to determine which patient factors direct
      surgeons towards APM and towards PT.
