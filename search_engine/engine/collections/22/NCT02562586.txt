      (THR) were included in this study. Patients with previous hip surgeries and coagulation
      disorders were not included. All patients were submitted to a non-cemented Total Hip
      Replacement (THR) through a Hardinge's approach. Before wound closure, a nurse opened an
      envelope containing the patient randomization: group 1 - with closed suction drainage (CSD)
      and group 2 - without closed suction drainage (CSD). In the group 1, a sub-fascial suction
      drain was used, and kept for 24 hours. Data collected included: mid-tigh circumference after
      24 hours, blood transfusion, inflammatory blood markers C-Reactive Protein (CRP), Erythrocyte
      sedimentation rate (ESR) and leucogram, Harris Hip Score (HHS) after 3 months, and
      complications. Patients were followed for 3 months post operatively.
