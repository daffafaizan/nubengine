      criteria received individualized diet meal plan and nutritional orientation for 12 weeks
      according to their nutritional diagnosis. Patients were evaluated three times with an
      interval of 30 days between each visit. Clinical, anthropometric measurements (weight,
      height, waist circumference and body composition assessed by bioelectrical impedance
      analysis) and food evaluations were performed. Nutritional orientations were strengthened in
      each visit. The diet prescription did not change during intervention period. The diet quality
      of the patients was assessed through the Brazilian Healthy Eating Index - Revised (BHEI-R)
      version. Migraine severity was assessed with the Headache Impact Test (HIT) and the Migraine
      Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS). Depressive symptoms were also evaluated with the Beck
      Depression Inventory (BDI).
