      virus set point. Virus set point is different for each patient and can be a predictor for
      disease progression. Preliminary studies indicate that early, short-term antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) given to people newly infected with HIV may lead to lower virus set points and
      preserved CD4 counts. However, the length of short-term treatment needed to balance the
      possible adverse effects of ART with the achievement of lower virus set point is not yet
      known. By lowering the virus set point and maintaining CD4 counts, the need for long-term ART
      may be postponed. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of a
      short course of ART on producing a lower virus set point in adults recently infected with
      HIV.

      This study will last at least 28 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two
      arms. Arm A will receive ART for 12 weeks as emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate
      (TDF/FTC) daily and lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/RTV) in tablet form twice daily. After 12 weeks,
      treatment will be interrupted unless the CD4 count is measured to be less than 350 cells/mm^3
      on two consecutive occasions during treatment interruption. If that occurs therapy will be
      resumed. Participants in Arm B will receive no treatment until cluster of differentiation 4
      (CD4) counts drop below 350 cells/mm^3, indicating ART is needed. Study visits will occur at
      study entry, at Weeks 2 and 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter. At each study visit, a physical
      exam, blood collection, and completion of an adherence questionnaire will occur. Participants
      are encouraged to enroll in a related substudy that will evaluate HIV viral load in genital
      secretions.
