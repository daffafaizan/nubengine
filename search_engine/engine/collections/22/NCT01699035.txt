      perspective on return to work. The survey development included qualitative analysis of a set
      of interviews with stroke survivors to arrive at the critical elements described above,
      followed by item development with an expert panel and preliminary testing of the wording and
      format for legibility. The survey is being administered both on-line and by paper through the
      mail to a wide range of survivors with the objective of obtaining a large, diverse sample.
      The ultimate goal of the project is to arrive at a refined set of recommendations to inform
      stroke survivors, health care professionals and employers to increase their sensitivity to
      the needs and desires of individual attempting to return to work after stroke.
