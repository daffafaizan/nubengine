      The present proposal seeks to compare the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal safety and
      effectiveness of a strategy of initial randomisation to treatment with the selective COX-2
      inhibitor celecoxib or to 'usual-care' with their current non-selective NSAID therapy (with
      or without cyto-protection with ulcer healing drug use in either celecoxib or 'usual-care'
      limbs).

      Trial Design

      This trial utilises the Prospective Randomised Open Blinded End point (PROBE) design .
      Patients with clinically diagnosed osteoarthritis (OA) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 60 years
      of age or more who are free from established cardiovascular disease and who require chronic
      NSAID therapy will be identified in the setting of primary care. Patients will be randomised
      to receive either celecoxib or to continue their previous standard NSAID therapy. They will
      then be followed up for an average of 4.2 years in the setting of the local National
      Healthcare system. The study will terminate when 277 adjudicated cardiovascular events have
      accrued. A summary is shown in the diagram below.
