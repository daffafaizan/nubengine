      escalations to assess safety, tolerability, and pharmacodynamic effect of EDP1066. Since this
      clinical study is the first study in humans, the participants will be healthy volunteers or
      subjects with mild to moderate psoriasis or atopic dermatitis who are otherwise well.
      Investigation of EDP1066 in this patient population provides an opportunity to gain
      pharmacodynamic information using a range of tissue biopsies and composite clinical
      endpoints.
