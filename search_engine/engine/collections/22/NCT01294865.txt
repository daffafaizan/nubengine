      presentation of neonatal infection is subtle and nonspecific. Microbiologic cultures of
      clinical specimens, the gold standard for diagnosis, have low sensitivity and are not
      available in time to influence initial therapy. Therefore, reliable and rapid in vitro tests
      are needed for early diagnosis and management of infection in neonates. suPAR, secreted from
      the cells (neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells) has recently been
      reported to be a potential biomarker for several infection diseases. The levels of suPAR have
      not been studied in newborn infants yet.
