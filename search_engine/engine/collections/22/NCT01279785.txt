    
      This is an exploratory, single arm, open label pilot study evaluation of 123I-MIP-1072
      intraprostatic uptake determination by SPECT/CT imaging (and optional CGCP imaging), with
      histological confirmation of disease localization and staging. Methodical evaluation of
      123I-MIP-1072 in intraprostatic tumorous and non-tumours regions will provide important
      preliminary data upon which further clinical studies can be based. The optional additional
      CGCP imaging was added, because of its inherent potential for higher resolution scintigraphic
      detection of 123I-MIP-1072 localization. This imaging feasibility data will provide important
      preliminary information for the use of CGCP imaging in prostate cancer.
