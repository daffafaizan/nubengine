      verify the algorithm when the mobile video reads a patients pulse rate and respiratory rate
      while spontaneously breathing. There is no facial recognition technology. There is no
      immediate feedback given to the research team to act upon or provide for further clinical
      care decisions. In real time, the mCVI® device will be compared to two commercially-available
      Masimo pulse oximeter devices in a single visit.
