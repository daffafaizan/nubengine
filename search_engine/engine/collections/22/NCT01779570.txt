    
      Objectives: (1) We aim to investigate the anti-inflammatory effects of macrolide treatment in
      patients with influenza LRTI and the impact on viral clearance. (2) To investigate the impact
      of macrolide treatment on influenza symptom and disease resolution.

      Design: A randomized, open-label, multicenter study.

      Settings: Acute medical facilities in 3 general public hospitals in Hong Kong.

      Subjects, Sampling and Intervention: Adult (>/=18 years) patients hospitalized for
      virologically confirmed influenza LRTI who fulfill the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      randomized to receive (1) azithromycin 500 mg p.o. for 5 days (in addition to antiviral, as
      part of usual care), or (2) no azithromycin (ie, antiviral alone, part of usual care) after
      informed consent. Serial blood samples will be collected for cytokine/inflammatory response
      assays. Serial nasopharyngeal swabs will be collected to assess for viral clearance.
      Symptoms, clinical progress, radiography and adverse events will be monitored.
