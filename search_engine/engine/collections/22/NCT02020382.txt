    
      RATIONAL Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) affects more than 200,000 people in France and 1.5
      million in Europe. Difficulties in the management of IBD are related to the need for invasive
      tests for the diagnosis of IBD (endoscopy), partly explaining the delay in diagnosis, and the
      inability to distinguish early colonic Crohn's disease of ulcerative colitis (UC) in 10-30%
      of cases.

      Recently, we identified real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), from healthy colonic
      mucosa of IBD patients, a molecular signature of IBD involving 10 microRNA (miRNA) Common
      (miR26a, miR29a, miR29b, miR126 * miR15a, miR127-3p, miR324 -3p, miR30c, miR185, miR196a) and
      15 colic chronic disease (MC) and ulcerative colitis (RCH) discriminating microRNA
      (miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-146a, miR-146b-5p, miR150, miR-181d, miR-182, miR199a -3p,
      miR199a-5p, miR199b-5p, miR-203, miR223, miR-299-5p, miR320a, miR-328).

      TYPE OF STUDY : multicenter diagnostic evaluation Study

      MAIN PURPOSE OF THE STUDY : To evaluate the diagnostic value of microRNA in colonic IBD
      (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) in adults as compared to healthy controls (and
      non-IBD colitis)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES :

        -  assess the ability of microRNA to discriminate a colic chronic disease (MC) of
           ulcerative colitis (RCH) in adults

        -  evaluate the diagnostic value of microRNA in inflammatory colitis child

        -  explore the possibility of measuring miRNA of interest in the stool
