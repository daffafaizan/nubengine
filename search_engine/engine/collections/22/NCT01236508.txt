        1. To investigate the relationship of carotid inflammation, as measured by FDG positron
           emission tomography (PET) to standardized uptake value in atherosclerotic plaque, with
           the number of covert brain infarcts.

        2. To investigate the relationship of FDG PET standardized uptake value with the relative
           volume of white matter hyperintensity.

        3. To correlate vascular inflammation in the entire aorta and aortoiliac vessels to carotid
           inflammation and cerebral infarcts and white matter disease.
