    
      Afamelanotide is a man-made drug being studied for use as a preventative medication for EPP
      sufferers. It is a synthetically produced analogue of human alpha melanocyte stimulating
      hormone (alpha-MSH) and is not yet available on the market.

      The purpose of this study is to look at whether afamelanotide can reduce the number and
      severity of EPP symptoms when patients are exposed to light between 10:00 and 20:00 hours.
      This study will also look at how the drug is tolerated when taken by people with EPP.

      The study will involve the use of an implant, which comes in the form of a small rod to be
      administered under the skin. The implant may contain the study drug afamelanotide or a
      placebo (inactive medication).

      Over 450 subjects have been treated with afamelanotide to date with no serious safety
      concerns identified. For this study, afamelanotide has been formulated as a controlled
      release depot injection (implant). This means that the afamelanotide will be released slowly
      into the body over a few days. Once inserted, the implant will remain in the body after
      afamelanotide has been released and will slowly dissolve.

      This study will help to provide more information about afamelanotide. This information will
      be used to determine the safety and efficacy (the ability of the drug to produce an effect)
      of this drug in EPP sufferers.
