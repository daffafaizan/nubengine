      difficult to breathe. There is no cure for this disease, and it is the fourth leading cause
      of death in the United States. Symptoms include coughing, excess mucus production, shortness
      of breath, wheezing, and chest tightness. The most common risk factor for developing COPD is
      cigarette smoking; however, only 15% to 20% of smokers are diagnosed with COPD in their
      lifetimes, suggesting that some smokers are more prone to developing COPD than others.
      Elastin, a protein found in the tissues surrounding the lung airways and in the alveolar
      walls of the lung, is essential for healthy lung function. As elastin breaks down, lung
      damage can occur, potentially leading to COPD. It is thought that some people may be
      genetically predisposed to elastin damage by cigarette smoke, thus accounting for the select
      group of smokers affected by COPD. This study will examine the ways in which elastin defects
      contribute to the development of COPD. Researchers will examine whether genetic variations
      play a role in altering elastin function and in influencing health outcomes in people with
      COPD.

      This study will enroll people with COPD that was caused by emphysema. Participants will
      complete one study visit that will include a medical record and history review and blood
      collection (or saliva collection, if blood draw is unsuccessful). A portion of blood will be
      stored for future genetic research. Participants will also complete questionnaires to collect
      information on activities, health, and quality of life. Study researchers will contact
      participants at the end of the study to collect follow-up medical information.
