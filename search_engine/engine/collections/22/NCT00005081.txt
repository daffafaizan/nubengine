      recurrent or progressive glioblastoma multiforme, anaplastic astrocytoma, or gliosarcoma
      resistant to nitrosourea. II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour, followed 1 hour later by
      carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
