      functional OPRM1 A118G variant has been linked to rewarding effects of alcohol in alcohol
      users and to nicotine in female smokers. Since no previous studies examined the influence of
      the A118G variation on pure nicotine responses, the next logical step is to evaluate how this
      genetic polymorphism affects nicotine's rewarding, cognitive, and physiological effects using
      IV nicotine administration in male and female smokers. In addition, the association of the
      G398A polymorphism of the CHRNA5 gene (rs16969968) with maximal response to nicotinic
      agonists justifies examination of this SNP as a moderator of IV nicotine sensitivity in
      humans (Bierut et al. 2008). This SNP will be examined in an exploratory fashion since it is
      not feasible to fully stratify the study sample for multiple SNPs. The frequency of
      rs16969968 SNP ranges from 35%-42% among those of European ancestry, making it feasible to
      examine this variation in our subject sample.

      Currently this study is active and enrollment is continuing. Currently there are 205
      completers and on going.(June 2014)
