      involves several weeks of daily treatment sessions. Stereotactic body radiation therapy
      (SBRT) is a newer form of EBRT that gives fewer treatments but higher doses of radiation per
      treatment. In many patients there are certain areas within the prostate with more prominent
      cancerous growth (intraprostatic lesions), which may require higher doses of radiation
      (boost) to treat effectively. This study will treat the prostate with simultaneous boost(s)
      to intraprostatic lesion(s) in 5 treatments over 10-14 days.
