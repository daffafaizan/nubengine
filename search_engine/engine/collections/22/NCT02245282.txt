      OHSU on subjects with diagnosed prostate cancer. This pilot project will study 20 subjects
      prior to their next scheduled clinical procedures (biopsy or radical prostatectomy). Data
      from this project will be used to explore new capabilities of the software platform developed
      under current SBIR funding. CE-MRI will involve the use of an extracellular (Gadolinium
      based, Gd) contrast agent. When Gd is used, (dynamic-contrast-enhanced) DCE-MRI signal
      intensity time-course data will be analyzed analytically using the so called "shutter-speed"
      paradigm which takes into account of the effects of finite water exchange kinetics. Region of
      interest (ROI) and high resolution (~millimeter) parametric maps of pathophysiologic
      quantities, such as tumor vessel permeability, tumor perfusion, extracellular extravascular
      volume fraction, will be generated from the DCE-MRI data. All parameters will be compared to
      literature results for software validation and correlated with pathology for clinical
      potential.
