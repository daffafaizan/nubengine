      later in life, after high school sports has ended. However, youth in sports may provide a key
      "window of opportunity" to teach them about eating health foods if that information is tied
      to sport performance. This project will test to see if that is true.

      The virtual world is an idea medium for learning for this project. The project will test
      whether it indeed can result in behavior change more effectively than just more traditional
      face to face learning.
