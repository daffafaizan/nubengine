      There are an estimated 300,000 surgeries performed annually with a health care expenditure
      burden in excess of 2.8 billion dollars. The investigators propose a new management paradigm
      including early laparoscopic management.

      Contemporary management of SBO includes a trial of nonoperative management (TNOM) reportedly
      with resolution in upwards of 70% of patients.

      Although it is one of the most common diagnosis for surgical admissions, there are few
      prospective, clinical trials to address the question surgical timing. Additionally, there are
      no prospective, randomized trials comparing early laparoscopy versus TNOM for high grade SBO.
      The hypothesis is that early laparoscopic enterolysis will result in decreased overall
      complications, shorter length of stay, decreased health care cost, and lower conversion rate
      to open laparotomy.
