        1. Dose Escalation of AGS67E without myeloid growth factor (GF)

        2. Dose Escalation of AGS67E with myeloid growth factor (GF)

      Subjects will be enrolled sequentially into dose cohorts starting with AGS67E without GF.

      All subjects will receive a single 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion of AGS67E once every
      three weeks. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of
      AGS67E, investigator decision or consent withdrawal.

      This dose escalation will first determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AGS67E without
      GF and then determine the MTD of AGS67E with GF. Once an MTD has been established, the study
      may enroll subjects into respective expansion cohorts of 12 subjects each at doses
      recommended by the data review team (DRT) (expansion cohort without GF and/or expansion
      cohort with GF).

      During dose escalation, the Data Review Team will review cumulative unaudited data on an
      interim basis to review subject safety, recommend exploring additional doses and/or
      schedules, or the expansion of existing cohorts.
