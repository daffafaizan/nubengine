      some tumor cells. The word "over-expressed" in this situation means that there are too many
      copies of the protein on the surface of the cell when compared to a healthy, normal cell, and
      this helps the tumor continue to grow in size. Mirvetuximab soravtansine acts by targeting
      the folate receptor in tumor cells. In animal models, mirvetuximab soravtansine is highly
      effective in decreasing tumor size. This suggests that mirvetuximab soravtansine may help
      shrink or stop growth of folate receptor alpha positive breast cancer in this study.

      In this study the investigator will be looking at how folate receptor alpha expression
      changes following 2 doses of neoadjuvant mirvetuximab soravtansine. The investigator will
      also look to evaluate the safety of this regimen, measure any change in tumor size, associate
      folate receptor alpha expression with a change in tumor size, and describe any changes in
      Ki-67 and percent of apoptotic cells in this population.
