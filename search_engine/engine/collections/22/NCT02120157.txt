    
      This is a phase II prospective study designed to evaluate the incidence of 6 month non-
      relapse mortality, safety, and feasibility of haploidentical bone marrow transplantation
      (BMT) after myeloablative conditioning with post-transplant Cy. Conditioning regimens include
      a total body irradiation (TBI)-based prep for lymphoid leukemias and a chemotherapy based
      prep for myeloid leukemias.

      To estimate the incidence of non-relapse mortality at 180 days following myeloablative
      haploidentical BMT for children and young adults with high risk hematologic malignancies.
