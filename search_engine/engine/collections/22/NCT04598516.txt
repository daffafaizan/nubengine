      changes in renal function (serum creatinine) in absence of- and post- intravascular iodinated
      contrast administration, to elucidate the relationship between renal function and contrast
      administration in elective patients with eGFR <30 mL/min/1.73m2. The effects of contrast
      administration on risk of 1-month dialysis and mortality will also be evaluated.

      Daily serum creatinine assays will be done 1. during 5 days before contrast (= in absence of
      contrast), 2. during 5 days after contrast (= post-contrast), and 3. during 5 days at 1-month
      post contrast (= 1-month post contrast in absence of contrast). Baseline serum creatinine
      values will be obtained on the day before each 5-day series.

      Relevant baseline characteristics of patients will be reported to enable a detailed
      description of the study population. To explore whether the magnitude of the mean difference
      in peak change in serum creatinine before and after contrast administration depends on other
      factors, pre-planned subgroup analyses will be performed. To enable subgroup analyses, data
      will be collected on 1) prophylactic hydration (yes vs no); 2) administration route
      (intra-arterial versus intravenous contrast administration); 3) contrast volume (high vs low)
      and 4) comorbidity (presence vs absence of diabetes).
