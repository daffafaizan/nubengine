      themselves to record all significant Adverse Events (AE) related to preparative hemaphereses
      of healthy donors. All complications (phlebotomy and circulation problems, citrate toxicity,
      donor compliance, and technical complications) shall be assessed with respect to plasma-,
      platelet-, leukocyte- (stem cells, granulocytes, monocytes), and red cell aphereses as well
      as multicomponent aphereses. Study data are recorded by means of an Internet-based
      hemapheresis vigilance system. Study results will be evaluated according to the advanced
      standards of the International Haemovigilance Network (IHN). The study contributes to the
      quality assurance of each single center as it enables the comparison to other transfusion
      medicine establishments.
