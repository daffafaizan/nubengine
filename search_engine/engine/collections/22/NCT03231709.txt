    
      The drugs being tested in this study are called Trelagliptin and Alogliptin. This study will
      look at the participant's preference for treatment with Trelagliptin versus Alogliptin.

      The study enrolled 60 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups:

        -  Trelagliptin 100 mg, followed by Alogliptin 25 mg

        -  Alogliptin 25 mg, followed by Trelagliptin 100 mg All participants will be asked to take
           one tablet of trelagliptin orally once a week or one tablet of alogliptin orally once a
           day throughout the study period.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 16 weeks. Participants will make 3 visits to the clinic.
