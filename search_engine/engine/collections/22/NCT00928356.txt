      requiring CABG with suitable anatomy for combination CABG and PCI of non-bypassed arteries.

      The primary endpoint of this feasibility study is a 30-day composite of major adverse
      clinical events including death, repeat revascularization, stroke and/or myocardial
      infarction.

      The secondary endpoints include:

        1. Successful completion of same sitting CABG and coronary stent procedure

        2. Successful completion of CABG and PCI during single hospitalization

        3. Achievement of complete revascularization

        4. Patency of the LIMA and stented vessels as determined by coronary angiography at time of
           procedures or prior to discharge and by cardiac Computed Tomographic Angiography (CTA)
           or coronary angiography at 1 year.

        5. Stent thrombosis at 24 hours (acute), 30 days (sub acute), and 1 year (late)

        6. One-year composite clinical event endpoints of major clinical events including death,
           repeat revascularization, myocardial infarction, and freedom from angina

        7. Comparative analysis of hospital, 30 day, and 1 year events of hybrid CABG patients
           compared to consecutive patients undergoing off pump CABG with standard thoracotomy
           during study period
