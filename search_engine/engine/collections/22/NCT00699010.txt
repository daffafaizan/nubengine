      combination with niacin 240 mg and oxycodone HCl 40 mg alone in crossover design. 15 subjects
      were randomized to receive oxycodone/niacin first followed by oxycodone with a 48 hour
      washout between doses. 15 subjects randomized to receive oxycodone before the
      oxycodone/naicin dose with a 48 hour washout between doses. The purpose of the Treatment
      Phase was to assess the abuse liability and abuse deterrence potential of 4 times the
      recommended 2-tablet dose of AcuroxÂ® Tablets 5/30 mg versus oxycodone HCl 40 mg alone (8
      tablets per dose).

      All 30 subjects received a single dose of each study treatment. Subjects were fasted prior to
      dosing on all dose days.
