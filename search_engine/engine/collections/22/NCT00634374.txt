      concern to pediatricians and caregivers. Calibrated oral syringes are accurate in measuring
      and delivering the required dose, have minimal potential for spillage and are considered the
      standard drug delivery system for this population. However, infant acceptance of the syringe
      may not always be favorable. The objective of this study was to compare the Rx medibottle to
      the oral syringe when used to administer liquid medication to infants. It is a prospective,
      controlled trial that enrolled infants <2 years of age admitted to a community hospital in
      the Bronx, who were prescribed a daily dose of 2 mg/kg of prednisolone syrup (15 mg/5 ml) for
      a respiratory illness. Participants were randomly assigned to receive one dose of
      prednisolone syrup using the Rx medibottle (intervention arm) or the oral syringe (control
      arm). The infant medication acceptance scale (MAS) used to evaluate acceptance by the infants
      was developed and validated by Donna Kraus, Leslie Stohlmeyer and Patricia Hannon and
      published in the American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy (1999;16:1094-1101).
