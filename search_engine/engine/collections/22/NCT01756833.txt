      doxycycline 100 mg bid, will reduce the rate of increase of maximum transverse diameter of
      small (3.5-5.0 cm among men and 3.5 to 4.5 cm among women) abdominal aortic aneurysms. The
      primary outcome is abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) maximum transverse diameter determined by
      CT scans at two-year follow-up with allowance for baseline (pre-randomization) diameter.
      Based on an anticipated growth rate of 2.5 mm per year in the placebo group and the current
      threshold at which surgical intervention will be offered to trial participants, (5.5 cm in
      men, 5.0 cm in women), the upper limit of AAA size for inclusion has been set at 5.0 cm for
      men and 4.5 cm for women. Among these subjects, the threshold for repair would be exceeded
      only by those exhibiting persistent growth. Secondary outcomes will determine if doxycycline
      affects other measures, e.g., MMP-9 levels in plasma and whether these effects are related to
      aneurysm growth. Nineteen clinical sites have identified pools of over 1600 patients with
      small aneurysm who meet the proposed inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two hundred fifty-eight
      patients will be randomized to placebo or doxycycline and their aneurysms followed for change
      in diameter at six-month intervals using CT imaging. The alternative hypothesis is that
      doxycycline will inhibit the expansion rate by 40% during the two years of observation.
      Patients enrolling in N-TA^3CT must be able to give consent for their participation
      themselves and meet study eligibility criteria.
