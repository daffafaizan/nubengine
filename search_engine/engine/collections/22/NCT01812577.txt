      assisted, is advantageous compared to deep sedation (DS)in patients undergoing percutaneous
      radiofrequency ablation of liver lesions with respect to post-operative analgesia (at rest
      and in movement)and vomiting. Furthermore we collect data on operator and patient
      satisfaction.

      In this study patients are randomly divided into two groups (20 patient each): TPVB and DS.
      In TPVB group the block is performed in lateral position at level of T7 with bupivacaine
      5mg/ml. In DS group the procedure is conducted under local and intravenous anesthesia, and a
      post-operative analgesia is assigned. Data on patient, on procedures (duration, number and
      position of lesions etc.), complications with the anesthesiological technique are collected.
      The intensity of post-operative pain is assessed at 3-6-12 and 24 hours after procedure in
      both group using VRS pain scale at rest and in movement. Any concomitant event like nausea,
      vomiting, respiratory complications etc are recorded.
