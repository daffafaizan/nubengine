      through a myeloablative regimen, which induces a neutropenia. The length of the neutropenia
      has an incidence on the risk of contracting bacterial and fungal infections that could be
      lethal. It is then important to find ways to accelerate the neutrophil recovery, so patient
      survival can be improved.

      Studies conducted in the '70s and '80s suggested that if the hemoglobin level could be kept
      at a higher level, then the neutrophil recovery would be accelerated. Other studies also
      support the hypothesis that if the stem cells do not need to produce red cells because these
      are being supplied through transfusions, then the stem cells would differentiate into
      non-erythroid cell lines.

      As of now, for patients undergoing a bone marrow transplant, it is standard practice to
      transfuse with red cells based on the condition of the patient or if the hemoglobin level
      falls below 70 g/L. Hematopoietic growth factors have been used to increase the speed of the
      neutrophil recovery, but studies conducted so far do not demonstrate that mortality and
      length of hospitalization have been reduced by the specific use of G-CSF. In more recent
      studies, these agents have been shown to also have negative effects, such as delayed platelet
      recovery and impaired immune recovery. In addition, the prophylactic use of G-CSF was also
      associated with graft-versus-host disease, treatment-related mortality and death.

      In conclusion, this study will determine if maintaining a higher hemoglobin level has an
      effect on the neutrophil recovery after allogenic bone marrow transplantation in children.
