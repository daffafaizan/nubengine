      central sleep and/or mixed apnea and periodic breathing. Previous studies in the field have
      shown that treatment of periodic breathing with ASV improves sleep quality and quality of
      life. In reducing central apneas, ASV reduces overall arousal index, and increases overall
      slow wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep more than oxygen, continuous positive
      airway pressure or bi-level treatments. ASV can also more effectively reduce central apnea
      and overall apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) in patients on long-term opiates, and appears to
      effectively treat Complex Sleep Apnea Syndrome. It is more effective than other forms of
      non-invasive ventilation for patients with central and/or mixed apnea or periodic breathing,
      and is better tolerated.

      This is a prospective, randomised, crossover, observational study. Subjects will spend one
      night on conventional ASV and one night on modified ASV with full in-lab polysomnography
      (PSG) during therapy on both nights.

      Objective and subjective parameters will be recorded and analysed.
