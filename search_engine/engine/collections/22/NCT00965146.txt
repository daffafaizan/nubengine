      Retaining (CR) Total Knee System is to be implanted for evaluation in this study. This device
      system is commercially available and is intended for cemented use.

      The study group will consist of a maximum of 265 cases, requiring primary total knee
      replacement, and diagnosed with non-inflammatory arthritis. All subjects will be implanted
      with a femoral component, a tibial insert, a tibial tray and a resurfaced patella. Subjects
      receiving bilateral total knee replacements will represent two cases. Study participants will
      be recruited from 5 institutions.

      Subjects will be evaluated preoperatively and at follow-up intervals of 7 wks (± 2 wks), 3
      months (± 3 weeks), 6 months (optional visit), 12 months (± 2 months) and annually thereafter
      (± 2 months). Each subject will be followed for 15 years post-implantation.

      The objectives of this study are to:

        1. Evaluate the effect of system component design on functional performance.

        2. Evaluate the effect of system component design by comparing postoperative functional and
           radiographic findings with preoperative.

        3. Evaluate complications and the rates in which they occur.
