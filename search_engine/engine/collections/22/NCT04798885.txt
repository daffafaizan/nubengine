      concern. Recent studies estimate that persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) are present
      in almost half of the affected citizens at one year post-injury. Prospective studies have
      demonstrated that these citizens are at risk of developing long-lasting symptoms which are
      associated with high societal burden due to long-term impact on labour market attachment and
      increased use of health care and social benefits. In Denmark, there has in recent years been
      an increasing awareness on societal impact and personal consequences of PCS. Accordingly,
      clinicians as well as social workers and therapists in the municipalities point to the gab in
      knowledge concerning PCS and advocate urgently for evidence-based treatment for these
      citizens. Recently, the research group behind this application developed a novel early
      intervention - "Get going After concussIoN" (GAIN 1.0) - for citizens who experience
      persistent PCS three to six months post-concussion. The intervention was tested in a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) with promising results. However, it was delivered in a
      single hospital setting in which these citizens are normally not cared for. In this study the
      intention is to test the results of GAIN 1.0 in a larger RCT (GAIN 2.0) which takes place in
      the municipalities of Central Denmark Region where citizens live their daily lives and whose
      health- and social care systems support citizens who experience persisting PCS.
