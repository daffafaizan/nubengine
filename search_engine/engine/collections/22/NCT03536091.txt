      magnification endoscopy to detect and assess microscopic inflammation in patients with
      inflammator bowel diseases. For this purpose, IBD patients will be prospectively enrolled and
      inflammatory changes will be assessed using optical magnification endoscopy in conjunction
      with optical chromoendoscopy. Endoscopic scoring of inflammatory changes in IBD patients will
      be done on a newly developed magnification score resulting as a consensus from experts in
      optical diagnosis and endoscopy in IBD patients. Results will be correlated against
      histopathology.
