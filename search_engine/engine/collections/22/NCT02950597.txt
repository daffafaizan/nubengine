      Nearly five million Americans experience heart failure (HF) and greater than 250,000 die
      annually. 1 The prevalence has continued to increase with the aging of the US population and
      HF is now the leading cause of hospitalization among adults >65 in the United states. Despite
      remarkable improvements in medical therapy, the prognosis of patients with myocardial failure
      remains poor, with almost 20% of patients dying within 1 year of initial diagnosis and > 80%
      8-year mortality. 2 In addition patients who are admitted to the hospital for heart failure
      have over a 50% readmission rate within six months of discharge. 3,4 These patients require
      routine clinical care and often require diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. This project
      seeks to assess if the use of hemodynamic (HD) monitoring technologies (ClearSight/Nexfin)
      that are currently used in the intraoperative and critical care settings can provide utility
      by demonstrating associations between alterations in a patients HD values to the likelihood
      of hospital admission.

      The non-invasive HD device utilized (Nexfin, Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA) provided
      flow-guided cardiovascular parameters that were captured for each clinic visit for up to 24
      months. Analysis was performed between the most recent prior clinic visits for patients who
      were hospitalized for HF exacerbation to those who were not hospitalized. HD data was not
      used to guide clinical care. A Cox hazard model using a log transformation of HD variables as
      the covariates, was applied to describe hospital admission.
