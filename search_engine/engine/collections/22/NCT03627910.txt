      (T0), 45 days after admission (T45) and at the end of the study (T90, 90 days after
      admission). At each time point patients' nutritional status will be determined and the
      following biochemical parameters will be investigated: lymphocyte count, total proteins,
      protidogram, prealbumin, transferrin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
      Platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), beta transforming growth factor (TGF-beta). Analysis
      of fecal DNA will be also performed to characterize the gut microbiota. In addition, at the
      baseline and at T45 participants will be administered the Braden scale for predicting
      pressure sore risk.
