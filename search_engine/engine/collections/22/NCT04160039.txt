    
      A single-blinded randomized controlled trial will be conducted in a transplant intensive care
      unit (TICU). Eligible adult patients will be enrolled within 72 hrs after TICU admission and
      randomly allocated to either (1) standard PT/OT care, or (2) PT/OT care and cycle ergometry
      sessions with trained PT/OT therapists or technicians. The outcome measures, tests of
      strength and function, will be assessed at baseline, every 14 days, and upon TICU discharge
      by a blinded PT/OT therapist.
