      discussion and debate in the literature, especially in patients without neurological deficit.
      Most authors recommend surgical treatment for patients whose fracture shows signs of
      instability: 50% loss of vertebral body height, kyphosis with more than 30 degrees,
      involvement of more than 50% of the spinal canal. The authors advocate that this type of
      treatment uses the shorter hospital stay, early patient mobility, better kyphosis correction,
      the possibility of spinal canal decompression and prevention of neurological deterioration,
      as arguments in its favor.However, observational studies in patients without neurological
      deficit, showed no difference in long-term functional outcomes in patients with this type of
      injury, regardless of the type of treatment used (surgical or conservative). This study will
      express the clinical results and morphological changes of the thoracic and lumbar spine, at a
      minimum follow-up of 24 months, comparing the findings of the patients undergoing surgical
      treatment with those found in undergoing conservative treatment.
