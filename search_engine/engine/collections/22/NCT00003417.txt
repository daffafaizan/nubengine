        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of escalating doses of conformal radiotherapy
           planned with 3-D treatment planning plus carmustine in patients with glioblastoma
           multiforme.

        -  Determine dose/volume and dose/anatomic characteristics that influence
           radiotherapy-induced CNS (central nervous system) toxicity.

        -  Evaluate local control, survival, and failure patterns of these patients treated with
           high doses of conformal radiotherapy to gross disease.

        -  Correlate changes on cross-sectional diagnostic MRI imaging studies to clinical or
           biologic endpoints.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are stratified according to the planned
      target volume, i.e., gross residual tumor plus 3 mm (less than 75 cc vs at least 75 cc).

      Patients undergo radiotherapy over 15-30 minutes daily 5 days a week for 6-8 weeks. After 46
      Gy of radiotherapy have been administered, patients undergo radiotherapy field reduction and
      are accrued into one of four dose levels. (Dose level 1 closed to accrual 1/16/01) All
      patients receive at least 33 radiation treatments. Each patient is evaluated for acute
      dose-limiting toxicity for 90 days from start of therapy.

      Patients also receive carmustine IV over 1-2 hours daily on days 1-3 for the first week of
      radiotherapy. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for up to 6 courses.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 1 year, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      at least 5 months.
