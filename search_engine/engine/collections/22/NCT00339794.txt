      diabetes, hypertension, and obesity) and the clinical utility of the related genetic tests
      has not been demonstrated, all signs suggest that genetics will become increasingly relevant
      to and integrated into family medicine. In recognition of these emerging genomic innovations
      and their potential for improving primary care practice, the American Academy of Family
      Physicians (AAFP), in collaboration with the National Human Genome Research Institute
      (NHGRI), has made genomic medicine the topic of their 2005 Annual Clinical Focus curriculum.
      The AAFP is one of the largest medical organizations with a membership that comprises a group
      of 56,400 active family physicians who deliver care in a broad array of practice settings in
      rural and urban communities around the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands and
      Guam. This study seeks to take advantage of the plans for AAFP's clinical focus on genomics
      to characterize family physicians' attitudes and practices related to the genetics of complex
      disorders. This information could be useful in understanding and shaping the dissemination of
      genetic medicine in ways that improve the standard of primary care practice. To this end, we
      propose to conduct two phases of research activity. In the first phase, a web-based survey
      will be conducted of members of AAFP. In the second phase, a sub-sample of those who complete
      the survey will be re-contacted; half will be members who have enrolled in a year-long
      web-based curriculum related to medical genetics, and the other half will be those who have
      chosen not to enroll in the curriculum.
