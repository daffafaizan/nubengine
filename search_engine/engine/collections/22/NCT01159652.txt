      healthy individuals. However, little research has been conducted regarding the effect of
      hypnotics on sleep-dependent memory. One study found that zopiclone (7.5 mg), but not
      brotizolam (0.25 mg), impaired sleep-dependent memory consolidation in normal sleepers.
      Another study reported significant impairment of sleep-dependent memory on a motor task with
      triazolam (0.375 mg), but not with zolpidem immediate release (10 mg). These studies provide
      some evidence that sedative-hypnotic drugs may impair sleep-dependent memory consolidation,
      but further investigation is clearly needed in this area. Because hypnotics are commonly
      prescribed for insomnia, it is important to determine if there is a significant risk of
      impairment in sleep-dependent memory consolidation associated with these medications.
      Further, investigation of alternative doses and drug regimens upon memory consolidation
      appears warranted.

      The purpose of the current study is to determine the effect of two hypnotic medications on
      sleep-dependent memory consolidation in normal sleepers. Zolpidem extended release, which
      will be active for most of the sleep period when administered at bedtime, will be compared to
      zaleplon, which will be active for half of the sleep period when administered in the middle
      of the night. This comparison allows us to address the question of whether a few hours of
      drug-free sleep results in better memory consolidation than sleep with drug throughout the
      night.
