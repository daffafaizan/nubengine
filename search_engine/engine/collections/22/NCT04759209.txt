      discriminate the donor transmitted or acquired lesions and disease progression
      post-transplant. However, many centers worldwide do not perform those biopsies because they
      are invasive and costly. We aimed to develop and validate a non-invasive virtual biopsy
      system. Our goal was to provide clinicians with a virtual biopsy system to guide diagnostics,
      therapeutics and immediate patient management post-transplant and to minimize additional
      risks and costs to perform day-zero biopsies only using standard donor parameters. To
      circumvent these limitations, we sought to build and validate a virtual biopsy system that
      uses routinely collected donor parameters to predict kidney day-zero biopsy results. Since
      machine learning has demonstrated its clinical relevance in many medical specialties and
      superior performance to logistic regression, we based our analyses on machine learning
      methods as well as traditional statistical approaches using large and qualified international
      cohort donors who underwent routine and protocolized collection of donor parameters together
      with day-zero biopsy assessment using the standards of the international Banff allograft
      histopathology classification.
