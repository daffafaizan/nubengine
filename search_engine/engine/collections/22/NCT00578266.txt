      and to show it is equal or superior to the current standard practice. With this initial
      assessment be hope to gain information suggesting further study of this regimen or
      discontinuation of this regimen before exposing large numbers of patients to this new
      treatment option. We also will gain experience with this new regimen giving insights as to
      possible modifications in dosing and monitoring and selection of patients for future
      treatment in case of positive results. For this initial study we plan to enroll up to 24
      patients.
