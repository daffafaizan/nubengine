      advanced NSCLC there is a need to explore new agents and combinations with novel mechanisms
      of action in an effort to improve clinical outcomes in this patient population. The HGF/c-MET
      pathway inhibition is a promising novel target in NSCLC. Preclinical evidence support the
      combined targeting of EGFR and HGF/c-MET pathways in NSCLC as a strategy that may result in
      enhanced antitumor activity. Inhibition of both HGF/c-Met and EGFR pathways can be
      accomplished by utilizing the combination of AMG 102 and erlotinib in patients with advanced
      NSCLC. Therefore, we propose a safety and efficacy, phase I/II clinical trial of the
      combination in patients with previously treated, advanced NSCLC.
