      controlled study. All the participants were randomized into study group ( dry weight (DW)
      determined by BCM-BIS) and control group ( dry weight determined by clinical symptoms) with
      stratification by diabetes mellitus and centers. Body composition monitor based on
      bioimpedance spectroscopy (BCM-BIS) was performed monthly and concomitant biochemical data
      and clinical outcomes were collected. Intra-dialysis complications were recorded in every
      dialysis session. Primary outcome was all-cause hospitalization. Secondary outcomes included
      1) complications during DW adjustment 2) intra-dialysis morbidities 3) hypertension 4)
      mortality 5) acute fluid overload (AFO) or cardiovascular (CV)-related events. The clinical
      feasibility of the BCM-BIS algorithm was also inspected. Statistical methods: a software
      (SAS) 9.3 was used for statistical analysis in this study. R 3.0 was used for graphic
      presentation of parts of the results. Relative risk, incidence rate ratio and Fisher's exact
      test were used to compare the discrete outcomes in both groups. Survival analysis was used
      for time-related events. Repeated-measured and longitudinal data were analyzed with the
      generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) through the procedure for continuous variables (PROC
      MIXED) and for discrete variables (PROC GLIMMIX) in SAS.
