    
      RYR1- related myopathy comprises a group of rare neuromuscular diseases. Affected individuals
      generally present with delayed motor milestones, muscle weakness, impaired ambulation, and,
      in severe cases, scoliosis, ophthalmoplegia, and respiratory distress all due to skeletal
      muscle weakness.

      Causative variants in RYR1, which encodes the major calcium (Ca2+) release channel in
      skeletal muscle, RyR1, exert different effects on the RyR1 channel. They generally disrupt
      the normal Ca2+ flow between the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) and muscle cell cytosol and
      commonly result in excessive Ca2+ leak into the cytosol. Persistent Ca2+ leaks reduce its
      availability in the SR that is necessary for excitation-contraction coupling leading to the
      muscle weakness characteristic of this disease.

      This open-label study consists of ten participants, randomized to two dose groups. All
      participants will have a diagnosis of RYR1-RM. In addition they have a prior muscle biopsy
      demonstrating a leaky RYR1 channel which responds to S48168 (ARM210) ex vivo. The first group
      of three participants will receive a low dose of S 48168 (ARM210) daily for 28 days. The
      second group of seven participants will receive a higher dose for 28 days. The decision to
      escalate to the higher dose will be made by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board
      (DSMB) after review of safety, tolerability and PK of the low daily dose. Safety and
      tolerability will be the primary objective in this study. In addition, exploratory objectives
      will include PK, PD/TE as well as measures of muscle/motor function and fatigue.
