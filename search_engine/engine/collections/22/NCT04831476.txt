    
      Combination therapy with the 5-α reductase inhibitor, dutasteride, and the α-blocker,
      tamsulosin, in men with moderate to severe benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate
      enlargement, was studied in the Combination of Avodart ™ and Tamsulosin (CombAT) which was a
      four-year, global, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel design (3 arms) study. The
      aim of the study was to investigate the benefits of combination therapy
      (dutasteride-tamsulosin) compared to monotherapy in terms of improvement of symptoms and
      long-term results (AUR and surgery), in men with moderate to severe BPH. The primary endpoint
      in the two years since the start of the study was the change in the IPSS score, while the
      primary endpoint, after four years of treatment, was the time until the long-term results
      manifested (i.e. AUR or CF surgery) as well as the percentage of participants who were led to
      them. Patients were at least 50 years old with a prostate tumor ≥30 cm3 and a PSA level ≥ 1.5
      ng / mL. 4838 men (39) participated in this study.
