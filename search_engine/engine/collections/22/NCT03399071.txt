      200mg/m2 iv infusion day 1, Oxaliplatin 85mg/m2 iv infusion day 1, Docetaxel 50mg/m2 iv day
      1, Fluorouracil 2600mg/m2 over 24 hours iv) and the PD-L1 inhibiting monoclonal antibody
      Avelumab. The safe dose of Avelumab in combination with FLOT will be established in a safety
      run-in phase with a standard 3+3 design, starting with the recommended dose of 10mg/kg iv
      Avelumab (dose level 0) in which a dose reduction to 7mg/kg iv (dose level -1) may occur.
      Four cycles of two-weekly chemo-immunotherapy will be administered before surgery and four
      further cycles post-operatively in patients who are fit enough to receive further
      chemo-immunotherapy after surgery. Resectional surgery will take place 4-8 weeks following
      the last dose of chemo-immunotherapy in patients who remain fit.

      Study Objectives:

      To evaluate the safety, efficacy and toxicities and to explore biomarkers of peri-operative
      chemo-immunotherapy with Avelumab and FLOT.
