      biopsy' of tumor biological activity. Enumeration of CTCs in rectal cancer patients could
      play an important role in diagnosis, predicting the risk for tumor recurrence and
      effectiveness of neoadjuvant therapy.

      The investigators choose several timepoints to detect the dynamic change of CTCs,1 day before
      the 1st ,3rd and 5th(if the patient needs before surgery) neoadjuvant therapy course,1 day
      before and 7days ,3 month,6 month after surgery. Approximately 7.5-mL ethylene diamine
      tetraacetic acid(EDTA)-blood was drawn by vein puncture from patients with rectal cancer .
      Briefly, the number of CTCs will be count by the cellsearch system , recorded and analysed by
      the investigator.
