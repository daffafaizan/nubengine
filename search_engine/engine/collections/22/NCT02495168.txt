    
      This is a pivotal trial that will examine the therapeutic equivalence of a new generic
      fixed-dose combination product containing budesonide 80 μg/formoterol fumarate dihydrate 4.5
      μg and reference listed drug (RLD) Symbicort® inhalation aerosol in adult participants with
      chronic but stable asthma as defined in National Asthma Education and Prevention Program
      Expert Panel Report 3 (NAEPP 3) guidelines. To ensure adequate study sensitivity, the test
      and reference products should both be statistically superior to placebo (p<0.05) with regard
      to the bioequivalent study primary endpoints. Participants will be provided a generic placebo
      pressurized metered-dose inhaler (pMDI) device for use during the 2-week Run-in Period for
      device training.
