      related to injury. Current technique still stays at visual observation.

      Showmotion™ (NCS Lab, Carpi, Italy) is an innovative platform that provides a comprehensive
      analysis to monitor motion patterns of the whole body using WISE sensors, proprietary
      wireless inertial and magnetic units (MIMU) developed by NCS Lab (Italy).

      Using the data acquired from MIMU and validated protocols for upper and lower limbs,
      Showmotion is able to measure, objectify and store three dimensional kinematic variables
      highlighting underlying information and allowing an in-depth analysis of the movement in real
      time.

      Compared to the classic motion analysis performed with cameras in special research
      laboratories, the Showmotion™ technology allows the user to analyze the movements of the
      subjects in any place, quickly, and without the need to a long process of data analysis.
