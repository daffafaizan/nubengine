      enrolled if being seen for a condition putting them at risk for dehydration including emesis,
      diarrhea, etc. Children will have their capillary refill time measured and then sent home
      with a digital scale to track their weight. This will serve as the standard for calculating
      percent dehydration. When a patient has reached a stable weight at 1 week we will assume this
      is their healthy weight. There is no intervention in the study.
