      placebo (PL: 600 mg) and GSE (600 mg) on systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood
      pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac
      output (Q), total peripheral resistance (TPR), and AoS were compared 2 h after ingestion of
      GSE or PL on different days, one week apart. Arterial blood pressure was measured using a
      sphygmomanometer from a brachial artery at the level of the heart on chair. HR and SV were
      continuously measured using a non-invasive device (Physio Flow). CO was calculated by HR X
      SV. TPR was calculated by MAP/CO.
