      well-recognized complication of lung transplantation. Recent evidence suggests that
      immunosuppressive therapy after solid organ transplantation may lead to humoral
      immunodeficiency due to hypogammaglobulinemia (HGG). In lung transplant recipients with HGG,
      IVIG therapy offers the potential to significantly decrease the incidence and severity of
      infections, thereby reducing morbidity and potentially mortality.

      Comparison: The investigators are conducting a randomized clinical trial of IVIG versus
      placebo for lung transplant patients with severe HGG to see if IVIG decreases the number of
      bacterial infections in these patients.
