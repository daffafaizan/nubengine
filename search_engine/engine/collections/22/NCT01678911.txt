      Chicago (RIC), Center for Pain Studies (446 E Ontario St. Suite 1011, Chicago, IL 60611).
      Your part in this study will last for 15 weeks and will involve 4 visits to the
      Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and anywhere from weekly phone calls to phone calls every
      other day.

      If you are in this study, you will be placed in one of two study groups: one group will
      receive the study drug followed by a placebo and the second group will receive a placebo
      followed by the study drug. The amount of weeks on placebo versus the study drug will not be
      equal. You will be assigned a study group by chance using a process similar to the flip of a
      coin. This process is called randomization. Neither you nor the study staff will select the
      group you will be in. However, if you have a medical emergency, we can get this information.
      A placebo looks like the study drug but is an inactive substance that has no medication.
      Researchers use a placebo to see if the study drug works better or is safer than not taking
      anything.
