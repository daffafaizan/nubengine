      participants (all alcohol consuming, ages 14-24), were below the threshold for red blood cell
      (RBC) folate status for women of childbearing potential. Understanding how the interaction of
      behaviors (alcohol use, nutrient supplementation, diet) contribute to sub-optimal folate
      status is critical to developing and expanding upon evidence-based FASD prevention programs.
      Notably, how nutrient supplementation might improve overall folate status in a group with
      poor folate status and other behaviors that confound the absorption of folate. Because the
      participants do not view themselves as being at risk for unwanted pregnancy, their motivation
      to take a supplement for a future pregnancy is very low. This team seeks to collect data on
      how folate supplementation might improve individually measured outcomes, like cognition and
      mood, so that interventions might be developed focusing on these individual outcomes.

      After becoming aware of the study, prospective participants will undergo a screening
      questionnaire for inclusion/exclusion criteria. Once the participant meets the inclusion
      criteria, the study will be fully explained and written informed consent will be handed out.
      Participants will be randomized in a single-blind manner (participant) in a 1:1 ratio to the
      Methyl Folate supplement (1,000 mcg, once daily) or placebo (once daily).
