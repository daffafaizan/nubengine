      if left untreated can progress to cirrhosis and liver failure. NAFLD stages progress from the
      stage of simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, and fibrosis The stage of NAFLD is currently
      best determined using histology from a liver biopsy, however this provides a static depiction
      of the state of the liver. Therefore This project aims to determine fibrogenesis in the liver
      of obese humans in vivo, before and after weight loss.
