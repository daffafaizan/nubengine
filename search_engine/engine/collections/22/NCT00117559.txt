      group psychotherapy intervention and a telehealth intervention for veterans undergoing
      interferon treatment for the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The specific objectives of the proposed
      pilot study are: 1) develop study methods and materials; 2) evaluate study feasibility; and
      3) assess the efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral group therapy approach and a telehealth
      approach as compared to care as usual in a randomized design. Participants will be 45
      patients (15 participants in each condition) from the VA Boston Healthcare System who are
      undergoing interferon treatment for HCV. Assessment will occur at pre-treatment,
      post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Assessments will measure key areas, including
      adherence, quality of life, and psychological distress. Analyses will examine study
      feasibility and the effects of the treatment condition. It is hypothesized that the CBT
      condition and the telehealth condition will result in significantly improved outcomes,
      including enhanced adherence, quality of life, and psychological status. This treatment
      approach addresses initiatives by the National VHA Hepatitis C Program by optimizing the care
      of veterans experiencing the devastating side effects of interferon treatment.
