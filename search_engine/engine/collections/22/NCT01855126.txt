    
      We will recruit 50 subjects who report going to bed early and desiring later bedtimes and
      will ask them to wear an active and an inactive light mask for 8 consecutive weeks each. A
      2-week washout period between active and inactive conditions will be applied. Outcome
      measures will be collected periodically throughout the 8 weeks. Baseline (no intervention)
      will be collected prior to the active and inactive lighting interventions.
