        -  Determine whether telephone counseling delivered by breast cancer survivors enhances the
           well-being of women with recurrent breast cancer.

        -  Determine the impact of sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial predictors of
           well-being in these patients.

        -  Determine the changes in well-being over time since disease recurrence in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age
      (under 50 vs 50 and over), time since initial diagnosis (less than 2 years vs 2 years or
      more), and recurrence site (soft tissue without bone vs soft tissue with bone vs visceral).
      Patients are randomized to one of two study arms.

        -  Arm I (control arm): Patients receive the standard level of support by continuing to use
           existing resources. Patients receive written materials from the counseling group at 6
           months.

        -  Arm II (intervention arm): Patients receive weekly telephone counseling sessions by
           breast cancer survivors over 4 weeks for a total of 4-8 sessions. Patients receive
           written materials from the counseling group after the first session.

      In both arms, quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 3 and 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients (150 per study arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 30 months.
