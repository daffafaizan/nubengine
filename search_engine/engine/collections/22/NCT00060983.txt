      lower extremities that results in a number of abnormalities of movement. Among these are
      unregulated spinal reflexes, inadequate and delayed motor recruitment, and balance deficits.
      If the patient can walk, these abnormalities manifest in a gait pattern that has poorly
      coordinated timing between different muscle groups, decreased weight bearing capacity, and
      inappropriate muscle activity, such as scissoring.

      Research in patients with SCIs has demonstrated that, despite the damage to the spinal cord,
      many of the nervous system pathways that control walking remain intact and can be activated
      by the proper sensory stimulation. Two technologies that may enhance the benefits of
      treadmill walking are body weight support (BWS) and functional electrical stimulation (FES).
      Preliminary studies indicate that by combining these two interventions, gait performance is
      improved such that more efficient and functional movement emerges. This study will evaluate
      the benefits of adding BWS and FES to a treadmill-training program for patients with SCIs.

      During the treadmill training, patients are suspended in an apparatus to provide partial body
      weight support (BWS). The training effects of BWS locomotion with FES over the course of a
      multi-session training program will be examined. Study visits will be scheduled 3 days each
      week for 12 weeks. Participants will have follow-up visits at Months 3 and 12. Gait
      parameters modified by training will be identified and the nature of these changes will be
      characterized. Specifically, walking speed, kinematics, electromyography (EMG), and muscle
      strength will be assessed.
