      It is most frequently carried out as a single shot intrathecal injection. This method can be
      utilized for both labor analgesia and surgical anesthesia for cesarean section. One of the
      concerns in using a single shot spinal injection for surgical anesthesia is the duration of
      adequate surgical conditions. This concern is especially relevant to repeat cesarean
      sections, as each subsequent procedure has the potential to be more complex than the prior
      and, therefore, prolonged. A reliable way to prolong surgical anesthesia provided by single
      shot spinal injection of bupivacaine could prove invaluable in the setting of repeat cesarean
      section. It has been well documented that adding epinephrine to intrathecal lidocaine will
      increase its duration1, but the evidence for augmenting the duration of anesthesia provided
      by adding epinephrine to bupivacaine is much more equivocal and less robust. This is a
      randomized control trial investigating whether or not adding epinephrine to a standard single
      intrathecal injection of hyperbaric bupivacaine for repeat cesarean will prolong its
      duration. It will be investigated using women who are undergoing scheduled repeat cesarean
      section in whom neuraxial anesthesia is the appropriate primary anesthetic. The investigators
      will compare the onset, quality and duration of both sensory and motor components of the
      spinal block as well as the incidence of known side effects.
