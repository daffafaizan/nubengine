      effort, in COPD patients. However, the test need a 30m corridor.

      The 3 minute step test (3MST) is a other field test used in COPD patients. But no study shows
      that 3MST can be used to determine oxygen desaturation.

      The aim of this study is to compare oxygen desaturation during these to tests : the 6MWT and
      the 3MST.

      50 patients will be included in this study.

      Patients realize two 6MWT and two 3MST, with rest between each test.

      Oxygen saturation, heart rate are registered during the tests, dyspnea, leg peniblility are
      notified before and after each test, distance or number of steps are noted.
