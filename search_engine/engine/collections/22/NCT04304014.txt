      microbiota. This process is influenced by different factors: delivery type, feeding type,
      antibiotic treatment, etc. On the one hand, vaginally delivered babies are in contact with
      mother's vaginal and faecal microbiota. This fact will drive a neonatal gut colonization
      composed of vagina-associated bacteria. In contrast, babies born by C-section are more
      susceptible to be colonized by microorganisms present in the mother's skin. On the other
      hand, antibiotic administration during vaginal delivery also produces alterations in the
      vaginal microbiota of the mother. Described scenarios have been correlated to immunological
      and metabolic diseases such as asthma, allergies, diabetes or obesity. Moreover, disbiosis
      has also been associated to functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) in babies such as
      infant colic and functional constipation. After a disbiotic delivery, medical doctors usually
      recommend the use of probiotics to prevent rebiosis. Since the probiotics.

      L. reuteri, and B. longum and P. Pentosaceus have shown efficacy on FGID amelioration in
      previously published articles, these two probiotics were selected for the present study. All
      together, this study aims to characterize the role of three different parameters: type of
      probiotic, delivery type and feeding type.
