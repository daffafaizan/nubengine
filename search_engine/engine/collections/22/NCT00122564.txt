      against sexually transmitted infection. Although mucosal immune responses have been almost
      non-existent in trials of HIV vaccine candidates in which the antigen was delivered
      systematically.

      Several animal models have also demonstrated the importance or a mucosal IgA response for
      protection against viral infections. Mucosal S IgA are essential effectors having different
      mechanisms of action agglutination of pathogens, interaction with cellular receptor,
      transcytosis of immune complexes, intracellular clearance of virus.

      Gp 160 induces the majority of neutralizing Abs activity in patients serum and the
      immunogenicity of gp 160 can be improved by using and adjuvant such as DC-chol because of its
      properties to increase the permeation of the nasal epithelium and to facilitate systemic
      delivery of the vaccine antigen.

      Before beginning mucosal vaccine trial, we previously tested and validated procedures to
      collect and process secretion fluids on 6 HIV-1 infected women (K. Petitprez et al, 4th
      European mucosal immunology group meeting, Lyon France, 8-10 october 2004).
