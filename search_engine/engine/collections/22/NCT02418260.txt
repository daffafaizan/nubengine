      Despite the fact that the conservative treatment is still the gold standard for the majority
      of these fractures, this method was not proven to be superior when compared to the surgical
      treatment. Surgical options for the treatment of humeral shaft fractures range from open
      reduction and internal fixation with plate to minimally invasive methods (bridge plate and
      intramedullary nail) and the best method has yet to be determined. The goal of this study is
      to determine the best surgical option for the treatment of humeral shaft fractures. For this,
      will be recruited 105 patients with humeral shaft fractures, wich will be allocated,
      randomly, in 3 distinct groups. Each patient will be submitted to one of three possible
      methods of humerus osteosynthesis: open reduction and internal fixation with plate (ORIF),
      closed reduction and fixation with bridge plate or closed reduction and fixation with
      intramedullary nail. All data will be paired according to the age, gender, fracture
      classification, patient comorbidities and smoking habit. The Pearson's chi-square" test will
      be used to analyze the results of the three groups regarding categorical variables, and
      Student t-test (parametric) will be used to compare groups with respect to the numerical
      variables. The investigators expect to conclude that the methods of minimally invasive
      osteosynthesis of humeral shaft fractures have similar or better functional and radiographic
      outcomes, compared to the method of open reduction and internal fixation with a plate, with
      lesser risk of complications and an earlier return to activities.
