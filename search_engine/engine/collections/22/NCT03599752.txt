      I. To compare recurrence-free survival in patients with "low risk" lung-limited metastatic
      colorectal cancer (mCRC) undergoing pulmonary metastasectomy with or without perioperative
      chemotherapy.

      II. To compare overall survival in patients with "high risk" lung-limited mCRC receiving
      systemic chemotherapy with or without surgical resection.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare grade 3 and 4 adverse events in patients receiving surgical resection and/or
      chemotherapy in the management of lung-limited mCRC.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate for changes in circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) following
      surgical resection and/or systemic chemotherapy in patients with lung-limited mCRC.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 risk groups (low or high).

      GROUP 1 (LOW RISK): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP 1A: Patients receive standard of care chemotherapy for 3 months prior to and 3 months
      after undergoing metastasectomy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      GROUP 1B: Patients undergo metastasectomy.

      GROUP 2 (HIGH RISK): All high risk patients receive standard of care chemotherapy for 3
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients without
      progressive disease after 3 months are then randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP 2A: Patients undergo metastasectomy.

      GROUP 2B: Patients continue standard of care chemotherapy for 6 months in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or radiographic
      response after 6 months may then cross over to Group 2A.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.
