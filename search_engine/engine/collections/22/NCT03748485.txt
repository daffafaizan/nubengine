      worldwide(ref). Although the coloscopy or liquid biopsy screen has improved the early
      diagnosis of CRC, about 26.5-36.0% of the patients were diagnosed local advanced CRC at the
      first visit. Part of clinical local advanced colorectal cancer(cTxN1-2M0), which turn out to
      be pT1-3N0M0 after preoperational chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy, might not really need
      adjuvant chemotherapy due to the down-stage efficacy of the preoperational treatments, or the
      misleading by lymph nodes false-positive imaging diagnosis. Adjuvant chemotherapy was been
      admitted unnecessary in the pathological stage â…¡A (pT0-3N0M0) CRC following initial treatment
      of surgery without high risk factors of recurrences. The treatment efficacy of adjuvant
      chemotherapy for pT1-3N0M0 CRC following preoperational chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy
      remains unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy/safety of adjuvant
      chemotherapy in clinical local advanced CRC (cTxN1/2M0) following preoperational adjuvant
      therapies and pathologically proved pT0-3N0M0 CRC. Patients are randomized to control
      group(down-staged pT0-3N0M0 CRC with 6 to 8 periods adjuvant chemotherapy) and experimental
      group(watch group, down-staged pT0-3N0M0 CRC without adjuvant chemotherapy). The primary
      endpoint is the 3-years disease-free survival after surgery. Secondary endpoints evaluate
      long-term clinical outcomes, in particular overall survival and side effect of chemotherapy.
