      for the current study. Participants will complete a 9-week internet-based insomnia treatment
      program (SHUTi) or receive sleep education, depending on randomized group assignment.
      Participants will complete home-based assessments at 3 time points (baseline,
      post-intervention, 6 months). These assessments will include online questionnaires measuring
      insomnia symptoms, neurocognitive problems, fatigue, daytime sleepiness, and health related
      quality of life. In addition, at each time point participants will be asked to wear an
      activity monitor for one week to measure physical activity and sleep patterns. Each
      assessment time point will also include a home visit from Examination Management Services Inc
      (EMSI) to measure blood pressure, heart rate, cardiovascular biomarkers, and neurocognitive
      function.
