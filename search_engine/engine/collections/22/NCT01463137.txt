      focusing on aversive stimuli or avoiding aversive stimuli. Computerized training programs
      have been developed to implicitly direct the users attention towards a neutral,
      non-threatening stimuli. In this study, such a program will be compared with a program that
      implicitly directs the users' attention towards threatening cues. Pre/post-measurements will
      be compared in a sample of individuals that meet diagnostic criteria of Social Anxiety
      Disorder. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups, receiving one of the two
      variants of the attention bias modification program or a control training program.
