      thought to play a role in the cycle of pain and spasm. However, prior studies have
      conflicting results regarding their additive effect when given in addition to analgesics such
      as the NSAIDs. Because they have the potential to lead to adverse events their efficacy
      should be clearly demonstrated before their routine use.
