      such as soft tÄ±ssue mobilizations, electirical stimulations etc. Mulligan proposes
      mobilization with movement (MWM) technique for various musculoskeletal disorders. But there
      is no study related MWM for older adults with neck pain. The purpose of this study is to
      examine the effect of mulligan mobilization technique on pain, range of motion (ROM),
      functional level, kinesiophobia, depression and quality of life (QoL) in older adults with
      neck pain. The hypothesis of our study is MWM can be effective on ROM, kinesiophobia,
      depression and QoL in older adults with neck pain.
