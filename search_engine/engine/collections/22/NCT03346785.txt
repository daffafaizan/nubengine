      eating behaviours.

      The research question will be approached using a combination of methods. The first is the
      experience sampling method, where data is gathered from participants as they are going about
      their day-to-day lives. This method comprises two sub-sections - a correlational study, and
      an experimental study. This registration describes the experimental experience sampling
      method.

      The study will experimentally control participants' engagement in the act of food
      photography, and measure their eating behaviours. Participants will be recruited via online
      platforms and participate in the study for one week. At the beginning of the week, they will
      be required to fill in some online questionnaires (e.g. demographic information). For the
      rest of the week, they will be prompted at specific time points in the day via smartphone to
      engage in food photography/ non-food photography/ no phone use, and then answer some
      questions about their eating behaviours.

      The expected outcome of the project is to collectively evaluate the data from the various
      methods to conclude how social media use, and in particular the act of food photography,
      influences the various aspects of eating behaviours.
