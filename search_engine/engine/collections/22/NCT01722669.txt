    
      To compare the absorption and activity of quercetin or isoquercetin with or without ascorbic
      acid in healthy adults. Oral chews containing quercetin (500mg) or isoquercetin(500 mg total)
      with or without ascorbic acid will be given. Pharmacokinetic parameters (AUC, Cmax, Tmax,
      elimination half-life) will be determined over 24 hours (8 time points). Pharmacodynamic
      inhibition of protein disulfide isomerase activity will also be assessed.

      In addition to healthy subjects, a cohort of 10 individuals with antiphospholipid antibodies
      will participate. These participants will receive isoquercetin 1000 mg and have
      pharmacodynamics studies performed at time 0 and 4 hours.

      All study drugs will be provided by Quercegen Pharma.
