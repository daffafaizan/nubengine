      control of glucose in diabetes must adapt to individual physiologic characteristics and to
      the behavioral profile of each person. We propose to build a system that will use observers
      of patients' behavior and metabolic state and control modules that are responsible for
      insulin delivery and hypoglycemia prevention. In this phase of the project, we will
      investigate relationships of insulin sensitivity and impaired counterregulation with blood
      glucose variability, aiming to develop algorithmic physiology observers, which will track
      specific parameters of glucose variability and recurrent hypoglycemia as markers of change in
      a person's insulin sensitivity and counterregulatory ability.
