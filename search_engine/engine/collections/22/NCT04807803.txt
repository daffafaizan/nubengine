      mildest type of hepatic encephalopathy (HE). It is a frequent complication of the liver
      disease, affecting up to 80% of tested patients. MHE affects severely the lives of patients
      by altering their quality-of-life and their socioeconomic status and is strongly associated
      to the development of overt HE. Portal hypertension is the main complication of cirrhosis and
      is responsible of severe complications such as HE. The consequence of portal hypertension is
      the formation of the spontaneous portosystemic shunts (SPSS). Their presence has been
      associated with recurrent or persistent HE. The relationship between the SPSS and their
      characteristics and the prevalence of MHE in patient with cirrhosis is poorly known.

      Patients with compensated cirrhosis and portal hypertension will be considered for inclusion.
      After written inform consent, the serum ammonia, psychometric hepatic encephalopathy score
      (PHES) and the animal naming test (ANT) will be performed to evaluate the presence of MHE.
      Patients diagnosed with MHE will be treated and a new evaluation will be performed 6 months
      later.
