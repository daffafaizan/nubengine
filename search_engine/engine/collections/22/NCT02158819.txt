      TKA using standard instrumentation and TKA using a patient-matched cutting guide. The primary
      indication for this study is degenerative arthritis of the knee requiring unilateral primary
      total knee arthroplasty. Patients requiring TKA who are eligible and have consented to
      participate will be randomised to TKA with The Genesis II™ Total Knee Implant System or the
      Legion™ Primary Total Knee System using either Visionaire™ patient-matched cutting guides or
      standard instrumentation. The study will recruit for 1 year and patients will have a final
      follow up at the six week post-operative assessment.

      The primary objective of this study will evaluate the cost of the episode of care from
      hospital admission to discharge. This will include pre-operative costs, anesthetic costs,
      operative and theatre costs, costs of instruments and resources. The study will also measure
      length of stay as well as blood transfusion requirements. The secondary objectives of this
      study are to compare the safety and early readmission rates between the two techniques, by
      measuring the complication rates intra-operatively and post-operatively as well as the number
      of patients readmitted to hospital prior to the six week post-operative assessment.
