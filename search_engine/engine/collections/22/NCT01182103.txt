      development of major depressive disorder (MDD). BDNF had been reported to have an important
      role on neuronal plasticity, axonal growth and connectivity, and participating in the local
      response to various types of neuronal stressors. BDNF also influences the differentiation of
      neurons.

      In the past studies, the investigators had found that major depressive women had lower serum
      BDNF protein levels than healthy controls, and their BDNF levels became significantly
      increased after antidepressant treatments. In addition, some authors had found that reduced
      expression of BDNF was noted in postmortem brain of completed suicide subjects. Suicidal
      major depressive patients also had lower plasma BDNF levels than non-suicidal major
      depressive patients. These findings suggested that BDNF might play an important role in the
      suicidal behavior.

      However, in past studies, the results did not fully explain why major depressive patients
      with same genotypes had different clinical expression, including the severity of depression,
      with/without suicide, and the treatment response. Recently, some papers found that there were
      relationships between epigenetic regulation, including DNA methylation and histone
      modification, and psychopathology of major depression. Therefore, we try to investigate the
      relationships between epigenetic regulation of BDNF and major depression.
