      There is anecdotal evidence that some patients with cancer and concomitant psoriasis have
      shown improvement in their skin while receiving paclitaxel for cancer. Angiotech
      Pharmaceutical, Inc., the company with commercial rights over non-cancer uses of paclitaxel,
      has data that suggests paclitaxel demonstrates anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory
      properties, in addition to the better known antiangiogenic and antiproliferative effects
      attributed to this compound. In this pilot open-label single-dose study, we initially treated
      patients with severe refractory psoriasis using intravenous Micellar Paclitaxel (75 mg/m(2)
      every 4 weeks) for six months. Because this dosing regimen was well tolerated and because the
      dosing interval seemed too long, we now propose to treat patients with intravenous Micellar
      Paclitaxel at the adjusted dose of 37.5 mg/m(2) every 2 weeks.
