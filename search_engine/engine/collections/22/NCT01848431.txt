      transfusions if symptomatic or the fall below 25%. Patients in group 2 will receive
      transfusions to reach a hematocrit always above 30%.

      Tissue perfusion in free flaps will be measured with indocyanine green fluorescence
      angiography, confocal microscopy and oxygen partial pressure measurement probes.
