      usually controversial. Most are short-term, non-randomized. An essential limitation has been
      the lack of standardization of diagnosis. Some studies do not differentiate between joint
      pain and muscle pain, which can significantly affect the outcome of the treatment provided.

      Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) was recently published and
      validated. Their protocol allows standardization of the assessment and diagnosis of patients
      with temporomandibular disorder, including myofascial pain.

      To the investigator's knowledge, no previous prospective, randomized study has been conducted
      demonstrating the treatment outcomes of either trigger point injections or twin block in
      patients with chronic myofascial pain.
