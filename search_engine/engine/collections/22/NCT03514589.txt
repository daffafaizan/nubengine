      first step in a work-stream, which aims to develop the clinical applicability of the
      non-invasive SST in addition to using it as an important research tool. The invasive nature
      of the current diagnostic test makes large cohort research impracticable. Having gained proof
      of concept with the initial study we will now go on to gained detailed pharmacokinetic
      information in adults with the IV comparator of the 250 mcg test in addition to the data
      already gained for the 1 mcg test. We will test two doses of nasal Synacthen. We will do
      intra-individual variation work also.

      The next stage will then to be to perform pharmacokinetic validation of the nasal Synacthen
      plus chitosan dose in twenty children in order to establish that the chosen dose, peak
      cortisol response, bioavailability and pharmacokinetics are similar in the paediatric
      population. This will require 40 visits to our Childrens' Clinical Research Facility.

      In order to obtain the quality of pharmacokinetic data required for commercial regulatory
      approvals an improved Synacthen assay is required. This work is ongoing in collaboration with
      ACTH assay experts at the University of Manchester.
