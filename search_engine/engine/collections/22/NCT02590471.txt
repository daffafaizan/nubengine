      stented femoral and superficial femoral arteries, both axially and angularly. As a result,
      stents get broken, restenosed or thrombosed. Some researchers report a 20 to 46% two-year
      incidence of broke stents in the superficial femoral artery, while restenosis and occlusion
      incidence vary from 21.8% to 53.3% . In addition to axial and angular stress, contributing to
      this untoward effect is musculofascial sheath which houses the artery in distal thigh.

      Investigators suggest that standard stenting of an artery be augmented by incision of the
      anterior musculofascial sheath (septum intermuscular vastoadductoria) that will increase the
      mobility of distal part of the femoral artery, which will decrease frequency breakage of
      stents. Review of the world literature yielded no peer instances of such improvement of
      stenting outcomes in the said arteries.
