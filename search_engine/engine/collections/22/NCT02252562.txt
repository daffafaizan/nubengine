      health concerns that impact all healthcare arenas. Further work is indicated to better
      understand these healthcare issues in order that effective preventive measures can be
      developed.

      The investigators have developed and validated an experimental model for studying the
      mechanisms, risk factors for, and implications of bacterial cross contamination in the
      surgical operating room. The investigators have confirmed through use of this model that
      intraoperative bacterial transmission events occur frequently within and between operative
      cases and that these transmission events are linked to 30-day postoperative HCAIs and to
      increased patient mortality. In response, the investigators have implemented and evaluated
      various strategies designed to target risk factors for intraoperative bacterial transmission
      events including anesthesia provider hand hygiene compliance, improved handling and design of
      intravascular catheters, and improved environmental decontamination of high-risk objects.
      While these focused strategies have been successful in reducing transmission events and the
      incidence of 30-day postoperative infections, the investigators' recent work in the intensive
      care unit suggests that the hand hygiene system the investigators studied could be further
      optimized. The investigators now propose to evaluate the effectiveness of a multimodal hand
      hygiene system enhanced with novel wireless technology designed to facilitate real-time group
      and individual performance feedback, two evidence-based educational interventions, in
      reducing 30-day postoperative HCAIs (primary outcome) and intraoperative bacterial
      transmission events, hospital stay duration, and hospital re-admission rates (secondary
      outcomes).
