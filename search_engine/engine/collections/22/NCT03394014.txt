      amputation were randomly assigned to receive either sciatic nerve block using a popliteal
      approach (group P, n 28) or a sub gluteal approach (group G, n 28). Patients in both groups
      received same amount of LA (25 ml of bupivacaine 0.5 %) and additional ultrasound guided
      femoral nerve block by 10 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% to ensure sensory block of the medial side
      of the leg. Time to complete sensory and motor block, time taken to perform the block,
      block-related complications, block duration, time for asking for rescue analgesia in the
      first 24 h were recorded and both patients and surgeons were asked about their level of
      satisfaction. Success of the block was considered when the block is solid and doesn't require
      shifting to GA
