    
      The Intermittent Neurogenic Claudication Treatment with Aperius® (INCA) trial was designed as
      a multicenter single arm post-marketing study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the
      Aperius® in patients with degenerative lumbar stenosis with symptomatic neurogenic
      intermittent claudication.

      One hundred fifty six patients with a history of Degenerative lumbar spinal stenosis (Lumbar
      level L1 to L5) at one or maximum 2 levels with symptoms of neurogenic intermittent
      claudication with or without back pain were included. All patients were followed for 12
      months with visits at 48 hours, 7 days, 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months.

      Primary effectiveness endpoint was assessed as the mean percentage change from baseline in
      Zurich Claudication Questionnaire for Symptom Severity at 6 weeks. Other effectiveness
      outcomes were percentage change in Zurich Claudication Questionnaire scores (ZCQ), Quality of
      laife Questionnaire scores (called EuroQuol 5D or EQ-5D), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) pain
      scores (back, leg and buttock groin pain), pain medication and changes in walking distance
      from baseline to follow-up. Procedure and device related Serious Adverse Events were assessed
      throughout the complete 12 month follow-up period.
