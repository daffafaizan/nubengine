      exposure to traumatic events and includes symptoms of re-experiencing the trauma, such as
      through nightmares and flashbacks, avoidance and numbing, and physical hyperarousal. PTSD has
      been estimated to affect 10-20% of returning Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)/Operation Enduring
      Freedom (OEF) veterans. The most effective intervention found for PTSD is exposure therapy,
      which can be delivered in different formats, e. g. via virtual reality (VR) and as imaginal
      exposure. The goal of this study is to test the difference between 4 study conditions:
      virtual reality exposure therapy (VRE) or prolonged imaginal exposure therapy (PE), both
      combined with an antibiotic drug, DCS (active pill vs. placebo). D-Cycloserine (DCS), a drug
      that has been FDA approved for over 20 years, has been hypothesized to enhance the
      therapeutic effects of exposure therapy.). A secondary purpose of this study is to examine
      predictors for PTSD and response to PTSD intervention in active duty military personnel,
      veterans, and civilians who served in Iraq/Afghanistan. Psychophysiological factors (e.g.
      heart rate, blood pressure) and/or a genetic polymorphism (BDNF Val66Met) obtained from a
      saliva sample will be examined.

      The two primary co-aims are

        1. to examine the effects of DCS versus placebo (PLA) augmentation of exposure therapy on
           PTSD symptoms, and

        2. to examine the relative efficacy of virtual reality enhanced exposure therapy (VRE) and
           exposure therapy (PE) on PTSD symptoms.
