      solvents appears to be strongly increased in SSc. Moreover, exposure to silica is associated
      with a specific type of SSc phenotype with a worse prognosis. However, the type, intensity
      and probability of these expositions are unknown.

      The aim of the study is to precisely determine type, intensity and probability of toxic
      substances exposition in Systemic Sclerosis patients through an auto-questionnaire and
      integration of these data in a computer matrix.
