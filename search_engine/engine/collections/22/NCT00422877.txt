    
      This is a Phase II open-label study of weekly Taxoprexin® Injection in patients with advanced
      primary cancers of the liver, including hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), or carcinoma of the
      gallbladder or biliary tract (BTC), who have not received prior systemic cytotoxic therapy
      for advanced disease. Patients may have previously received radiation and/or systemic
      chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy. Patients may not have been treated previously with a
      taxane. Patients may have been previously treated with up to two immunological and/or
      biologic agents (e.g., interferon, monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors).
      Patients will receive Taxoprexin® Injection at a dose of 500mg/m2 (400mg/m2 for patients with
      an elevated bilirubin at baseline) intravenously by 1-hour infusion weekly for the first five
      weeks of a six week cycle. Treatment will continue until progression of disease, intolerable
      toxicity, refusal of continued treatment by patient or Investigator decision.
