      consecutive infants diagnosed with IC, according to Rome III criteria, will be prospectively
      enrolled in a 12 months period by 3 different Pediatric Gastroenterology units: Department of
      Translational Medical Science, Section of Pediatrics, University of Naples "Federico II";
      Institute of Pediatrics of the University of Foggia; Endoscopy and Gastroenterology Unit,
      Department of Pediatrics, University of Messina.

      After the enrollment, all children will be randomly assigned to receive Chamomilla L.,
      Melissa Officinalis L. and tyndallized L. Acidophilus (H122) (Group A), L reuteri DSM 17938
      (108 CFU) (Group B) or Simethicone (Group C). Treatment will be given to subjects for 28
      days. The study's primary outcome is defined as a reduction in the duration of average crying
      times, from baseline (day 0) to end of treatment (day 28). The secondary outcome measure is
      the number of participants who respond to treatment on days 28. Infants who experience a
      decrease in the daily average crying time of 50% from baseline will be considered as
      responders to the treatment. Parents will be instructed to complete a structured 28-day
      maternal diary, modified from Barr et al. in order to record the frequency of colic episodes
      and the daily crying and fussing time (in minutes), feeding schedule, stool frequency and
      characteristics, and any adverse events experienced (14). Follow-up visits will be conducted
      on study days 7, 14, 21 and 28 by the same study investigator. At that visit, diaries and
      unused study products will be returned.
