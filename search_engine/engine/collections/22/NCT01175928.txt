      neuropathy (DPN). DPN is an important risk factor for the development of foot ulceration, one
      of the most common causes for hospital admissions and lower-limb amputations among diabetic
      patients. However, to date there are no medications currently approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration to treat DPN.

      The goal of this research project is to assess the effectiveness of a non-invasive, patented
      peristaltic pulse pneumatic compression device (the NormaTec PCD) in a home treatment program
      to improve the symptoms of DPN (e.g. numbness, pain, and tingling in the legs) and the
      underlying functioning of the nerves in the legs (as determined by sensory perception
      assessments and Nerve Conduction Studies testing).

      In this prospective, randomized, double-blind study, subjects will be randomly placed in one
      of two groups: a control group using a sham NormaTec PCD ("placebo"); and an experimental
      group using a NormaTec PCD.
