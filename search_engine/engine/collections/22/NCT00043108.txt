        -  Determine the complete resection rate and toxic death rate of patients with locally
           advanced non-small cell lung cancer treated with paclitaxel, carboplatin, and
           radiotherapy followed by surgical resection and adjuvant paclitaxel and carboplatin.

        -  Determine the survival, event-free survival, and incidence of pathologic complete
           remission of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the protocol completion rate (CR) of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pathologic response rate/downstaging, pathologic near CR rate, freedom
           from distant metastasis rate, and freedom from local regional failure rate of patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive induction therapy comprising radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.5-6
      weeks and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22,
      29, and 36.

      Within 1-3 weeks after completion of induction therapy, patients undergo restaging. Patients
      with resectable disease undergo surgical resection within 4-8 weeks after induction therapy.
      Patients with unresectable disease undergo additional radiotherapy 5 days a week for 3 weeks
      and receive paclitaxel and carboplatin as in induction therapy on days 1, 8, and 15.

      Within 4-12 weeks after surgery or additional chemoradiotherapy, patients receive adjuvant
      therapy comprising paclitaxel and carboplatin as in induction therapy on day 1. Adjuvant
      treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 57 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
