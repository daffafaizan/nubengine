    
      The ARIES Norovirus Assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based qualitative in
      vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection of Norovirus GI/GII RNA from stool specimens
      obtained from symptomatic patients.

      The objective is to establish the diagnostic accuracy of the ARIES Norovirus assay through a
      multi-site, method comparison on prospectively collected leftover, stool specimens.
      Diagnostic accuracy will be expressed in terms of clinical sensitivity (or positive
      agreement) and specificity (or negative agreement)
