      considered to be more effective in reducing positive and negative symptoms and in improving
      cognitive deficits. They cause less extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia than
      typical antipsychotics. They still have a lot of important side effects like sedation,
      metabolic syndrome and weight gain. These effects could lead to obesity, type II diabetes and
      cardiovascular diseases, particularly for schizophrenia patients because they are already at
      an increased risk for these complications. Moreover, an increase in weight gain has been
      demonstrate to exacerbate negative symptoms and can lead to non compliance with a consequent
      risk of relapse. It also can create an additional social disadvantage for schizophrenia
      patients and decrease their quality of life. The weight gain will result, in part from an
      increased food intake (and probably an increased appetite) and from a decreased energy
      expenditure.

      The purpose of this study is to understand the cerebral mechanisms of appetite in patients
      with schizophrenia treated with atypical antipsychotics to prevent or treat their weight
      gain.
