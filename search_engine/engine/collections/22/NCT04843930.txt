      with cognition and daily functioning. These deficits are pronounced in cognitive domains
      including attention, learning and executive skills, and may continue to impact quality of
      life after recovery from other COVID-19 symptoms. This study aims to investigate the efficacy
      of AKL-T01 (Akili Interactive), a remotely-delivered digital cognitive intervention, in
      targeting and improving cognition and functional outcomes in individuals recovering from
      COVID-19. The efficacy of the AKL-T01 intervention will be measured relative to a waitlist
      control group.
