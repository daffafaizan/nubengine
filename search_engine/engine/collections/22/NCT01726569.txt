      glaucoma patients were diagnosed in the country of Asia areas. In the country of China,
      patients who are low educational level and less known acknowledgement and information have
      less known glaucoma. In the help of the government and some international non-governmental
      organizations(NGOs), a lot of people in the country know the cataract, and the operability of
      cataract is increase. Because vision loss usually development after operation for glaucoma.
      If patients did not understand this, they may be not only do not accept operation, but also
      affect operability of cataract. We hope the educational intervention for glaucoma can
      increase the degree of satisfaction in glaucoma patients.
