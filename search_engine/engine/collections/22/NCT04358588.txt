      pathogens and infections. In vitro studies have shown that NO inhibits the replication of
      severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and improves survival for
      cells infected with SARS-CoV. Additionally, in a clinical study of patients infected with
      SARS-CoV, iNO demonstrated improvements in arterial oxygenation, a reduction in ventilation
      support and an improvement in lung infiltrates observed on chest radiography. Based on the
      genetic similarities between the two coronaviruses, the data in SARS-CoV support the
      potential for iNO to provide meaningful benefit for patients infected with COVID-19.

      The clinical spectrum of the COVID-19 infection ranges from mild signs of upper respiratory
      tract infection to severe pneumonia and death. Preventing disease progression in patients
      with mild or moderate disease would improve morbidity/mortality and significantly reduce the
      impact on limited healthcare resources.

      Expanded access allows for iNO to be delivered via the INOpulse delivery system for the
      treatment of COVID-19. INOpulse technology provides targeted pulsatile delivery of iNO via
      portable INOpulse delivery system.
