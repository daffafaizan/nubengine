      following criteria can be met: (1) consistent engraftment, (2) little or no GVHD with the
      ability to rapidly withdraw immune suppression, (3) rapid recovery of CD4 counts to levels
      greater than 200 cells/micro liter. Our prior (ongoing) trial attempts to address how LLME
      treated T cells given as donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) can address points 2 and 3 above.
      The current study addresses how treatment of the CD34- fraction of the graft attempts to
      address points 1 and 2 (and to a lesser extent point 3) above. We believe that if these
      points can be consistently achieved that the mortality of allogeneic HSCT may be reduced to
      levels more akin to those of autologous HSCT. We propose to test the hypothesis that
      LLME-treated T cells will be safe with regard to reducing GVHD or other infusion related
      toxicities and that their administration as part of the transplant will facilitate
      engraftment. We believe that this approach will ultimately be an important step in a variety
      of transplant settings ranging from matched siblings to haplodisparate donors.
