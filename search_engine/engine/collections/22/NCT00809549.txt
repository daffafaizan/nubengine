      allow them to redistribute in the injured central nervous system and aid regeneration of
      damaged tissue. If the hypotheses is correct, it predicts that G-CSF treatment will improve
      the functional outcome of patients following acute ischemic stroke.

      Underlying this work are the following considerations:

        -  Currently the clinical and functional outcomes following ischemic strokes are poor and
           require new treatment strategies.

        -  G-CSF administration is a well established routine treatment for the mobilization of
           hematopoietic and endothelial precursors from the bone marrow into the circulation.

        -  Acute ischemia locally increases factors that direct circulating bone marrow derived
           cells to home to these sites of injury.

        -  Evidence exists that bone marrow derived cells are able to repopulate different tissues
           including those of the CNS.

        -  Acute ischemic injury to the central nervous system provides a milieu for the
           regeneration of neural tissue.
