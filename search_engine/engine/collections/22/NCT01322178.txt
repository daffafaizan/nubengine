      considerable progress.However, approximately 25% of patients with colorectal cancer present
      with overt metastatic disease. In selected patients, synchronous or metachronous liver
      metastases (LM) can be resected in curative intention. Over the last 5 years there has been
      the recognition that preoperative, neoadjuvant, combination chemotherapy regimens, namely,
      5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (5-FU/FA) in combination with either irinotecan or oxaliplatin
      can facilitate to downsize the initially unresectable LM and make the resection possible. The
      addition of targeted therapies might render them even more effective.

      Due to these results, the investigators hypothesize that cetuximab in combination with
      mFOLFOX6 as treatment in patients with KRAS wild-type, unresectable liver metastases of mCRC
      may further improve clinical outcomes.
