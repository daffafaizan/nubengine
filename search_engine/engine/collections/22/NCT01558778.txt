      I. To determine the feasibility of a mechanical stimulation regimen in hematopoietic cell
      transplant (HCT) patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the data collection tools to prepare for a larger phase II trial.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo mechanical stimulation over 20 minutes once daily (QD) beginning on date of
      hospital admission and continuing through day 100 post-HCT, except for day 0 (date of
      transplant).
