      with cognitive impairment. This knowledge is important to design programs that are
      appropriate. Dr. Elena Portacolone, an Assistant Professor from the Institute of Health and
      Aging is the study researcher.

      Study participants are interviewed by Elena at a time and place convenient to them, usually
      their home. Interviews are audio recorded and last around one hour. Study participants are
      interviewed five times within 3 months.

      After the interview, a transcriptionist will type into a computer the recording and will
      remove personal names. The sound recording will then be destroyed.

      Participants can stop being in the study at any time.
