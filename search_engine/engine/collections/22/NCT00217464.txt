      Primary

        -  Determine whether fulvestrant can slow the rise of prostrate-specific antigen (PSA)
           level in patients with early recurrent adenocarcinoma of the prostate after radical
           prostatectomy or irradiation.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the utility of monitoring serum PSA in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine changes in bone mineral density and markers of bone resorption in patients
           with PSA-only failure treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, single group assignment study.

      Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on days 0, 14, and 28. Treatment repeats once a
      month in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study for 84 months.
