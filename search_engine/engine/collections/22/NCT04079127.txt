    
      The objective of this post market surveillance study is to obtain outcome data on the Avenir
      Müller Hip Stem by analysis of standard scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event
      records, and thus to assess the long-term performance and safety of this implant.

      This is a multi-centre, retrospective post-market surveillance study involving orthopaedic
      surgeons skilled in hip surgery. Each case enrolled has received the Avenir Müller Hip Stem
      for a primary hip arthroplasty. The Avenir Müller Hip Stem is CE marked (European Conformity)
      and commercially available.
