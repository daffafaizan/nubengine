    
      Circulating Tumor Cells, free DNA, Stem Cells and EMT-related antigens as biomarkers of
      activity of cabazitaxel in castration-resistant prostate cancer

      Primary objectives: To evaluate the prognostic role of response of the copy number of
      androgen receptor (AR) and Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) and AR-V7 and other gene
      expression biomarkers in CTC and the investigators will compare these results with those
      obtained in plasma cell free DNA and RNA.

      Eligible patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed prostate cancer or
      unequivocal increased PSA . Metastatic and/or inoperable disease and received prior therapy
      with docetaxel and candidate to cabazitaxel treatment.

      All patients receive cabazitaxel at standard schedule 25 mg/m2 q21. Blood sample will be
      collected for CTC evaluation at baseline, after the first cycle of therapy (optional), at
      first radiological evaluation (after 3 months), at disease progression (optional) or after
      9-12 months of treatment for patients who did not show disease progression (optional).
      Disease progression defined according to Prostate Cancer Working Group 2 (PCWG2) criteria. On
      blood samples from Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer (CRPC) patients the investigators
      will investigate the presence of the previously presented CTC, DNA and RNA free markers.

      As an option, it will be possible to require a sample of the tumor collected during prostate
      surgery or during the biopsy.

      All patients will be treated and monitored according to the local clinical practice. No
      additional procedures/patient visits in comparison with the usual clinical practice are
      planned for the study.
