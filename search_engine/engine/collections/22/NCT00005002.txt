      than or equal to 2,000 copies/ml at Week 8 are randomized to receive Remune or Incomplete
      Freund's Adjuvant (IFA) at Week 9. Patients who do not achieve a plasma HIV-1 RNA level of
      less than or equal to 2,000 copies/ml at Week 8 are not randomized and are terminated from
      the study. These patients are eligible to receive funding for up to a 3-month supply of
      nelfinavir (Viracept) and Combivir. Randomized patients receive Remune or IFA at Week 9 and
      approximately every 12 weeks thereafter until study completion (when the last patient reaches
      Week 48). Patients are considered virologic failures if they (1) fail to achieve a virologic
      response by Week 48 or (2) after achieving a virologic response, have a virologic relapse.
      Regardless of their previous response status, patients whose plasma HIV-1 RNA level increases
      to greater than 2,000 copies/ml while they are receiving protocol-specified HAART are
      eligible to receive salvage therapy and continue to receive Remune or IFA until study
      completion. Study visits occur at screening, Day 1, Weeks 4, 8, 9, 12, and then every 4 weeks
      thereafter until the last patient reaches Week 48. Patients who complete this study are
      eligible to participate in a rollover study.
