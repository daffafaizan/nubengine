      transmission also contributed greatly to HIV epidemic which was mostly reported in South-west
      rural areas. In past years, Yunnan has experienced powerful campaign of scaling-up the HIV
      identification as well as antrertroviral therapy.

      This study will investigate how to reach the last two of HIV'90-90-90 targets': to provide
      antiretroviral therapy (ART) for 90% of who diagnosed HIV infection and to achieve viral
      suppression for 90% of those treated.

      The study population consists of participants who received an newly diagnosed HIV infection
      within the study period. All rerolled participants will be randomized into different study
      group. In intervention group, medical institutions will provide patients personal involved
      intervention strategies which guided by frequent viral load detection, and providing of the
      dosage form of 400 mg EFV in their antiviral therapy.

      Main assessment measures are viral suppression rate of HIV-infected patients and treatment
      coverage .
