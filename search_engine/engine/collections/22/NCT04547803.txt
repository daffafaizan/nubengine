      the PEARL team and screened for study eligibility. Eligible patients who provide oral consent
      to participate. Participants will be randomized 1:1 with comparisons between "Usual care" and
      "Usual care + Video-visit" arms. Participants randomized to the intervention arm will
      participate in a 15-20 minute Video visit (using ZoomÂ®) with an advanced practice provider
      (APP; nurse practitioner or physician assistant in HIM) approximately 2-5 days after
      discharge. The telephone follow-up will occur 3-6 days after discharge. If a patient has a
      Video visit, the telephone follow-up will be scheduled for after the Video visit.

      It is standard practice for HIM teams to make and coordinate outpatient appointments and
      activities including radiologic procedures for discharging patients. During this study, usual
      care will continue for patients in each arm. The intervention (Video-visit) is in addition to
      and not in place of the usual standard of care.

      If issues/concerns beyond the scope of the video visit or telephone follow-up arise, then the
      PEARL APP will direct these to the discharging hospitalist team/supervising physician, or the
      participant's primary care provider (PCP) consistent with current standards of practice and
      management of post-discharge issues. Issues re-directed to the discharging hospitalist team
      or other providers will be documented in the Video-visit encounter. If the APP deems the
      clinical situation urgent or emergent, the APP will refer the patient to emergency services,
      or if needed ask the patient his/her location and contact 911. The APP will also immediately
      notify the study PI or co-PI who are both hospitalists and familiar with the practice. The
      APP will also notify the discharging hospitalist team.
