      distant metastatic disease. While survival is slowly improving with better diagnostic tools
      and therapy, the overall 5-year survival remains low at 18%. Unlike other malignancies, such
      as colon cancer and prostate cancer, there is no peripheral blood marker of response or
      recurrence during treatment in esophageal cancer. However, quantifying cfDNA is a unique and
      tumor specific avenue that may allow real time response to treatment in esophageal cancer.

      To identify esophageal cancer specific mutations, tumor samples will undergo whole exome
      sequencing. From this data, the investigators will select 10-15 genes to focus their efforts.
      PCR primers will be designed to detect these tumor specific mutations in the cell-free
      component of peripheral blood samples over the course of treatment for esophageal cancer.

      The investigators will obtain baseline blood (before treatment) and then collect blood after
      neoadjuvant treatment, after surgery, and then at subsequent visits from the participants.
