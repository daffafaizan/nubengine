      in up to 330 participants with GA due to AMD being treated with IONIS-FB-LRx. The study is a
      Phase 2, double-masked, randomized, stratified, placebo-controlled study conducted at
      multiple centers. It is an adaptive design in which three dose levels will be evaluated in a
      subset of patients (Stage 1) and, following an interim analysis, the number of patients in
      two of the dose cohorts will be expanded (Stage 2).
