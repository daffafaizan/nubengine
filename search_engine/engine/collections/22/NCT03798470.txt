      for opioid addiction. A local non-profit community-based addiction recovery program, Faces
      and Voices of Recovery (FAVOR) utilizes a peer recovery coaching model applied to substance
      use disorders by identifying, training, credentialing and supervising individuals who have
      been in recovery for at least 2 years.These peer recovery coaches become the primary
      workforce in this community-based model. FAVOR provides no-cost comprehensive services for
      addiction recovery. The investigators hypothesized that having FAVOR Recovery Coaches (FRC)
      evaluate patients during an ED visit for opioid overdose would result in a high degree of
      engagement from the patients and serve as an opportunity to begin treatment for addiction.
