      Arthroplasty (TKA) using Patient-specific (PSI) or conventional Instrumentation.

      For this purpose, economic variables of the surgery (number of instrument trays, setup and
      cut-sew-time), radiological alignment and patient reported outcomes (VAS Pain Scale, Oxford
      Knee Score, EQ-5D) were assessed. Cost per QALY (quality-adjusted life year) was assessed
      using the German DRG reimbursement and the EQ-5D.

      A total of 139 TKA with PSI or conventional instrumentation were included in three Centers
      and were assessed before surgery, as well as 6 weeks, 6 and 12 months postoperatively.
