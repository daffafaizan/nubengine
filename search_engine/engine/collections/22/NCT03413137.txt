      fusion prostate biopsy among men. The target population are males that are schedule to
      undergo MRI-US Fusion prostate biopsy and have an MRI of the prostate. All the pathological
      samples would be conducted from the area in the prostate that was found as suspicious of
      malignancy by previous MRI imaging, and defined as region of interest (ROI).

      First the prostate biopsy will be preformed in a transperineal approach; Then a transrectal
      approach would be used to sample a few more cores.

      The primary endpoint will be To compare the detection rate for clinically significant
      prostate cancer between transperineal vs transrectal mp-MRI-fusion/TRUS biopsies.
      Additionally, the study aims to determine the accuracy of prostate cancer detection in
      transperineal vs transrectal mp-MRI-fusion/TRUS biopsies.
