      more important. Although estimates vary, 70-85% of Americans will suffer from back pain at
      some point in their lives. Back pain is well established as one of the most common reasons
      for seeking care from a medical doctor. The American public also turns to alternative
      medicine providers, such as doctors of chiropractic, for back pain care. However, few
      clinical examples and little scientific evidence exist of care coordination between these two
      provider groups in general, and none that specifically target older adults above the age of
      65. The purpose of the Collaborative Care for Older Adults with Back Pain (COCOA) Clinical
      Trial is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and feasibility of a collaborative care model
      (medical and chiropractic care) through a pragmatic, prospective pilot trial conducted with
      120 older adults over the age of 65 with low back pain of at least 1 month duration.
      Participants will be randomized to 3-parallel treatment arms: a) conventional medical care
      (MED CARE), b) unlinked conventional medical and chiropractic care (DUAL CARE), and c) a
      co-management model including conventional medical and chiropractic care (SHARED CARE).
      Participants in all three groups will receive up to 12 weeks of usual back pain treatment
      from medical doctors or doctors of osteopathy (MD/DO) at Genesis Family Medical Center.
      Participants in two treatment groups additionally will receive up to 12 weeks of usual
      chiropractic care for back pain from doctors of chiropractic at the Palmer Research Clinic.
      Outcomes including pain, disability and secondary outcomes will be measured at 1, 2, and 3
      months (primary endpoint) with follow-up assessments completed by telephone at 6, 9, and 12
      months.
