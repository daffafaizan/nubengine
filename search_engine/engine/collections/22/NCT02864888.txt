    
      QT/QTc interval prolongation is investigated during the first two weeks of subject
      participation in the parallel phase 3 study. The pre-cordial leads and lead II will be
      utilized to determine QT/QTc prolongation. Descriptive information is provided on changes in
      T and U wave morphologies. The percentage of subjects in each therapy group who have
      worsening of the T and U wave morphology is documented. Discrete U waves are excluded from
      the QT/QTc interval measurement. Except for the pre-therapy ECGs, all ECGs are performed
      during one ANP therapy infusion daily, that being an afternoon infusion to account for
      diurnal variation in the QT/QTc interval. The study subject is at rest in the supine position
      for 30 minutes prior to the ECG study. The baseline QTc is derived from 3 ECGs taken on day 1
      during the hour preceding the first Antineoplaston therapy infusion or the first radiation
      session.
