      different times: only in the morning, only at night, and half in the morning, half at night.
      After 2 weeks taking the insulin in one regimen, patients will be switched to another
      regimen. Through the whole study, patients will be injecting themselves twice daily, and
      neither the patient nor the treating doctor will know which vials contain the insulin and
      which have only saline (placebo). The vials will be labeled MORNING or EVENING. Patients will
      continue to take their mealtime, short acting insulin doses.

      Additionally, patients will wear a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) which will be masked.
      Before the study, patients will be taught about how to use the CGM, and keep it taped to
      their abdomen. The site that the CGM inserts into their abdomen will need to be changed every
      5 days. We will know if a patients' blood sugar goes low even if the patient did not feel the
      low. Patients will still have to self-monitor their blood sugar levels at-least four times in
      five days, to calibrate the CGM.
