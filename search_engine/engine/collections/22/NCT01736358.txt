      general population. Life-time incidence of urolithiasis is estimated to be between 5%- 12%.
      The treatment of kidney stones depends on stone type and size, symptom severity, and the
      presence of obstruction.

      URS is a common ambulatory procedure as improved technological advances and increased
      clinical utilization have helped decrease postoperative complications. Despite an overall
      reduction in the perioperative complication rate, post operative pain management after URS
      remains a major factor delaying discharge of patients.

      Post operative pain after URS is usually treated with opioids and non steroidal anti
      inflammatory drugs. Intranasal ketorolac (SprixTM) is an FDA approved pain formulation for
      short term management (5 days) of moderate to moderately severe pain that requires analgesia
      at the opioid level. The efficacy of intranasal ketorolac formulation was demonstrated in
      placebo-controlled studies in patients following major surgeries.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the role perioperative usage of single-dose
      of intranasal ketorolac on immediate post operative opioid requirements. Secondary objectives
      of the study are to (a) evaluate the post operative pain score 30 minutes after surgery, 1
      hour after surgery, and 2 hours after surgery, (b) find the incidence of immediate (until
      discharge) and 24hrs post operative side effects in the target population, (c) find the level
      of anesthesia satisfaction in the target population, (d) find the time to discharge in the
      target population, (e) compare the two groups post anesthesia discharge score.
