      individuals in their lifetime. However, the current antidepressant agents take weeks to work,
      and fail to help at least 40% of depressed patients. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a
      remarkably effective treatment for depression, but its use is limited by cognitive
      dysfunction.

      As a result, it is becoming a clinical problem which need to be settled urgently. Previous
      clinical study showed that subanesthetic dose of ketamine could play a role in antidepressant
      effects with safety and minimal positive psychotic symptoms.The investigators also found that
      subanesthetic dose of ketamine combined with other anesthetics could improve cognitive
      function in depressive rats receiving electroconvulsive shock (a model for analogy with ECT).
      Few clinical researches concerned the effects of subanesthetic dose of ketamine combined with
      propofol anesthesia on cognitive function in patients after ECT, therefore the investigators
      conduct this randomized controlled double-blind trial. In this study, cognitive function will
      be rated by Mini-Mental State examination score.
