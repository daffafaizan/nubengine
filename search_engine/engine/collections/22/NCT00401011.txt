    
      The primary objective of the phase I portion is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      perifosine in combination with bortezomib in patients previously treated with bortezomib.

      All patients will receive daily perifosine qhs with food. In the initial phase I study, 3
      patients will be entered into a specified combination of perifosine and bortezomib cohorts.
      If no dose-limiting toxicity is observed, then three additional patients will be entered in
      cohort 4 - a full dose of bortezomib (1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 every 3 weeks). If
      this dose is tolerated it will be used for the phase II study, otherwise an intermediate dose
      of 1 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 every 3 weeks will be employed.

      The phase II study will use the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib and perifosine. The
      primary objective of phase II portion is to determine the response rate (the combined CR + PR
      + MR) following treatment with perifosine + bortezomib in patients with multiple myeloma who
      have relapsed following initial front-line therapy, are refractory to their most recent
      therapy, and were previously treated with bortezomib. The secondary objectives of the phase
      II portion are;

        1. To further assess the safety and tolerability of perifosine in combination with
           bortezomib-with or without dexamethasone-in patients with multiple myeloma.

        2. To obtain correlative data in patients with multiple myeloma treated with perifosine in
           combination with bortezomib-with or without dexamethasone (NOTE Centers may choose not
           to participate in correlative studies).
