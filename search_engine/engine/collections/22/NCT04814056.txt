    
      This is an open-label, sing-arm clinical study,which will recruit about 15 patients in China.

      The study is designed to evaluate the efficacy of Afatinib in treatment of NRG1-fused locally
      advanced/metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and explore the clinical factors that
      may predict the effectiveness of treatment.

      Target Patient Population:Locally advanced (stage IIIB) or metastatic (stage IV) NRG1-fused
      non-small cell lung cancer patients, who have previously received platinum-based doublet
      chemotherapy and developed disease progression subsequently.

      Test Drug, Dosage and Medication Regimen:Afatinib is the second-generation TKI drug, which
      can irreversibly bind to receptors of erbB family. Afatinib will be administered orally at a
      dose of 40 mg per time, Q.D. If a patient cannot tolerate a dose of 40mg due to adverse
      reactions, when the adverse reactions restore to level 1 (CTCAE 5.0) or below, the dosage
      could be adjusted to 30mg per day, Q.D.

      Evaluations of Study:The data to be collected include demographic characteristics of the
      patients, information necessary to determine whether the patients are qualified (including
      medical history, features of previous and current diseases and NRG1 fusion status in tumor
      tissue), and efficacy and safety data in terms of objective response rate (ORR), disease
      control rate (DCR) and progression-free survival (PFS).
