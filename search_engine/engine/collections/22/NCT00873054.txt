      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy is the standard therapy used for large kidney stones greater
      than 20 millimeters or stones in the lower kidney. For moderate sized kidney stone (10-20
      mm),currently the options for treatment include both methods. However, no studies have proven
      that one procedure is better than the other. So, we will compare both the procedures for
      breaking the kidney stone. Our main outcome measures will be the stone-free status after the
      procedure. Other outcome measures are assessment of morbidity associated with use of the
      procedures i.e. any minor or major complications within 3 months of initial treatment.
      Patient will be assessed for infection at post-operative office visits to include a basic
      urinalysis only if they have systemic indicators of infection (fever, dysuria, frequency,
      etc.). Pain will be monitored with the scale of 0-10 points. Also we will review of stone
      density on Computerized Tomography (CT) scans and the effect this has on success of both
      procedures. We hope with PCNL stone-free rates will be minimum with minimal morbidity and
      ultimately improve patient care.
