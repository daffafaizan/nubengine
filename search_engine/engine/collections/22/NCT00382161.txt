      activation of guanylate-cyclase. Pleiotropic effects of statins are well known regarding the
      increase of endothelial function. Thus, activation of endothelial NO-synthase could raise the
      activation of guanylate-cyclase with a consecutive relaxation of smooth muscle cells in the
      penile arteries and the corpus cavernosum leading to an improvement of erectile function.
      Therefore, statins are supposed to be effective in the treatment of erectile dysfunction,
      especially in patients with cardiovascular risk-factors with underlying endothelial
      dysfunction.

      The effect of fluvastatin on penile blood-flow and erectile function in patients with
      arteriogenic erectile dysfunction and cardiovascular risk factors will be determined in a
      cross-over design. Patients were either treated with fluvastatin-sodium 80mg or placebo for 8
      weeks. After a wash-out of 4 weeks, treatment will be switched (placebo /
      fluvastatin-sodium). Penile blood flow measurement and assessment of erectile function with
      the IIEF-5-score and the KEED-score will be performed at baseline, after 8 weeks of
      treatment, after 4 weeks wash-out and after cross-over treatment (8 weeks).
