      the treatment of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).However, the sample size of these
      studies is small and most studies use B-ultrasound or CT for semi-quantitative determination
      of liver fat content. The defects of evaluation methods seriously affect the accuracy of the
      studies. Also, antioxidant agents have been proposed as a potentially effective treatment.
      Vitamin E is a potent antioxidant compound, which has been tested in pediatric NAFLD because
      of the absence of side effects. Conflicting results have been reported in clinical trials,
      both in children and in adults. The project intends to adopt advanced proton magnetic
      resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) to non-invasively and precisely determine liver fat content
      and understand the change in liver fat content before and after the treatment with
      atorvastatin tablets or Vitamin E in NAFLD patients with abnormal lipid metabolism and type 2
      diabetes. We also intend to compare the therapeutic effects of atorvastatin and Vitamin E in
      the treatment of NAFLD.
