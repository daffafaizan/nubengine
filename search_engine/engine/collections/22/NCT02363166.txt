      the UFHealth Shands Hospital's Adult and Pediatric Emergency Department. The collected
      information will serve as pilot data for a future large comprehensive multi-site study.

      Patients will have a wound culture and a nasal swab obtained as part of the study, which will
      be assessed for MRSA isolates using next-generation whole genome sequencing. The principal
      investigator or PI designee will also survey participants and review hospital records.
