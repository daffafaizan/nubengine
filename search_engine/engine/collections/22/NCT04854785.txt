      [11C]SL25.1188 scan (for MAO-B) - as well as one MRI scan.

      The primary hypotheses are:

        1. TSPO VT and MAO-B VT are greater in the PFC, ACC, and hippocampus in COVID-19 with new
           onset, persistent MDE with or without other neuropsychiatric symptoms after recovery
           from mild respiratory symptoms (DNP-mild).

        2. TSPO VT and MAO-B VT are greater in the PFC, ACC, and hippocampus in COVID-19 with new
           onset, persistent MDE with or without other persistent neuropsychiatric symptoms after
           recovery from moderate respiratory symptoms (DNP-moderate).

      Exploratory hypotheses are:

        1. Greater TSPO VT and MAO-B VT in the PFC, ACC, and hippocampus will be positively
           associated with severity of MDE symptoms and poorer performance on cognitive tasks.

        2. TSPO VT and MAO-B VT will be positively correlated in the PFC, ACC and hippocampus in
           COVID-DNP.
