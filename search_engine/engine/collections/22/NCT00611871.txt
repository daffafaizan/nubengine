      investigation of a novel therapeutic approach to post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
      Current treatments for PTSD include exposure and other aspects of cognitive therapy as well
      as drug therapies based on serotonin-reuptake inhibiting antidepressant agents. However,
      these treatments are often unsuccessful, and symptoms in affected individuals may persist for
      decades. The central hypothesis guiding this research project posits that acquired fear
      responses, such as those in PTSD, when reactivated by recall become sensitive to
      noradrenergic modulation and thus may be permanently attenuated by blocking noradrenergic
      transmission. Further, we predict that this attenuation will facilitate subsequent therapy.
      In the current study, we will be investigating this model in three groups of Veterans of
      either Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF) with PTSD: 1)
      Individuals who receive propranolol following recall of a traumatic memory
      (Propranolol-trauma); 2) Individuals who receive a placebo following recall of a traumatic
      memory (Placebo-trauma), and; 3) Individuals who receive propranolol following recall of an
      affective neutral memory (Propranolol-neutral). In addition, traumatic memory recall will be
      psychophysiologically assessed by measuring Veterans' facial corrugator electromyography
      (EMG), skin conductance, blood pressure and cardiovascular inter-beat interval responses pre-
      and one month post-medication administration.
