    
      This is a 28-week open protocol, composed of two phases of randomized treatments with 14
      weeks duration.

      Inclusion criteria: DSM-IV diagnosis of OCD; age between 7 and 17 years; willing to
      participate in the protocol; parents or legal tutors agreement with their child participation
      in the protocol; absence of physical or cognitive impairment that prevent the participation
      in the protocol.

      We expect to end the protocol with 50 patients in each arm (total = 200). For this reason,
      the purpose is to recruit at least 400 patients for the first randomization (R1: fluoxetine X
      group CBT). Responders to the initial type of treatment will be maintained in the same
      procedure for additional 14 weeks. The second randomization (R2) will address non-responders
      to fluoxetine, who will be randomized to switch to group CBT or receive group CBT as add-on
      therapy; and non-responders to group CBT, who will be randomized to switch to fluoxetine or
      receive fluoxetine as add-on therapy.

      Fluoxetine will be administered in drops or capsules, in doses ranging from 10 to 80mg/day.
      Group CBT will be delivered weekly, in 2-hour sessions, in groups of 6 to 8 participants.

      At the end of each treatment (weeks 14 and 28), treatment response will be assessed by blind
      raters, through the YBOCS and CGI-global improvement subscale. Response will be defined as at
      least 35% reduction in baseline YBOCS scores and a CGI score of 1 or 2.

      Efficacy of treatments at the end of R1 will be compared and the efficacy of the different
      sequences of treatments at the end of R2 (adaptive treatment strategies) will be compared by
      means of an intention-to-treat analysis.
