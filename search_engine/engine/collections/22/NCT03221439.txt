    
      One hundred and forty eight patients with chronic low back pain from two outpatient
      physiotherapy clinics in Brazil will be randomized to receive either Cognitive Functional
      Therapy or combined Manual Therapy and Motor Control Exercises. Intervention: 4-10 sessions
      of CFT. Control: 4-10 sessions of combined Manual Therapy and Motor Control Exercises.
      Measurements: Clinical outcomes will be assessed at the baseline, 3 months, 6 months and 12
      months after randomization. Analysis: Intention-to-treat analysis will be performed, and
      linear mixed models will be calculated to evaluate the effect of the intervention.
      Non-specific predictors, moderators and mediators of outcome will also be analysed.
      Discussion: This study will investigate whether the results of the first CFT clinical trial
      can be replicated. In addition, the results will contribute to a better understanding of the
      efficacy of the CFT approach.
