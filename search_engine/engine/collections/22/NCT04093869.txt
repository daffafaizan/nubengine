      distress and (ii) improving functional capacity. It is hypothesized that compared to SOC-ED,
      the CSTEX intervention will result in 1) greater reductions in global distress measured by an
      established psychometric test battery; and 2) greater improvements in functional capacity
      assessed by distance walked on a standard Six Minute Walk test (6MWT).
