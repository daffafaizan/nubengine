      I. Evaluate the clinical effectiveness of flavopiridol in patients with metastatic androgen
      independent adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

      II. Assess the toxic effects of flavopiridol in this patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive intravenous flavopiridol over 72 hours every 2 weeks for at least 4 courses.
      After 2 courses of treatment, patients not experiencing unacceptable toxic effects may
      receive a dose escalation. Patients are followed every 3 months until death.
