    
      Eutopic endometrium was obtained and separated into single endometrial stromal cell (ESC) in
      women with adenomyosis (study group) and without adenomyosis (control group).

      After becoming pre-confluent (covering 80% of the culture well), ESC was cultured for 8 days
      solely or with the addition of medroxyprogesterone (MPA) or danazol.

      ELISA was done to measure IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha concentrations of the culture media.

      Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was done to measure IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-alpha RNA levels in
      ESC.
