      I. To characterize the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 9cUAB30 in healthy volunteers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicities of this drug in these participants. II. To correlate the
      pharmacokinetics with the toxicity of this drug in these participants.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive a single dose of oral 9cUAB30 on day 1. Blood and urine samples are
      collected at baseline, periodically on day 1, and then on day 8 for pharmacokinetic studies
      by high performance liquid chromatography.

      After completion of treatment, participants are followed at days 8 and 30.
