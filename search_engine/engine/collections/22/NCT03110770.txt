      a 3-dose vaccination regimen with the Zika virus wildtype (ZIKVwt) DNA vaccine
      (VRC-ZKADNA090-00-VP) or placebo (VRC-PBSPLA043-00-VP). The placebo was a sterile
      phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). The hypotheses were that the ZIKVwt DNA vaccine would be
      safe and would elicit a ZIKV-specific immune response.

      Participants received study product intramuscularly (IM) in the limbs as specified by the
      group assignment by PharmaJet needle-free device. In Part A, 90 participants were randomized
      to vaccine at a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 4 mg dose split between 2 injections, 4 mg dose
      split between 4 injections or 8 mg dose split between 4 injections. In Part B, 2338
      participants were randomized to vaccine or placebo in a 1:1 ratio to receive a 4 mg (1 mL)
      dose of vaccine or 1 mL of placebo split between 2 injections. The vaccine dose and
      administration plan for Part B was selected based on Part A and Phase 1 data.

      Vaccine safety and tolerability were assessed by monitoring of clinical and laboratory
      parameters throughout the study. Solicited reactogenicity symptoms were collected for 7 days
      after each product administration. The study schedule included clinic visits with safety and
      immunogenicity blood samples collected at particular time points.

      Vaccine efficacy was evaluated in Part B by comparing incidence of virologic ZIKV cases
      between vaccine and placebo groups. During the study, when participants exhibited any
      possible symptom of ZIKV infection, they were evaluated by blood and urine ZIKV polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR). Stored blood samples were also assessed retrospectively by ZIKV PCR to
      identify possible asymptomatic cases. A Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) oversaw the
      study.
