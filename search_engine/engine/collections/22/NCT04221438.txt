    
      PRIMARY CLINICAL OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the pathologic complete response (pCR) rate of neoadjuvant treatment with
      encorafenib and binimetinib.

      SECONDARY CLINICAL OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine response rate (RR) (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST]),
      disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS).

      II. To describe correlation of pCR with RR, DFS and OS. III. To assess safety and toxicity.

      CORRELATIVE SCIENCE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate CD8 positive (+) T cell infiltration and Ki-67 status in tumor or tumor bed
      pre, during, and post neoadjuvant treatment and the change in CD8+ tumor infiltrating
      lymphocyte (TIL) with neoadjuvant treatment and correlate with clinical response.

      II. To compare local review for pathologic response with central pathology review.

      III. To assess the correlation between change in fluorothymidine F-18 (18F-FLT) PET/CT uptake
      and change in Ki-67.

      IMAGING OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the change in 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake (from baseline to post-neoadjuvant therapy)
      among patients with and without pathologic complete response.

      II. To compare post-neoadjuvant 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake among patients with and without
      pathologic complete response.

      III. To estimate an optimal threshold for prediction of pathologic complete response using i)
      change in 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake, and ii) post-neoadjuvant 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake.

      IV. To assess the correlation between change in 18F-FLT PET/CT uptake and change in Ki-67.

      OUTLINE:

      NEOADJUVANT TREATMENT: Patients receive 18F-FLT intravenously (IV) and undergo a PET/CT scan
      approximately 60 minutes later. Within 2 weeks, patients receive encorafenib orally (PO) once
      daily (QD) and binimetinib PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 2 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      then receive 18F-FLT IV and undergo a second PET/CT scan approximately 60 minutes later.

      SURGICAL RESECTION: Within 2 weeks of completing therapy with encorafenib and binimetinib,
      patients undergo surgery.

      ADJUVANT TREATMENT: Within 2-7 days after surgery, patients resume treatment with encorafenib
      PO QD and binimetinib PO BID on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 11
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, then
      every 6 months for 3 years.
