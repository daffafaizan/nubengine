    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm observational study, in which enrolled
      patients will be implanted with the ENTERPRISE 2 for evaluation of safety and effectiveness
      of ENTERPRISE 2 in real-world applications.

      The study population will consist of 164 patients with ruptured or unruptured intracranial
      aneurysms and a parent vessel diameter of ≥2.5 mm and ≤4 mm. All patients will be implanted
      with the study device.

      The enrolled patients will be followed at 30 days, 180 days, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4
      years and 5 years post procedure.

      The primary endpoint is the incidence of aneurysm recanalization (at 180 days) evaluated
      through digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Secondary effectiveness endpoints include
      incidence of aneurysm recanalization (at 1 year), successful stent/coil placement rate
      (immediately post procedure), aneurysm occlusion (immediately post procedure, at 180 days and
      1 year), incidence of retreatment (at 30 and 180 days, and 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years). Safety
      evaluation include: incidence of disabling stroke or neurological death (at 180 days and 1
      year), incidence of in-stent thrombosis (at 180 days and 1 year), and incidence of in-stent
      stenosis (at 180 days and 1 year). Exploratory endpoints include stent wall apposition
      performance (intra-procedure), first-time deployment success rate (intra-procedure) and
      duration of stent deployment (intra-procedure).
