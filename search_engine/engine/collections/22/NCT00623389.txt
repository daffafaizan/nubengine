      the trunk and legs. Electrode leads are connected to an stimulator/telemeter. Following
      implantation, patients undergo training in standing, transfers and other advanced mobility
      skills using the functional electrical stimulation system. A prescribed course of exercise,
      functional training and rehabilitation with the implanted stimulation system, followed by
      laboratory assessments of strength, balance and functional abilities with and without the
      system, as well as the technical performance of the implanted components. Home-based training
      follows prior to discharge for home use of the system.

      Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months after discharge and then annually thereafter.
