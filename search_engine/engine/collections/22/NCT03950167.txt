      However it has never been evaluated whether there is any difference in gallbladder functions
      between healthy pregnant women and pregnant women diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum.
      Moreover correlation between hyperemesis gravidarum symptom scores and gallbladder functions
      has never been assessed. There is also few data comparing serum cholecystokinin levels
      between healthy pregnant women and those diagnosed with hyperemesis gravidarum. The
      investigators will measure serum cholecystokinin levels after a fatty meal (100 g chocolate)
      and compare two groups. In this study the investigators would like to evaluate gallbladder
      functions and serum cholecystokinin levels in women with hyperemesis gravidarum and compare
      these with healthy subjects.
