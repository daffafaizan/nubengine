      This balance is analyzed according to types of activity such as self-care, productivity and
      leisure time, as well as different dimensions such as the physical, mental and social
      dimensions required to engage in activities. Occupational balance is a concept related to
      health and well-being. Therefore, determining the factors affecting this concept is important
      for health promotion interventions. There is no study in the literature on the relationship
      between socio-demographic factors and occupational balance. The results of this study are
      thought to provide new information to the literature.
