    
      - Arm A: Participants will receive daily doses of bosutinib orally for 7-9 days prior to
      surgery. On the day of the scheduled surgery (either craniotomy or surgical resection as
      planned by the treating doctor), participants will take the bosutinib within 6-12 hours of
      the surgery. During the surgery, tissue samples of the tumor will be collected to test the
      levels of bosutinib in the brain. A contrast-enhanced MRI or CT scan will be done within days
      after the surgery. Daily dosing of bosutinib will resume after a recovery period of 10 days.
      From then on, the study will be divided into 28-day cycles.

      The following tests/procedures will be performed regularly during cycles of study treatment:
      medical history; physical exam; blood tests; contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans (even numbered
      cycles only).

        -  Arm B: Participants will receive daily doses of bosutinib. The study is divided int
           28-day cycles. There are no breaks from taking bosutinib between treatment cycles. The
           following tests/procedures will be performed regularly during cycles of study treatment:
           medical history; physical exam; blood tests; contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans (even
           numbered cycles only).

        -  Participants may continue to receive daily bosutinib until their disease worsens, they
           experience unmanageable side-effects, or they decide to stop treatment.
