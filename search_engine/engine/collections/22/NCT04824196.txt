      years were assigned to a group 1 (n=22) engaging in vestibular visual cues exercises and
      group 2 (n=22) engaging in proprioception exercises. Training sessions (~30 minutes each)
      occurred twice a week for consecutive six weeks. The following parameters were analyzed
      before and after training for both groups: Berg balance scale (BBS) and Clinical test of
      sensory organization and balance (CTSIB).
