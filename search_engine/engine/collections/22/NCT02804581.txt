      bacterial aerobic fermentation of Gum Arabic , it has a potent anti-inflammatory effect and
      can down regulates TNF a expression by modulating NF-kB-DNA binding activity , in addition
      butyrate is known to act as histone deacetylase inhibitor in the cells.Recently, in vitro and
      in vivo data indicates that HDAC inhibitors may have anti-inflammatory effect due to their
      effects on cell death acting through acetylation of non-histone proteins. The possible
      anti-rheumatic mechanisms of HDAC inhibitors, including growth arrest in rheumatoid arthritis
      synovial fibroblasts (RASFs), suppression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, suppressing
      angiogenesis as well as the protective effects on bone and cartilage against their
      destruction.

      The investigators expect regular intake of GA will raise serum butyrate level. The endogenous
      butyrate decreases the TNF level. The latter will decrease the number of relapsing episodes,
      arresting the destruction of joints and improve both survival and life quality of rheumatoid
      arthritis patients.
