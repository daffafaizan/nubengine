      clinical practice (both primary care and sub-specialties) and has become one of the most
      challenging therapeutic dilemmas in GERD management. It has been estimated that up to 30% of
      the patients receiving PPI once daily will continue to report typical GERD symptoms [1].
      Presently, increasing the PPI dose has been the standard of care in these patients [2].
      However, success in relieving refractory GERD symptoms with such a therapeutic approach has
      been extremely limited, resulting in frustration of both the patient as well as the health
      care provided. Furthermore, patients who fail PPI will continue to seek medical attention and
      may undergo a variety of invasive or non-invasive tests, and thus consume already limited
      health care resources. Recent advancement in the understanding of the diverse composition of
      the different GERD groups as well as symptom generation has led to the recognition of
      alteration in pain perception as an important contributing factor for PPI failure in some and
      the presence of non-acid related stimuli in others [3].

      This study will clarify for the first time the role of pain modulation in patients who failed
      standard dose of PPI. The clinical experience with doubling the PPI dose, which is the
      current standard of care, has been very limited and relatively disappointing. Additionally,
      this study may identify the group of PPI failure patients that may benefit from doubling the
      dose of PPI and the group that will benefit more from adding a pain modulator. This study is
      timely, has never been performed and addresses a prevalent emerging clinical dilemma in GI as
      well as primary care clinics.
