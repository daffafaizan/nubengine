    
      To determine the efficacy of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel in combination with PVHA and
      pembrolizumab as measured by progression free survival (PFS).

      Hypothesis: The combination of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, PVHA and pembrolizumab will
      improve PFS compared to the historical control for chemotherapy.

      3.2 Secondary Objectives & Hypotheses

        1. Objective: To estimate median overall survival (OS)

        2. Objective: To determine the overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria
           in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1).

        3. Objective: To determine the toxicity and tolerability of gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel
           with PVHA and pembrolizumab.

      Hypothesis: The combination of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel, PVHA, and pembrolizumab will be
      safe and improve OS and ORR compared to the historical control for chemotherapy.

      3.3 Exploratory Objective

        1. Objective: To evaluate pre-treatment and on-treatment PD-L1 and hyaluronan (HA) status
           and correlate with PFS, ORR, and OS.

        2. Objective: To measure the stromal alterations and stromal degradation of hyaluronan and
           correlate with clinical benefit.

        3. Objective: To quantify the pre-treatment and on-treatment change in immune effector
           cells and correlate with clinical benefit.

        4. Objective: To cryopreserve additional tumor tissue for future analysis, including but
           not limited to DNA and RNA sequencing.

        5. Objective: To create organoid cultures from core biopsy specimens for future studies.
