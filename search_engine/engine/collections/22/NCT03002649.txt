      (causing weakness) and skin (causing a rash) in most affected patients. DM can also involve
      multiple body systems including the lungs, joints, gut and heart. Therapy for DM involves
      administering corticosteroids, typically with an immunosuppressive agent, but treatment
      options for refractory DM are very limited. This research is being done to determine the
      safety and effectiveness of a Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor called Tofacitinib in adults with
      active, treatment-refractory dermatomyositis. The investigators will also look for specific
      biomolecular changes in blood, skin, and muscle when it is exposed to Tofacitinib.
      Tofacitinib is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of
      rheumatoid arthritis. The study aim is to conduct a 12-week, open-label, pilot study with up
      to 10 patients who have refractory DM to assess whether a JAK inhibitor effectively and
      safely reduces the symptoms of DM in both the skin and muscle. This study consists of up to 9
      study visits over 6 months. There is an optional treatment extension period of 4 weeks. All
      subjects will undergo follow-up assessments 4 weeks after stopping treatment. Results from
      this study will contribute to the design of future trials that will further define the role
      of JAK inhibitors in the treatment of patients with dermatomyositis.
