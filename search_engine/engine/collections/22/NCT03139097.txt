    
      The Quantra System is a fully integrated and automated in vitro diagnostic device which uses
      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The Quantra Surgical Cartridge was
      developed to monitor hemostasis during major surgical procedures in adult patients. The
      cartridge consists of four independent channels each containing different sets of reagents,
      which provide four measurements performed in parallel yielding six parameters that depict the
      functional status of a patient's coagulation system. In this multi-center, prospective,
      observational study, blood samples will be obtained from healthy adult volunteers to
      establish a normal reference range for the test parameters measured by the Quantra System.
