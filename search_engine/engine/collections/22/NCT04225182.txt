      convincing results. The aim of this study is to determine the improvement of the
      effectiveness of a home-based rehabilitation with and without instrumented knee brace for
      moderated gonarthrosis patients.

      The study will focus during one years on 80 moderated gonarthrosis patients with a Kellgren
      and Lawrence (K&L) score between 2 and 3, aged between 50 and 80. Each patient will practice
      an 8 weeks progressive home exercise program with 3 session per weeks. The effectiveness of
      this protocol will be quantified with a gait analysis with kinematics, kinetics and
      electromyography, before and after the progressive home exercise protocol. The statistical
      analysis will focus on ANOVA and correlation between control group and instrumented knee
      brace group.
