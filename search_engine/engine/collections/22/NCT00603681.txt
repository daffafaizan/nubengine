      treatments are proposed as primary management of constipation, but institutionalised patients
      are not likely to be able to increase either the intake of dietary fibre or fluid and their
      physical activity is low.

      The latest agent widely used for the treatment of constipation is polyethylene glycol (PEG).
      PEG is classified into the group of osmotic laxatives. It is minimally absorbed from the
      gastrointestinal tract and not metabolised by colonic bacteria.

      Most of the PEG products at the market contain electrolytes and have a salty and unpleasant
      taste which may affect the compliance of using them. A PEG solution without electrolytes has
      been developed and used for some years in various countries. Now we will compare the efficacy
      and safety of PEG solutions with or without electrolytes and their acceptability in the use
      for constipation in institutionalised patients.
