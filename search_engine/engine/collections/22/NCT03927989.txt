      mortality from the U.S.'s most deadly cancer. Annual lung cancer screening with low-dose
      computed tomography is now recommended for high risk individuals based on age and smoking
      history. This study will evaluate a smoking cessation intervention for lung cancer screening
      patients. We will evaluate quit rates after a standard intervention (brief counseling session
      at time of lung cancer screening) versus a dual nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) and
      gain-framed text messaging intervention.
