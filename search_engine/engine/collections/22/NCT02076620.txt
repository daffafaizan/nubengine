    
      In the clinical trial 3-6 patients will be assigned to L19TNFalfa at one of the following
      sequential dose levels (10.4 µg/kg, 13 µg/kg and 17 µg/kg) in combination with a fixed dose
      of doxorubicin.

      The RD will be defined following a traditional 3+3 design. The dose escalation will continue
      until the MTD is found, that is until at least two patients among a cohort of three to six
      patients experience a dose limiting toxicity (DLT).
