    
      At each participating research site, select nurse clinicians who are experienced or experts
      in short peripheral I.V. catheter (SPIVC) therapy, will audit medical records and observe the
      SPIVC sites of adult patients in various hospital wards until a minimum total of 300 SPIVC
      sites are audited among 3 Brazilian acute care hospitals. The wards audited will be selected
      by the Investigator and will be audited during a specified time period until at least 100
      SPIVCs are audited. The time to complete the study will depend on the size of the select
      wards, the number of nurse auditors and the number of monitoring visits required.

      There are no treatments. The short peripheral I.V. catheter-related medical devices
      (products) observed during the study are currently approved by Brazil regulatory agencies,
      purchased by the hospital and available to the clinician at the time of the study.
