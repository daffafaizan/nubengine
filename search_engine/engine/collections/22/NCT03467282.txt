      Gastroenterology Service of the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre (Hospital of Clinics of
      Porto Alegre-HCPA) -Brazil with diagnosis of NAFLD confirmed by biopsy and transient
      elastography. Patients who are cirrhotic, pregnant, co-infected or who have Chronic Kidney
      Disease will not be included. All patients, after signing the Written Informed Consent Form,
      will undergo a complete anamnesis to investigate alcohol consumption (AUDIT, Alcohol Use
      Disorders Identification Test), smoking, previous history, medications in use, food
      consumption assessment (through a 3-day food record), physical activity level and physical
      and functional capacity (International Physical Activity Questionnaire, sit-to-stand test,
      unipodal, walk test and dynamometry), body composition (Electrical bioimpedance, dual energy
      x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), anthropometric measurements), cardiovascular risk (Framingham
      Score and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease - ASCVD), biochemical parameters for
      assessment of inflammatory status [C-reactive protein (CRP), toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)],
      lipid profile (total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides), hepatic function [cytokeratin-18
      (CK18), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),
      gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase], as well as blood glucose
      level , insulin, albumin, creatinine and complete blood count and even assessment of gut
      microbiota (patients will be provided with a kit for collecting feces and from the extraction
      of DNA from stool samples, after which a metagenomic analysis will be performed). These
      procedures will be performed at baseline and repeated after 24 weeks (at the end of the
      study). Through the of process of randomization (randomization.com), the patients will be
      allocated to receive treatment A or B. As for patients and researchers involved both are
      blinded (double-blind study). The intervention consists of treatment with probiotic mix
      (Lactobacillus acidophilus 1x109 colony-forming unit (CFU) + Bifidobacterium lactis 1x109 CFU
      + Lactobacillus rhamnosus 1x109 CFU + Lactobacillus paracasei 1x109 CFU) and the placebo
      identical in characteristics and packaging (polydextrose/maltodextrin). Patients will be
      instructed to consume 2 sachets/day during 24 weeks. Patients will be instructed to report
      any symptoms or para effects related to the use of sachets and adherence control will be
      carried out through the patient's notes on a form provided and also by checking the number of
      sachets.
