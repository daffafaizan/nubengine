      receptor positive advanced breast cancer. It has been proven that the addition of fulvestrant
      250mg can enhance PFS of anastrozole monotherapy according to SWOG0226 study. However, the
      optimal recommended dose of fulvestrant for patients with advanced breast cancer is 500mg
      worldwide according to CONFIRM study. The investigator designed this research to investigate
      whether high dose fulvestrant can further improve efficacy of anastrozole monotherapy.
