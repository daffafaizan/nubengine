    
      Objective: This project, Clinical and Molecular Studies in Families With Corneal Dystrophy or
      Other Inherited Corneal Diseases will study the inheritance of corneal dystrophy and other
      inherited corneal diseases, both Mendelian and complex in order to identify the genes that,
      when mutated, cause corneal disease and the pathophysiology through which they act.

      Study Population: Families of many nationalities and ethnic backgrounds. We will study a
      maximum or 2,000 patients and family members.

      Design: The study consists of ascertaining individuals, and especially families with multiple
      individuals, affected by corneal dystrophy and other inherited corneal diseases. These
      patients and their families will undergo detailed ophthalmological examinations to
      characterize their corneal disease and determine their affectation status. A blood sample
      will be collected from each individual for isolation of DNA and in some individuals for
      lymphoblastoid transformation to establish a renewable source of DNA. Linkage analysis,
      physical mapping, and mutational screening will be carried out to identify the specific the
      gene and the mutations in it that are associated with corneal disease in this family. If
      necessary, the gene product will be characterized biochemically. All associate investigators
      will carry out patient ascertainment, diagnosis, and sample referral, and in some cases
      molecular genetic analyses. The study will enroll subjects at NEI and collaborating
      institutions.

      Outcome Measures: Linkage will be determined using the lod score method and mutations in
      specific genes will be assessed using a combination of residue conservation, blosum score,
      and molecular modeling. Biochemical, metabolic, and physiological effects will be
      individualized to the specific assay.
