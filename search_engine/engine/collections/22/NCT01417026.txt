      ASD by using intervention software in the form of appropriately designed computer games. The
      effects of this type of social intervention may be amplified with the concurrent use of
      oxytocin. Furthermore, these learning effects may impact social skills in general and
      translate to the level of the individual's everyday social behavior. Thus, the objective of
      this study is to determine the safety and therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin in
      children and adolescents with ASD when paired with a computer game intervention that is
      designed to enhance face perception skills.
