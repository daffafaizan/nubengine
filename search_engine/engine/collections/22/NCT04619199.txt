    
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis is the most common idiopathic interstitial lung disease whose
      cause is unknown. However, it remains a rare disease, there is an incidence of approximately
      4400 new patients per year in France. It is a serious disease with few therapeutic options
      and a median survival after diagnosis around 36 months. It is also responsible for high
      morbidity, with a marked deterioration in quality of life (dyspnea, cough, fatigue and
      anxiodepressive disorders) and significant functional impairment (respiratory failure) With
      age and gender, socio-economic factors are the most influential indicators of health. At
      present there is very little data on socio-economic factors in the IPF. The investigators
      hypothesize that a lower socio-economic level and / or exposure to various air pollutants may
      influence the IPF's natural history, including the severity of diagnosis and prognosis of the
      IPF. The investigators also hypothesize that the deleterious effect of air pollutants is
      modulated by individual susceptibility (shorter telomeres) and that this effect is related to
      oxidative stress and shortening of telomeres.
