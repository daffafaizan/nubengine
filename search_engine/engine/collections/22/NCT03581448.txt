      robotic arm and hand to perform simple motor tasks (e.g. fragile object transportation),
      while a virtual peripheral nerve regeneration protocol provides users with
      biologically-realistic, idiosyncratic parameters for the restoration of haptic sensation (in
      double-blind fashion, the cellular neurophysiologists characterizing neural regeneration with
      microscopy are unaware of subjects' name and condition; and the human-subject experimenters
      are unaware of the haptic feedback parameter that will be used in the experiment each day,
      which is entered by the neurophysiologist in a black-box section of the software in the case
      of microscopic evaluation of nerve regeneration (early part of the project), or which is
      automatically input by the system in the case of real time impedimetric measurements (later
      part of the project)).

      The main experimental factors are 'haptic feedback', with three modalities: full, partial
      (nerve-regeneration dependent) and null; and to challenge human control strategy and impose
      demand on haptic information, the 'transported object weight' (heavy, medium and
      lightweight).

      Recording techniques: Subjects' electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG) and
      behavioral performance.
