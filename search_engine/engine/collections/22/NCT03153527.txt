      either prednisone in decreasing doses over 4 weeks or placebo.

      Patients, treating physicians, and study personnel will be blinded to treatment allocation to
      either prednisone or matching placebo. At inclusion, we will perform a 250 micrograms
      SynacthenÂ® stimulation test. The results of the test will be blinded to treating physicians
      and investigators, and its value to predict clinical outcome will only be assessed after
      completion of the trial. As a safety measure, all patients will be instructed about stress
      coverage as well as signs and symptoms of hypocortisolism and will be provided with emergency
      medication. Patients will be randomized to the standard (tapering) or the experimental
      (matching placebo) arm. Follow-up will be for six months. In order to improve adherence to
      the study and ensure feasibility, follow-up visits in most study centers will be by telephone
      only. Visits will be performed early after stopping glucocorticoids in both arms (i.e. at
      days 7 and 35) to ensure safety; the other two visits will be on days 90 and 180.
