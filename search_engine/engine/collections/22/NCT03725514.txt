      practice. When the pulp is diseased or requires removal for restorative reasons, it is
      replaced with an artificial filling material during conventional root canal treatment. Root
      canal treatment has lots of drawbacks, starting with different iatrogenic errors during
      endodontic procedures, weakening of remaining tooth structure which might affect the tooth
      survival. Also Root canal treated teeth require the placement of a post and core, which
      itself is doubtful whether it increases fracture resistance of the tooth or it weakens it.
      The most important drawback is that the survival of affected pulp is hindered by the
      conventional root canal treatment. Thus a new treatment approach was introduced utilizing the
      body ability to regenerate, called Pulp Regeneration. Regeneration was first introduced in
      the dental field as a solution for immature apex treatment, due to difficulties encountered
      during its conventional root canal treatment. Here the Pulp regeneration shall be used on
      vital mature teeth to increase the survival rate of the affected teeth.
