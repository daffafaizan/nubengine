      to systematically address a major question in nutrition: Does food processing, specifically
      with regard to whole grains (WGs), have an independent effect on outcomes related to diabetes
      and cardiovascular disease? Whole grains are defined as intact, ground, cracked, or flaked
      caryopsis (kernel or seed), where the principal components (bran, endosperm, germ) are
      present in the same proportion as the intact caryopsis. In contrast, refined grains (RGs) are
      milled to remove the bran and germ, leaving only the endosperm and resulting in lower fiber,
      iron, and many B vitamins. Several previous studies have shown that consumption of WGs vs.
      RGs improves insulin sensitivity and decreases risk for chronic disease. However, the effects
      of consuming WGs may differ depending on degree of processing. While whole grain products
      contain the three components of the kernel, we hypothesize that consuming the food containing
      the least processed (and least pulverized) kernels may have beneficial effects on metabolism
      that decrease disease risk through plausible physiological mechanisms.

      The investigators propose a partial feeding study using a randomized 3-period crossover
      design to compare the effects of 1) intact or minimally processed whole grains, 2) highly
      processed whole grains, and 3) refined grains, each fed for 4 weeks. The primary outcome will
      be change in peripheral insulin sensitivity. Secondary outcomes include hepatic insulin
      sensitivity, components of the metabolic syndrome and other cardiometabolic risk factors,
      arterial stiffness, gut microbiome and fecal short chain fatty acids, and ratings of hunger,
      satiation, palatability, and acceptability (gastrointestinal symptoms).
