      patients) in parallel groups. Patients will be screened and evaluated on Visits 1 to assess
      their eligibility prior to randomization. The treatment period (Visit 1-6) will last 12
      months and the patient will receive initial and follow-up evaluation (section 4.5) including
      history and physical examinations, and baseline and end of treatment ABI and carotid IMT
      assessments. Vascular events and death as well as adverse events including bleeding
      complications will also be recorded at intervals as detailed in section 4.5.
