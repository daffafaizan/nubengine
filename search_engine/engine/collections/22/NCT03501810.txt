    
      This is a Prospective, single-arm, multi-center, observational, post-market clinical
      follow-up study The OrtoWell® Distractor System (CE marked) is a device intended for
      separating and holding apart vertebral bodies in the spinal column, to facilitate removal of
      damaged discs, and implantation of disc prostheses or spinal cage prostheses, as well as for
      repositioning the vertebral bodies following implantation of disc or cage prostheses The
      OrtoWell® Distractor System will be used in patients undergoing anterior or lateral spinal
      surgery, where separation of vertebrae is required, including corpectomy, insertion of disc
      prosthesis, insertion of an anterior lumbar interbody fusion (ALIF) cage, and tumor surgery
      The study will enroll up to 32 patients in Germany that require one of the above listed
      intervention except the patients with a known osteoporosis Study subjects are expected to
      participate for approximately 30 days following the surgery. Participation will involve a
      screening period, surgery and scheduled follow-up assessment at 30 days post implant
