    
      20 volunteer test subjects will be entered into an accuracy study that is designed to
      validate accuracy of the respiratory rate of the Polso Monitoring system.

      A range of stable respiratory rates will be elicited from each volunteer test subject. The
      rates will be approximately 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 and 45 breaths per minute; with
      some natural variation from these exact numbers.

      Each subject will be instrumented with an open system mask that allows for measurement of the
      end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) respiratory rate and tidal volume. The EtCO2 monitor will be
      used as the Accuracy Reference Device (Reference) in this study.
