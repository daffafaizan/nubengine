    
      Variables in study:

        -  Age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and waist abdominal circumference

        -  Noncontrast computed tomography scan (NCCT): stone density (average of 3 measurements),
           stone size, stone area, skin to stone distance (average of 3 measurements: zero, 45o and
           90o), and collecting system anatomy: infundibular length, width, and height, and
           infundibulopelvic angle

      Study design:

      All patients will be submitted to a noncontrast computed tomography scan before to SWL. A
      radiologist with expertise in urolithiasis will evaluate all exams.

      Patients will be submitted to SWL under the following conditions: outpatient, general
      anesthesia, 3000 impulses, rate of 90/min, discharged from hospital in the same day with
      alpha-blocker (doxazosin) during 30 days.

      Patients will be followed up as follow:

        -  One week after SWL: medical visit To evaluate complications such as pain, dysuria,
           hematuria, steinstrasse, visit to the emergency department.

        -  12 weeks after SWL: new NCCT scan To evaluate kidney stones fragmentation and clearance.

      Univariate (Student's T test) and multivariate analysis (multiple logistic regression) will
      be done to assess the impact of patient's corporal habitus (BMI and abdominal waist
      circumference), stone characteristics (size, area, density and SSD), and renal collecting
      system anatomy (infundibular length, width and height, and infundibulopelvic angle) on SWL
      outcomes (fragmentation and stone-free rates).
