      estimated recurrence rate is 23-50% after the first episode and increases to 60% after the
      second pneumothorax (3). Optimal management of this benign disease, especially after repeat
      attack, has been a matter of debate. Recent advances in video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery
      (VATS) that combine bullectomy with pleural abrasion provide a preferred intervention for
      treating primary spontaneous pneumothorax (4-6). Unfortunately, recurrence rates of
      pneumothorax after VATS range between 5% and 10%, which are higher than the rates reported
      after open thoracotomy (7-11). It is suggested that a higher chance of missed leaking blebs
      around the staple line of endoscopic staplers (12) and a less intense pleural inflammatory
      reaction are induced by VATS procedure than by thoracotomy (13, 14). In addition,
      postoperative air leakage usually occurs at the staple line. (7, 15) As a result, the
      efficacy of VATS is questioned and more aggressive procedures, such as limited thoracotomy
      with pleurectomy, are sometimes performed to enhance the effects of pleural symphysis (10,
      14).

      Theoretically, reinforcement of the visceral pleura around the staple line is a reasonable
      way to prevent postoperative air leak and recurrent pneumothorax. Previous retrospective
      studies showed that staple line coverage with absorbable mesh after thoracoscopic bullectomy
      is safe and may be effective in decreasing the rates of pneumothorax recurrence (16,17). One
      animal study also showed that when absorbable mesh insertion is coupled with pleural
      abrasion, appropriate pleurodesis is predictably achieved (18).

      In the present study, additional absorbable mesh coverage of the staple line will be randomly
      administered in patients with primary spontaneous pneumothorax after VATS to test the
      efficacy and safety of this method.
