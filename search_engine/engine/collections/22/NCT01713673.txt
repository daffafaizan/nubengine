    
      This study is a prospective, single-center, randomized, sham-controlled, blinded pilot
      clinical trial. Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups in a 2:1
      randomization scheme, two (2) subjects assigned to receive Ultherapyâ„¢ treatment to every one
      subject assigned to receive Sham treatment.

      Gravimetric measurement of sweat production and starch iodine tests will be performed, and
      Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Scale (HDSS) scores will be obtained, prior to treatment and
      at each follow-up visit. Patient satisfaction will also be assessed. Sham treated subjects
      will have the option of continuing to Stage II and receive active treatment after completion
      of their Stage I 90 day study visit.

      In a protocol amendment, the initial Stage I study cohort, excluding Sham treated subjects
      who opt to continue to Stage II, will be recruited to complete one long-term follow-up visit
      at 365 days following subjects' second study treatment. The same follow-up assessments will
      be completed to compare the amount of axillary sweating compared to baseline.
