      trained in an individualised program of home care in order to recover their own autonomies.
      Home care compares 2 arms: usual care vs physiotherapist (PT)-assisted care. Usual care
      consists in supporting drug and oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilation, GP's assistance,
      periodical in-hospital visit. The PT-assisted home care is supported by PT at least 2
      times/month, autonomous 50 min physical activity/working day by the help of a DVD. The
      physical activity consists in cyclette, calisthenic exercises, and training of the
      respiratory muscles. Few brief educational lessons by PT preceded the training activity.
      Every two weeks, PT calls the patient by phone for an educational reinforcement.
