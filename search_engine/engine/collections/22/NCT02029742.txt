      painful sickle crises, organ damage, reduced quality of life and high health care use.
      Hydroxyurea (HU) is an oral medication that reduces disease symptoms and improves quality of
      life by increasing the amount of fetal hemoglobin in the blood. Despite the clinical promise
      of hydroxyurea, many children with SCD do make taking hydroxyurea a daily health habit.
      General barriers to medication adherence in underserved populations include lack of trust of
      medical staff, incomplete knowledge regarding benefits of hydroxyurea, and other factors that
      impede access to care such as transportation difficulties. Challenges specific to hydroxyurea
      use include understanding the importance of maximizing fetal hemoglobin levels and addressing
      concerns about hydroxyurea. Children and adolescents also require that a developmentally
      appropriate transition of self-management be established with their parents. Community-based
      health workers are a well established means to provide support for chronic disease management
      for underserved families and address multi-faceted barriers through culturally, behaviorally
      and developmentally aligned intervention. The investigators hypothesize that Community Health
      Workers support, augmented by daily task-focused communication technology, can improve
      self-managed adherence to hydroxyurea.
