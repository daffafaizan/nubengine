        -  To compare progression-free survival, overall survival, radiological response, and
           safety and tolerability of cediranib maleate in combination with gefitinib versus
           cediranib maleate in combination with a placebo in patients with recurrent or
           progressive glioblastoma following standard front-line treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cediranib maleate and gefitinib or cediranib maleate and a placebo once
      daily on days 1-42. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood and tissue samples are collected from some patients for genetic profiling and biomarker
      analysis.
