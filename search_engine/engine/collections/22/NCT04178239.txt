      Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is used to define patients with and without CF. All patients are then
      characterized using several fatigue, depression, QoL and executive functioning
      questionnaires. Cognitive functioning and underlying neural correlates are assessed using an
      n-back task measuring working memory and (sustained) attention during functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI). Sarcoidosis disease activity is determined using lung function,
      laboratory parameters, and exercise capacity.
