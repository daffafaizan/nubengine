      Therefore, the investigators conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to
      investigate the effects of Nelutri™on muscle strength, muscle mass, and muscle function in
      healthy adults; the safety of the compound are also evaluate. The Investigators examine the
      peak torque/body weight at 60°/s knee extension, handgrip strength, skeletal muscle mass,
      physical performance, and metabolic parameters at baseline, as well as after 6 and 12 weeks
      of intervention. Eighty adults were administered either 2,000 mg of Nelutri™ or a placebo
      each day for 12 weeks;
