      that dispenses drug solution into the intrathecal space through an implanted infusion
      catheter. All functions of the system (e.g., dosing) are controlled externally using a
      hand-held, battery-operated programmer. Lioresal Intrathecal (baclofen) is indicated for use
      in the management of severe spasticity. Spasticity is a major problem that has long
      challenged traditional medical treatment. While the incidence of spasticity is not known with
      certainty, it likely affects over half a million people in the United States and over 12
      million worldwide. Spasticity is associated with some very common neurological disorders such
      as: multiple sclerosis, stroke, cerebral palsy, spinal cord and brain injuries. Chronic
      spasticity seriously restricts normal daily activities and reduces the quality of life for
      many patients.
