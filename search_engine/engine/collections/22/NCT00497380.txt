      subjects undergoing breast surgery because of malignancy vs. prophylactic reasons (aim 1).
      Furthermore, the effects of one-week pre-operative protein feeding with or without enrichment
      with arginine on post-operative protein metabolism (aim 2) will be investigated in the cancer
      group. Variables of interest are: 1. Whole-body and skeletal muscle protein metabolism, whole
      body arginine turnover and de-novo arginine production rate, and the anabolic capacity to
      feeding(assessed by stable isotope methodology). 2. Body weight, muscle mass and functional
      status, score for well-being (assessed by Profile of Mood State and Mini Mental State).

      In the present study, we propose that a nutritional supplement that is high in protein
      content and enhanced in arginine will be more effective than a typical commercial nutritional
      supplement in diminishing the catabolic effects of surgery in subjects with cancer, thereby
      optimizing their quality of life. If this is found to be the case, this would provide the
      basis for reformulating the nutritional composition in accord with the effects of cancer and
      surgery on protein metabolism.
