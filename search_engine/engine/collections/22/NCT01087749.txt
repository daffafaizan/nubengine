      and tissues are important for a drug to be absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated
      (ADME)18. The chemical properties of drugs can affect whether it needs a transporter protein
      to enter the cell or not. It is not well known how these proteins are affected in chronic
      disease and how different drugs may be absorbed, metabolized, or eliminated differently in
      certain diseases. Preliminary studies suggest that some drugs (those requiring drug
      transporter proteins) may show altered elimination in the presence of uremic toxins. Uremic
      toxins are substances accumulated in the blood of patients with chronic kidney disease and
      many are not removed through hemodialysis (HD). We hypothesize that the different classes of
      drugs (BDDCS class1, 2, and 3) will have different degrees of changes in AUC, meaning that
      for a class 1 drug we would see less of a change in AUC than in a class 3 drug because a
      class 3 drug requires transporters. Previous studies can't make that comparison because they
      used different patients for each drug, so even if there were a change in a class 1 drug, it
      can't be compared to a class 3 drug. In order to get an accurate comparison, we will test the
      three drugs on the same patient and see how he AUC changes from drug to drug within the same
      patient comparing it to the healthy volunteer (taking the same three drugs).
