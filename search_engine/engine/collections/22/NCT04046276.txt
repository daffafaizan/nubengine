      Disease (PD), chronic physical exercise has produced nigrostriatal neuroprotection and
      symptom improvement, provided training was of high-intensity and prolonged duration (>3
      months in rodent models). Conventional physical therapy in Parkinson's disease (PD) has
      traditionally avoided fatigue and high intensity workouts. Yet, in PD controlled studies have
      shown that: (i) an acute aerobic stress produces endogenous dopamine immediately after the
      exercise and (ii) short term (a few weeks) high intensity aerobic training enhances D2
      striatal receptor density and cortical excitability and clinically improves walking, upper
      limb and executive functions; (iii) long-term (six months) high intensity aerobic treadmill
      training is associated with less deterioration of subjective UPDRS III score compared to a
      waiting list. Long-term high intensity aerobic training has not been compared to low or
      medium intensity training in PD patients for its objective motor, cognitive and putative
      neuroprotective effects.

      Hypothesis/Objective

      Hypothesis High-intensity aerobic exercises practiced over 9 months will produce greater
      symptomatic motor and cognitive benefits and neuroprotective effects in PD patients, than low
      or medium intensity training.

      Primary Objective To compare the motor effects of a 9-month conventional physical therapy
      program (light aerobic exercises), an aerobic program of medium intensity on stationary
      bicycle (50% maximal oxygen uptake, VO2 max), and an aerobic program of high intensity (70%
      VO2 max) in Parkinson's disease.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To evaluate aerobic capacities before and after the program.

        -  To evaluate cognitive functions, depression, quality of life before and after each
           program as well as 3 months following program termination and motor function 3 months
           following program termination.

        -  To explore potential neuroprotective effects of a 9-month aerobic program through
           specialized brain imaging (123I-Ioflupane SPECT) and a potential aerobic
           intensity-effect of such neuroprotection.

      Method Design

      Single-blind randomized study, 3 parallel groups (n= 7 or 8 per group and per center, over 3
      centers):

        -  Group 1 " High Intensity Aerobic exercise ", HIA (70% VO2 max);

        -  Group 2 " Medium Intensity Aerobic exercise ", MIA (50% VO2 max);

        -  Group 3 " Conventional Physical Therapy ", CPT HIA and MIA groups are experimental
           groups and CPT group is the control group. Each group will attend 3 weekly 45-minute
           sessions at the hospital for 9 months.

      Number of subjects needed: 69 Inclusion criteria Patients with diagnosis of PD according to
      the UKPDSBB criteria to distinguish idiopathic PD from atypical parkinsonism such as
      multi-system atrophy, progressive supra-nuclear paralysis or vascular parkinsonism; Previous
      MRI available, to further help distinguish idiopathic PD from atypical parkinsonism; Hoehn &
      Yahr Stage 1-3 in OFF state; Age > 18; Signed informed consent to participate in study.

      Non-inclusion criteria Patients lacking motivation or ability to participate in training
      sessions for 9 months, in the investigator's opinion; contra-indications to high-intensity
      aerobic training in the cardiologist's opinion; contra-indications to perchlorate de
      potassium or to the use of 123I-FP-CIT; concurrent severe co-morbidities; cognitive deficit
      limiting participation to the program; Montreal Cognitive Assessment test (MoCA)<23;
      uninsured patient; participation in another ongoing interventional clinical trial (drug
      therapy, surgical treatment, another rehabilitation treatment, medical device); Pregnancy or
      current lactation, or no efficacious contraception during the 9 months of intervention.

      Recruitment period: 1 year; Study duration: 26 months (24 patients recruited in 2 centers and
      21 patients in the other 2 centers) Participation duration for each patient: 14 months Number
      of participating centers: 3
