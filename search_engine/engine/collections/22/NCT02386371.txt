      surgery and radiotherapy remains at 10% at 10 years to 15% at 20 years, respectively. IBTR is
      an independent predictor of poor survival with a 3 to 4.6 increased risk of cancer-related
      death.

      In a heterogeneous population, local control remains a major therapeutic challenge for these
      relapses, especially those considered of better prognosis, namely occurring late and of low
      histological grade. Therapeutic de-escalation is possible for these relapses to avoid a
      mutilating and often traumatic mastectomy.

      However, this second conservative surgery has a high rate of second local relapse (19 to 50%
      at 5 years) due to the absence of a re-irradiation, rendered impossible by the problem of
      tolerance of previously irradiated tissues.

      Retrospective or prospective studies on partial breast irradiation (PBI) in adjuvant setting
      report promising results, both in terms of tolerance (saving healthy tissue) and local
      control (74% to 100% at 5 years). Used techniques include brachytherapy, external beam
      radiotherapy and intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT).

      IORT is now the subject of renewed interest in breast cancer. It has the advantages of
      high-precision ballistics on the operated area and of preservation of healthy tissue. To
      date, no prospective data, however, have been published in the indication of ipsilateral
      breast recurrence.

      A prospective, multicenter, single arm Phase II design will evaluate the feasibility of
      repeated breast-conserving surgery combined with re- irradiation using IORT after local
      recurrence of breast carcinoma.
