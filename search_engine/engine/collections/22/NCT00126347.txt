      However, it remains uncertain whether homocysteine per se, low status of folate, or other
      factors related to methionine metabolism are involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular
      disease. Previous studies have shown that a high concentration of homocysteine in blood is
      related to an impaired vascular function in the arteries, an indicator of cardiovascular
      disease risk. Virtually all intervention trials used folic acid as a homocysteine-lowering
      agent, which may however affect vascular function through mechanisms not related to
      homocysteine. The researchers investigated whether reduction in homocysteine concentrations
      following a methionine load, via supplementation with serine, betaine or folic acid improves
      vascular function in healthy volunteers, in order to distinguish between effects of folic
      acid and of homocysteine-lowering per se.

      Comparison: The effects of supplementation with serine, folic acid and betaine (all together
      with an oral methionine load) were compared to the effects of a placebo (together with a
      methionine load) on plasma homocysteine concentrations and on vascular function following
      methionine loading in healthy volunteers.
