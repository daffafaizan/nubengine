      receive (1) a communication coaching intervention or (2) a waitlist intervention. The
      investigator will survey all providers at Baseline and Follow Up. Providers randomized to the
      intervention arm will attend face-to-face meetings with study coaches, and have some of their
      encounters with patients shadowed by a coach or audio recorded. Providers will obtain verbal
      consent from patients to participate in the study (i.e. have their encounter shadowed or
      audio recorded). Providers will then be provided feedback by coaches on their communication
      during these encounters. Providers randomized to the waitlist intervention arm will be
      offered the option of receiving this intervention after they complete the follow up survey.
