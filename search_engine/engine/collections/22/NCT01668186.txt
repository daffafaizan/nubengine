      Centre in Montreal, Canada, on a yearly basis. This includes a consultation in Genetics,
      Nutrition, Neurology, and Ophthalmology (OCT and FAF exams). All medical records and images
      will be collected, retrospectively and prospectively, until the end of the study, and entered
      anonymously in a database. Biospecimens will be collected to identify new biomarkers.
      Candidate drugs will be evaluated for recovery of peroxisome functions in cultured
      fibroblasts.
