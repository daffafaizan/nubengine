    
      Purpose: The investigators aim to develop and implement NICU-specific Antimicrobial
      Stewardship Program (ASP) strategies at both national and individual unit levels to promote
      optimal antimicrobial use and decrease the incidence of multi-drug resistant organisms (MDRO)
      in Canada.

      Hypothesis: The investigators expect to find:

        -  Significant national variation in broad-spectrum antimicrobial use, which will not be
           correlated with rates of sepsis. High antimicrobial consumption rates may be associated
           with limited existing ASP resources and increased neonatal morbidity related to
           inflammatory cascades.

        -  Significant national variation in the prevalence of MDROs across NICUs.

        -  Differences in empirical antimicrobial regimens may be associated with MDRO prevalence,
           and the variation in antimicrobial use may explain some variation in neonatal morbidity.

      Study Population and Sample Size: The study population will include very-low-birth-weight
      (VLBW) infants (i.e., the group of infants neonates with the highest risk of infections
      within NICUs) admitted to participating tertiary NICUs in Canada.
