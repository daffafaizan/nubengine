    
      Objective:

      Primary Objective: to analyse the development of mucosal immunity against SARS-CoV-2 in nasal
      fluid of Covid-19 patients and their household contacts

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To descriptively analyse the correlation of mucosal antibodies with viral diagnostics
           and disease symptoms

        -  To determine the correlation between mucosal and serum antibody levels

        -  To study the functionality of serum and mucosal antibodies

      Study design: A single-site, observational, prospective cohort study among COVID-19 patients
      and their household contacts Study population: The study will be conducted among COVID-19
      patients with a laboratory-confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2, as well as household contacts
      remaining in home quarantine at the same address, among secondary and tertiary hospital
      careworkers in the provinces of Gelderland and Noord-Brabant in The Netherlands.

      Intervention (if applicable): N/A

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Mucosal antibodies: descriptive analysis of SARS-CoV-2 IgG, IgA, IgM and IgD concentrations
      in nasal fluid at the various collection moments.

      Viral diagnostics: presence of SARS-CoV-2 in diagnostic specimens collected at inclusion
      visit.

      Disease symptoms: presence of respiratory complaints in participants. Serum antibodies:
      descriptive analysis of SARS-CoV-antibody concentrations in serum at day 28 Antibody
      functionality: descriptive analysis of antibody functionality of serum and nasal fluid
      samples, including virus neutralization
