      Primary

      To determine the change from baseline to post-treatment Ki67 values in ER-positive,
      HER2-negative ILC tissue derived from postmenopausal women awaiting definitive surgery or
      further neoadjuvant treatment who are randomized to 21-24 days of neoadjuvant endocrine
      treatments with fulvestrant (two 250 mg IM injections given on day 1), anastrozole (1mg given
      orally daily), or tamoxifen (20mg given orally daily).

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate ER protein expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neoadjuvant
           endocrine therapy.

        -  To evaluate PR protein expression in ILC tissues at baseline and following neo-adjuvant
           endocrine therapy.

        -  To evaluate ER-related and ILC-specific candidate gene mRNA expression in ILC tissues at
           baseline and following neoadjuvant endocrine therapy in an effort to identify biomarkers
           of endocrine response and putative drivers of endocrine resistance in ILC.

        -  To evaluate associations between changes in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neoadjuvant
           endocrine therapy with ER and PR protein expression, or ER and candidate gene mRNA
           expression at baseline and post-treatment.

      Exploratory

        -  To evaluate DNA methylation in ILC tissues at baseline and following neo-adjuvant
           endocrine therapy.

        -  To evaluate associations between germline and somatic DNA sequence variants with changes
           in Ki67 in ILC tissues following neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.

        -  To evaluate the activity of signaling pathways in ILC tissues by immunohistochemical or
           other protein analyses, such as histone modifications, at baseline and following
           neo-adjuvant endocrine therapy.
