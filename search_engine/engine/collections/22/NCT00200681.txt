      patients are randomised between 4 treatment arms: A1 VAD (4 cycles); A2 VAD (4 cycles)
      followed by DCEP (2 cycles); B1 Velcade® + dexamethasone (4 cycles); B2 Velcade® +
      dexamethasone (4 cycles) followed by DCEP (2 cycles) A1, A2, B1, B2 + autograft.
      Randomisation will be stratified on the basis of the initial b2 microglobulin level (> or < 3
      mg/l) and the presence of chromosome 13 abnormalities identified by FISH analysis. VAD:
      Vincristine/Adriamycin/Dexamethasone; DCEP: Dexamethasone/Cyclophosphamide/
      Etoposide/Cisplatin.
