        -  Compare the objective response rate in women with advanced or metastatic breast cancer
           treated with two dose levels of capecitabine.

        -  Compare the duration of response, time to progression, time to treatment failure,
           survival, incidence of adverse events, and time to onset of the adverse experience in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      Karnofsky performance status (70-80% vs 90-100%) and presence of hepatic metastases (yes vs
      no). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive lower-dose oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive higher-dose oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the end of the third and sixth courses, and at
      completion of therapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients (60 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 9 months.
