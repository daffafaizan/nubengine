      chronic diseases and pain conditions.

      The mechanisms underlying pain relief of exercise are largely unknown but may be related to
      the modulation of central descending pain inhibitory pathways after acute exercise bouts.
      Exercise-induced hypoalgesia (EIH) is typically assessed as the temporary change in PPTs
      after a short acute exercise bout and EIH is seen as a proxy of descending pain inhibitory
      control. In general, EIH seems hypoalgesic (functional) in asymptomatic subjects. A
      hyperalgesic (impaired) EIH response has been reported in different chronic pain populations,
      although a functional EIH response also has been reported in subgroups of knee osteoarthritis
      patients. This implies differences in the acute response to exercise between healthy
      (pain-free) subjects and chronic pain patients, but it is still unknown whether the presence
      of pain itself affects the pain alleviating response (i.e. the EIH response) to acute
      exercise.

      It is hypothesized that acute pain will decrease the EIH response magnitude following
      hypertonic saline injection compared with the control injection. This study will increase the
      insight into the EIH mechanisms in healthy subjects in general, and how the presence of pain
      affects the body's own ability to modulate pain during exercise.
