      serious complication which can be prevented by prophylactic peripheral iridectomy (PPI).
      However, it is difficult to perform routine PPI via scleral tunnel incision especially when
      the pupil is dilated. Here, the investigators designed a novel progressive grasping
      peripheral iridectomy (PGPI) surgical method which can ensure the accurate iridectomy
      position and minimize the complication. The aim of this study is to assess the safety and
      efficacy of the PGPI in preventing AACG following congenital cataract surgery.

      This is a retrospective, nonrandomized comparative trial with historical control. The
      congenital cataract patients performed with cataract extraction combined with PPI (PPI group)
      and the patients performed with cataract extraction alone and leaving the iris intact
      (historical control group) were enrolled and a retrospective medical chart review was
      conducted. The IOP, anterior chamber depth, corneal clarity, patency of peripheral iridectomy
      opening, and the rate of AACG, iris posterior synechia (IPS) and visual axis opacity (VAO)
      were compared between two groups.
