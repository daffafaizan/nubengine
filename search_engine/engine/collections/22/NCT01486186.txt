    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study to evaluate the
      effect of Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in COPD subjects. Following a 14 day run-in
      period, approximately 504 subjects will be randomly assigned to double-blind treatment for 52
      weeks. After the 52 weeks treatment period, subjects in both treatment arms will follow-up 52
      weeks. The primary measure of efficacy is the frequency of exacerbations and spirometric
      values (e.g. FEV1). Secondary efficacy measures include Dyspnea (MMRC), Quality of life (
      CAT,SF-36), Exercise Capacity( 6MWD). Safety will be assessed through the collection of
      adverse events. There will be a total of 5 study visits ( randomization, and after 13, 26, 39
      and 52 weeks of treatment). A follow-up contact for collection of effect and adverse event
      will be conducted approximately 52 weeks following the last study visit.
