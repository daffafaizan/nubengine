      after liver transplantation remains unclear so far. Microangiopathy is strongly suspected to
      be involved in the etiology, so sufficient flushing of peribiliary plexus (PBP) which
      directly nourishes the donor biliary tree may be pivotal to prevent NAS with a patent hepatic
      artery.

      Solution of University of Wisconsin (UW solution) is a standard for liver graft flushing, but
      accused of high viscosity and hyperaggregation effect on erythrocytes by ingredient
      hydroxyethyl starch as well as initial vasoconstriction by high potassium content, which
      together constitutes a hindrance to solution penetration and thorough flushing of liver
      microcirculation including PBP. Several studies have revealed the relationship of high
      viscosity of UW solution with the development of NAS.

      The investigators, therefore, have hypothesized that sequential perfusion with low-viscosity
      and high-viscosity preservation solutions might improve the patency of PBP in contrast with
      conventional sole perfusion with high-viscosity UW solution, and as a result, the incidence
      of NAS with a patent hepatic artery after liver transplantation would be significantly
      decreased.
