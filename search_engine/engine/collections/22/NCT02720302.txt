      for the enrollment is 50% in each of the two treatment groups.

      With 60 patients in each group, the study has 80% statistical power at 5% significance level
      to detect an average difference between the treatment groups in the intra-individual change
      in the BMI Z-score that is 0.51 x the standard deviation in the intra-individual change.
      Previous data from the investigators own group suggest that a reasonable estimate of the
      standard deviation in the intra-individual change in the BMI Z-score following intervention
      is 0.42. Thus, the study has 80% statistical power at 5% significance level to detect a
      difference in the intra-individual change in the BMI Z-score that is 0.51 x 0.42 = 0.21 on
      average. The study will with the present funding end its follow up in June 2017.
