      decades as our understanding of the relationship between the alignment of the distal radius
      and the function of the wrist and forearm has improved. Over the last 15 years there has been
      a trend towards more invasive, internal plate fixation of fractures of the distal radius. One
      argument in favor of internal fixation for these fractures is that it would be beneficial to
      allow early movement of the wrist articulation in an attempt to maximize final outcome. There
      is a difference in opinion among physicians on the importance of supervision of exercises in
      the recovery process. Some physicians advocate formal occupational therapy while other
      physicians believe that appropriate instructions for home exercises are just as good. A
      common belief is that the motivation of the patient plays an important part in recovery. In
      addition, Psychological and personality factors, such as pain anxiety, catastrophizing, and
      depression are strongly related to upper extremity specific health status and may also
      influence recovery. The goal of this study is to determine which protocol for exercises leads
      to better outcome in patients treated for distal radius with a volar plate. As a secondary
      goal and to generate hypotheses for later studies we would like to evaluate the influence of
      psychosocial factors on both objective (motion, grip strength) and subjective (DASH
      questionnaire) measures of functional recovery.
