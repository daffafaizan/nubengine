      physiological features of zinc homeostasis. Animal and human studies show that a small,
      vulnerable pool of cellular zinc is sensitive to changes in dietary zinc. The protein,
      Metallothionein (MT), is made within cells to stabilize this transient zinc pool and to
      provide a means to 'park' a small zinc reserve. The overall goal is to develop a new method
      for measuring MT in cells and to assess other cellular responses to changes in small changes
      in dietary zinc. Culture models of zinc deficiency and excess have been developed and used to
      test the response of cellular MT levels and mineralization to changes in zinc availability.
      In Phase II, the changes in the expression of leukocytic zinc transporters and the cellular
      in vitro uptake of isotopic zinc will be measured. Healthy men will be recruited to
      participate in a 6-week feeding trial to be followed by a 3-week recovery period. The results
      of this study will determine if potential new cellular zinc biomarkers respond to changes in
      zinc status when the men are fed an additional 4 mg zinc/d incorporated into a rice-based
      meal. These findings will provide essential, new information for designing an efficacy trial
      of biofortified rice and the zinc status of infants and young children.
