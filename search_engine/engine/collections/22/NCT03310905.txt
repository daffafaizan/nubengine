      either as an isolated abdominal wall or in combination with another organ transplant. Each
      subject will be followed for a study period of 18 months.

      Participants receiving an isolated abdominal wall or abdominal wall in combination with
      another organ transplant will receive the standard immunosuppression therapy as the
      non-vascularized composite allograft organ transplant. These patients will be studied to
      determine efficacy of the abdominal wall transplant to restore function of the defective
      abdominal wall for a study period of 18 months at Duke University Medical Center.
