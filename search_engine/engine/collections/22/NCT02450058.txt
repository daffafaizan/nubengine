      designed in 1996, paclitaxel was known to have efficacy in patients with advanced breast
      cancer, but its role was still to be established in the adjuvant setting. Therefore the
      GONO-MIG5 trial was designed to compare a standard anthracycline-containing chemotherapy
      regimen, i.e. 5fluorouracil, epirubicin, ciclophosphamide (FEC), given for 6 cycles to a new
      regimen containing both epirubicin and paclitaxel (EP), given concurrently, for 4 cycles.
      This latter regimen was chosen on the basis of the results obtained in metastatic breast
      cancer patients, where the combination of doxorubicin and paclitaxel was associated with more
      than 90% of objective response . Only four cycles of the new regimen were planned since the
      expected toxicity, particularly the cardiotoxicity, was high, and a short treatment duration
      was hoped to be the best strategy to obtain a favourable balance between the toxicity and the
      expected high efficacy.
