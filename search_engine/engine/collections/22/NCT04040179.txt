      sonographer to collect ultrasound video data for the following categories:

        -  Adductor canal

        -  Popliteal fossa

        -  Fascia Iliaca

        -  Rectus sheath

        -  Axillary

        -  ESP

        -  PECS

        -  Interscalene

      Each volunteer will be scanned to collect data for every category in the list. Where
      applicable, both sides of the body will be scanned.

      The videos will be segmented by hand to identify the relevant anatomical regions for each
      category.

      The primary objective for this study is to provide the range of data required to develop
      robust models in conjunction with additional data from patients undergoing a Peripheral Nerve
      Block procedure that are able to produce the desired segmentation on the unseen validation
      images. The models will be scored using the standard "Mean intersection over Union"
      pixel-level metric for semantic segmentation.
