      arm. Participants in the first treatment arm will receive a coach-assisted C-CBT intervention
      called "Beating the Blues" (BtB). A second treatment arm will receive a coach-assisted,
      animated C-CBT intervention called "Entertain Me Well" (EMW). Both treatment arms will have 8
      weekly sessions that contain core components of CBT. A coach will provide between-session
      support throughout the 8 sessions. The control arm will use the standard care of BtB without
      coach assistance.
