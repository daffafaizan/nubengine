        -  Hyaluronic acid

        -  Cone-beam computed tomography(CBCT) x-ray The patients with Grade II furcation will be
           divided into two groups. Both groups will have the same number of patients and the same
           procedure such as the scaling root planning. However, the control group will use
           hyaluronic acid and membrane. The placebo group, on the other hand, will use hyaluronic
           acid without membrane and will use CBCT x-ray. The x-rays will be done at the beginning
           of the treatment. Then, two monitoring processes will be done. The first monitor will be
           done after three months. The data will be recorded. Then, after another three months,
           the patients will undergo an x-ray check again and the data will be recorded. The goal
           is to only have the patients exposed to x-ray twice so they would not be compromised to
           the high dose of radiation. The evaluation to be done for the 3-month interval will only
           be clinical assessments.
