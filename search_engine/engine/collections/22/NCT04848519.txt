    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the combination of propranolol hydrochloride and
      pembrolizumab by assessing the overall response rate (ORR) as measured by Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1.).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy of the combination as measured by progression free survival (PFS;
      from treatment initiation until disease progression, death due to disease, or lost to follow
      up) and overall survival (OS; from treatment initiation until death due to any cause or loss
      to follow up), and safety as measured by incidence of adverse events assessed up to 2 years.

      TERTIARY/EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess tissue-based assays in archival tissue and correlative changes in peripheral
      T-cell subsets, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC), blood inflammatory markers and
      cytokines.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive propranolol hydrochloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and
      pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days for
      propranolol hydrochloride and every 3 or 6 weeks for pembrolizumab for up to 2 years in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 12 weeks
      for up to 2 years.
