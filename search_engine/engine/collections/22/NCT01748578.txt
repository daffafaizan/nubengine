      A total of 8 subjects will be dosed in each group with subjects randomized in a ratio of 6:2,
      EBI-005:placebo. Treatment administration in Group 2 will proceed following a review of
      safety data from Group 1. In both groups, subjects randomized to active treatment will
      receive EBI-005 in the right eye and placebo in the left eye. Subjects randomized to placebo
      will receive placebo in each eye.
