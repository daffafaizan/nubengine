      disability (ID), present hyperphagia, overweight or obesity, compared to the general
      population. Prader-Willi Syndrome (PWS) and related syndromes (PWS-like) represent the most
      well-known causes of eating disorders with early and severe obesity. Other known RD with ID
      have been described as being associated with eating disorders with overweight or obesity,
      which appear later in adolescence : Angelman's syndrome (approximately 40% of patients are
      overweight or obese, and 32% of children have hyperphagia), Fragile X syndrome (over 30% are
      obese), Smith-Magenis syndrome (50 to 60% are obese). Prader-Willi syndrome is the only
      genetic obesity identified to date associated with hyperghrelinemia, while ghrelin levels are
      lower than in controls in other situations of obesity.

      The aim of the study is to find out whether the levels of ghrelin, which are abnormally high
      in PWS throughout life, are also high in these pathologies when people have hyperphagia
      and/or overweight.

      The study involves a single visit carried out during a routine follow-up in the CRMR, in
      which the blood sample will allow the dosage of the ghrelin hormon. The visit will also
      involves a data collection and some questionnaires.
