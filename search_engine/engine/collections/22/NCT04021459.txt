      observe the spreading of CTC during surgery in endometrial cancer. CTCs are very rare events
      on blood and their detection require extremely sensitive technologies. This pilot study will
      investigate CTC spread during surgery on 10 patients with endometrial cancer.

      The main objective is to compare venipuncture site for detection of CTCs in endometrial
      cancer during surgery. Blood samples are collected on a simple sampling (arm) compared to
      sampling as close as possible to the tumor (ovarian vein).
