      heart failure (CHF) and myocardial remodeling. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are
      considered markers of fibrosis. Recently, circulating MMPs can be measured and are elevated
      in patients with CHF. However, MMPs it is still unclear whether MMPs are produced in failing
      hearts. Thus, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the production of MMP in failing
      hearts.
