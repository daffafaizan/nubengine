      home-based parent training program with 15 sessions focused on improve family nutrition and
      physical activity and promoting positive parent-child interactions. The aim of this study is
      to pilot-test the development of a childhood obesity program that includes parenting and
      health information. Participants in this study will be recruited through community
      organizations based upon their obesity health risk. Only families whose children's BMI
      percentile is greater than or equal to 75 will be eligible to participate in this study These
      participants will be randomly assigned to either the control group, in which participants
      will receive health information via mail only, or the experimental group that will
      participate in 15 DRIVE sessions focusing on parent-child interactions, health and nutrition,
      and physical activity. Both groups will complete a baseline assessment, mid-point assessment,
      and post assessment in their home, which will measure parent and child height, weight, and
      waist circumference; parent attitudes towards health and nutrition; and parent and child food
      consumption and physical activity levels. Results from this study will provide information
      regarding the feasibility of implementing the DRIVE curriculum as well as its impact on
      parent and child body mass indexes, and parents' knowledge, and attitudes related to
      nutrition.
