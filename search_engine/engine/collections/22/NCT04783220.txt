      to middle income countries (LMIC) and in Arabic countries in particular. The main concept of
      this proposal is to develop a program in Arabic for parents of premature infants with the aim
      to increase their knowledge about short and long term problems of prematurity, increase their
      involvement in the care during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and
      promote responsive and sensitive parenting in the NICU and after discharge. This is to
      empower parents and have them become active contributors to enhancing their infant's
      development through play activities and tracking of developmental milestones.
