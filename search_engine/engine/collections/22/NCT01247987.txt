      fertilization (IVF). In one group, the subjects will have all of their embryos cryopreserved
      at the blastocyst stage, followed by thaw and transfer in a subsequent cycle. In the other
      group, subjects will have all of their embryos cryopreserved at the bipronuclear oocyte
      stage, followed by thaw, extended culture, and transfer in a subsequent cycle.
