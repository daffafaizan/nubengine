      infusion 5-weeks before the baseline measurements (CVID-IVIgG group), are studied. In all
      subjects, endothelial function is evaluated as flow mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial
      artery, measured by ultrasonographic technique at baseline and 1, 7, 14, and 21 days after
      IVIgG infusion. FMD is also measured in a group of IVIgG naive CVID patients (number of
      patients recruited depending on availability) and a group of control healthy subjects. The
      latter FMD measurements serve only as a mere reference of pathological or normal values in
      condition of deficiency or normal levels of circulating IgG and are not used for primary
      outcome evaluation. To dissect further the mechanisms of improved endothelial function after
      IVIgG infusion, we investigate the role of human IgG on the production of Nitric Oxide (NO)
      in vitro on Human Coronary Artery Endothelial Cells (HCAEC) isolated from normal human
      coronary arteries.
