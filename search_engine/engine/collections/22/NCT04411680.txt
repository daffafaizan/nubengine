      approximately 120 patients with COVID-19 associated acute hypoxemia: of which 80 patients
      will receive sargramostim plus standard of care, and 40 patients who will receive standard of
      care alone. The aim of the study is to determine if inhaled sargramostim, as an adjunct to
      institutional standard of care, improves clinical outcomes in patients with
      COVID-19-associated acute hypoxemia. All patients on the sargramostim arm will be treated
      with 125 mcg inhaled sargramostim twice daily for 5 days, in addition to institutional
      standard of care. If required, upon progression to an invasive mechanical ventilator,
      administration of sargramostim may be delivered by intravenous infusion to complete a total
      of 5 days (including days delivered via inhalation).

      GM-CSF is a critical cytokine for healthy pulmonary function and is necessary for the
      maturation and maintenance of alveolar macrophages. Preclinical studies have shown GM-CSF
      confers resistance to influenza by enhancing innate immune mechanisms that depend on alveolar
      macrophages for their health and normal functioning. Clinical studies of sargramostim in
      patients with severe sepsis and respiratory dysfunction or acute respiratory distress
      syndrome have shown improvements in oxygenation and lung compliance.
