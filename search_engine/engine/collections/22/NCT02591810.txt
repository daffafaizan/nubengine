    
      This is a prospective randomized control trial comparing three methods of treatment for acute
      DRUJ instability with or without concomitant distal radius fracture. Upon determination of
      residual DRUJ instability either preoperatively or intraoperatively after distal radius
      fracture fixation, patients will be randomized into one of the three treatment arms of the
      study: nonoperative treatment with immobilization, percutaneous DRUJ fixation with Kirschner
      wires, and open anatomic foveal repair of Triangular fibrocartilage complex TFCC ligaments
      with suture. Those patients undergoing Kirschner wire fixation will have their pins pulled in
      the clinic setting six weeks postoperatively. Outcomes will be assessed at follow up visits
      using the subjective and objective measures and clinical assistants will be blinded as to the
      treatment type. Physician-based assessment of functional outcome with be assessed using the
      Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) score and Mayo Wrist scores, as well as
      independent assessment of DRUJ instability, ROM, and grip strength. Patient-based assessment
      will include visual analog pain scores as well as satisfaction questionnaires.
