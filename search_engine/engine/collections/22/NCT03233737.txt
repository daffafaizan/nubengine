      will be sprayed onto the gingival mucosal tissue. Onset and duration of local anesthesia will
      be evaluated over a one hour period using pin prick and quantitative sensory testing of heat
      (QST-heat) stimulation. Subjects will receive both treatments in a cross-over design with
      each session separated by 4-14 days. A total of 50 subjects (normal volunteers) will be
      evaluated.
