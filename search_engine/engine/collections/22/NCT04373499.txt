      consequences. One in 12 United States children has asthma, resulting in 13.4 million missed
      school days, 1 million emergency department visits, and 140,000 hospitalizations annually.

      A key barrier to self-management of asthma is improper use of respiratory inhalers, which
      limits disease control. Better inhaler technique is associated with improved asthma outcomes
      for children. Assessment and education of inhaler technique are recommended at all healthcare
      encounters, however it is limited in practice because it is resource intensive (both
      personnel and time) and lacks fidelity. Thus, low-resource interventions that accurately
      teach inhaler skills are needed to impact pediatric asthma outcomes.

      Teach-to-Goal (TTG) is a patient-centered strategy that uses tailored rounds of teaching and
      assessments to ensure mastery of inhaler technique. Studies show it is effective but resource
      intensive. A "virtual TTG" (V-TTG) intervention represents an opportunity to deliver inhaler
      technique education with a high-fidelity, low-resource, and feasible strategy. The module
      utilizes innovative learning technology with video demonstrations and assessment questions to
      tailor education to each user; the cycles of assessment and education continues until
      satisfactory mastery is achieved.

      This study evaluates the comparative effectiveness of this high-fidelity, low-resource, and
      feasible model (V-TTG) versus a standardized brief intervention that mimics usual care to
      deliver tailored inhaler technique education to children with severe asthma via a randomized
      clinical trial.
