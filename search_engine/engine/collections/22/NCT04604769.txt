      an adequate quality of care, especially during the anxious context of coronavirus pandemic.
      Taking care of numerous patients, the increasing work and mental charges, facing death, the
      need of material and changes in work organization are all elements that can influence stress
      among medical workers. Considering real causes of stress and what are the needs of the
      medical team is fundamental for developing concrete actions to ease the workloads. A few
      studies were conducted in China on psychological distress of medical staff during COVID-19.
      According to these few studies about psychological distress in ICU, investigators think that
      stress scores during COVID-19 could be increased among nurses during pandemic. The second
      hypothesis is that causes of stress would be not so different from normal care but could be
      amplified by the actual situation. One point to take into consideration is that most of the
      studies were conducted in China and medical policy and hospital organization are different in
      Belgium. The objective of the study is to compare psychological distress and needs of nurses
      in ICU before and during coronavirus pandemic.
