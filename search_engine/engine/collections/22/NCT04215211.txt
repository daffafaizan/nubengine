      development of artificial intelligence, much more potential lies in the preoperative
      conventional/advanced MR imaging (T1 weighted imaging, T2 weighted imaging, FLAIR,
      contrast-enhanced T1 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and perfusion imaging)
      could be excavated to aid prediction of patients' prognosis in the frame of molecular
      pathology of gliomas. The creation of a registry for primary glioma with detailed survival
      data, molecular pathology, radiological data and with sufficient sample size for deep
      learning (>1000) provides opportunities for personalized prediction of survival of glioma
      patients with non-invasiveness and precision.
