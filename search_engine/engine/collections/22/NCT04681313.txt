      (HRPCI), mechanical circulatory support (MCS) devices are increasingly used to maintain
      hemodynamic stability during these procedures. It is crucial to have a better understanding
      of the hemodynamic effects during HRPCI and of MCS devices to guide appropriate device
      selection and utilization for HRPCI.

      Clinical studies evaluating different MCS devices are not all consistent in terms of patient
      selection, outcomes examined and overall findings. Therefore, the role of MCS devices in
      HRPCI is still widely debated. This is reflected in a variable clinical practice pattern and
      recommendations from professional society guidelines. The investigators believe that having a
      clear scientific understanding of MCS devices in terms of hemodynamic effects during
      different stages of these complex procedures may prove helpful in refining the process of
      appropriate MCS device selection in appropriate clinical setting.

      One especially insightful method of examining the MCS devices effect is analyzing the left
      ventricular (LV) pressure-volume loops (PVL). Continuously recording PVL during HRPCI can
      provide valuable data on the device effects on loading conditions and contractility of the
      left ventricle.

      In this study, the investigators will collect hemodynamic data in real-time during HRPCI
      being performed as standard of care and continuously recording left ventricular
      pressure-volume loop (PVL) throughout the procedure via the IncaÂ® Pressure-Volume Loop System
      (CD Leycom, Hengelo, The Netherlands).
