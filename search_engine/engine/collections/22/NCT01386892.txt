      (e.g. plasma, serum, microvesicles, and cells) then analyzed. Flow cytometry will be used to
      determine cell and microvesicle subsets. RNA will be extracted from the various components of
      blood and will be subjected to gene and microRNA profiling to determine gene expression. DNA
      will be isolated from the cells to be used in studies investigating epigenetic regulation of
      genes identified in the screens. Protein will also be isolated from the multiple components
      to examine the impact of genetic regulation by epigenetic mechanisms or microRNA on protein
      expression. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be placed in tissue culture for study.

      Saliva and urine will be obtained the same day as blood for testing.
