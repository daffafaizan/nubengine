      18-40 years of age who will undergo elective caesarean section surgery. People with known
      psychiatric illness and medication use, illiterate, who do not have mental competence to
      understand survey questions and very urgent patients will not be included in the study.

      Preoperative anxiety levels will be determined by the STAI-Continuity scale at the time of
      admission to the anesthesia outpatient clinic and by the STAI-State scale 1 hour before
      surgery.The scales will be scored as normal, mild, moderate and severe anxiety. Psychiatric
      consultation will be requested for patients with severe anxiety. At the end of the cesarean
      section, the concentration of TNF-Î± and IL-6 cytokines in the blood remaining from routine
      blood gas taken from the umbilical cord will be determined to obtain information about the
      state of fetal well-being.
