      edema, a palpable lump and tenderness of the hand.

      Radiological examination include hand-wrist radiographs in the posteroanterior (PA), true
      lateral and 45ยบ oblique views. A true lateral view of the hand may demonstrate the
      dislocation, although overlapping of the joints can mask the dislocation. On PA radiographs,
      Fisher et al. propose using the so-called M-line parallelism of the CMC joints. A break in
      this M-line suggests a dislocation. Another method is to draw metacarpal cascade lines on a
      PA radiographs.

      It is important to recognise the associate lesions, for example hamate fractures, because
      this fracture can change the prognosis, surgical planning and treatment. The investigators
      hypothesized that there is an interobserver variability to evaluate the carpometacarpal
      fracture-dislocation and associated lesions in x-rays are underestimated. The investigators
      propose a protocol with a CT scan to asses this lesions. The researchers hypothesised that
      surgical reconstruction would result in better clinical result and lower complications rate
      than non-surgical treatment.
