      are examining this study microdevice loaded with drugs in patients with cutaneous lesions of
      cutaneous T cell lymphoma (CTCL) or peripheral T cell lymphoma (PTCL) patients.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved the use of all the drugs
      contained in the microdevice as a treatment for cutaneous or peripheral T cell lymphoma. All
      drugs used in this study are FDA approved. Some drugs are for different cancer indications.
      Romidepsin, vorinostat, bexarotene, brentuximab vedotin, pralatrexate, and mogamulizumab have
      been FDA approved for CTCL. The FDA has not approved the use of the microdevice as a tool to
      identify what cancer treatment is best for any disease.

      In this research study, the investigators are investigating whether the microdevice loaded
      with 19 drugs can be safely inserted in and removed from cancerous skin lesion. The
      microdevice was developed as a tool with the ultimate goal to help screen several existing
      and investigational drugs directly within a patient's tumor to identify what drugs are the
      most effective for treating a patient's cancer.

      This microdevice was investigated in laboratory studies and shown to help identify what drugs
      could be effective in treating a specific cancer type. The microdevice was able to release
      drugs only to the immediately surrounding tumor tissue in concentrations of one millionth of
      what is normally needed for a therapeutic dose. The microdevice can be retrieved along with a
      few millimeters of surrounding treated tumor tissue for analysis of tumor response to drug.
