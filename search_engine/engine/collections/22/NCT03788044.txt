      to the main trial in which eligible AF patients (= in possession of a smartphone and capable
      working with their smartphone) will test this new educational application. Not eligible
      patients randomized to this group, will receive standard care.

      This extra study arm will additionally include an anticipated 221 patients (eligible plus not
      eligible patients).

      [An anticipated total of 1259 AF patients will be included for the AF-EduCare study (1038 AF
      patients) plus the AF-EduApp substudy (221 AF patients).]
