    
      Subjects with documented uterine fibroids, screening UFS-QOL severity score of at least 40,
      and meeting other eligibility criteria will be enrolled in the study. Following screening and
      a pre-treatment endometrial biopsy, subjects will be assessed monthly for the four (4) month
      double-blinded treatment phase. The study duration is approximately six months, comprised of
      a one-month screening period, 4 month treatment period and one month follow-up period.
      Subjects' blood will be drawn in a fasting state to obtain the pre-dose trough (PK) levels of
      study drug at each study drug dosing/dispensation visit to determine the potential for drug
      accumulation.
