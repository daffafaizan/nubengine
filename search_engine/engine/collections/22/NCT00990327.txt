      However, it produces transient symptoms that are poorly tolerated by most subjects. PGxHealth
      has designed a multi-center, randomized crossover, double-blind study to compare the safety
      and effectiveness of apadenoson to adenosine (AdenoscanÂ®) in SPECT-MPI. Subjects who are
      clinical candidates for SPECT-MPI will be enrolled to undergo two sequential SPECT-MPI
      studies. The first study will use adenosine as the stress agent in approximately 1300
      subjects. Eligible subjects will then be randomized in a 1:2 assignment ratio to receive a
      second SPECT-MPI using either adenosine or apadenoson as the pharmacologic stress agent, with
      the goal of obtaining a total of 753 subjects who complete both studies. The similarity of
      the results from the two adenosine:adenosine stress tests will be compared to those from the
      adenosine:apadenoson tests to assess efficacy. The incidence and intensity of commonly
      reported side effects will be compared to evaluate improved tolerability.
