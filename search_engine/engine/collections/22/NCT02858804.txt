      and vincristine) ±R /DHAP(cisplatin, cytarabine and dexamethasone) ±R alternating
      chemotherapy. If a partial remission or better response achieves, patients will be
      recommended to receive autologous stem cell transplantation as consideration therapy or
      another two cycles EDOCH ±R /DHAP±R chemotherapy (based on patient's choice). Patients with
      less than partial remission (PR) response will quit this study. After treatments finished,
      maintenance therapy with rituximab or thalidomide plus prednisone will be given less than two
      years. The determination of maintenance regimens is dependent on patients choices.
