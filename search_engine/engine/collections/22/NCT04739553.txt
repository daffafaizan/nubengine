      written consent will be included. The study is a clinical single-center interventional study.
      The patients (n = 25) need to have an expected high demand for ventricular pacing and no
      established class I indication for cardiac resynchronization therapy. They will receive a
      pacemaker implant with a traditional right ventricular pacing lead and an additional His
      pacing lead in a basal high septal position at the level of the proximal electrical
      conduction system (His). An atrial lead is implanted if dual chamber pacing is needed. All
      leads are connected to a biventricular pacemaker with the His lead in the LV port.
      Postoperatively, the baseline examinations will include: transthoracic echocardiography,
      12-lead ECG with a 3D photography of the chest wall to document ECG electrode location, and a
      contrast-enhanced cardiac CT scan. The echocardiography and ECG will be performed during
      traditional right ventricular pacing only and His pacing only. His pacing will be used as the
      permanent programming of choice if feasible during follow up. The CT scan is used for
      documenting the final positions of the pacing leads and to create a patient-specific 3D model
      of the cardiac electrical activation using a software which enables merging of a CT scan and
      ECG and a CT chest photography. During follow up (1-3 and 12 months), transthoracic
      echocardiography, 12-lead ECG and 3D chest photography are repeated for assessment of
      mechanical and electrical function during pacing. The performance of all implanted pacing
      lead will be evaluated at each follow up visit.
