      can be differentiated from abnormal lung sounds.However, technical issues and complicated
      display modes have restricted the use of computerized lung sound analyses in the clinical
      environment.

      The VRI provides dynamic gray-scale images and quantitative lung data showing the breath
      sound distribution of healthy individuals. Typical features that are discerned by trained
      raters and quantitative lung data may serve as a reference for comparison to abnormal breath
      sound images.
