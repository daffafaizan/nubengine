      tissue-protective effect via activation of Janus kinase (JAK)-2, signal transducer and
      activator of transcription (STAT)-5 pathway and NF-kappa B pathway. The activation of JAK-2
      and STAT-5 promote hemoglobin synthesis and facilitate cell cycle progression. Also, NF-kappa
      B pathway inhibition regulates pro-inflammatory cytokine production.

      We expect that erythropoietin may lead to improve the symptoms and outcome of autoimmune
      encephalitis.
