      in respite care centers (RCCs) that provide a social model of care for people with dementia
      living in the community and support for their caregivers. Largely staffed by long-time
      volunteers, these centers support caregivers' ability to maintain their loved one in the
      home. Traditionally, support for social activities and mealtime offered by the RCCs cannot be
      extended to home. In this project, we will use a telehealth interface to provide consultation
      to family caregivers in the context of home where problems arise.

      Outcomes include improvements in: a) quality of life (QOL) and nutritional outcomes for
      people with dementia (PWD) and QOL outcomes for family caregivers (CGs); b) self-efficacy
      training outcomes for assessing and managing meals for the CGs and the RCC volunteers; and c)
      sustainability outcomes as determined by directors of the RCCs. Two large RCCs with a total
      of 5 sites of care in suburban and rural areas of SC will be the sites of this project.
