      respiratory distress, associated with explosive acute inflammation and alveolar edema. ARDS
      occurs in all age group of patients, where mortality rates increase in advancing age.

      In animal studies of ARDS, mensenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can attenuate lipopolysaccharides
      (LPS)-induced lung injury and pulmonary permeability edema through modulating the
      inflammatory. These findings show that MSCs may improve the clinical outcomes and prognosis
      of ARDS patient. Meridigen is developing UMC119-06, human umbilical cord-derived MSCs, for
      the treatment of ARDS. The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of UMC119-06 in
      patients with ARDS.
