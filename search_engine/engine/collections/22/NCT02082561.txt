      (5-session) transdiagnostic treatment for anxiety disorders. The current treatment (called
      F-SET) focuses chiefly on the elimination of anxiety maintaining behaviors and cognitive
      strategies (so-called "safety" aids) among individuals suffering from a range of anxiety
      disorders including generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder (SAD) and
      panic disorder (PD).

      Four primary hypotheses were evaluated in the current study: (1) the F-SET protocol would
      produce better overall outcome relative to a waitlist control, (2) the F-SET protocol would
      yield clinically significant improvement of primary diagnosis symptoms as well as secondary
      diagnosis symptoms, (3) the F-SET protocol would create treatment improvement that is
      maintained during a 1 month follow-up interval and (4) given that reduction of safety aid use
      is the key mechanism of change in the F-SET treatment, a reduction in safety aid use will
      mediate the relationship between pre and post treatment.
