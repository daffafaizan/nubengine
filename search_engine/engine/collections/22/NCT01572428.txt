      of the colon in blue light)versus standard white light for the detection of serrated lesions
      in the proximal colon (the colon proximal to the splenic flexure). Recent studies have
      indicated that colonoscopy is more effective in preventing cancer in the left side of the
      colon than the right side of the colon. The reasons for this difference may be partly
      biologic, in that a special group of polyps known as serrated polyps, particularly sessile
      serrated adenomas, are located primarily proximal to the splenic flexure. These lesions share
      molecular features with a group of cancers that occur primarily in the proximal colon. These
      molecular features include CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) and microsatellite
      instability. These lesions are endoscopically subtle in that they are often flat, have the
      same color as the surrounding mucosa, and are hard to differentiate from normal mucosa.
      Narrow-Band Imaging has anecdotally been used to highlight the appearance of these lesions.
      This study will test whether Narrow-Band Imaging increases the detection of serrated lesions
      in a randomized controlled trial.
