      placebo-controlled trial in participants with two or more features of the metabolic syndrome
      and symptomatic osteoarthritis in this 12-week efficacy study:

      Aim 1: To assess the effects of strawberries on biomarkers of inflammation [serum levels of
      C-reactive protein: CRP; inflammatory cytokines: interleukin-6: IL-6; interleukin 1β: IL-1β;
      tumor necrosis factor-alpha: TNFα] Aim 2: To assess the effects of strawberries on knee
      function as assessed by overall musculoskeletal examination and pain score (ICOAP, KOOS and
      HAQ-DI).
