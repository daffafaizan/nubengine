    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, masked, sham-controlled, multicenter study to assess the
      safety and efficacy of 4 mg of CLS-TA administered via suprachoroidal injection compared to a
      sham injection procedure in the treatment of subjects with macular edema associated with
      non-infectious uveitis.

      Qualified subjects will be randomized to receive two suprachoroidal injections of CLS-TA
      administered to the study eye or two sham injection procedures administered to the study eye
      approximately 12 weeks apart (Visit 2 and Visit 5). Follow-up visits will be conducted
      monthly up to 24 weeks (Visit 8).
