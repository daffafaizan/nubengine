      I. Pilot test an mHealth HPV vaccine intervention for college students to establish
      feasibility and acceptability.

      II. Obtain preliminary efficacy data on whether the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention
      increases HPV vaccine initiation compared to the control group.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine whether the mHealth HPV vaccine intervention affects secondary outcomes compared
      to the control group.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive targeted HPV vaccine narrative-style video via the

      email or by text message.

      ARM II: Participants receive standard information about HPV and then HPV vaccine information
      statement (VIS) via the mobile-friendly website.
