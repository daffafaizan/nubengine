    
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is the 4th leading cause of morbidity and
      mortality worldwide. COPD is now seen as a disease that is both preventable and treatable. In
      order to better facilitate treatment for these patients, a number of consensus guidelines
      have been developed to help physicians in the diagnosis and chronic management of these
      patients. However, a number of studies have shown that implementation and adherence to the
      guidelines by physicians, both at the primary care and specialist level, remains poor.

      Patients who experience an Acute Exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) have an increased risk of
      mortality, and therefore, must have their management optimized to improve survival. These
      patients most often are evaluated and treated in their local emergency departments (EDs) for
      the acute episode; however, follow up care is often left to their primary care physician
      (PCP). The national rate of patient compliance for follow up with their PCP within the first
      month following an AECOPD is unknown, however, locally, it is only 30%. From this, it could
      be inferred that there is a poor rate for any adjustment in chronic management after an
      AECOPD and therefore an increased risk of future exacerbations.

      It is our belief that informing the PCP that their patient experienced an AECOPD, with a form
      that provides details of the acute management along with an update of the current guideline
      recommendations, will improve follow up, compliance with current guidelines and the quality
      of life for patients with COPD.
