        -  Determine the response rate of patients with AIDS-related lymphoma treated with
           allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation followed by delayed donor
           leukocyte infusion.

        -  Determine the complication rate of these patients treated with PBSC transplantation.

        -  Determine the immune dysfunction and recovery of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 60 minutes on days -5 to -3. Patients who have not
      received prior mediastinal radiotherapy receive thymic radiotherapy on day -1. Allogeneic
      peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Patients also receive anti-thymocyte
      globulin IV over 10-12 hours on days -1, 1, 3, and 5 and cyclosporine IV beginning on day -1,
      switching to oral when possible, and tapering until day 35.

      In the absence of active acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and at least 2 weeks after
      completion of cyclosporine, patients receive an infusion of donor leukocytes on or before day
      49. Patients may receive a second donor leukocyte infusion if there is evidence of persistent
      malignancy and no GVHD.

      Patients are followed through day 100, on days 120, 180, 270, and 365, and then every 6
      months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-4 years.
