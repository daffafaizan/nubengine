      septic patients complicated with or without GI are detected. The serum levels of HO-1, PINK1,
      PLK1as well as oxidative stress and inflammatory markers are compared in different groups.
      For those who requiring intestinal surgery as treatment, the intestinal tissue specimens are
      retained. Meanwhile, the clinical symptoms, intestinal motility indicators and intestinal
      barrier indicators are recorded. In addition, a biomarker model was established to provide
      important reference for diagnose and management of gastrointestinal dysfunction in septic
      patients.
