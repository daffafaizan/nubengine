    
      Phase 1b randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation trial of sedation
      regimens in critically ill children. Testing the hypothesis of mean daily fentanyl dose
      through day 7 of mechanical ventilation will be reduced by â‰¥25% by the addition of
      dexmedetomidine to fentanyl therapy. This trial will involve multiple clinical sites.
      Randomization will occur by individual and investigators will be blinded to study/treatment
      arm. The statistical analysis will account for center effects, participant characteristics
      (including post-surgical state), and changes over time to minimize bias. In addition, PIs and
      study coordinators will undergo training to standardize assessment procedures. The study will
      randomize participants to receive placebo (fentanyl standard of care) titrated to
      sedation+saline placebo (bolus+infusion) or one of the following 3 Dexmedetomidine treatment
      arms in a sequential cohort fashion: Cohort 1: Fentanyl SOC titrated to sedation +
      Dexmedetomidine (0.5mcg/kg bolus load + 0.2 mcg/kg/hr infusion); Cohort 2: Fentanyl SOC
      titrated to sedation + Dexmedetomidine (0.5mcg/kg bolus load + 0.5mcg/kg/hr infusion); and,
      Cohort 3: Fentanyl SOC titrated to sedation + Dexmedetomidine (0.5mcg/kg bolus load +
      0.7mcg/kg/hr infusion).

      An interim analysis is planned for this trial.
