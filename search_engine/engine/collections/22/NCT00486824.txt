      consent will be randomized by the pharmacy to receive oral nifedipine or oral indomethacin.
      Both the patient and primary medical provider will be blinded to the identity of the study
      drug. An abdominal ultrasound will be performed in the labor and delivery unit prior to the
      administration of the tocolytic in order to assess fetal position and fluid level, and to
      document fetal cardiac activity and movement, and will be repeated at 48 hours
      post-randomization. Following randomization, the patient will be given either 50 mg oral
      indomethacin with two pills of placebo, or 3 pills each containing 10 mg oral nifedipine for
      a total of 30 mg. The patients will then receive either 25 mg of oral indomethacin every 6
      hours for 48 hours, or 20 mg of oral nifedipine every 6 hours for 48 hours. Tocolysis beyond
      48 hours will not be used. Antibiotics and steroids for fetal lung maturity will be
      administered as per standard of care for preterm labor. Maternal side effects and delivery
      outcomes will be assessed from questionnaires administered by the study team following
      treatment, and/or from review of the patient's medical records.
