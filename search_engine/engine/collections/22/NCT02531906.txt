      I. Collect preliminary data on the safety and efficacy of two analgesic regimens that can be
      used to design larger studies for comparing such regimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Examine effects of the treatment regimens on pain control, oral mucositis, and
      quality-of-life ratings scores during and after chemoradiation therapy (CRT).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess treatment regimen effect on patient nutrition and hydration status during and
      after CRT (weight loss, vitals, oral [PO] tolerance, etc.).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive gabapentin PO thrice daily (TID) for up to 7 weeks during
      radiotherapy.

      ARM II: Patients receive gabapentin PO TID, methadone hydrochloride PO twice daily (BID), and
      oxycodone hydrochloride PO every 8 hours (Q8H) as needed (PRN) for up to 7 weeks during
      radiotherapy.

      All patients may continue to receive treatment for pain throughout their course of
      chemoradiation therapy (and up to 24 months following CRT if continuing on a pain regimen).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 30 days, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months. Patients requiring prolonged analgesic therapy may be followed up every 6 months for
      24 months.
