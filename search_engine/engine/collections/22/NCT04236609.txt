      the research question of this trial is to evaluate the use of a novel sirolimus-eluting stent
      coated with drug-eluting polymer after crimping on the balloon as compared to the
      standard-of-care EES in the treatment of de novo coronary artery disease in patients with
      diabetes mellitus. ABILITY is a prospective, multi-center, multinational, randomized, open
      label, 2-arm parallel group, post-approval study.
