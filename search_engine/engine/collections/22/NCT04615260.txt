    
      Subjects will be recruited for this study from among those scheduled to undergo 1-2 level
      posterolateral spinal fusion procedures with bone grafting for degenerative disc disease or
      grade 1-3 spondylolisthesis. The study will entail each subject having a local bone graft
      placed on the left side of their spine, with Nanobone placed on the right side of their spine
      during the procedure. Eligible and consenting patients recruited for this study will be
      subject to the standard of care. This includes the following visits: preoperative, operative,
      post-discharge, 4 months postoperative, 1-year postoperative, and 2-years postoperative. They
      will be subject to standard of care imaging modalities including AP, lateral, and
      flexion/extension lumbar radiographs at pre-operative, post-discharge, 4-months
      postoperative, 1-year postoperative, and 2-year postoperative time points. Standard of care
      advanced imaging including a CT scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan will be
      performed pre-operatively. Patients will also receive standard of care clinical examinations
      and self-assessments at all clinic visits. Imaging obtained outside the standard of care for
      this study will include 1-year and 2-year lumbar CT scans to evaluate fusion. The 2-year
      lumbar CT scan will only be required if fusion has not been demonstrated at the time of the
      1-year lumbar CT scan. Patients enrolled in this study who are treated with rigid pedicle
      screw fixation must be treated using rigid pedicle screw instrumentation appropriate for
      posterolateral spinal fusions.
