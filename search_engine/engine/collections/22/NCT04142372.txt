    
      Firstly, clinical information is collected on all hematological malignancies diagnosed in our
      hospital district area retrospectively between the years 2000 and 2019. Clinical outcomes,
      laboratory results, clinically relevant diagnoses, characteristics defining clinical stage
      and established prognostic parameters are gathered.

      Simultaneously a tissue microarray (TMA) of diagnostic samples is compiled using
      representative annotated tissue areas. This TMA is used in combination with additional
      control material to identify prognostic and predictive biomarkers.

      A combined microarray dataset of hematological malignancies (Hemap) is utilized to point out
      genes of possible drug targets, disease specific markers, prognostic markers, or predictive
      markers.

      The clinical datasets and Hemap dataset is ultimately utilized to gain knowledge, new tools
      for prognostication and diagnostics, and targets for treatment. Artificial intelligence
      -assisted differential diagnostics will be tested.
