      with asymptomatic flexible pes planus aged between 18-25, studying at Alanya Alaaddin
      Keykubat University. Persons meeting the inclusion criteria will be determined by the
      specialist physiotherapist. Surface electromyography (sEMG) measurements will be made by a
      doctorate physiotherapist. Other evaluations will be made by a specialist physiotherapist.
      Individuals who meet the inclusion criteria, who volunteered to participate in the study and
      signed the consent sheet will be randomly divided into two groups, the control group and the
      foot core group. Individuals with initial evaluations will be followed up in an exercise
      program planned for 8 weeks. The control group will be given exercises to strengthen the
      weakened muscles, stretch the shortened structures and increase proprioception. Foot core
      training will be given to the study group in addition to the exercises given to the control
      group. Before and after exercise, the subjects will be assessed with navicular height
      measurement, muscle activation evaluation, evaluation of walking parameters, functional lower
      extremity performance evaluation and balance evaluation.
