      the management of sepsis has been evolved on in vitro results showing that concentrations
      close to 10μg/ml may refrain biosynthesis of pro-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the
      activation of the translation factor NF-κB. Intravenously administered clarithromycin has
      been widely applied in experimental sepsis by one susceptible isolate of Escherichia coli,
      one multidrug-resistant isolate of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and one pan-resistant isolate of
      Klebsiella pneumoniae after induction of pyelonephritis by the test isolates. Results of
      these animal studies revealed that clarithromycin inhibited the evolution of the systemic
      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) acting at the cellular level of blood monocytes and
      that its effect was expressed when administered after induction of sepsis.

      Based on the latter experimental data, one double-blind randomized clinical trail was
      conducted over the period June 2004-December 2005 in the 4th Department of Internal Medicine,
      in the 1st Department of Critical Care and in the 2nd Department of Critical Care of the
      University of Athens. The study enrolled 200 subjects with ventilator-associated pneumonia
      (VAP) and sepsis, severe sepsis or septic shock; 100 received placebo and 100 clarithromycin.
      Statistical analysis of results revealed that clarithromycin effected earlier resolution of
      signs of sepsis and of VAP accompanied by a) prolongation of survival of the total of
      patients over the first 16 days of follow-up, b) prolongation of survival of patients with
      septic shock for 28 days of follow-up, and c) 2.75-fold reduction of the relative risk of
      death over the first 28 days of follow-up in patients with multiple organ failure.

      The proposed clinical trial is based on the extremely beneficial results of clarithromycin in
      the septic population of patients with VAP creating the following needs: a) to generalize the
      application of intravenous clarithromycin in the total of admitted septic patients
      irrespective of the underlying cause of sepsis, and b) to expand the effect of clarithromycin
      over a greater time period than the first 19 days post start of administration.
