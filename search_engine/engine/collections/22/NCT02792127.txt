      (i.e., implementation in remote areas, cost-effectiveness, etc.), the primary challenge for
      online formats is to imitate real-life interactions while promoting a reduction in symptoms.
      This will be attempted in a six-month online program for social anxiety.

      The present study will assess the efficacy of a six-month online program through measures of
      social anxiety, fear of negative evaluations, unhelpful thoughts, avoidance behaviours and
      quality of life. This information will be collected from students at baseline and upon
      completion of the online program.
