    
      This is a phase I, open-label, single-dose, dose escalation study in postmenopausal women
      conducted at single center.

      The objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability, effects on bone turnover measured
      by biochemical markers and bone density, and the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of a
      fully human monoclonal antibody of receptor activator for nuclear factor-Îº B ligand (RNAKL),
      (code name: TK006).

      Subjects would sequentially enroll in one of three cohorts. Subjects in the first cohort
      would receive a single 30-mg subcutaneous injection of TK006. If no safety signals are
      observed in the first cohort after 28 days, subjects would enroll in the second cohort and
      receive a single 60-mg subcutaneous injection of TK006. After an 28-day period for
      observation of safety of the second dose, subjects would enroll in the third cohort and
      receive a single 120-mg subcutaneous injection of TK006.
