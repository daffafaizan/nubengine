      Materials will be developed to accommodate the change in scope of program focus for the
      purposes of training and supervising group leaders. An evaluation of the fidelity to the
      original FVEP model will be assessed through the review of service delivery.

      In addition, the acceptability of Fatherhood Focused FVEP (F3) will be compared to the
      treatment as usual, FVEP as it is presently implemented. To do this, fathers who participate
      in FVEP will be compared to men who participate in F3 around the constructs: group cohesion,
      motivation to change, satisfaction with the program and rates of successful completion.
      Tertiary outcomes will include the assessment of: aggression toward intimate partners and
      hostile-aggressive parenting behaviors as reported on assessment measures and subsequent
      arrest records.
