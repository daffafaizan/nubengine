      option to receive continued open-label Daclizumab High Yield Process (DAC HYP) monotherapy
      and to evaluate the long-term safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity of DAC HYP monotherapy in
      participants with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Approximately 60 to 100
      participants will be enrolled into an optional open-label, 16-week autoinjector substudy at a
      selected subset of sites which will run concurrently during the main study, and will evaluate
      the systemic exposure and local tolerability of subcutaneous administration of DAC HYP by
      autoinjector. The 2013-2014 trivalent influenza vaccine will be offered to all eligible
      participants as an optional substudy to assess the effect of DAC-HYP treatment on the immune
      response to vaccination,
