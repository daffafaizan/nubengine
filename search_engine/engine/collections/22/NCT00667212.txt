    
      Qualified participants will be randomly assigned to 12 1-hour sessions of either
      cognitive-behavioral therapy or supportive psychotherapy.

      Participation in this study will require 16 visits over approximately 4 months with 3
      follow-up sessions over a 12 month period. Therapy is provided at no cost and each study
      participant will receive a comprehensive psychological assessment. Two types of talk therapy
      are being offered in this study. One form of therapy focuses on thought and behaviors
      associated with anger and aggression. This type of therapy is known as cognitive behavioral
      therapy. The other type of therapy focuses on the individuals' feeling about their anger
      /aggression and the situations that lead to this anger. This is known as supportive therapy.
      The form of therapy you are given will be randomly determined (like by flipping of a coin).
