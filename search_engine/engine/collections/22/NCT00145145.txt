      MAGE-3.A1 peptide (300 Âµg) mixed with CpG 7909 (5 mg) will be administered twice
      intradermally (10% of the dose each) and twice subcutaneously (40% of the dose each) in the
      arms and thighs.

      Tumor staging will be performed before inclusion and at week 13. PBL collections will be
      performed before starting the treatment, and at weeks 3, 7 and 13. They will provide the T
      lymphocytes for the immunological analysis.

      Additional cycles of immunization will be proposed to patients without tumor progression
      requiring another treatment. A second cycle of 3 injections at 6-week intervals will be
      started at week 17 with the same vaccine, followed by a third cycle of 12 injections at
      3-month intervals starting at month 11. At any time, progression of the disease necessitating
      any treatment not allowed during the study, will result in study withdrawal.
