    
      The study is a randomized crossover trial testing the feasibility and safety of three
      different training protocols in 10 COVID-19 survivors that have been discharged from
      hospital. The subjects will be randomized to perform three different exercise training
      protocols in a random order.

      The aim is to clarify the feasibility and safety of three training protocols in COVID-19
      survivors. The hypothesis is that patients surviving COVID-19 will be able to comply to all
      training protocols.

      The study consists of 4 visits with 1 baseline session (a medical screening and fitness test)
      and 3 different training sessions. Each training is separated by 1-week washout, to account
      for potential confounding by leisure activity performed just before the training, patients
      will be wearing activity watches (Polar).

      Feasibility and safety evaluation will be based on 1) how tolerable and enjoyable the
      training was based on a subjective questionnaire (Likert Scale) 2) compliance to the
      prescribed exercise protocol with regard to duration and intensity and 3) experienced side
      effects.
