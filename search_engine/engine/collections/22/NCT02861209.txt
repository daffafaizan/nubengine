      by Vanhaecht et al., 2011. This methodology aims to offer a systematic approach in 7 phases
      for the support of an interdisciplinary team in the development of new care pathways or in
      the improvement of existing ones.

      The before-part of the study includes phases 1 to 4 that aim to map current practice in
      detail and to translate these findings into the development of a care pathway. Current
      practice will be investigated using mixed methods comprising:

        -  surveys evaluating care on the level of the hospital

        -  semi-structured interviews with healthcare professionals (HCP) and patients

        -  outcome assessments in patients included in the study (self-management, adherence,
           satisfaction with care, satisfaction with information, quality of life) using validated
           questionnaires at the start of the therapy, after 1 month and after three months

        -  outcome assessments in healthcare professionals at baseline (self-efficacy and
           perceptions on self-management) using validated questionnaires

        -  training and feedback sessions on counseling for HCPs

      Based upon these findings, a care pathway in each hospital will be developed by a local
      project team of different stakeholders from different disciplines.

      The after-part of the study includes phase 5-7 in which the care pathway is implemented,
      evaluated and continuously followed up.

      Implementation and evaluation take place at the same time. The evaluation includes:

        -  outcome assessments in patients (newly recruited) at the start of the therapy, after 1
           month and after three months

        -  outcome assessments in HCPs (follow up)

        -  evaluation of counseling skills

        -  focus group discussions and interviews with HCPs to evaluate the development and
           implementation of the care pathway.

      At the end of the study a comparison of outcomes before and after the implementation will be
      made to study the impact of the care pathway on the before mentioned aspects (see "Brief
      Summary").
