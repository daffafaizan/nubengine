      biochemical and biomechanical characteristics needed in an ideal scaffold for tissue
      engineering. Accordingly, we expect matrix to support the growth and differentiation of
      transplanted mesenchymal stem cells. The first step in this effort is to isolate Wharton's
      Jelly matrix by decellularization. The second step will be to test the ability of this matrix
      to support the growth and differentiation of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells. The third
      step will be to pursue preliminary animal testing to study the ability of this matrix to
      support bone tissue regeneration in vivo.
