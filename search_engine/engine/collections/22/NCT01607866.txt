      extracapsular extension of the tumor. Superficial parotidectomy (SP) is the standard
      treatment. Extracapsular dissection (ED) has been proposed to minimize the risk of facial
      nerve palsy. However, the oncologic safety of ED is controversial in the literature. We
      propose quadrant parotidectomy (QP) which is less radical than SP and less conservative than
      ED. QP entails dissection overlying one primary division of the facial nerve leaving the
      other division undisturbed while the resection safety margin is still generous.

      Surgery for pleomorphic adenoma is a compromise between radicality and facial nerve
      morbidity. Risk of local recurrence is imprecisely described in the literature and is
      universally regarded as infrequent and remote. Many studies did not report recurrent cases.
      Thus, Facial nerve injury is the main concern of parotid surgeons and is considered the
      primary end point of this study.
