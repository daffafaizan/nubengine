      rehabilitation unit. Stroke patients admitted in our neuro-rehabilitation unit who follow the
      inclusion criteria, will be invited to participate. The main objective of the study is to
      register the time spent in different activities during therapy session performed in the
      intensive rehabilitation program. At the end of each session a sum of the minutes spent in
      each activity will be performed and at the end of the rehabilitation program the average of
      time spent in each therapy will be calculated. Indeed, throughout these data the total amount
      of time spent on rehabilitation (hours and minutes) will be obtained. Secondary objectives
      are to report changes on functional, cognitive and health status outcomes during different
      time-frames. This outcomes will be assessed at baseline (admission on neuro-rehabilitation
      unit), at discharge of rehabilitation unit (average of 30 days after stroke), at 3 months and
      6 months after stroke. Safety and Feasibility of the program will also de recorded.
      Feasibility will be assessed by adherence to the prescribed program, including the register
      of the following parameters: attendance rate (number of planned sessions attended), training
      session modification (dose reduction or early termination of the individual session) and
      reasons for training interruption (2 or more days without training session) as fatigue,
      dizziness, feverâ€¦ Safety will be assessed registering any adverse event related to rehab (ie.
      episodes of falls,..)
