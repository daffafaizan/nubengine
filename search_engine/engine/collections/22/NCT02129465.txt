      Intrauterine CMV transmission occurs mainly during primary maternal infections, with a
      maternal-fetal transmission rate of about 40%. The mechanisms dictating CMV intrauterine
      transmission are unknown, and transmission is currently thought to be dependent on multiple
      factors, including the maternal and fetal immune system.

      To investigate the mechanism of transmission approaching laboratory prediction of
      transmission, the investigators collect blood from pregnant women with primary CMV infection,
      and analyze several characteristics. These include CMV viral load, cytokine profile in
      response to in-vitro stimulation with CMV peptides, meticulous analysis of anti CMV
      antibodies, maternal DNA polymorphism and microarray of gene expression.

      These results will be analysed according to transmission as indicated by a positive culture /
      Polymerase chain transcription of amniotic fluid or newborns urine / saliva.
