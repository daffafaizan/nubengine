    
      Subjects with chronic periodontitis will undergo non-surgical periodontal treatment (NSPT)
      consisting of a complete scaling, polishing, root planning, and the irrigation of periodontal
      pockets with a 10% povidone iodine solution. Periodontal parameters (plaque index, gingival
      bleeding index, pocket depth, and clinical attachment loss), insulin sensitivity using KITT,
      glucose tolerance using oral glucose tolerance test and serum CRP level by immunoturbidimetry
      will be measured before and 3 months after the NSPT.
