      women will be included. At random 97 patients undergo a standard prolapse operation and 97
      patients undergo an operation with the mesh. Evaluation will take place during surgery, at
      the postoperative visit after six weeks, and after six months and twelve months. Quality of
      life, degree of vaginal prolapse, subjective effectiveness, safety and incidence of
      complications will be evaluated.

      An amendment to the original study has been approved by the Ethical Committee to examine long
      term outcome of this RCT at 7 years. This study was completed in december 2015.
