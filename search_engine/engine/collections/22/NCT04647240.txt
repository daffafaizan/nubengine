    
      DL-VSU-201 is a randomized (2:1 injectable Dermacyte® Liquid:placebo), double-blind, placebo
      controlled study in subjects with underlying venous reflux disease with a non-infected venous
      stasis ulcer (VSU) < 25 square centimeters that has failed to demonstrate improvement after
      receiving at least 4 weeks of standard, conventional wound therapy (e.g. surgical
      debridement, dressings, pressure off-loading, negative pressure and/or hyperbaric oxygen
      therapy). Subjects will receive localized subcutaneous injection of Dermacyte® Liquid or
      placebo into and/or around the wound bed during during clinic visits over a 12-week period
      and assessed for efficacy measures at Screening, Baseline, and Weeks 4, 8, and 12. Percent
      reduction of the wound surface area will be formally collected at Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, and
      12. To assess healing, the ulcer will be evaluated by assessing the change in the surface
      area (L X W) from Baseline. Overall change in VAS from Baseline to Week 12 will be evaluated
      and total wound closure will be evaluated at Week 12.
