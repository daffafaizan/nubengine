      pain. Discrepancies exist on the side of manipulation and the placebo effect of this manual
      intervention. In addition, some authors have proposed that spinal manipulation can alter
      proprioception of the cervical spine. The aim of this study will be to investigate the
      effects of cervical spine manipulation on pain, disability and cervicokinethesia in patients
      with mechanical neck pain. Patients will receive cervical spine manipulation in either right
      or left side of the neck and will be assessed on pain intensity, neck-related disability,
      widespread pressure pain sensitivity, and cervicokinethesia by an assessor blinded to the
      allocation group.
