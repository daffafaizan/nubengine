      group of 90 men, age between 55 to 75 years old recruited after a medical consultation, with
      the diagnostic of Congestive Heart Failure (CHF), under treatment at the Institute of
      Medicine and Rehabilitation and Institute Dante Pazzanesi, considered clinically stable (no
      cardiac symptoms or changes in medication for at least 30 days) and Funcional Class I, II,
      III according to NYHA.

      Experimental Design: Patients will perform an test, first on land, and in a week time in a
      underwater treadmill. The data will be collected in four distinct moments: 1- anaerobic
      threshold (AT), 2- respiratory compensation point (RCP), 3- maximal effort (ME) and recovery
      (R). We will compare the following variables: test total time; perceived exertion scale
      (Borg); Heart rate (HR); Oxygen consumption (VO2); Carbon Dioxide production (VCO2); Oxygen
      pulse (VO2/FC); the ventilatory efficiency (VE/VO2) and (VE/VCO2); Respiratory quotient
      (VCO2/VO2); Systolic and Diastolic blood pressure; electrocardiographic changes, compatible
      with ischemia or arrhythmia.
