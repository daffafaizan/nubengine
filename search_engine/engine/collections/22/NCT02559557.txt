      I. To culturally modify and adapt an existing educational and skills-training intervention
      for use with Spanish-speaking parents of children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or
      with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      II. To pilot the culturally-modified, parenting intervention with eligible families of
      children treated for ALL or AML in the Pediatrics department at City of Hope.

      OUTLINE:

      PHASE I (FOCUS GROUPS): Parents undergo a semi-structured interview with bilingual research
      assistants over 120 minutes. The content and purpose of the intervention is explained, and
      the focus group discussions elicit feedback on the intervention components and content of the
      sessions, and whether the material is culturally and linguistically appropriate. Following
      the focus group discussion, parents receive a copy of the educational handouts that they may
      choose to use with their child if they like.

      PHASE II (PILOT TESTING): Parents of children age 5 to 17 years, 11 months old undergo
      adapted skills training in Spanish over 60 minutes (8 training sessions total) or 80 minutes
      (6 training sessions total). The adapted skills training sessions focus on parenting
      strategies and learning techniques. Sessions include homework assignments and techniques for
      parents to apply with their child for at least 30 minutes, 3 times a week at home.

      After completion of study, parents are followed up every 2 weeks for 3 months and at 6 and 12
      months.
