      maneuvers in supine position and recruitment maneuvers with postural changes of lateral
      decubitus with 10 cmH2O level of positive-end expiratory pressure (PEEP) during 180 seconds;
      in pediatric patients scheduled for surgery under general anesthesia using ultrasound imaging
      and a four-point-aeration score to assess the lung aeration.
