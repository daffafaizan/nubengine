      caries lesions in children, aged 3-8 years old will be treated by non-invasive resin based
      sealing (n= 50) or resin based restoration (n=50). Randomization between sealing and
      restoration (1:1) was made by for a resercher at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and
      kept at the clinics in sealed envelopes. The treatments will be examined clinically and
      radiographically after 6, 12, 24 and 36 years. The treatments are performed and controlled by
      only one practitioner (the main reseacher of this study) from the Federal University of Rio
      de Janeiro, Brazil.

      Sealing: The dentist will use a resin based sealing, and follow their usual clinical
      procedures based on the instructions from the manufacturer and the guidelines from the
      Department of Pediatric Dentistry and Orthodontics of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro,
      Brazil.

      Restoration: The dentist will use preparation design and a resin based resin restoration, and
      follow their usual clinical procedures (partial caries removal) based on the instructions
      from the manufacturer and the guidelines from Department of Pediatric Dentistry and
      Orthodontics of Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

      The prevalence of regression, arrest and progression of sealed and restored caries lesions,
      are computed and related to the clinical and radiological registrations of children, or
      treatment related factors for assessing of statistically significant correlations.

      The influence of each factor on the longevity and need for retreatment of occlusal sealants
      and restorations, will be assessed using apropriate analyses for statistical treatment of
      data.
