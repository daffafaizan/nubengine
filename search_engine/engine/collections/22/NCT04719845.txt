      in idiopathic tracheal stenosis but little litterature has been published on the subject.
      Hence we decided to design a prospective multicenter open label randomized controlled trial
      to compare the two interventions. Patients refered for endoscopic treatment of a simple
      benign tracheal stenosis will be randomized to endoscopic laser resection or dilatation.
      Randomisation will be stratified for center, type of stenosis (idiopathic vs other) and
      history of previous endoscopic treatment. Patients will be blinded to treatment but not
      physician. All patients will be treated with proton pump inhibitors.
