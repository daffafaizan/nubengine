    
      This is a phase I/phase II prospective multicenter trial to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of afatinib with induction chemotherapy in primary unresected patients with
      HPV-negative locally advanced SCC stage III or IVa/b of oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx,
      or larynx. The primary endpoint is overall response rate after the completion of induction
      chemotherapy.

      Eligible patients will begin with a 14 day lead-in period with afatinib alone. This will be
      followed immediately by 2 cycles of induction chemotherapy with carboplatin AUC 6 IV,
      paclitaxel 175mg/m2 day 1, and afatinib as a continuous daily dosing. Each cycle is repeated
      every 21 days. All patients will receive concurrent chemoradiotherapy beginning 2-3 weeks
      after the completion of the second cycle of induction chemotherapy (Refer to Study Schema in
      page 8 of the protocol).

      During the period of induction chemotherapy, a complete history and physical (including
      weight) and tumor assessment by physical examination on Day 1 of each cycle will be performed
      and documented. Complete blood count with differential and a comprehensive metabolic profile
      will be performed weekly. After completion of induction chemotherapy, reassessment with blood
      work, physical exam, CT/MRI of neck and nasopharyngolaryngoscopy will be performed. After the
      completion of CRT, the patient will have a MRI, CT, or FDG PET approximately 12 weeks after
      CRT. Follow-up will be standard of care from this point onwards.

      Physical exam, blood work and AE assessments will also be frequently performed during entire
      treatment.
