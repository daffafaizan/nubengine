    
      Week one of the study is a Baseline Period during which time, baseline data related to opioid
      dose and frequency, mood, sleep, bowel movements, and pain intensity will be collected.
      Participants will receive no Dronabinol during week one and will continue to take their
      stabilized dose of regular prescribed opioids, both baseline and rescue.

      Weeks two through four is the Titration Period, during which time study participants will
      titrate the Dronabinol dose up to a daily dose of 20 mg of Dronabinol per day, according to a
      prearranged titration table. Participants will continue to take their stabilized dose of
      regular prescribed opioids, both baseline and rescue. Participants will be encouraged to
      maintain the 20mg daily total dose of Dronabinol. Participants may also reduce their dose of
      Dronabinol at any time (if they experience severe adverse effects) to a minimum daily dose of
      Dronabinol of 10mg per day. Participants who cannot tolerate at least a minimum daily dose of
      10mg of Dronabinol per day will be discontinued from the study.

      Weeks five through twelve is the Opioid-Sparing Period, during which time participants will
      be encouraged to maintain the stabilized dose of Dronabinol that they "found" during the
      Study-Drug Dose Finding Period. Study Participants will continue to take their regular
      prescribed opioids, but will be encouraged to reduce their opioid dose and/or opioid dose
      frequency at any time during the remainder of the study should they experience a reduction in
      pain and/or an improvement in opioid-related side effects.
