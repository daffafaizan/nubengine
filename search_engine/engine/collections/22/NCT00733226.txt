    
      Context: Respiratory infections are the major cause of wheezing attacks in children with
      recurrent wheezing or asthma in preschool age. OM-85 BV is an bacteria lysate which has been
      proven to prevent respiratory infections about 40 percent in children.

      Objective: To determine if using OM-85 BV diminish the number and duration of the respiratory
      infections and respiratory infection related wheezing attacks,beta-2 agonist and steroid use,
      and number and duration of hospitalizations in children with recurrent wheezing and asthma.
      And also to determine if OM-85 BV has any effect on serum cytokine levels after 6 months.

      Study Design/Setting/Participants: A double-blind, randomized, controlled trial of OM-85 BV
      versus placebo for children 6 months to 6 years of age who have respiratory tract infection
      related recurrent wheezing attacks.

      Intervention: Participants will receive either active Broncho-Vaxom or placebo for 3 months.

      Study Measures: They follow up for 1 year for number and duration of wheezing attacks,
      number, type and duration of respiratory infections, number and duration of beta-2 agonist
      use, number and duration of steroid use and number and duration of hospitalizations. Serum
      cytokine levels will measure to determine if Broncho-Vaxom has any effect on serum cytokine
      levels (at the beginning of the trial and sixth months of the trial).
