        -  The Efficacy Study Part is designed to evaluate the frequency and severity of vasomotor
           symptoms [VMS] in both hysterectomized and non-hysterectomized postmenopausal
           participants after treatment with E4 15 mg or 20 mg or placebo for up to 13 consecutive
           weeks. For endometrial protection, all non-hysterectomized participants will be treated
           with 200 mg progesterone (P4) once daily for 14 consecutive days, after completion of
           the E4/placebo treatment.

        -  The Endometrial and General Safety Study Part (Safety Part) is designed to evaluate the
           general safety, endometrial safety, secondary efficacy (lipid, glucose metabolism,
           health-related quality of life [HRQoL] and treatment satisfaction of E4 in
           non-hysterectomized participants. All participants will receive E4 20 mg in combination
