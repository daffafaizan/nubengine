      them to a 12-week resistance training intervention with Theraband and existing evidence-
      based materials or attention control using a meditation intervention. Using an electronic
      survey tool, patients will complete a baseline questionnaire on key outcomes (quality of
      life, fatigue, side effects) and potential confounders and will consent to a medical record
      review. These will also be assessed via at 4 weeks post randomization and 12 weeks post
      randomization. Participants in the intervention group will receive one-time in person
      instruction in the exercises derived from the existing evidence base of home-based resistance
      training programs for older adults and cancer survivors. They will be sent home with a book
      demonstrating the exercises, a log and a set of appropriate resistance bands. Weekly
      follow-up calls will occur for the duration of the intervention and updates on the call
      results will be provided to the colon cancer clinic nurse so that care is integrated.
      Participants in the attention control group will be mailed a meditation CD. Follow-up in the
      control group will parallel that of the intervention group, with weekly calls.
