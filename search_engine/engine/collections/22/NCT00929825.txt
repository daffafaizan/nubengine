      transplantation (THSC) at the Clinical Hospital. Patients will be randomly divided into four
      groups, each with 15 subjects: group I patients who will use only the mechanical sialogogue;
      group II patients who will make use of electrical sialogogue (TENS); group III patients who
      will make use of mechanical sialogogue associated with TENS and group IV patients who will
      not receive therapy (control).

      The project will present the following experimental design:

        1. Selection of patients to be subjected to the transplantation of hematopoietic stem
           cells;

        2. Implementation of a reference sialometry;

        3. Institution of therapy with mechanical and electrical sialogogue;

        4. Clinical examination, assessment of the occurrence of mucositis and obtention of saliva
           samples pre- and post-THSC;

        5. Qualitative analysis of saliva (turbidity, viscosity and color);

        6. Biochemical analysis of saliva;

        7. Statistical analysis of data.
