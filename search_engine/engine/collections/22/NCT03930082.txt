      daily living ability, physiological function, social-psychological status, comorbidities,
      mental state, grip strength, walking speed. After the assessment, the patients' frailty index
      was obtained. Moreover, the operation time, intraoperative bleeding loss, perioperative
      complications, length of stay, hospitalization expenses, readmission rate within 30 days,
      mortality within 30 days and other outcome indicators of these patients will be recorded.

      The Main purposes of present study are to verify the feasibility of applying Frailty Index
      (FI) to assess the degree of frailty in elderly patients undergoing gastrointestinal surgery,
      compare the difference of perioperative adverse events in elderly patients with different
      degrees of frailtyï¼Œfind potential indicators for evaluating and predicting the safety of
      surgery in elderly patients, and provide reference data for the determination of future
      assessment tools of frailty.

      The secondary objective is to compare the quality of life and long-term prognosis(only for
      patients with cancers,including recurrence free survival and overall survival) of elderly
      patients with different degrees of frailty after gastrointestinal surgery.
