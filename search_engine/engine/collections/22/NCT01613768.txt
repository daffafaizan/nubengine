      I. Evaluate the response rate of eribulin per Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) in patients with locally advanced refractory or metastatic salivary gland cancer
      (SGC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of eribulin in patients with locally advanced refractory
      or metastatic SGC.

      II. Evaluate the duration of response and time-to-progression.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive eribulin mesylate intravenously (IV) over 2-5 minutes on days 1 and 8.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
