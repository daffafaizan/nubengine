      digital periapical radiographs. Instrumentation was done using Protaper Next till size X3
      (size 30). Pre-operative radiographs also included CBCT scans to measure the 3D volume and
      area of the periapical lesion to be used as baseline data. The postoperative radiographic
      examination included: a) digital periapical radiographs taken at 3,6,9, and 12 months to
      monitor the lesion through out the follow-up period. b)CBCT scan to measure quantitatively
      the volume and area of the periapical lesion after 12 months follow up
