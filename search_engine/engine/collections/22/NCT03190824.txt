    
      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the overall tumor sites response
      (objective response rate [ORR]) to OBP-301 in both injected and noninjected lesions up to and
      including Week 24 in patients with unresectable/unresected Stage III and IV melanoma. The ORR
      is defined as the rate of complete response (CR) and partial response (PR) based on the
      modified immune-related response criteria (irRC) 1.0. The modification is to allow the
      identification of up to 10 cutaneous, subcutaneous, and/or lymph node tumor lesions and
      identify the lesions as target and nontarget lesions.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the ORR up to and including Week 24 in injected target lesions based on the
           modified irRC 1.0 and Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1

        -  To evaluate the ORR up to and including Week 24 in noninjected target lesions based on
           modified irRC 1.0 and RECIST 1.1

        -  To evaluate the ORR in both injected and noninjected target lesions at Week 12 based on
           the modified irRC 1.0 and RECIST 1.1

        -  To evaluate duration of response and time to response

        -  To evaluate progression free survival (PFS) at Week 24 and Week 48

        -  To evaluate overall survival (OS) at Week 24 and Week 48

        -  To evaluate the safety of OBP 301

      Exploratory Objective (optional):

      The optional exploratory objective of this study is to investigate the tumor immunological
      response in blood and tumor tissue following treatment with OBP-301.
