      I. To determine feasibility of the administration of topical spironolactone versus placebo in
      this patient population. (Study I) II. To further explore the efficacy of the topical
      spironolactone to prevent/attenuate rash from EGFR inhibitors. (Study II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore efficacy of the spironolactone versus placebo. (Study I) II. To describe the
      efficacy of a Modified Preemptive Therapy Regimen intervention. (Study II) III. To explore
      the adverse event profile of spironolactone and the Modified Preemptive Therapy Regimen
      intervention. (Study II) IV. To explore patient reported outcomes of patients using
      spironolactone and a Modified Preemptive Therapy Regimen intervention. (Study II) V. To
      explore long term (8 week) effect of the 4 week treatment of spironolactone and a Modified
      Preemptive Therapy Regimen intervention on EFGR induced rash. (Study II)

      OUTLINE:

      STUDY I: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients apply spironolactone topically to face twice daily (BID) for 4 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients apply placebo topically to face BID for 4 weeks.

      STUDY II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients apply spironolactone topically to face and body BID for 4 weeks

      ARM II: Patients undergo modified preemptive therapy regimen consisting of skin moisturizer
      topically BID, sunscreen topically before going outside, hydrocortisone topically once daily
      (QD), and doxycycline orally (PO) BID for 4 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
