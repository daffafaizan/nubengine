      and will be recruited for enrollment. Randomization will occur by electronic randomization
      software. Prior to surgery, the pharmacy will be notified of an enrolled patient and will be
      responsible for randomization and creating either a placebo intravenous dose or a treatment
      study dose. Both study groups will receive the standard of care treatment for intra-operative
      hemorrhage control.
