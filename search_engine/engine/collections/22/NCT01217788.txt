      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV), criteria as a marked and
      persistent fear of most (generally accepted as four or more) social or performance situations
      in which the patient believes embarrassment could occur as a consequence of exposure to
      unfamiliar people and/or possible scrutiny by others. The anxiety resulting from the social
      or performance situation is profound. The avoidance, fear, or anxious anticipation of these
      situations interferes significantly with the person's daily routine, having a marked impact
      on occupational functioning and/or social life. The disorder has a lifetime prevalence
      estimated at up to 13%, with onset typically in the mid-teens, and it is diagnosed slightly
      more frequently in females than in males. Social phobia tends to be a chronic disorder with
      periods of exacerbation, with a reported mean duration of illness of approximately 20 years.

      There are two subtypes of social phobia: (i) generalized (discrete), which is suffered by
      approximately 50% of social phobia patients and in which fear and avoidance extend to a wide
      range of social situations, and (ii) non-generalized, in which the patient fears only one or
      a few circumscribed situations. Speaking in front of large groups is by far the most
      prevalent of social fears (Lang and Stein, 2001).

      Social phobia has a lifetime comorbidity rate of approximately 81% with other psychiatric
      disorders (particularly affective disorders, other anxiety disorders, and substance abuse
      disorders), as well as to being associated with increased nonpsychiatric medical
      difficulties. People with social phobia identify social impairment, inadequate social
      support, overall role impairment, specific impairment in education, work, and other
      activities, as well as interference in their efforts at self-improvement. Unfortunately, for
      these patients, there is a strong consensus that social phobia is one of the least commonly
      recognized and treated mental disorders
