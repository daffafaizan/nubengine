    
      Primary Objective

        -  To demonstrate that implementation of a rapid, multidisciplinary supportive care program
           for patients receiving chemoradiotherapy who are deemed to be at high risk for
           hospitalization based on real-time pedometer data will reduce the rate of
           hospitalization during chemoradiotherapy or within four weeks of radiotherapy
           completion.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To demonstrate the feasibility of a program of rapid, multidisciplinary supportive care
           triggered by real-time pedometer data.

        -  To characterize the interventions enacted by our multidisciplinary supportive care team.

        -  To explore if interventions enacted by our multidisciplinary team for patients with low
           recent step counts lead to increased step counts in subsequent weeks compared to
           historical controls.

        -  To collect biospecimens for future correlative studies examining associations between
           blood/urine biomarkers and patient activity levels.
