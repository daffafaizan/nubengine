      clogging the tube as well as dealing with the thick fluid in the middle-ear. The reasoning
      behind this study is that the use of Pulmozyme速 may be able to treat both of these problems.
      Pulmozyme速 was approved by the FDA in 1994 for the treatment of cystic fibrosis patients.
      Infections present in airway (lung) secretions of cystic fibrosis patients and the material
      that plugs ear tubes are in some ways the same. "Off-label" use of a drug is the practice by
      physicians to use a FDA-approved drug in treating conditions other than what the original
      approval was intended for. Pulmozyme速 has been used to treat other lung diseases not related
      to cystic fibrosis. There has been no published report on the use of Pulmozyme速 to treat ear
      infections. This study is a clinical trial that compares two treatments and will last for 3
      months.
