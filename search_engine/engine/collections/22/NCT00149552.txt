      opportunistic infections in HIV infected individuals. Drug users are especially susceptible
      to zinc deficiency. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of zinc
      therapy in preventing immune failure in HIV infected individuals who abuse drugs.

      This trial will last 30 months. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either zinc
      supplements or placebo. Male participants will receive 15 mg of zinc and female participants
      will receive 12 mg of zinc. Clinical and laboratory study visits will occur at 3 or 6 month
      intervals throughout the study.
