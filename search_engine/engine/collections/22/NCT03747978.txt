    
      This was a double-blinded randomized controlled trial conducted at the National Obesity
      Center and the cardiology unit of the Yaoundé Central Hospital in Cameroon from October 2016
      to May 2017. Eligible patients were type 2 diabetes patients, newly diagnosed for
      hypertension (grade I or II) with confirmation on ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM). Patients
      were either on lifestyle modification alone or on a stable anti-diabetic treatment for the
      past three months, aged 25-65 years naïve to any anti-hypertensive treatment, who provided
      their written informed consent. Participants were assigned to receive as anti-hypertensive
      treatment perindopril-amlodipine once daily or perindopril-indapamide at the same frequency.
      The two groups were followed up and monitored for sixth weeks and patients did not take any
      additional treatment with BP modifying properties.

      The primary outcome was the relative change in circadian blood pressure profile between the
      two groups after six weeks of treatment
