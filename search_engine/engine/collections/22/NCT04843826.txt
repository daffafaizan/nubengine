    
      -  Preparation of the implant site will be prepared by a crestal incision on the ridge
           bisecting the existing keratinized mucosa and vertical releasing incisions extending to
           the vestibule. The papillae of the adjacent teeth are not included in the flap design.

        -  A full thickness flap will be raised buccally exposing the underlined ridge of the
           implant site. A surgical drill guide will be used for the precise placement of the pilot
           drill. After pilot drill application, the osteotomy will be prepared with the
           corresponding size of parallel drill.

        -  The implant will be placed in the recipient site by means of an insertion device. The
           implant neck will be positioned flushing with the crestal bone level.

        -  The healing abutment extension of the implant will be placed in such a way that the head
           of the implant protruded about 2 to 3 mm from the bone crest.

        -  Reassessment of the case to assure absence of any signs of inflammation and presence of
           normal tissues before the surgical procedure
