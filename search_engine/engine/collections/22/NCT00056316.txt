      with other forms of emotional distress. This study compared the effectiveness of two
      home-based interventions to reduce levels of depressed, anxious, and other negative moods in
      women living with a family member with dementia. Eligible caregivers were randomly assigned
      to participate in either a video/workbook/telephone coaching intervention, or to a basic
      education condition consisting of a workbook and supportive telephone calls. Participants
      were evaluated for psychosocial distress after treatment, and at 3- and 6-months following
      the end of intervention.
