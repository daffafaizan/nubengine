      of physicians and in consecutively enrolled subjects to assess outcomes generalizability.
      Following appropriate government and ethics committee/IRB approval the NellixÂ® EndoVascular
      Sealing System will be implanted into eligible patients who are adequately informed and have
      consented to join the study. Enrolled patients will undergo a high resolution,
      contrast-enhanced computed tomography angiography (CT) scan of the relevant aortic and
      aortoiliac vasculature within three months of the scheduled procedure and at specified
      follow-up intervals post-implantation. Follow-up visits will occur at 30 days, 6 months, and
      annually to 5 years to assess aneurysm morphology, the status of the implanted devices, and
      relevant laboratory test results.
