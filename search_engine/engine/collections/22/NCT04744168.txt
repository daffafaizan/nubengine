      consultations at term and three days later if they don't deliver between the two. At 41 weeks
      of amenorrhea and five days, women are convened in maternity for induction labour. Midwife
      determined Bishop's score with a vaginal exam to choose between a cervix's maturation (if
      bishop's score <5) or an induction of labour by oxytocin (if bishop's score>5).

      The protocol of study consists of proposing to the pregnant women one or two acupuncture
      sessions the term's day and three days later. Once the consent is signed, women are randomly
      included in the experimental or placebo arm. In the experimental arm, midwives puncture five
      points : 4GI, 6 RP, 34VB, 36E, 3F on each side while in the placebo arm, they puncture just
      one point : 16 HM on each side.

      At each consultation, the midwife collects the bishop's score to compare the average of it
      between the two arms and evaluate the rate of maturation.

      The maturation's rate between the two groups will be compared by a Fisher's exact test and
      analyzed in function parity (nulliparous or multiparous) and number of sessions (one or two)
      with a model of univariate and multivariate logistic regression.

      Finally, the average duration of induction labour will analyze, duration of labour and
      delivery route between the two arms.
