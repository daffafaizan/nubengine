      surgery treatment.So maintain remission medications were routinely given to patients after
      surgery.But maintain remission medications,as azathioprine,6-MP, ciclosporin,tripterygium
      glycosides, had a onset time.The therapeutic effect may appear 3 months~6months after taken
      medicine.There is a treatment blank period between surgery and onset time of maintain
      remission medications.Enteral nutrition has been used in the induction remission and maintain
      remission for CD.May be it can fill the treatment blank period.
