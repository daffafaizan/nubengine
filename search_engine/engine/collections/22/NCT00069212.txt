      on the pathological consequences of exposure to trauma, there is a paucity of information on
      the psychobiology of subjects who are resilient to severe stress. The proposed study will
      comprehensively evaluate the neural circuits that mediate fear, reward, social cooperation,
      memory, and emotional regulation in traumatized men and women with and without PTSD and
      healthy subjects. Subject groups will include prisoners of war, active duty special
      operations forces, returning Iraqi veterans (approval pending), and men and women exposed to
      non-combat traumas including sexual and or physical abuse. Comparison groups will include men
      and women exposed to trauma without PTSD (resilient subjects), and healthy men and women who
      have never been exposed to trauma. Changes in neural circuitry associated with resilience
      will be evaluated using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Relationships and
      interactions among the neural circuits mediating fear, reward, social cooperation, memory,
      and emotional regulation will be assessed and correlated with clinical, neuroendocrine, and
      neuropsychological findings. Identification of biological and psychosocial correlates of
      resilience could help predict illness vulnerability following exposure to trauma and could
      assist in the selection of "hardy" subjects for high-risk professions.
