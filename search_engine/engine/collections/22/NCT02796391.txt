      targeted cessation materials to facilitate extinction during pre-quit VLNC smoking, (2)
      establish the feasibility of recruitment and measurement strategies to be used in the RCT,
      (3) determine whether immediate vs. gradual pre-quit nicotine tapering in combination with
      the targeted behavioral intervention has beneficial effects (on cessation-related and
      intermediate outcomes) for eventual comparison with validated cessation methods (e.g., NRT),
      and (4) examine several potential moderators and mediators of treatment efficacy.
