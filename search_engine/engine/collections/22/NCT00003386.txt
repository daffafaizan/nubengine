      develop delayed-type hypersensitivity to dinitrophenyl-modified autologous tumor vaccine. II.
      Assess the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the feasibility of
      conducting a group wide vaccine study.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo a standard debulking procedure with the tumor tissue being sent to
      Thomas Jefferson University. Patients then receive six courses of combination chemotherapy
      consisting of either paclitaxel and cisplatin or paclitaxel and carboplatin. Vaccine therapy
      must commence within 4-12 weeks of completion of chemotherapy. Patients are tested for
      delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) on day -7. Cyclophosphamide IV is administered on day 0.
      Dinitrophenyl (DNP)-modified autologous ovarian epithelial cell vaccine and BCG adjuvant are
      injected once a week beginning on day 3 and continuing for 6 weeks. DTH testing is repeated
      at week 8. Booster vaccine injections are administered at 6 and 12 months if patient is
      disease free. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
