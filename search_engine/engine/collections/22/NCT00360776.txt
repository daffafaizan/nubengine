      I. Estimate the complete response rate, partial response rate, and overall response rate in
      patients with natural killer (NK)- or T-cell-large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia who
      present with neutropenia or anemia treated with tipifarnib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of tipifarnib in these patients. II. Determine the mechanism of
      treatment responses in these patients through correlative laboratory studies.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease type (natural killer-large granular lymphocyte
      [LGL] leukemia vs T-cell-LGL leukemia).

      Patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are
      evaluated after completion of course 4. Patients achieving complete response receive 1
      additional course of treatment. Patients achieving partial response receive 4 additional
      courses of treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically during study for response mechanism studies
      and other biomarker correlative studies, including mutations of K-ras and N-ras genes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 6 months for 5 years.
