      period. One group exercised regularly (5 or more hours/week) before onset and continued doing
      so with the same regularity (group A). The second group either did not perform physical
      activity or did so sporadically (group S).

      Consultations were initially performed on a weekly basis for the first month, then once a
      month for the remaining period. In each consultation, patients were asked about diet
      accomplishment, glycaemia monitoring, insulin injections and exercise performance. All
      individuals from group A declared to practice regularly intervallic routines, playing team
      sports (basketball for n=1 and soccer for n=6). Only one individual declared to perform
      aerobic exercise (long distance running and swimming). At the end of the first year a second
      blood sample was extracted in the same conditions from each individual to determine the same
      parameters. Exercise routine accomplishment and follow-up of diet and insulin injections was
      followed monthly during one more year. At the end of this period, the study was considered
      finished and the last blood extraction was performed in order to measure the same parameters.
      Other subjects were excluded because they were not capable to provide data required for study
      follow up.
