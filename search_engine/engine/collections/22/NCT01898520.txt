    
      A 12 week randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled,parallel group study followed by a
      24-week open-label extension phase.

      The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of Sativex treatment using a spasticity 0-10
      numerical rating scale (NRS). The endpoint for analysis is the comparison between Sativex and
      placebo in the change from baseline to the end of the acute phase in mean spasticity 0-10 NRS
      scores (week 12 or last seven days prior to withdrawal).

      The secondary objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of Sativex via volunteered
      adverse events, laboratory parameters and vital signs. The efficacy of Sativex compared to
      placebo is also investigated for the following outcomes: spasticity (modified tardieu scale
      (MTS) score of the most affected limb and the modified ashworth scale (MAS) score of the main
      muscle groups of the upper and lower limb), sleep quality (sleep 0-10 NRS), pain (paediatric
      pain profile [PPP]), quality of life (of both the participant and the caregiver; cerebral
      palsy quality of life (QOL) questionnaire and caregiver QOL questionnaire), comfort (comfort
      questionnaire), depression assessment (childrens depression inventory (CDI 2)) and the
      caregiver's global impression of change (CGIC).
