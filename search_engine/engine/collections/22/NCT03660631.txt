      39 seconds. Yet effective implementation of research-based interventions that reduce
      CVD-related illness and death remains a substantial challenge. The objective of this study is
      to test the scalability of a pharmacist-led, remote CVD risk and prevention services model in
      large, organizationally and culturally diverse hospitals and health-systems, many with high
      proportions of minority and underserved patients, using a pragmatic cluster-randomized
      design. This service is called the Cardiovascular Risk Service (CVRS). There are limited data
      on the barriers and facilitators of implementation to enhance the CVRS in these types of
      diverse, complex health-systems. Therefore, scaling up our effective, innovative team-based
      intervention will require an assessment of barriers and facilitators to CVRS adoption,
      implementation, and maintenance. Our central hypothesis is that barriers and facilitators to
      CVRS implementation will vary across diverse primary care offices. We will use mixed methods
      including interviews, observations, and an innovative physician-pharmacist collaboration
      survey we developed to predict implementation of pharmacy-based services. The rationale for
      this proposed study is that overcoming barriers to implementation of a novel strategy to
      improve secondary prevention of CVD will lead to innovative strategies for broader adoption
      by health systems throughout the US.
