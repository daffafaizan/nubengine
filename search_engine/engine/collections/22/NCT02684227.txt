      I. To determine the clinical activity of combination enzalutamide, carboplatin and paclitaxel
      represented as:

      Ia. Objective tumor response (complete response [CR] + partial response [PR]). Ib. The
      proportion of patients who survive progression-free for at least 6 months after initiating
      therapy.

      II. To quantify protein and phosphoprotein expression of androgen receptor (AR) and
      AR-response genes following enzalutamide treatment in match-paired pre and post treatment
      tumor biopsies.

      III. To determine the safety and feasibility of daily enzalutamide given in combination with
      carboplatin and paclitaxel in women with advanced stage or recurrent endometrial cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine median response duration. II. Estimate progression free survival and overall
      survival. III. Evaluate for presence of pharmacokinetic interaction between enzalutamide and
      paclitaxel.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate molecular results, including AR receptor expression and activation, to clinical
      endpoints.

      II. Identify potential agents to synergize with enzalutamide based on pathways activated
      after enzalutamide treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) alone on days 1-28. Patients then
      receive enzalutamide PO QD on days 1-21, paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 1,
      and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6-9 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 1
      year.
