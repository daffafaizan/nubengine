      fractures of the acetabulum between September 2016 and February 2019 at our institution. This
      study was approved by the ethics committee at our institution and verbal and written informed
      consent was obtained from all patients. The final analysis included 43 patients (33 males and
      10 females) who underwent the Kocher-Langenbeck approach for the reduction and fixation of
      the posterior structures of the acetabulum.

      The patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 (G1) consisted of 20 patients who
      underwent preoperative molding of the osteosynthesis plate on a 3D printed model of the
      pelvis. Group 2 (G2 or control group) included 23 patients who underwent surgery using the
      conventional technique.

      All patients were examined in the outpatient department via clinical and radiographic
      evaluation at 3, 6, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively, then every 6 months thereafter. A
      standard radiographic assessment including three views (AP, iliac oblique, and obturator
      oblique) and a pelvic CT scan were obtained for all patients at the last follow-up visit. The
      reductions were classified as one of three types: anatomical (residual displacement <1 mm),
      imperfect (residual displacement 1 to 3 mm), and poor (residual reduction >3 mm). Clinical
      outcomes were assessed using the modified Harris Hip score. Bone consolidation was obtained
      in all cases. Clinical and radiographic results at the last follow-up as well as the minimum
      follow-up duration were evaluated by one surgeon who did not participate in the surgical
      management of the patients.
