    
      This is a small (N = 42) 2-arm, double-blind, randomized controlled pilot study to assess the
      effect of a single dose of immediate release carbidopa-levodopa (50mg/500mg) to acutely
      reduce alcohol consumption and craving in college students with a history of heavy episodic
      drinking. Participants will be between 21-24 years old from 2- and 4- year colleges in the
      Seattle Metropolitan area. Interested students will contact the study line and provide verbal
      consent to be sent a link to an online screening survey. Eligible participants will be
      scheduled to come in for the ad libitum alcohol administration. Participants will receive
      either the carbidopa-levodopa or a placebo and complete the alcohol administration protocol.
