      treatment dose will be 75mJ/cm2 ( Minimum Effective Dose;MED) for all patients. If no
      erythema develops, the subsequent treatment dose can be increased by 0.5 MED. If mild to
      moderate erythema develops, the same dose (i.e. 1 MED) will be used.If severe erythema/
      blisters develop, treatment will be stopped and the patient wil be invited one week later and
      treatment will be offered at 50% of the last dose.

      During the first consultation, patients will be assessed for the presence of striae distensae
      (SD). Duration and previous treatments of SD will be recorded. The width of the widest striae
      and the length of the longest straie will be measured at baseline and after 2 months of
      treatment. Photographs will be taken at baseline and post treatment. These will be evaluated
      by dermatologists who will be blinded (i.e. details of which photographs are pre or post
      treatment will not be given). Subjective scores will be used (Very good to excellent; >75%,
      Good; 51-75%, Moderate; 26-50%, Minimal to no improvement; <25%) Participants will also be
      given a feedback form to rate any improvements noted and any side effects experienced.
