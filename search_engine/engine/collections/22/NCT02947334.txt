      verify eligibility for the trial. Eligible subjects will be considered enrolled and progress
      to the Randomization visit. Results from screening evaluations will be reviewed and only
      subjects who continue to meet all eligibility criteria will be randomized. Randomized
      subjects will enter the 12-week treatment period, followed by a 40-week long-term treatment
      period and a 6 week follow-up, for a total of 58 weeks (approximately 14 months) study
      participation. Subjects will attend clinic visits as shown in the Schedule of Activities.
      Subjects will be randomized to receive either 150 mg Q2wks of bococizumab or placebo in a 1:1
      ratio. Lipid levels will be blinded to the investigator and staff, subject and sponsor.
