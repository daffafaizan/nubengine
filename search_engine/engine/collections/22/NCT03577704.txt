      mg per single dose) combined with 3 different fixed-dose chemotherapy regimens.

      Three chemotherapy regimens are：

      ① Gemcitabine (1000 mg/m2) and Cisplatin (75 mg/m2) , every three weeks. Gemcitabine was
      administered on the first day and on the 8th day, and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 was administered on
      the first day , a total of 4-6 cycles。

      ② Paclitaxel (80 mg/m2) and carboplatin (AUC=2), every 3 weeks. Paclitaxel and carboplatin
      were administered on days 1, 8 and 15 for a total of 4-6 cycles.

      ③ mFOLFOX6 protocol: oxaliplatin (85 mg/m2), leucovorin (400 mg/m2), and 5-fluouracil (5-FU)
      (400 mg/m2, followed by 2400 mg/m2), every 2 weeks. Oxaliplatin, leucovorin and 5-FU were
      administered on the first day.

      After 4 to 6 cycles of (gemcitabine and cisplatin regimens) and (the paclitaxel and
      carboplatin regimens) or after 6 to 12 cycles of the mFOLFOX6 regimen, well-controlled
      patients will be continue to receive a weekly HLX07 infusion as maintenance therapy for
      maximum 2 years or until disease progression or emergence of intolerable toxicity or
      permanent withdrawal or death (whichever comes first).

      The study used the Bayes optimal interval design (BOIN) to determine the MTD of HLX07 in
      combination with chemotherapy.
