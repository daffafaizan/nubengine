      non-painful and non-damaging dose. The resulted in significant immunologic changes in the
      skin that included up-regulation of specific skin tissue and skin genes and the activation
      and mobilization of specific skin cells.

      In the first part of the study, the researcher will make a determination of the laser
      irradiance that will be tolerated. The highest irradiance the subject tolerates for 1 minute
      will be identified as that subject's maximum tolerable irradiance. After all subjects are
      tested, researcher will select the highest irradiance that was tolerated and use this in the
      second phase of the study.

      Approximately 24 hours after the first test exposures, each subject will receive a one minute
      laser treatment at the maximum tolerable irradiance. Four hours later, two skin biopsies will
      be collected from laser treated site a untreated.

      One tissue sample will be test at UC Irvine Dept. of Dermatopathology to evaluate microscopic
      skin changes, one skin sample will be delivered to Massachusetts General Hospital to evaluate
      RNA and protein expression.
