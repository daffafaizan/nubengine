      will be asked to undergo a 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (ingestion of 75g glucose with
      subsequent timed assessment of growth hormone, glucose, insulin and related binding
      proteins.) Baseline assessment of hormones that may contribute to the results will be drawn,
      prior to performing the test. Patients will be asked to complete one visit total to
