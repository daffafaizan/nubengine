      engineering strategy to assemble an anti-BCMA CAR(chimeric antigen receptor) in autologous T
      cells will help these CART cells to recognize and kill BCMA-expressing MM tumor cells. This
      trial aims to evaluate the safety and anti-tumor efficacy of autologous BCMA-CART in treating
      relapsed or treatment refractory multiple myeloma.
