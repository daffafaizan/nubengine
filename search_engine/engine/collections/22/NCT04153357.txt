      the intubation success rate. We want to compare different video laryngoscopes in this field.

      methods: We enroll total 60 patients > 1 year old undergoing neurosurgery. We compared the
      intubation times, success rates and minor complications of Airtraq, Glidescope and c-mac
      video laryngoscopes in these pediatric patients undergoing neurosurgery.
