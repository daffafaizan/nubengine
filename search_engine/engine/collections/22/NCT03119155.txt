      more than 170 maternal and child health care hospitals throughout the whole of China. This is
      a multi-center-based study to improve the integral diagnostic level of fetal congenital heart
      diseases by fetal echocardiography. Sixty pregnant cases (18-45 years) whose fetuses with
      heart abnormalities will be recruited in a successive manner from every center every year.
      Cases are gravidas with fetal congenital heart disease diagnosed by echocardiography in
      16th-24th of gestational weeks. Every center will upload the echocardiography materials and
      the diagnostic reports so that another two experienced echocardiography physicians confirm
      the diagnosis based on these materials in a double-blinded method. In addition, the golden
      standard of congenital heart disease depends on the autopsy, heart and vascular casting after
      abortion and operation after birth. The investigators will provide the report about the rate
      of missed diagnosis and misdiagnosis and the periodical training on fetal echocardiography
      for every center every half an year. Only gravidas who are willing to have complete pregnancy
      checks and finally delivery or abortion in the hospital are interviewed are eligible for the
      study. Study participants will be asked for their informed consent.
