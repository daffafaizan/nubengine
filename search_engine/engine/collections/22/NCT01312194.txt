      necrotic molars. The patients were randomly divided into two groups of treatment: one and two
      visits. The treatment protocol is the same for both groups, except the number of visits and
      the use of intra canal medication in the group treated in two visits. Patients will be
      followed clinically and radiographically for a minimum period of two years. The data was
      collected by the evaluation of postoperative pain and to determine the healing of periapical
      lesions, characterizing the success of the treatment.
