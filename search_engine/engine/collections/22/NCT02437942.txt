    
      Detailed Protocol

      The following assessments will be undertaken by a consultant sports physician during the
      initial clinical examination:

        -  Hip joint range of motion (flexion, internal and external rotation)

        -  Flexion ADduction Internal Rotation (FADIR) and Flexion ABduction External Rotation
           (FABER) tests

        -  Squeeze tests (resisted adduction) at 90, 45 and 0 degrees were performed (SQ90°, SQ45°
           and SQ0° respectively)

        -  Resisted sit up

        -  Prone internal and external rotation

        -  Gaenslen's test

        -  Hip extension

        -  Femoral slump

        -  Thomas test

        -  Palpation of the adductor insertion to tubercle, pubic symphysis and superficial ring
           with resisted oblique sit up and deep ring scrotal invagination

        -  The crossover test Radiological examination will include magnetic resonance imaging of
           …..

      Biomechanical testing involves the following progressive neuromuscular challenge tests which
      are undertaken after the clinical examination:

        -  Countermovement jump - Vertical jump as high as possible

        -  Single leg drop landing - Hop from a 30cm height onto one leg and hold the landing for
           2sec

        -  Hurdle hop - Lateral hop over a 15cm hurdle followed by a hop back to the starting
           position and a hold for 2sec

        -  Change of direction cut - Sprint for 5 metres, make a 75 degree acute change of
           direction and sprint for a further five meters to the finish

        -  Indecision cut - Sprint for three meters then react to a light stimulus and make a 90
           degree cut to the left or right for a further 1.5metres

      Questionnaires

        -  Hip and groin outcome score (HAGOS)

        -  Marx activity rating scale

      Physical therapy assessment:

        -  Single leg squat

        -  Straight leg raise

        -  Hip strength testing

        -  Hip range of motion

        -  Squeeze test

        -  Crossover test

        -  Linear running analysis

      Rehabilitation Details

      Movement Control Focusing on the deficits in large compound movement patterns evident during
      assessment as well as hip and trunk control deficits. High emphasis placed on the technical
      quality with which the sessions were carried out. Particular focus on pelvic control while
      improving sagittal and frontal plane hip and lumbopelvic control. Any symptoms during
      exercises indicates poor technique and the exercise will be reviewed and intensity reduced
      until appropriate technique achieved. The rep and set ranges reflected the emphasis on
      control while improving range at the thoracic spine, hip and ankle.

      Strength-Power Double leg and single leg strength training carried out as necessary. Good
      form instructed throughout to ensure appropriate hip strategy especially under high load.
      Power work included single leg plyometric exercises to reduced ground contact and improve
      stiffness throughout the kinetic chain.

      Linear Running Linear running drills focused on optimizing lumbo pelvic control in all three
      planes identified during assessment. Commence with wall drills and marching and skipping and
      progressing onto sled and harness drills which facilitate developing optimal posture with
      increased rate of force development and ground reaction forces to improve performance.

      Multi Directional Multidirectional drills will be used to provide a neuromuscular challenge
      to the trunk on pelvis and hip control as well as optimizing foot position and the ability to
      control the centre of mass relative to the stance leg to reduce hip and pelvic overload and
      optimise cutting performance. Higher intensity cutting drills will be included as a
      progression once a painfree squeeze at 90 degrees has been achieved and symmetrical hip
      internal rotation bilaterally.

      Conditioning With a view to ensuring all aspects of the athletes performance are addressed,
      conditioning will be carried out on a stationary bike to allow sufficient intensity without
      overloading the pubic/groin region. Sessions will be prescribed from Maximal Aerobic Power
      assessment on a wattbike and focused on alternate maximal and supramaximal sessions.

      Hip and Groin Outcome Score (HAGOS) and MARX activity rating scale A HAGOS and MARX
      questionnaire will be completed by each groin patient on every visit -approximately every two
      weeks.

      Patient Registry

      Patient data will be inputted into iMedDoc medical data management software. Captured data
      will include:

      Patient information - doubly de-identified patient code, electronic scan of consent form,
      anthropometric data, sport, playing position and playing level, time with pain, pain side or
      bilateral pain.

      Sports medicine consultants findings - Diagnosis, magnetic resonance imaging findings,
      findings of clinical examination Physiotherapist's findings - clinical examination findings
      for initial test and post-rehabilitation HAGOS - hip and groin outcome score for initial test
      and throughout rehabilitation MARX activity rating scale - for initial test and throughout
      rehabilitation Magnetic resonance image files Quality assurance plan Weekly cross-checking
      will be undertaken by two members of staff to ensure data entered onto the registry is
      correct as per paper records and per acceptable ranges.

      A six-monthly audit of the registry will be undertaken by external auditors (Dr Kieran Moran,
      Dublin City University and Dr Siobhan Strike, Roehampton University).

      Registry standard operating procedures

      Basic patient contact details are inputted by administration staff Patient consent form is
      uploaded to imeddoc software Doctors and physiotherapists input physical examination findings
      on imeddoc software HAGOS and Marx activity questionnaire are inputted by the patient using a
      tablet device. This data is uploaded to imeddoc automatically once questionnaire is
      completed.

      Data is downloaded from imeddoc and placed into Microsoft excel. Patient name is
      de-identified.

      Two researchers manage the registry updates and cross-check the data on a weekly basis. Where
      applicable paper records are checked to ensure the information submitted to the registry is
      complete and is within acceptable ranges.

      A six-monthly audit of the registry will be undertaken by external auditors (Dr Kieran Moran,
      Dublin City University, Ireland and Dr Siobhan Strike, University of Roehampton, London).

      Sample size assessment to specify the number of participants or participant years necessary
      to demonstrate an effect Suggested sample size = 600 Biomechanical clustering techniques
      (which will be used to describe the different biomechanical diagnoses that exist in AGP
      patients) require relatively large numbers of participants. Previous studies have utilised an
      n = 588 for this purpose (Sutherland and Davids), therefore it is hypothesised that 600 will
      be sufficient for such an analysis in the current study.

      A sample size of n = 600 will allow a comprehensive examination of the clinical presentation
      of groin pain. Previous studies have only utilised up to 218 participants (Bradshaw et al
      2008).

      Finally, a sample size of 600 will be sufficient to account for drop out from the
      rehabilitation intervention. Drop out may be relatively high due to the regular physical
      therapy contact required (approximately every 2 weeks) despite the wide geographical spread
      of participants (throughout Ireland).
