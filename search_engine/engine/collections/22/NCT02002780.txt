      surgery for a complex heart problem. Measures of quality of life among children with heart
      problems indicate that those 8 to 12 years of age have lower quality of life scores than
      younger or older children.

      Children who survive a critical illness requiring a multi-day stay in a pediatric intensive
      care unit are at risk for a variety of psychiatric morbidities. Depression, anxiety and
      post-traumatic stress disorder occur in 7% to 28% of patients.

      A systematic review of psychological adjustment among children with heart problems indicates
      that parent reports (but not child self-reports) are useful in detecting problems with
      psychological adjustment. While parent reports tend to identify increased social and
      behaviour problems, child self-reports indicate more frequent symptoms of depression compared
      to healthy peers.
