    
      Study design :

      Research of routine care - hospital based, two site, nested case-control study, conducted in
      the Institute of Cardiology within the Pitie-Salpetriere University Hospital and the Cardiac
      Center of the Saint Antoine University Hospital.

      Number of participants :

      Group 1 : n=80 HIV seropositive participants (HIV+) Group 2 : n=160 HIV seronegative
      participants (HIV-) Sample size calculation based on : 10% absolute difference between the
      two groups for maximum platelet aggregation (MPA) to residual platelet aggregation (RPA)
      ratio calculated MPA/RPA for each antiplatelet drug (Aspirin, Clopidogrel, Prasugrel).

      Study justification :

      Platelet function is a risk marker independent of ACS recurrence risk. People living with HIV
      who have a premature coronary artery disease, revealed by an ACS event, more frequently
      experience ischemic recurrence than people without HIV.

      Hypothesis :

      Due to their elevated residual platelet reactivity, people living with HIV present more
      frequent ACS recurrence following a first event than people without HIV.

      Primary objective :

      Determine if there is an influence of HIV and antiretroviral medications on the platelet
      reactivity of individuals under oral antiplatelet treatment. PLatelet reactivity will be
      assessed between one week to 3 years after the initial acute coronary syndrome under dual
      antiplatelet therapy.

      Methods :

      Platelet aggregation measured by :

        1. Light transmission aggregometry (LTA, 20µM adenosine diphosphate receptor inhibitor
           (ADP) and 5µM of arachidonic acid (AA))

        2. Point of care VerifyNowRM P2Y12 and ARU (P2Y12 Reaction Units and ARU Aspirin Reaction
           Units)

        3. Flow cytometry (VAsodilatator Simulated Phosphoprotein (VASP))
