      interest in "personalizing" the delivery of ICBT, for example, by increasing the amount of
      therapist support available (from once a week to twice a week) to reflect the unique needs
      and preferences of the patients. Patients also express an interest in personalizing "therapy
      messages". One current barrier to offering more personalized messages, however, is that
      patients do not consistently provide information on their use of new treatment strategies, as
      well as strengths and challenges of using strategies. As a result, therapists find it
      difficult to personalize their messages. One method of overcoming this difficulty is to
      systematically ask patients to reflect on their use of treatment strategies (e.g., monitoring
      thoughts, challenging thoughts, controlled breathing, pleasant activities, and exposure)
      through questionnaires rather than relying on patients to provide this information in emails.
      Another factor that could moderate ICBT efficacy is therapist location. Some therapists who
      provide ICBT work in a specialized unit where there is primary focus on ICBT and daily
      attention to following ICBT guidelines. Other therapists deliver ICBT from community mental
      health clinics where the primary focus of the setting is on face-to-face care and there is
      lower familiarity with ICBT. It is possible that ICBT may be more effectively delivered in a
      setting where the primary focus is on ICBT.
