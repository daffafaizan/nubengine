      through speckle tracking give additional information to conventional echocardiographic
      parameters (LVOT VTI measurements, etc.) in identifying patients at greatest risk of major
      clinical events occurring within 30 days after VA ECMO liberation. It is a prospective
      observational non-blinded pilot study. In this study will be investigated whether particular
      values of strain (longitudinal and circumferential LV longitudinal and circumferential and RV
      longitudinal strain) and conventional echocardiographic parameters, obtained during VA ECMO
      weaning studies, are more associated to major clinical outcomes within 30 days after VA ECMO
      liberation.

      The population consists of patients receiving VA ECMO mechanical circulatory support for
      cardiogenic shock, who have undergone an echocardiogram as part of the weaning process and a
      decision has been made to attempt weaning from VA ECMO. The decision to wean the patient from
      VA ECMO will be made by the attending clinician who will be aware of all echocardiographic
      measurements with the exception of the speckle tracking results (as is the standard-of-care
      at our institution). The study investigator who will perform all speckle tracking analysis
      will not be involved in the decision to wean from VA ECMO.

      SCHEMATIC OF STUDY DESIGN

        1. Screening of VA ECMO patients in whom a weaning study is planned

        2. Definitive SCREENING FAILURE = patients who do not fulfil inclusion criteria or have at
           least one exclusion criterion (not including the LVOT VTI criterion)

        3. VA ECMO weaning study performed

             -  Patients deemed unsuitable for liberation from VA ECMO at this time are not
                enrolled for analysis, and are reassessed following the next weaning study

             -  Patients deemed suitable for liberation from VA ECMO, but whose LVOT VTI was <10cm
                at any stage of the weaning study, or whose LVOT VTI at lowest achieved flow was
                lower than baseline are excluded

             -  Patients deemed suitable for liberation from VA ECMO and not excluded based on LVOT
                VTI criterion are enrolled.

        4. EVALUATION OF SPECKLE TRACKING FINDINGS (LV LONGITUDINAL AND CIRCUMFERENTIAL AND RV
           LONGITUDINAL STRAIN) AND CONVENTIONAL ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC PARAMETERS WITH CLINICAL
           OUTCOMES AT 30 DAYS POST VA ECMO LIBERATION (REMOVAL)
