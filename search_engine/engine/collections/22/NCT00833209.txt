      Dexoxy Glucose Positon Emission Tomography) comparing them with controls. Results showed a
      hypometabolism in the OFC, which persist immediately after the antimigraine drugs withdrawal.
      A similar pattern is observed in varied substance related disorders and should be a marker of
      addictive behaviour. It can be linked with difficulties in the decision-making process, which
      can be explored by the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) test.

      Several questions are still unanswered. What will this abnormality become in the long term ?
      Is it predictive of susceptibility for relapse? Can it be linked to a specific psychological
      profile (addictive behaviour)?
