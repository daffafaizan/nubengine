    
      The primary objective is to demonstrate efficacy of inhaled OligoG measured by FEV1, and
      supported by secondary endpoints including Mucociliary Clearance, rheology,microbiology and
      Quality-of-Life.

      The secondary objectives are

        1. To demonstrate the safety and tolerability of inhaled OligoG as a dry powder for
           inhalation after multiple dose administration; and

        2. To evaluate patient compliance with treatment.

      The design will be randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, cross-over
      phase II study. Mucociliary and Cough clearance (MCC) will be an exploratory endpoint in a
      subset of 24 patients, and Lung Clearance Index (LCI) an exploratory endpoint in another
      subset of 20 or more patients.
