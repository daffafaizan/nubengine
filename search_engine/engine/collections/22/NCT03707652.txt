      combination of oral supplements for enhancing whole blood levels of NAD+. Each subject will
      receive a specific dose of the formulation once daily for 3 days followed by a washout
      period. Upon completion of the treatment phase, there is a post-treatment period of
      assessments.

      Participants receive assessments of blood tests, vital signs, body weight with completion of
      questionnaires.

      The primary objective of the study is to identify the ideal dosage of an oral supplement to
      increase whole blood NAD+ levels in adults.

      The secondary objective of the study is to monitor for safety from a change in fasting blood
      chemistry panel parameters after three day's dosing compared to cycle baseline.
