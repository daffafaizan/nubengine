      methyl-prednisolone at a dose of 2 mg/kg per day (Martin PJ R. J., 2012; Van Lint MT, 1998).
      Despite initial responses (around 60%), fewer than half of patients have durable complete
      responses, and those patients who do not respond or progress after an initial response have
      high mortality (Weisdorf D, 1990; Alousi AM, 2009; Bolanos-Meade J, 2014). Moreover,
      prolonged high-dose corticosteroids (CS) exposure is associated with deleterious
      complications and long-term morbidity (Mohty M, 2010).

      For these reasons, there is great interest in identifying effective therapies for
      corticosteroid-resistant aGvHD and improve outcomes.

      Recently, ruxolitinib (JakafiÂ®), which has an Orphan Drug status in the USA, was granted an
      approval on 24 May 2019 from the FDA based on study INCB 18424-271 (NCT02953678). This
      open-label, single-arm study enrolled 72 grade 2-4 SR-aGvHD patients who were treated with 5
      mg (possibly increased to 10mg) ruxolitinib b.d. Of the 72 patients, 49 were included in the
      efficacy evaluation that led the FDA to grant market authorization. Of these 49 patients,
      Overall Response Rate (ORR - Complete + Very Good Partial + Partial Responses) after 28 days
      was 100%, 40.7% and 44.4% for patients with Grade 2, Grade 3, and Grade 4 aGVHD respectively.
      The overall survival (OS) estimate at 6 months was 51.0% for the entire cohort.

      The more recent REACH2 phase 3 randomized trial (NCT02913261) investigating ruxolitinib
      versus best available therapy in patients with corticosteroid-refractory acute GVHD has
      further established the role of ruxolitinib in the treatment of corticosteroid-refractory
      acute GvHD. The ORR at day 28 was higher in the ruxolitinib than in the control group (62%
      versus 39%; odds ratio, 2.64; 95%CI, 1.65-4.22; P<0.001). Similarly, the durable overall
      response at day 56 was higher in the ruxolitinib than in the control group (40% versus 22%;
      odds ratio, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.43-3.94; P<0.001) (Zeiser R, 2020) In the REACH1 and REACH2
      trials, 45% and 38% of patients, failed to respond to ruxolitinib at day 28, respectively.
      Moreover, in the REACH2 trial, the overall response at day 56 after initiation of therapy
      decreased from 62.3% at D28 after initiation of therapy to 39.4% at D56, suggesting a clear
      unmet medical need for those patients who failed to respond at D28, or worsened afterwards
      (Zeiser R. 2020). More importantly, results from the REACH1 trial showed only a 22%
      probability of survival at 2 months in ruxolitinib-non responder patients (Jagasia 2020).

      MaaT013 is made of allogeneic, full-ecosystem pooled biotherapeutic intestinal microbiota
      manufactured by MaaT Pharma in Lyon, France, according to GMP requirements. The intestinal
      microbiota material in its natural environment is derived from healthy, strictly-vetted and
      selected donors, following the European consensus recommendations (Cammarota 2016) with the
      purpose of minimizing the risk associated with fecal material transplants (FMT) for clinical
      research. Thus, prior to donation, donors undergo a thorough medical evaluation and
      laboratory screening including SARS-CoV-2 detection, to avoid any known contamination risk.
      MaaT013 is administered as an enema.

      MaaT013 showed interesting results in steroids and ruxolitinib-resistant aGVHD patients with
      gut involvement (55% ORR at D28) and 47% and 39% OS at 6 and 12 months respectively (Malard
      2020), therefore warrant being tested as salvage therapy in steroid and JAK
      inhibitors-resistant GI-aGvHD patients. Given the absence of an approved 3rd line strategy or
      2nd line strategy in ruxolitinib intolerant patients and the extremely poor prognosis of
      these patients, who are mostly left with no viable therapeutic option, a single-arm
      open-label design was proposed.
