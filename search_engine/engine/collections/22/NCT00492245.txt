      complication after the infection wich is corneal infiltration. Topical treatment sometimes
      helps to avoid loss of visual acuity. Therefore recurrence of the opacities after topical
      drops is observed. When corneal fibrosis occur is difficult to achieve visual rehabilitation
      with topical approach. This study evaluate pre and postoperative data of patients with
      subepithelial fibrosis caused by adenoviral infiltrates submitted to phototherapeutic
      keratectomy (PTK) using mitomycin C.
