      interaction and communication between parents and children. Healthy eating and physical
      activity were also promoted. The drama project conducted 100 drama performances (either in
      the long or short version) in primary schools during the 2015-16 school year. The main
      targets were Primary 3 to 5 (P3-5) students and their families. Students would take home a
      DVD of the drama to watch and worksheets to complete with parents and other family members.

      The goals of the study were to evaluate the effectiveness of the project to enhance health,
      happiness, harmony (3Hs), healthy eating and physical activity and participants' satisfaction
      levels towards the drama project.

      Quantitative assessments were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the project. Process
      evaluations were performed in randomly selected students, parents and teachers to evaluate
      the process of each component of the program. Qualitative and quantitative assessments were
      used. Students, parents and teachers were asked to express their views on a questionnaire.
      Feedback from students was also collected through small group discussions, while that of
      parents was collected through telephone interviews.
