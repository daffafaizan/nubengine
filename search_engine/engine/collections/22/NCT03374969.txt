      epigenome of young children who have experienced early maltreatment. Families are randomly
      assigned to the experimental condition (Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-Up) or a treatment
      control (Developmental Education for Families). Biological samples and behavioral
      observations of parenting will be collected pre- and post- intervention. Biological samples
      will be used to conduct whole genome analyses of differential DNA methylation that occur as a
      result of the intervention. Behavioral observations of parent-child interactions will be used
      to assess the efficacy of the intervention in altering parenting behaviors.
