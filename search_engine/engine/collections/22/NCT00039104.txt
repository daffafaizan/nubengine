      I. To evaluate the confirmed response rate of hormone refractory prostate cancer patients
      treated with Zometa with BMS-275291.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile associated with this treatment in this patient
      population.

      II. To evaluate the overall and progression-free survival associated with this treatment
      regimen.

      III. To explore changes markers for bone turnover, fPYR, fDPYR, and serum samples for
      cross-linked N-telopeptides from baseline.

      IV. To assess changes in bone tumor metabolism after treatment using PET scans. V. To assess
      changes in MMP-1, MMP-9, VEGF and bFGF from baseline after treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      chemotherapy (yes vs no) and participating center.

      ARM I: Patients receive zoledronate IV over at least 15 minutes on day 1 and oral BMS-275291
      daily on days 1-28.

      ARM II (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL AS OF 10/10/2003): Patients receive zoledronate as in Arm I.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up
      to 2 years.
