      national and international anesthetic guidelines. Thus, hypovolemia is more often then
      anticipated. In awake patients this condition is often masked. Introduction of anesthesia
      often leads to an unmasking of hypovolemia with a consecutive hemodynamic instability.

      Aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that a preoperative volume substitution (8 ml/kg
      RingerAcetate Solution in 15 min. prior to introduction of anesthesia) reduces possible
      hemodynamic instabilities during initiation of anesthesia.
