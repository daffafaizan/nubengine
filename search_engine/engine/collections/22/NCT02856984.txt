      study is to assess the strength of the association between Zika virus infection (ZIKV) during
      pregnancy and adverse maternal/fetal outcomes and the risk of vertical transmission. The
      study will prospectively enroll a cohort of pregnant women up to 17 weeks and 6 days
      gestation and subjects at any gestational age with acute Zika infection, confirmed by
      serology or PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test. The study will follow these women through
      their pregnancy to identify for clinical evidence of acute ZIKV, while controlling for
      potential confounders. Outcomes in the women, the developing fetus, and infants will be
      assessed. All protocol-specified data will be recorded and entered in a central data
      management system for the purposes of analysis of composite data from the study.

      The study will recruit up to10,000 pregnant women in their first trimester from ZIKV-endemic
      regions and follow them longitudinally to study the impact of incident ZIKV during pregnancy
      on maternal, fetal, and newborn outcomes. Researchers will identify cases of incident ZIKV
      among pregnant women by monitoring for symptoms of Zika-like illness and performing serial
      laboratory sampling for diagnosis of seroconversion and viral shedding. After delivery,
      infants born with evidence of ZIKV or born to mothers diagnosed with incident virus infection
      will be followed in a prospective longitudinal cohort for at least 1 year. In addition, a
      control group of infants born to mothers without evidence of ZIKV during pregnancy will be
      followed.
