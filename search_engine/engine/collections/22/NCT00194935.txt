      cycles (every 3 weeks) of carboplatin (AUC 5) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m2). Patients who
      demonstrate a complete clinical response to this regimen will then be treated with topotecan
      consolidation (4 mg/m2 weekly x 8 weeks for one cycle followed by a break in the 9th week)
      for a maximum of 3 cycles. Primary endpoints will be toxicity and the determination of the
      appropriate dose, schedule, and duration of topotecan for further consolidation trials.
