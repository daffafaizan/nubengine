      phenomenon. Thus, acute hypoxia may complicate severe infections including severe sepsis.
      Conversely, healthy persons who ascend to moderately high altitudes, which will be associated
      with a lowering of the inspired oxygen level, may sustain an infection. Even so, it is
      unknown whether hypoxia modifies the systemic inflammatory response, or, conversely, whether
      the reaction to hypoxia is influenced by the presence of systemic inflammation. The present
      protocol aims to measure global cerebral blood flow, metabolism and net flux as well as the
      systemic response in healthy volunteers who are subjected to either normobaric hypoxia alone
      (N=12), low-dose IV endotoxin infusion alone (N=12), or a combination of endotoxin infusion
      and normobaric hypoxia (N=12).
