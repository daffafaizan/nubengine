    
      Primary Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of early administration of vitamin D3
      (cholecalciferol) in reducing mortality and morbidity for vitamin D deficient patients at
      high risk for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and mortality.

      Primary Hypothesis: Early administration of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) will improve
      all-cause, all-location mortality to day 90 in vitamin D deficient patients at high risk for
      ARDS and mortality.

      Methods: Patients were recruited from the emergency departments (EDs), hospital wards,
      operating rooms, intensive care unites (ICUs) and other acute care areas of the participating
      PETAL Network Clinical Centers. Screening included a test for Vitamin D (25OHD) levels using
      either the hospital's clinical laboratory or an FDA-approved point-of-care device (FastPack
      IP, Qualigen Inc). Patients screened as vitamin D deficient (<20 ng/mL) were randomized. Half
      of the randomized patients received an early administration of high-dose vitamin D3 and the
      other half received a placebo. Both active and placebo products were given orally or via
      naso/orogastric tube.

      Rational: Vitamin D has pleiotropic roles in regulating immune function and maintaining
      epithelial surface integrity. Strong preclinical data support the protective role of vitamin
      D in regulating pulmonary inflammation and disruption of the alveolar-capillary membrane that
      are fundamental to ARDS pathogenesis.
