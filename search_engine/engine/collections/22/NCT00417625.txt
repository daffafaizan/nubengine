      Collateral coronary arteries (natural bypasses to the heart) may reduce the accuracy of
      perfusion measured by cardiac MRI.

      We are testing the accuracy of these measurements in subjects undergoing medically necessary
      cardiac catheterization and catheter-based treatment (angioplasty and stenting). We will
      perform special invasive measurements of coronary artery flow and pressure during
      catheterization in order to compare with cardiac MRI.
