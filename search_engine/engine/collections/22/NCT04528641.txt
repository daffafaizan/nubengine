    
      RT-CoV-2 is a Phase I, open-label, dose escalation multicenter clinical trial to assess
      safety and immunogenicity of the candidate Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine GRAd-COV2
      in Italian healthy volunteers aged 18-55 years and 65-85 years inclusive. GRAd-COV2 is based
      on a novel replication defective Gorilla Adenovirus and encodes for SARS-COV-2 full length
      prefusion stabilized Spike protein. GRAd-COV2 is developed and manufactured by ReiThera Srl.

      This study will evaluate a singular intramuscular administration of GRAd-COV2 at 3 dose
      levels: 5e10, 1e11, 2e11viral particles (vp). There will be 6 study arms for a total of 90
      healthy volunteers, divided into 2 cohorts of age, 18-55y and 65-85y, respectively.

      Participants will be followed up for 24 weeks after vaccination. Follow up includes safety
      and immunogenicity assessment. Follow up visits will occur at day2, then 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24
      weeks after vaccination.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of a single dose
      vaccination schedule of GRAd-COV2 across 3 dosages in healthy younger and older adults. The
      secondary objective is to evaluate humoral and cellular immunogenicity.
