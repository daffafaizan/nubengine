        -  Determine whether layered membrane technology can quantitatively measure the expression,
           activity, and localization of cell growth control and signaling proteins in hair samples
           from patients with cancer.

        -  Correlate changes in protein expression with expected changes based on planned therapy
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, multicenter study.

      Hair samples are obtained from patients at baseline and at the end of study. The samples are
      assayed for proteins and phosphorylation status using layered membrane technology. Proteins
      analyzed may include vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), Erk1/2, Akt,
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and c-KIT.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 190 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
