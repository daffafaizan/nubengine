      visceral and referring (shoulder) pain. Although intensities of them can be various, all of
      them affects the total pain together. Unintentional liver cauterization during laparoscopic
      cholecystectomy is unwanted, but sometimes unavoidable complication/process. However its
      effect on postoperative pain is not studied with detail in literature.
