      active role in their treatment and recovery. Quitting tobacco use decreases cancer patients'
      risk of disease recurrence and development of second primary cancers. In addition,
      preoperative tobacco cessation may reduce the likelihood of perioperative pulmonary,
      cardiovascular, and wound healing complications. Due to increased awareness of the health
      hazards of tobacco use, rates of cessation after cancer diagnosis are high. However, 35% to
      69% of patients continue to use tobacco and this is largely due to strong barriers to
      quitting (low-self efficacy, psychological distress) rather than lack of positive intentions
      to quit. Previous attempts to increase smoking cessation among the medically ill have
      provided intervention either during or after hospitalization.

      We propose that the period immediately prior to hospitalization and surgery represents a
      unique window of opportunity, or "teachable moment," for smoking cessation that could take
      full advantage of patients' enhanced health awareness and quitting motivation, strong
      physician quitting advice, and patients' heightened desire to take an active role in their
      care.
