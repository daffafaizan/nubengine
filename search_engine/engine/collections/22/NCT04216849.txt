      and control group. The volunteers of the experimental group will be given peripheral
      intravenously a dose of 1.5*10^6/kg human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cell (HUC-MSC) at
      0,8,16,24,32 week. The control group will be given the same dose of saline. Then
      centralization visit was conducted every 8 weeks until the 48th week.The primary end points
      include estimated glomerular filtration rate and urinary albumin creatinine ratio(UACR). The
      secondary end points include HbA1C,plasma insulin and C-peptide, and insulin dose.
