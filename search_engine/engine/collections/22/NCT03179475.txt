      chronic pain in individuals with sub-acute and chronic spinal cord injuries. Targin® is
      currently approved for use by Health Canada for the treatment of moderate-to-severe chronic
      pain and will be investigated here for the management of moderate-to-severe chronic pain
      following spinal cord injury. The effectiveness and safety of opioid use for individuals with
      spinal cord injury has yet to be thoroughly investigated. Additionally, individuals with
      spinal cord injury using opioids may have the superimposed effect of neurogenic bowel and
      opioid induced constipation, which may cause increased frequency and severity of autonomic
      dysreflexia episodes, reduced quality of life, depressive symptoms, and discontinuation of
      opioid medication. Targin® has the potential to ameliorate these symptoms and improve
      treatment adherence in individuals with spinal cord injury.
