      macronutrients, water, and electrolytes, so it requires intravenous supplementation such as
      PN and/or intravenous fluids to maintain health and/or growth. IF type II is associated with
      complex infectious and metabolic complications and patients require PN for weeks or months.
      Long-term PN use, however, includes the risk of complications, among which a serious one is
      the intestinal failure-associated liver disease (1). It has been proposed that metabolic
      endotoxemia (2-3), inflammation (4) and oxidative stress (5) are involved in the development
      of this intestinal failure-associated liver disease.

      Although some studies have reported beneficial effects of n-3 PUFA to prevent and reverse the
      liver disease associated with IF (6-7), due to its antioxidant (8-10) and anti-inflammatory
      activity (11-12) and in the modulation of the intestinal microbiota (13), the literature on
      the use of n-3 PUFA in non-critical patients with IF and PN is limited and the results have
      not been conclusive.

      Therefore, a randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect of PN
      supplemented with lipid emulsions containing n-3 PUFA/kg body weight/day for 7 days on
      oxidative stress (concentrations of MDA), compared with a control group (without n-3 PUFA)
      will be performed.
