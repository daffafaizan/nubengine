      (Aminolevulinate-Photodynamic Therapy) treatment of actinic keratoses, to a modified version
      in which light exposure begins immediately after application of the Levulan. We hypothesize
      that this will yield a therapeutic efficacy equivalent to the standard ALA-PDT regimen, but
      will cause less pain during the light exposure. The study employs a bilateral design in which
      the left versus right sides of the treatment area are compared in the exact same patient.
      There are 3 arms of the study, each having a different time duration of light exposure in the
      modified regimen to determine which one is most efficacious
