      because of its hormonal effects as well as its aggressive behavior and dissemination,
      particularly in some hereditary PHEO/PGL. Although several therapeutic modalities have been
      used to palliate malignant PHEO/PGL, a continued search for new agents to address the
      malignancy is needed to improve outcomes. One approach is to utilize drugs that target
      signaling pathways leading to decreased proliferation and survival of cancer cells. Some data
      in the literature suggests that in malignant PHEO/PGL, VEGF seems to play a role in the
      biology of the cancer and thus, its inhibition could reduce tumor growth. Sunitinib and
      imatinib has been used in a limited number of malignant pheochromocytomas with varying
      responses. Axitinib was designed to inhibit VEGFR that participates in tumor angiogenesis. In
      order to determine the activity of axitinib in tumor and hormonal responses in malignant
      PHEO/PGL, it will be used as a single agent in this study. The combination of
      cyclophosphamide; vincristine and dacarbazine have been shown to produce partial responses in
      malignant PHEO/PGL. The majority of the patients may have already received this combination
      or will receive this combination chemotherapy in the future. The goal is to develop multiple
      lines of effective treatments for this disease.
