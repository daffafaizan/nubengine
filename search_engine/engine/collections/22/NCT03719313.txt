    
      This partially double-blind, randomized study will employ a matrix (factorial) design to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of LNF 50 mg/RTV 100 mg twice per day (BID) with and without
      PEG IFN-alfa-2a 180 mcg once-weekly (QW) for 48 weeks compared to no treatment (placebo LNF
      and placebo RTV) in patients chronically infected with hepatitis delta virus (HDV) and
      receiving anti-HBV (hepatitis B virus) nucleos(t)ide maintenance therapy.

      Approximately 400 patients will be randomized with an allocation ratio of 7:5:2:2 All
      patients will receive/maintain background anti-HBV nucleos(t)ide therapy with entecavir or
      tenofovir for at least 12 weeks prior to initiating study therapy.

      All patients who complete 48 weeks of treatment will have a liver biopsy for histology
      assessment at EOT and will be followed for an additional 24 weeks off study treatment.
