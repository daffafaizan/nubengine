      I. To determine the objective response (complete and partial) to E7389 in patients with
      locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma that progressed after
      prior gemcitabine hydrochloride-based therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine the antitumor activity of E7389, in terms of median survival, 1-year survival
      rate, response or stable disease duration, toxicity, and time to disease progression, in
      these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients receive eribulin mesylate IV on
      days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, all patients are followed at 4 weeks. Patients with
      complete response, partial response, or stable disease are followed every 3 months.
