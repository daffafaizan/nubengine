      stimuli but seems to extend to non-painful stimuli as well. These stimuli include smell,
      taste, touch, light, and sound. This study will provide detailed QST examinations of FM
      subjects and controls' responses to light using visually evoked potentials (VEP). In
      addition, careful characterization of experimental pain responding across multiple sensory
      modalities will be examined.
