      / Interstitial fluid (ISF) flux through cerebral parenchyma for removal of byproducts of
      cellular metabolism and hence in maintaining the health of the brain. It remains unknown to
      what extent these phenomena exist in the human brain. A key challenge in this work is to make
      non-invasive and reproducible measurements of the cerebral microenvironment in humans. For
      these studies, the investigators have implemented a suite of MRI measurements to track
      physiological changes in the brain during sleep. This exploratory work aims to establish the
      sensitivity and reproducibility of MRI as a non-invasive neuroimaging assessment of cerebral
      changes during natural sleep and sedation. The long term goal of this work is to use MRI as
      an imaging biomarker to assess the cerebral response to normal versus disordered sleep in
      patients.

      Our specific aims will address the following questions:

      Aim 1: How sensitive are MRI metrics for determining changes in the brain during sleep?

      Aim 2: How reproducible are MRI metrics during sleep and during sedation?

      The investigators will recruit 12 normal adult subjects for this study (consecutive
      respondees to recruitment adverts). The investigators will make regional MRI measurements
      during onset, maintenance and waking from stage N2 sleep. From these the investigators will
      characterize which MRI metrics are most sensitive to changes in the cerebral environment, and
      how these vary for different cerebral regions.

      Measurements will be repeated during ~90 minutes of natural sleep, and following oral
      sedation with 10 mg zaleplon (Sonata).
