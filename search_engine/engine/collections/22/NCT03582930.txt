      time RDS is diagnosed if a patient is <12 hours of age and has not previously received liquid
      surfactant, or is <24 hours of age, and received liquid surfactant in the first hour after
      birth, was extubated and RDS is worsening. Parents must give informed consent. Up to 2 repeat
      doses of aerosolized Infasurf can be administered. Aerosolized Infasurf must be administered
      as described in the protocol. Adverse events at administration (if any) and all serious
      adverse events related or possibly related the aerosolized Infasurf therapy will be extracted
      from the medical record and reported to the sponsor, ONY Biotech. A copy of the discharge
      summary of patients will be collected by the sponsor using HIPAA compliant methodology for
      generation of a data set that will characterize adverse events and other efficacy and safety
      data.
