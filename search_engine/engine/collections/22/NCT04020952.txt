    
      Three working archwires of different gauges will be used during canine retraction; st.st
      0.019×0.025" as a comparator, st.st 0.016×0.022" and st.st 0.017×0.025" wires as
      interventions. after levelling and alignment till reaching the working archwire, it will be
      left in place for a month then maxillary first premolars will be extracted and base line
      records will be taken(digital models, digital periapical radiographs and panorama). digital
      models will be taken monthly to measure rate of canine retraction for 6 months. after 6 month
      evaluation of anchorage loss, change in canine tip and torque will be done on last obtained
      digital model , panorama will be taken to evaluate the change in canine tip and digital
      periapical radiograph will be taken and compared with the preretraction radiograph to
      evaluate amount of root resorption.
