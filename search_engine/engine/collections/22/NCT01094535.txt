      perioperative mortality rates have declined in recent years, pancreatectomy is still
      associated with significant postoperative malnutrition, maldigestion, and glucose
      intolerance, mostly as a result of pancreatic insufficiency. Quantifying residual pancreatic
      function remains a challenge, but is essential in improving the survival and quality of life
      of pancreatic cancer patients. Secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography
      (S-MRCP)has recently emerged as a widely-accepted noninvasive technique to assess
      morphological changes in the pancreatic ducts, as well as functional secretory capacity of
      the gland. The aim of our study is to evaluate S-MRCP as a means to assess pancreatic reserve
      in patients who will undergoing surgical resection for pancreatic carcinoma. As an adjunct to
      S-MRCP, we will also evaluate the concomitant use of dynamic MRI with contrast enhancement.
      This will be a prospective study of twelve patients who will undergo S-MRCP/MRI within 30
      days of surgery and then at 3, 6, and 12 months post-operatively. Quantitative analysis of
      S-MRCP will include pancreatic duct diameter and volume before and after secretin
      administration. MRI will be analyzed for mean T1 signal intensity, total parenchymal volume,
      and gadolinium enhancement. These radiological parameters will be compared to clinical
      parameters of exocrine function(subjective reporting of steatorrhea and abdominal pain as
      well as levels of fecal elastase1 and fat soluble vitamins in stool samples) as well as
      endocrine function (fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, amylin, glucagon, and somatostatin
      levels, as well as arginine-stimulated levels of islet cell hormones).
