    
      All patients who are evaluated by one of three Shoulder/Elbow Fellowship-trained surgeons at
      Washington University Department of Orthopedic Surgery and who meet the inclusion criteria
      will be offered enrollment in the study. Following consent the participant will be asked to
      undergo an exam of the shoulder and complete questionnaires related to shoulder pain and
      function.

      Demographic information, health history related to the affected shoulder, and co-morbidity
      data will also be collected preoperatively.

      Patients will be randomized to either a simple, standardized home exercise program or a
      supervised physiotherapy program administered by a physical therapist after undergoing a
      standardized operative protocol for reverse total shoulder arthroplasty.

      Post-operative range of motion will be measured in a blinded fashion at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6
      months, and 12 months. A blinded observer will simultaneously measure validated functional
      outcomes scores including the Western Ontario Osteoarthritis Score, American Shoulder and
      Elbow Surgeons Score and Visual Analogue Score for pain pre-operatively and at 6 weeks, 3
      months, 6 months, and 12 months post-operatively.
