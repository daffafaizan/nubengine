      celiac disease (CD) or gluten sensitivity (GS).

      Study population: We plan to study 15 patients with CD and ataxia, 15 patients with
      hereditary ataxia, and 30 healthy matched controls.

      Design: Four groups of patients will be enrolled into the study. The first group will consist
      of patients with CD and ataxia, the second group will consist of CD patients without
      neurological manifestations, the third group will consist of patients with hereditary
      cerebellar ataxia without CD, and the final group will consist of healthy 30 race matched
      volunteers. The second group will not be recruited at the NIH. Standardized enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques will used to assess the presence of synapsin I in the
      groups of patients. Using affinity assays, cross-reactivity of antibodies to gliadin and
      synapsin 1 will be evaluated. Antibody epitope mapping will be performed on those antibodies
      that cross-react with synapsin 1 and gliadin. HLA class II genotypic and phenotypic
      frequencies will be assessed and compared with the matched volunteers as an exploratory
      measure to look for genetic risk and protective factors in this group of patients.

      Outcome measures: our outcome measures are as follows:

      A. To determine whether there is an association between antibody reactivity to synapsin I and
      neurological deficits of CD/GS.

      B. To characterize the cross-reactive antibodies in patients by determining subclass and
      affinity

      C. To map the epitope(s) of synapsin I that are targeted in patients with cross-reactive
      antibodies

      D. To explore HLA association in the subset of patients with CD and ataxia
