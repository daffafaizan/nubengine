      diabetes (T2D) and n=10 healthy controls. Participants will wear two accelerometers and a
      continuous glucose monitor (CGM) for two different periods of 7 days for objective assessment
      of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and blood glucose, respectively, and complete a
      graded exercise test (cardiorespiratory fitness), assessment of insulin sensitivity
      (hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) and single leg exercise using near-infrared spectroscopy
      (microvascular function). Participants will also complete a semi-structured qualitative
      interview to understand knowledge and attitudes toward sedentary behavior and questionnaires
      to assess the relationship between modifiable psychological and behavioral factors and
      sedentary behavior.

      The aims of the study are to:

        1. Compare objectively-measured, free-living physical activity and sedentary behavior
           between older women with and without T2D.

        2. Evaluate the relationship between prolonged bouts of sedentary behavior,
           cardiorespiratory fitness, glucose control, insulin sensitivity, and skeletal muscle
           microvascular function in older women with and without T2D.

        3. Assess knowledge and attitudes toward sedentary behavior and characterize the
           relationship between knowledge and attitudes toward sedentary behavior and modifiable
           psychological and behavioral factors in older women with T2D.

        4. Evaluate the relationship between sedentary behavior, mood states, and meaning salience
           during "normal" life and the period of confinement imposed by the COVID-19 epidemic.
