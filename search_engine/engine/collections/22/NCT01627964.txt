      cardiac images. Twenty patients who have both cardiac catheterization ventriculography and
      cardiac echo studies will be randomly selected. Cardiac catheterization ventriculography of
      the selected patients were taken from our hospital's PACS system. The investigators remove
      the patient information on the images, and use the image for motion analysis and assessment.
      The results will be compared and correlated with their cardiac echo, which could validate the
      clinical usefulness of the software.
