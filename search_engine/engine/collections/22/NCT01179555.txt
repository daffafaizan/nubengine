      on eye care adherence and comparing the efficacy of the intervention to usual care and
      automated telephone screenings.

      Glaucoma is a group of chronic, neurodegenerative diseases of the optic nerve, which leads to
      an increase in intraocular pressure, gradual changes in the visual field (VF), and
      progressive vision loss. Glaucomatous vision loss is preventable with proper eye care,
      including adherence to follow-up appointments and medications. Interventions that improve
      appointment adherence have the potential to prevent more severe glaucomatous disease. The
      primary purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy of a multifaceted intervention
      system, which includes a customized letter and personal telephone outreach, in improving
      appointment adherence in patients with glaucoma. In order to improve strategies to reduce the
      rate of appointment non-adherence, shared characteristics of adherent versus non-adherent
      patients with glaucoma will be identified and compared to patient characteristics in the
      previous literature. A secondary goal of this study is to analyze the cost-effectiveness of
      this multifaceted intervention on appointment adherence in patients with glaucoma.
