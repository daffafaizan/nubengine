      Primary

        -  To determine the safety and tolerance of Ad5CMV-NIS administered intraprostatically
           followed by radioiodine treatment in patients with locally recurrent adenocarcinoma of
           the prostate following external beam radiotherapy.

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of Ad5CMV-NIS in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the PSA response rates, duration, and time to PSA progression in these
           patients.

        -  To evaluate the immune response to Ad5CMV-NIS.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Ad5CMV-NIS.

      Patients receive intraprostate Ad5CMV-NIS, via transperineal injection under anesthesia, on
      day 1. They receive dosimetry oral iodine I 123 on day 4 and undergo image studies
      periodically for the next 24 hours for measurement of radioiodine uptake. Patients receive
      therapeutic oral iodine I 131 on day 5.

      All patients with intact thyroid glands (i.e., not previously surgically removed or ablated)
      receive TSH suppressive doses of oral liothyronine sodium 3 times daily for 10 days prior and
      for 15 days post administration of iodine I 123.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for measurement of PSA, fT4, and TSH; and peripheral
      blood cells are monitored for evidence of virus DNA via quantitative
      reverse-transcriptase-PCR.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4
      months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 8 years. A transrectal tumor biopsy is to be
      performed at 3 months and 1 year post-treatment.
