      transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block versus sham block has a substantial impact on pain
      following open inguinal hernia repair. Our primary outcome is to determine whether there will
      be a difference in opioid consumption within the first two days following surgery. Secondary
      outcomes will include: pain scores and activity assessment score.
