      improvement between 1999 and 2007. Potential advantages of the centralization of care and the
      discussion of treatment strategies in multidisciplinary teams, as suggested in other
      studies,13 require further research. However, the priorities should be to prevent lung cancer
      by implementing anti-smoking policies and controlling asbestos exposure throughout Europe,
      such as was recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2008.14 Other priorities
      are to reduce levels of residential radon in risk areas, and early diagnosis to improve the
      results of surgery, which is still the main curative treatment.

      The variability in the diagnostic process, treatment and advocacy, as well as the anticipated
      increase in associated mortality in Spain in coming years, has stimulated the creation of an
      epidemiological, observational, multicenter study of cases of lung cancer and other thoracic
      tumors diagnosed and treated by medical personnel, including both thoracic surgeons and
      medical oncologists. Data from this study will be collected retrospectively and
      prospectively, so as to enable an extensive study of the epidemiological and therapeutic
      factors related to the disease.
