    
      Patients diagnosed with solid malignancies or metastatic lesions who require clinically
      indicated resection will be identified by their Oncologist. The oncologist will inform the
      subject/family about the study and ask if they may be interested in participating. If the
      subject/family demonstrates potential interest in the study, the Pediatric Surgery Research
      team will discuss the risks and benefits of pre-operative ICG administration with the
      patients and enrollment.

      Study subjects: All patients diagnosed with solid malignancies as well as those with
      metastatic disease distant from the primary tumor will be potentially eligible for the study.
      Diagnosis will be made:

        1. In a multimodal fashion including physical exam, radiologic evaluation (ultrasound, MRI,
           CT scan, etc), and sometimes biopsy.

        2. Prior to definitive surgical resection of the newly diagnosed malignancy
