    
      This is a multicenter prospective double blind placebo controlled dose escalation safety
      clinical trial with brentuximab vedotin and stable background immunosuppressive therapy in
      adult individuals with Diffuse Cutaneous Systemic Sclerosis (dcSSc). Adult male and female
      participants with dcSSc will be recruited by a collaborative group of clinical sites in the
      United States. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled without regard
      to gender, race, or ethnicity.

      Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to study treatment, either brentuximab
      vedotin or placebo equivalent in a 6:2 ratio favoring brentuximab vedotin. Three dose cohorts
      are planned with 8 participants in each cohort, for a total of 24 participants who receive
      sufficient doses of the investigational medication to assess safety.

      The doses planned for each ascending dose cohort include 0.6mg/kg, 1.2 mg/kg, and 1.8 mg/kg
      brentuximab vedotin or placebo equivalent. All cohorts will receive intravenous
      administration of study medication every 3 weeks for 21 weeks, for a total of eight doses.
      Following completion of treatment, participants will undergo follow-up visits at weeks 24,
      28, 36 and 48.
