      in Department of General Surgery, Peking University Third Hospital were collected. The
      indication for the performance of the first and second ALPPS was evaluated by
      multi-disciplinary team (MDT). The liver function evaluation indexes of Gd-EOB-DTPA Enhanced
      liver MRI such as RE (Relative enhancement of the liver)=（SI20min-SIunenhanced）/ SIunenhanced
      and other related indexes were calculated. SI referred to signal intensity. SI20 min referred
      to the signal intensity in the hepatocyte phase (20 min after the injection). The
      relationship between the indexes and postoperative liver failure as well as other
      complications were analyzed.
