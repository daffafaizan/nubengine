      and it is 1 of the 5 most prevalent childhood disorders. Mind and body approaches can
      significantly help these youth, but getting access to this type of treatment is a challenge
      for families. Our mind and body study will test a mind and body intervention package
      delivered by health care professionals (i.e., nurses) introducing coping skills to youth ages
      10 to 17 that have migraine.

      Using a factorial design and the multiphase optimization strategy "MOST", in this study we
      are able to evaluate different doses of 3 treatment components (1. Duration of mind and body
      skill introduction session; 2. Home practice support intensity; and 3. Adherence prompt phone
      call) in one project. A screening experiment will be conducted to determine the dose of each
      treatment component for future evaluation of the optimized intervention package in a
      pragmatic or SMART trial.
