      questionaires as well as functional outcome, oncological outcome and toxicity in patients
      treated with definitive chemoradiation for anal cancer. Qol will be evaluated by standardized
      EORTC questionaires QLQ C30 and QLQ CR29. Acute and late toxicity will be assessed according
      to CTCAE 4.03. Oncological outcome will be assessed with regard to local and distant control,
      patterns of recurrence, freedom from treatment failure and overall survival. Correlations of
      physicians- and patients-assessed functional outcomes are planned.
