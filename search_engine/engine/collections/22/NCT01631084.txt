    
      Rationale: Change of practice environment and an interdisciplinary team is needed to
      implement evidence-based diabetes care which requires risk stratification, periodic
      assessments, education and treatment to targets.

      Hypothesis: The use of a web-based disease management program (Joint Asia Diabetes Evaluation
      (JADE) Program) delivered by a doctor-nurse-HCA team reduces the incidence of all
      diabetes-associated clinical endpoint and improves control of risk factors compared to usual
      care (DIAbetes MONitoring Database (DIAMOND) group) in type 2 diabetes.

      Objective: To compare structured care using the JADE portal versus usual care using the
      DIAMOND portal on incidence of all-diabetes related events, physical and psychological
      health.

      Study design: A multicentre, randomized, integrated disease management program Setting and
      patients: 600 patients from each site will be randomized to the JADE group (n=300) or the
      DIAMOND group (n=300) and followed up for at least 24 months.

      Intervention: All patients will undergo comprehensive assessment (CA) guided by the templates
      in the respective portal at baseline, month 12 and 24. The JADE group will be further managed
      by a doctor-nurse-HCA team guided by the JADE portal with risk stratification program and
      recommendation to different care protocols with predefined follow up (FU) schedules,
      information sharing and decision supports.

      Outcome measures: Primary composite outcomes include all diabetes-related clinical events;
      secondary composite outcomes include control of risk factors and tertiary composite outcomes
      include behavioral changes, psychological health, quality of life and cost-effective
      analysis.
