      development of type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Takeda is developing SYR-322 (alogliptin) for the improvement of glycemic control in patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Alogliptin is an inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV
      (DPP-IV) enzyme. DPP-IV is thought to be primarily responsible for the degradation of 2
      peptide hormones released in response to nutrient ingestion. It is expected that inhibition
      of DPP-IV will improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      In Japan, α-glucosidase inhibitors are widely used as a first-line treatment for type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Because alogliptin has a different mechanism of action compared to
      α-glucosidase inhibitors, the study evaluated the efficacy and safety of alogliptin combined
      with an α-glucosidase inhibitor in type 2 diabetic patients with uncontrolled blood glucose
      while taking a α-glucosidase inhibitor and receiving diet and/or exercise therapies.

      To evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of the concomitant use of alogliptin and an
      α-glucosidase inhibitor, subjects who participated in the present study could enter a
      long-term extension study SYR-322/OCT-003 (NCT01263509) that was planned separately.
