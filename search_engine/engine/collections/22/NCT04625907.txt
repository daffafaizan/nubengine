    
      FaR-RMS is an over-arching study for children and adults with newly diagnosed and relapsed
      rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS). It is a multi-arm, multi-stage format, involving several different
      trial questions. FaR-RMS is intended to be a rolling programme of research with new treatment
      arms being introduced dependant on emerging data and innovation. This study has multiple
      aims. It aims to evaluate the impact of new agent regimens in both newly diagnosed and
      relapsed RMS; whether changing the duration of maintenance therapy affects outcome; and
      whether changes to dose, extent (in metastatic disease) and timing of radiotherapy improve
      outcome and quality of life. In addition the study will evaluate risk stratification through
      the use of PAX-FOXO1 fusion gene status instead of histological subtyping and explore the use
      of FDG PET-CT response assessment as a prognostic biomarker for outcome following induction
      chemotherapy.

      Newly diagnosed patients should, where possible, be entered into the FaR-RMS study at the
      time of first diagnosis prior to receiving any chemotherapy. However, patients can enter at
      the point of radiotherapy or maintenance, and those with relapsed disease can enter the study
      even if not previously entered at initial diagnosis. Patients may be entered into more than
      one randomisation/registration, dependant on patient risk group and disease status.
