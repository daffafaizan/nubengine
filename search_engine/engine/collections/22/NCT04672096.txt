    
      The proposed study is a prospective, single-center, single-arm, non-randomized design. Up to
      10 study subjects will be provided with the placement of an Injectrode insert. The maximal
      placement duration will be 28 days. Subjects selected to participate in the trial are healthy
      without any preexisting condition indicated to be treated. Each subject will be followed
      during the trial period of approximately 50 days, including the time for screening and
      post-explant follow-up. The study will end when the last subject has completed the trial
      period and exited. After exit from the clinical study, subjects will continue to be followed
      by their physician per standard of care. All device and procedure-related adverse events
      (AEs) and unanticipated problems (UPs) will be collected and reported per the study protocol.
