    
      This is a single institutional, single-arm, phase II trial to assess the local control rate
      of oligo-metastatic or oligo-progressive lymph node treated by stereotactic ablative
      radiotherapy at 1 year.

      Patients with pathologically proven non-hematopoietic malignancy patients with radiographic
      evidence of evaluable regional recurrent, oligo-metastatic or oligo-progressive lymph nodes
      are eligible for enrolment.

      Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy:

      The lymph node planning target volume (PTV) will receive the prescribed dose according to the
      assigned treatment group. The dose is prescribed such as 90-95% of PTV is covered by the
      prescription dose. If the critical structures exceed the defined dose limitation, a dose
      reduction method is applied as protocol defined. Dose inhomogeneity can exist within the
      clinical target volume (CTV).

      Treatment will be delivered in six fractions to the target volume and given once per day, 2-3
      fractions per week with no more than 2 daily consecutive fractions, over 2 to 2.5 weeks.

      Target Radiation Dose: SABR with 45 Gy in six fractions to the defined target volume with met
      organ-at-risk constraint criteria using intensity modulated radiotherapy or volumetric
      modulated arc therapy (VMAT or RapidArc).

      Radiation Dose Reduction:

      Reduced Dose 10%: SABR with 40.05 Gy in six fractions to the defined target volume with met
      organ-at-risk constraint criteria

      Reduced Dose 20%: SABR with 36 Gy in six fractions to the defined target volume with met
      organ-at-risk constraint criteria
