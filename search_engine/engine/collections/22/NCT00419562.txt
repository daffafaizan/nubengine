    
      Eligible participants will be randomized to receive either oral insulin (7.5 mg of
      recombinant human insulin crystals) or placebo daily.

      All participants randomized into this study will be seen at a study site for a follow-up
      evaluation, three and six months after randomization, and every six months thereafter.
      Participants will be contacted by phone between 6-monthly clinic visits to assess changes in
      diabetes status, medication compliance and adverse events. These phone contacts will occur
      approximately 3 months from the date of the participants previous clinic visit.

      At the study visits, participants will undergo assessments of their insulin production,
      immunologic status, and overall health. As the primary outcome measure, subjects will be
      followed until development of type 1 diabetes or the conclusion of the study. The trial is
      expected to last approximately 7-8 years or until the required amount of information is
      gathered.
