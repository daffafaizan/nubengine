    
      Patients with late fibrovascular sequelae of radiation or of combined radiation and surgery,
      with quantifiable symptomatology or disability, will be eligible for this trial. This
      protocol is designed as an open label one arm study. (A placebo controlled randomized trial
      was approved by the IRB but after extensive negotiation, drug and placebo in slow release
      formulation will not be provided by the manufacturer). Up to fifty patients will be
      recruited. After initial assessment of their condition by specified clinical and laboratory
      parameters, each of the patients will be treated for 8 weeks at the standard pentoxifylline
      dose (400 mg po TID). Objective and subjective response parameters will be re-assessed at the
      end of the treatment and 8 weeks later for possible decay of response.

      In addition to symptomatic objective and subjective response, blood and urine will be
      collected for TNF, TGF-beta, and FGF. Cutaneous blood flow and collagen subtyping will be
      performed on a subset of patients using Laser Doppler, functional MRI techniques and
      subcutaneous tissue biopsies. We will examine for correlation between clinical response and
      these biological responses.
