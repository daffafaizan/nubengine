      large group of patients with first episode psychosis achieve remission of psychotic symptoms
      during first year after initial contact with mental health services, almost one third
      continue having psychotic symptoms in spite of treatment with antipsychotic medication. Since
      auditory hallucinations are a major cause of distress and suffering for these patients, there
      is an essential need to test the effectives of targeted psychotherapeutic interventions in
      alleviating auditory hallucinations Two previous trials have provided preliminary evidence of
      the effectiveness of avatar therapy on auditory hallucinations, but no trial to date has
      examined the effect of virtual reality assisted avatar therapy in an adequately powered RCT.
      In this large-scale randomized, clinical trial, patients in the experimental intervention
      will be receiving 7 sessions of virtual reality assisted avatar therapy while patients in the
      TAU group will receive 7 sessions of supportive contact with mental health care professionals
      at their regular outpatient clinic.

      If the virtual reality avatar therapy is found to be beneficial in reducing the severity of
      refractory auditory hallucinations, it will be a breakthrough in the current treatment of
      psychotic disorders. A large group of patients with schizophrenia and related disorders in
      Denmark and worldwide will be the target group of the therapy. If proven effective, the
      treatment will be especially relevant for patients with treatment resistant schizophrenia,
      but the treatment can also be used as an add on to antipsychotic medication for patients with
      a better prognosis, such as patients with first episode psychosis. If the virtual avatar
      therapy is proven effective, it can be implemented in mental health services all over Denmark
      and internationally. A successful implementation will substantially reduce the costs
      associated with treatment of schizophrenia.
