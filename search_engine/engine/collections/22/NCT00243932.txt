      disorder. Available treatment for ALS remains scarce. Oxidative stress and mitochondrial
      dysfunction have been implicated in the pathophysiology of ALS. Oxidative stress refers to
      the effects of cell-damaging reactive oxygen species, also known as free radicals. Oxidative
      stress is thought to contribute to nerve cell loss in ALS. Mitochondria are organelles within
      each cell that are sometimes called "powerhouses of the cell" because cellular energy
      metabolism is located within the mitochondria.

      Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10), a mitochondrial cofactor known for its antioxidant properties, has
      prolonged survival in the mouse model of ALS and has slowed functional decline in another
      neurodegenerative disorder, Parkinson's disease. The goals of this double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, two-dose comparison phase II study are to obtain preliminary efficacy
      data and to select the preferred dose for a larger phase III study.

      Participants were randomly assigned to CoQ10 (at two different dose levels) or placebo in the
      first stage, then the 2,700 mg dose was selected in the second stage. Duration of the trial
      was 9 months with a total of 7 visits.
