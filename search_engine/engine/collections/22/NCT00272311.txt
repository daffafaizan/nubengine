      patients who have survived a prior event as well as during an acute heart attack. Aspirin
      also prevents a first heart attack.

      Low dose aspirin is sufficient to achieve complete inhibition of platelet aggregability, or
      stickiness, and this is the mechanism whereby aspirin prevents formation of blood clots.

      Our research is designed to explore whether higher doses of aspirin provide additional
      benefits on markers of atherosclerosis.
