      the United States is focused on cancer. Whether the CAM use is aimed at reducing one's risk
      of developing cancer or improving the quality of life of a cancer patient during treatment or
      at the end of life, the public focus on CAM and cancer has created a driving force for cancer
      centers to address the efficacy and science of these methods.

      Currently, the majority of cancer patients do not receive adequate palliative care.
      Acupuncture has been shown to be effective in the treatment of pain and nausea and has also
      been shown to improve one's general well-being. Acupuncture also has some effectiveness in
      relieving symptoms of anxiety and depression. This study will evaluate the efficacy of
      acupuncture by Traditional Chinese Medicine clinicians to address the quality of life and
      symptoms of patients with incurable cancer.

      Women with recurrent metastatic ovarian cancer and similar patients with advanced cancer who
      are ambulatory and receiving conventional palliative care will be enrolled in this study.
      Patients will continue to receive high-quality, conventional clinical interventions,
      including chemotherapy and pain and symptom reduction programs. Patients will also receive 8
      weeks of acupuncture. Evaluation tools such as Satisfaction with Life Domains Scale for
      Cancer (SLDS-C), Brief Pain Inventory, and Rotterdam Symptom Check List will be used to
      assess the acupuncture intervention.
