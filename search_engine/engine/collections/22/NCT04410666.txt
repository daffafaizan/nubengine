      multifactorial and originates from the formation of the bacterial plaque and its
      non-elimination by physical and chemical hygiene methods.

      The use of chemical agents to aid in the control of Bacterial Plaque has been the subject of
      study in many investigations. Today there is a variety of elements that can be use to carry
      out proper oral hygiene, such as toothbrushes, toothpastes, dental floss and mouthwash, all
      of them in a wide variety.

      Often the lack of accessibility to these means problems in the hygiene in the population,
      either due to the lack of knowledge or the cost of obtaining them.

      Therefore, the objective of analyzing the antibacterial effect of the infusion of green tea
      (camellia sinensis) used as a mouthwash on saliva and bacterial plaque was presented. The
      proposed research topic is relevant, since if green tea (camellia sinensis) is found to
      produce positive effects on bacterial plaque, it would serve to prevent its formation, thus
      helping to improve dental hygiene with an easy acquisition product and lower cost compared to
      other mouthwashes offered in the market, constituting a natural mouthwash.
