    
      This is a randomized, comparative, pilot study, which will compare two treatments:
      acupuncture treatment vs. treatment with motilium in 30 diabetic patients with impaired
      glucose control and gastroparesis.

      All patients who meet inclusion criteria will undergo gastric scintigraphy and upper
      endoscopy to assess the presence of gastroparesis and to rule out gastric outlet obstruction.
      At baseline, all enrolled patients will fill out the Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index
      (GCSI), the Quality of life questionnaire (SF-36). Subsequently, patients will be randomized
      to 20 mg motilium thrice daily and after 1 month wash-out period to acupuncture treatment,
      each treatment will last 12 weeks.

      After treatment, patients will undergo a second gastric scintigraphy and will complete the
      GCSI and the SF-36.

      Fasting blood glucose concentrations and HbA1c levels will be determined at the beginning and
      at the end of the study and at 6 months later as well.

      End Points:

      Primary: Level of improvement of gastric emptying rate, and improvement in blood glucose
      levels at the end of treatment, in comparison with tests before treatment.

      Secondary: Level of improvement in scores of severity of gastroparesis related symptoms, with
      quality of life indicators, in comparison with tests before treatment; also, the number of
      visits to family doctors/diabetic clinics/emergency rooms, as well as use of the medications
      resulting from diabetic complications will be investigated.
