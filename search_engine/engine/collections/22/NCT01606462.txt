      influenced by a plethora of studies in healthy volunteers, which demonstrated increased
      interpersonal trust, generosity, social learning/empathy and positively biased social
      stimulus processing as a result of OXT treatment. However, this interpretation is challenged
      by observations that OXT also promotes envy and schadenfreude (gloating), ethno-centrism
      (including prejudice, xenophobia, and racial bias), and defensive aggression towards
      outsiders.We investigate the neural correlates of emotion perception and subsequent memory
      effects of aversive and neutral stimuli. Tthe oxytocin effect on personal space is
      questioned. Additionally the effect of OXTR polymorphism regarding behavioral and neural
      response is explored.
