      beta-cell destruction in type 1 diabetes is typically associated with T-lymphocyte
      autoimmunity.

      Many T-lymphocyte-mediated diseases include a B-lymphocyte component. B lymphocytes can play
      a crucial role as antigen-presenting cells, expressing high levels of class II
      major-histocompatibility-complex antigens and generating cryptic peptides to which T
      lymphocytes are not tolerant.

      B lymphocytes can be selectively depleted with the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody. We will
      test the hypothesis that transient elimination of B lymphocytes with anti-CD20 monoclonal
      antibody would decrease immune-mediated destruction of beta cells and result in preserved
      beta-cell function in patients with type 1 diabetes of recent onset.
