      diagnosing changes in the bile ducts or managing outflow obstruction. Although ERCP may in
      most cases be performed safely, there is a risk of developing acute pancreatitis following
      the procedure. The risk has been estimated to 5-10%, with an increased risk in women, younger
      patients and in case the cannulation is difficult.

      Phospholipase 2 is crucial in the pathogenesis of acute pancreatitis. As Diclofenac is a
      potent inhibitor of Phospholipase 2, it has been suggested that it may be used for prevention
      of post-ERCP pancreatitis. There is some evidence for the effectiveness of Diclofenac, but
      more studies are needed to confirm that it reduces the risk of post-ERCP pancreatitis.

      In order to test whether Diclofenac reduces the risk for post-ERCP pancreatitis, a
      register-based randomized controlled study is planned. The study will be conducted embedded
      in the Swedish Register for Gallstone Surgery and ERCP (GallRiks). GallRiks includes data
      corresponding to the eligibility criteria as well as outcome measures. GallRiks will also be
      used to record which patients have been screened for inclusion.

      Patients who meet the eligibility criteria are invited to the study. If they accept
      inclusion, they are randomized to 100 mg Diclofenac prior to the ERCP or np prophylaxis. No
      blinding is done.

      The aim is to include 1000 patients. When 500 patients have been included, an interim
      analysis will be performed, comparing the incidence of pancreatitis and mortality in the two
      groups. A retrospective review of the patient records will be performed for those who develop
      pancreatitis.
