    
      This is an open-label immunization with Controlled Human Malaria Infection (CHMI) study.
      Healthy, malaria-na√Øve adults, aged 18-55 years old will be recruited into one of 5
      experimental cohorts in 2 parts.

      In Part A, 2 experimental cohorts of 5 subjects each will receive a series of 3 vaccinations
      at 0, 1, and 2 months at 2 doses (the "low dose" arm and the "high dose" arm).

      In Part B, 3 experimental cohorts of 10 subjects will receive a series of 3 vaccinations at
      0, 1, 6 months (called the "delayed dose" arm), the "delayed fractional dose" arm is
      vaccinated at 0, 1, and 6 months with the 6 month dose being 1/5 the other doses, and the
      "standard" arm" at the 4th, 5th, and 6th month (after the first 2 vaccinations of the other 2
      arms in Part B).
