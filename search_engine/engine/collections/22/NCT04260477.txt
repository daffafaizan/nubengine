      will be screened and enrolled in Damien Foundation (DF) clinics participating in the trial.

      First we will perform a two-arm study with 6EHRZ as control arm and 6EH続R続Z as intervention
      arm. If at interim analysis the intervention arm is not considered to be non-inferior to the
      control arm, the intervention stops and enrolment will continue in a an adapted intervention
      arm and the control arm (6EHRZ). Otherwise, enrolment continues to 6EHRZ and 6EH続R続Z.

      As per routine practice, during treatment patients are in daily contact with the direct
      observed therapy (DOT) supervisor and minimally monthly clinic visits are scheduled for
      monitoring of safety and treatment response.

      Additionally, liver function tests will be performed at fixed intervals during treatment. Six
      month and one year after treatment completion or cure the patient will be checked for relapse
      with systematic sputum acid-fast bacilli (AFB)-microscopy and TB culture.
