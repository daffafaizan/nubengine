      of 120 AML patients who achieved remission following induction chemotherapy will be recruited
      and randomized into two groups, of 60 cases in each group. For one group, the treatment cycle
      is in the first chemotherapy cycle and the control cycle is in the second one. For another
      group, the treatment cycle is in the second chemotherapy cycle and the control cycle is in
      the first one.

      Each subject is required to undergo two cycles of chemotherapy. At the treatment cycle,
      patients received subcutaneous injection of rhTPO at a dose of 300 U/kg body weight once
      daily at a platelet count of < 50×109/L, and rhTPO treatment ceased at a platelet count of
      ≥20×109/L if platelet is not transfused. At the control cycle, rhTPO therapy is not given.

      Each subject is required to be followed up for successive two chemotherapy cycles following
      inclusion in this study. During the follow-up period, routine blood test is performed once
      every other day, and platelet transfusion is recorded.

      The safety of rhTPO is evaluated by the monitoring of liver and renal functions, blood
      coagulation, and TPO-neutralizing antibody, and adverse events associated with rhTPO
      treatment are recorded during the study period.
