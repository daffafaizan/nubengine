      as is the response to intravenous antibiotic treatment. On the other hand, the inflammatory
      response to infection and treatment in PCD has not been well characterized. Given differences
      in disease progression, we hypothesize that children with CF respond to infection with a more
      exaggerated and prolonged inflammatory response than those with PCD.
