      not have been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairments or dementia (including Alzheimer's
      disease). It is important to find out if these improvements can be obtained with the computer
      game-based integrative (motor-cognitive) bilateral rehabilitation developed by Bright Cloud
      International Corp, and if these gains transfer to daily activities.

      Specific aims are:

        -  BAC technology acceptance;

        -  improvement in motor function for the upper extremity;

        -  strengthening of shoulder and fingers;

        -  increased active (self initiated) range of motion for shoulder, arms and fingers;

        -  improved independence in activities of daily living;

        -  improvement in cognitive areas of memory, attention and decision making;

        -  improved mood (as in reduced depression severity);
