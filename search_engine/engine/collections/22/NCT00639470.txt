      comprehend their child's pain medication information. Failure to understand the full
      implications of the medication may jeopardize the child's comfort level or welfare.
      Readability of printed education materials is a key to comprehension and supplements what
      healthcare providers verbally tell the parents/legal guardians. Several studies have
      demonstrated the benefits of using illustrations to convey intended messages. Simple line
      drawings appear to do well with those who have low-literacy skills.

      The following hypothesis will be tested:

        -  There is no difference in level of comprehension of medication administration by the
           legal guardians who receive standard fact sheets about medication, those who receive
           easy-to-read fact sheets, and those who receive easy-to-read fact sheets accompanied by
           illustrations.

        -  There is no difference in level of comprehension of pain assessment by the legal
           guardians who receive standard fact sheets about assessing pain, those who receive
           easy-to-read fact sheets, and those who receive easy-to-read facts sheets accompanied by
           illustrations.

        -  There is no relationship between legal guardians' satisfaction with medication education
           and whether they receive standard fact sheets, easy-to-read fact sheets, or those who
           receive easy-to read fact sheets accompanied by illustrations.
