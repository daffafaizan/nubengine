      electrode designs or additional molecules have been used for this purpose. The aim of the
      study is to test the effect of dexamethasone in two different application methods.
      Participants who will have cochlear implant surgery will be divided into three groups. Group
      1 will have intracochlear dexamethasone after the incision of the round window membrane.
      Group 2 will have intratympanic dexamethasone after the incision of the round window
      membrane. Group 3 will serve as a control group. All participants will be tested after a
      week, a month, 3, and 6 months. Impedance and threshold measurements will be compared.
