      be the main reasons to running related injuries. Fortunately, training errors can be avoided
      as training characteristics (distance, duration, pace) can be controlled by the runner.

      In order to avoiding training errors, especially excessive volume many novice runners follow
      0-5 kilometres type training programmes. However, limited research has been conducted on the
      training volume of beginner programs and the risk of running related injuries.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the relationship between the running volume the
      first 4 weeks of a running regime and the risk of running related injuries among novice
      runners. The relationship between running volume and running related injuries will be
      investigated in proportion to their body mass index (BMI).
