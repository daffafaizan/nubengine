      therapy on the vascular responsiveness of different vasoactive compounds (angiotensin II,
      insulin, histamine and glyceroltrinitrate) in healthy subjects. Pioglitazone will be given
      orally (4 weeks 30mg/d, titrated to 45 mg/d for another 4 weeks). Candesartan will be given
      orally (4 weeks 8mg/d, titrated to 16 mg/d for another 4 weeks) as treatment. Every subject
      will receive intravenous stimulation with phenylephrine, angiotensin II, histamine, insulin
      and glyceroltrinitrate before and after an 8 weeks treatment interval with study medication
      or placebo. In addition, pulse wave velocity will me measured non-invasively before and after
      treatment.
