    
      The Prolapse Registry was an observational study of patients who were implanted with AMS
      devices for the surgical repair of female pelvic prolapse. The registry followed patients
      post-operatively for up to 2 years and collected demographic, clinical, surgical, safety, and
      patient outcomes data.

      The registry was a web-based system in which surgeons entered patient information with regard
      to their prolapse surgery. All information entered was de-identified (no names, no date of
      birth, no date of surgery, etc).
