      infected patients, but it is not effective in eliminating the virus from the patient and
      life-long therapy is thought to be required. However, proper adherence to HAART regimens is
      costly, results in inconveniences to patients, and is not without significant acute and
      long-term risks. Many patients are interested in undergoing treatment interruption to relieve
      these inconveniences and risks. This study seeks to identify these patients and to monitor
      them for virologic and immunologic parameters during the treatment interruption. Patients
      that meet the criteria for the study will discontinue all antiretroviral therapy
      simultaneously, after which the patient will be monitored by a full panel of virologic,
      immunologic, and safety parameters. Through this study, we will attempt to further
      characterize the mechanisms by which HIV evades and/or suppresses an effective anti-viral
      immune response and to identify features of the virus or the patients' immune responses that
      are associated with virologic control following treatment interruption.
