    
      The study is designed as prospective registry. Patients with angina CCS II-IV undergoing
      assessment of microvascular function will be enrolled.

      The study does not interfere with the medical standards at the sites with regards to patient
      treatment or follow-up care.

      Study duration and schedule The duration of this study is expected to be 7 years. The subject
      recruitment is planned to start in January 2020 and end in January 2022. The actual overall
      study duration or subject recruitment period may differ from these time periods. Per-patient,
      the duration of participation will be up to 5 years. Patients will be evaluated at hospital
      discharge, at 12 months and 5 years (the latter two as telephone contacts).

      Number of subjects and study centers It is planned to enroll 1000 subjects in the registry
      based on power calculations as described. Recruitment and treatment of subjects is expected
      to be performed in 10 study centers.

      Primary endpoint The primary endpoint is the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial
      infarction, rehospitalization for angina or heart failure, and unplanned coronary angiography
      at 12 months.

      Secondary endpoints Each of the components of the primary endpoint Seattle Angina
      Questionnaire SAQ-7 Physical limitation scale SAQ-7 angina stability scale SAQ-7 angina
      frequency scale SAQ-7 angina quality of life EQ-5D-5L Beck depression inventory

      The SAQ-7 "angina frequency" domain has been shown to correlate to improvements in
      microvascular function in the WISE study. SAQ-7-7 has been also used in a number of studies,
      including the ISCHEMIA study.

      Other patient questionnaires are also standardized tests for the assessment of quality of
      life, depression and symptom severity in coronary artery disease studies.
