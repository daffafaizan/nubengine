      however, the vast majority of patients with T2D do not achieve satisfying glycemic control
      with physical activity alone, which is why pharmacological treatment with metformin is most
      often initiated. It is known that metformin and exercise both activates AMPK, which results
      in many different metabolic effects. Because of this similarity, an interaction between
      metformin and exercise is plausible, but knowledge in the area is sparse. With this study the
      investigators aim to look at the individual and combined effects of metformin and exercise in
      order to investigate whether an interaction occur. An Interaction will have tremendous
      clinical importance for patients with T2D given current guidelines where the vast majority of
      these patients are recommended both exercise and metformin treatment.

      The investigators hypothesize that metformin treatment reduces self-selected exercise
      intensity, which may be explained via decreased mitochondrial complex 1 function, increased
      blood lactate levels, heart rate and RPE during exercise. Furthermore exercise-induced
      AMPK-activation is reduced with metformin treatment.
