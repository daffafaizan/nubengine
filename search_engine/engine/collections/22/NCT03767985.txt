      standard treatment is glasses and patching therapy. From North-America, behavioural training,
      i.e. dichoptic training, perceptual learning and video gaming, has become increasingly
      popular. The rationale behind these games is by using dichoptic stimulation, with the
      contrast of the stimuli presented to the good eye reduced to match the appearance of the same
      stimuli when shown to the amblyopic eye, suppression can be alleviated. The many studies now
      conducted, demonstrate improvement in visual acuity with the games, the effect however is
      limited, but the rate of improvement is higher. In these studies, prescribed patching-time
      was compared to realised game-time. We have demonstrated in multiple studies that
      electronically measured compliance is low: on average only 50%.

      In this study we aim to compare the effect of patching therapy, using the ODM to objectively
      measure compliance, with the effect of a novel dichoptic action video game in children as
      well as in adults. In addition, the adult participants will undergo fMRI scans to document
      any changes in the visual cortex before and after either therapy.
