      little effect on normal human cells. In earlier tests of RBV in AIDS patients, the drug was
      well tolerated and safe, and this favorable result suggested that RBV should be more
      extensively studied in patients with AIDS and advanced AIDS related complex (ARC).

      Patients are selected from three patient groups:

        -  Patients with AIDS, who have not taken zidovudine (AZT) within 30 days of entry into the
           study and who have not been discontinued from AZT because of intolerance.

        -  Patients with AIDS related diseases who have not taken AZT within 30 days of entry into
           the study, and who have not been discontinued from AZT because of intolerance.

        -  Patients with AIDS or AIDS related diseases who have had AZT intolerance that required
           cessation of therapy. This is an outpatient study; patients are seen weekly for the
           first 4 weeks, every other week through week 12, and then every 4 weeks for the duration
           of the 24 weeks of the treatment portion of the study. Patients from each of the three
           diagnostic groups are enrolled at each dose level. For the first 3 days after entry into
           the study, all patients receive the lowest dose of RBV every 6 hours. Subsequent dosages
           increase until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD for a group is
           defined as the dose at which 4 or more of the 8 patients in the group develop toxicity
           which requires a change or discontinuation of the dosage.

      Patients who experience significant toxicity may continue in the study at lower dose to
      determine the long-term tolerance.
