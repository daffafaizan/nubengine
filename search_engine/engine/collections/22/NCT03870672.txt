      months post-stroke are randomized to 12 wks of one of 3 treatments: (1) CCFES + cHMC
      facilitation, (2) CCFES + iM1 facilitation, (3) CCFES + Sham rTMS. The treatment dose will be
      the same for all groups: 10 sessions per week (7.5 hrs) of self-administered CCFES-assisted
      hand opening exercises performed at home plus 2 sessions per week (2.5 hrs) consisting of
      group-specific rTMS and CCFES-mediated functional task practice performed in the laboratory.
      Upper limb impairment, activity limitation, and patient-reported disability will be assessed
      at 0 (baseline), 6, 12 (end of treatment), 24, and 36 wks. Neurophysiology (IHI and
      excitability of uncrossed output) will be assessed at 0 (baseline), 12 (end of treatment),
      and 36 wks, on a separate day from functional motor outcomes assessment. MRI assessment of
      stroke lesion and location, and DTI assessment of corticospinal damage will be performed at
      baseline.
