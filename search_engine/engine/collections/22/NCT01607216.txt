      birth at a time in development when the respiratory tract and immune system would normally be
      protected and maintained in a na√Øve state. This project is a component of the NIH Prematurity
      and Respiratory Outcomes Program (PROP) whose goals are the identification of disease
      mechanisms and biomarkers to stratify premature infants, at the time of discharge, for their
      risk of subsequent pulmonary morbidity. This Clinical Research Center (CRC) project will
      investigate prematurity-dependent alterations in cellular innate and adaptive immune systems
      resulting in increased susceptibility to respiratory infections and environmental irritants,
      and leading to respiratory morbidity in the first year of life. Prior studies have
      established developmental (maturity) and disease-related changes in circulating and pulmonary
      lymphocyte populations but a comprehensive assessment of their relationship to disease
      risk/outcome has not been undertaken. We hypothesize that cellular and molecular
      immuno-maturity is altered due to intrinsic and extrinsic factors presented by premature
      birth in such a way as to reduce resistance to viral infections and to promote cytotoxic
      damage to the lung. We will evaluate immunologic maturity by comprehensively phenotyping
      lymphocyte populations in peripheral blood sampled at premature delivery, at the time of
      discharge from the hospital and at twelve months corrected age. The lymphocytic phenotype
      will be analyzed particularly in the context of gestational age and maternal-fetal stressors
      capable of modulating oxidative stress (oxygen exposure, infection and environmental tobacco
      smoke exposure). Additionally, we will assess changes in the molecular phenotype of isolated
      CD8 lymphocytes, a cell type preferentially recruited to the lungs of premature infants and
      capable of contributing to disease pathogenesis, by genome-wide expression profiling, in
      order to uncover novel disease pathways and define a gene expression signature associated
      with disease risk. Finally, we propose to build a statistical model, using cellular and
      molecular phenotypes and additional clinical variables, for stratifying risk of lung
      morbidity within the first year of life.
