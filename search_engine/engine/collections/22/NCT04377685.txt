    
      In image processing, computational medical imaging has demonstrated its ability to predict a
      therapeutic response or a particular evolution after extracting relevant anatomical,
      functional or even non-visually perceptible information from the volume of images, making it
      possible to construct a powerful radiomic signature or to use robust anatomical/functional
      measurements to provide estimates of ventilation or vascular state. By combining these data
      extracted from the scanner with the standard clinical-biological data produced at admission
      during triage, our ambition is to build a predictive model using unsupervised classification
      approaches capable of helping predict clinical evolution with the aim of optimizing the
      management of the resource.
