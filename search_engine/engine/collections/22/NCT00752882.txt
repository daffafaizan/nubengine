      injections (29 mg/kg 30min Ã—3/day) and by continuous infusion (86 mg/kg/24 h, preceded by 29
      mg/kg/30 min). The main evaluation criterion of the study is the measure of the time during
      which ceftazidime concentration is above minimal inhibitive concentration of Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa in cerebrospinal fluid. This study will be developed in a neurological intensive
      care department. Inclusion criteria will be essentially, patients aged over 18 years old,
      hospitalised for a cerebrolesion associated to a hydrocephalus drained by an external
      ventricular derivation, an acquired pneumopathy under mechanic ventilation since more 7 days
      in the department of neurological intensive care. This study is a prospective randomised,
      simple blind and divided in two parts. The first part of the study is a study with parallel
      group comparing the treatment initiation between a continuous and an intermittent treatment
      of ceftazidime. The second part of the study is a cross-over study. One patient group will
      receive a continuous treatment of ceftazidime and the other patient group will receive an
      intermittent treatment of ceftazidime.
