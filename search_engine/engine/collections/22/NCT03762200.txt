    
      This is an open label, prospective, single arm, multicentre, multispecialty, post-marketing
      clinical study evaluating SURGICEL Powder as an adjunct to achieve haemostasis in the control
      of capillary, venous, and small arterial haemorrhage when ligation or other conventional
      methods of control are impractical or ineffective during surgery (open, laparoscopic or
      thoracoscopic) in adult subjects (18 years or older). Prospective subjects will be informed
      about the nature of the research, given the informed consent form (ICF) to read, and, if
      he/she understands the content, will be asked to provide consent by signing the ICF.

      Screening and enrolment will continue until at least 100 evaluable subjects from
      approximately eight (8) investigational sites, with an appropriate mild or moderate Target
      Bleeding Site (TBS) are included into the study. The TBS will be the only region evaluated
      for the primary endpoint and all secondary effectiveness endpoints.

      All enrolled subjects will be followed post-operatively through discharge, and via phone call
      or office visit at 30 days (+14 days) post-surgery. In addition, all enrolled subjects will
      receive a 6-month (+/-30 days) follow-up phone call or office visit to assess the occurrence
      of any serious adverse event (SAE) requiring surgical intervention and assessed as possibly
      related or related to the study treatment.
