      dosimetric scan at baseline. 48 hours later (minimum), a Metformin therapy will be started at
      a dosage of 850 mg 2 times / day ( = 1700 mg / day). Seven days later (minimum) and up to 48
      hours before surgery, the dosage of Metformin will be increased to 850 mg 3 times / day ( =
      2550 mg / day). This very same day (J10), patients will start a radiochemotherapy. For 5
      weeks, 5 days out of 7, patients will receive 800 mg/m² of Capecitabine 2 times / day (on
      morning and evening) ( = 1600 mg / m² / day) and a 3D irradiation or an Intensity-Modulated
      Radiation Therapy (IMRT) of a total dose of 50 Gy (5 sessions of 2 Gy per week). 6 to 8 weeks
      after completion of the chemoradiotherapy, surgery will be scheduled. It will consist of a
      tumor resection with total resection of the meso rectum.

      Prior to the start of treatment, patients will have a clinical and a paraclinical examination
      and will undergo a laboratory examination. Once a week during the radiochemotherapy, patients
      will have a clinical examination and will undergo a laboratory examination. Three weeks after
      the end of the radiochemotherapy, patients will have a clinical examination. Before surgery,
      patients will have a clinical and a paraclinical examination. Finally, at the end of the
      study, patients will have a clinical examination.
