      today. There is evidence that glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels above 7% are associated with a
      progressively greater risk of chronic complications related to DM. However, approximately 60%
      of diabetics do not achieve glycemic control. In Brazil, pharmacists are not involved in
      direct care of patients with DM. The investigators conducted a randomized controlled trial,
      for six months, in Ouro Preto, Minas terais to determine the effect of pharmaceutical
      intervention on glycemic control in patients with diabetes and hyperglycemic (A1C > 7%). One
      hundred and twenty-nine subjects were randomized to receive usual care only or usual care and
      pharmaceutical intervention. The population of those who had access in the brazilian public
      health care system, as consultations with doctors, nurses and nutritionists, laboratory tests
      and access to essential medicines were considered as conventional health care.
