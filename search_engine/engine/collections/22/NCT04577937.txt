    
      Lymphangioleiomiomatosis (LAM) is a rare progressive disease that affects primarily lungs
      with a cystic radiologic pattern and may be associated with angiomiolipomas in the kidneys or
      in other sites and an increased frequency of meningioma. Patients with sporadic LAM are
      usually female (incidence around 1/400.000 adult females). LAM associated with tuberous
      sclerosis may affect male, female and children.

      LAM patients are functionally characterized by obstructive or restrictive syndrome that leads
      patients to hypoxemia and chronic respiratory failure, so that quality of Life (QoL) of these
      patients is affected by dyspnea. Hypoxemia contributes to the development of secondary
      pulmonary hypertension (PH) during progression of LAM history, worsening the damage.

      The modifications in the neural control of ventilation during sleep in combination with
      anatomical disposition drive to sleep-related changes in upper airway resistance and
      physiologic desaturations. In healthy subjects these features are almost completely
      compensated but, in LAM patients, may lead to airway obstruction and/or pathologic oxygen
      desaturation that could be managed. So far, none have investigated the changes in sleep
      architecture and related blood gas exchange in patients with LAM relating these changes with
      disease severity.

      This pilot study investigate if the physiologic modifications of breathing during sleep lead
      to sleep disorders in LAM patients, measured through abnormalities in polysomnography (PSG)
      and ih sleep disorders in LAM are associated with respiratory functional abnormalities and
      disease severity.
