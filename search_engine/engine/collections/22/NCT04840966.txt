      their incidence is still uncertain and variable. In this study, the effects of SARS-CoV-2
      infection on chemosensory function have been investigated using both a self-reporting
      questionnaire on smell and flavor perception, and a simplified flavor test. A total of 111
      subjects (19 hospitalized [HOS] and 37 home-isolated [HI] COVID-19 patients, and 55 healthy
      controls [CTRL]) were enrolled in the study. The flavor test used consists in the
      self-administration of four solution with a pure olfactory stimulus (coffee), a mixed
      olfactory-trigeminal stimulus (peppermint), and a complex chemical mixture (banana).

      After SARS-CoV-2 infection, HOS and HI patients reported similar frequency of STDs, with a
      significant reduction of both smell and flavor self-estimated perception.

      The aromas of the Flavor test were recognized by HI and HOS COVID-19 patients similarly to
      CTRL, however the intensity of the perceived aromas was significantly lower in patients
      compared to controls.

      This suggests that a chemosensory impairment is present after SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the
      modified "flavor test" could be a novel self-administering objective screening test to assess
      STDs in COVID-19 patients.
