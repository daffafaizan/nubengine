      shown that the disease is inherited autosomal dominant. In one of the families the gene
      coding for the disease was located on chromosome 6q16. We will be analyzing 2 extended
      families with familial vocal cord paralysis to define their genetic defect leading to the
      disease. All family members will undergo a laryngoscopy to determine the extent of paralysis.
      For all family members we will isolate DNA and determine their microsatellite polymorphism on
      chromosome 6q16. If the results are negative we will continue the study and perform a whole
      genome scan to localize the gene(s) involved.
