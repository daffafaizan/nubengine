        -  Determine the clinical activity of BMS-247550, in terms of tumor response rate, in women
           with taxane-resistant metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the duration of response, time to progression, and survival of patients
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for
      4-18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      achieving complete response (CR) receive 4 additional courses beyond CR. Responding patients
      may receive additional courses at the investigator's discretion.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months.
