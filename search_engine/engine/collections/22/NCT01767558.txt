      criteria and provide consent to participate in the study. Subjects will undergo an ablation
      for paroxysmal AF with the Medtronic PVAC GOLD (CE-Mark). To assess for ACE lesions, pre- and
      post-ablation procedure cerebral MRIs will be done along with a neurological exam (Mini
      Mental State Exam). Subjects will be followed for 1 month post-procedure when a repeat MRI
      and neurological exam will be conducted if the subject had a positive MRI at pre-hospital
      discharge.
