    
      Specific Aim #1: To determine the effect of a refined and culturally-sensitive physical
      activity intervention on functional outcomes at 20 and 52 weeks among older Breast Cancer
      survivors who are within five years of treatment completion for stage I-III Breast Cancer
      (BCa).

      Specific Aim #2: To examine whether race and socioeconomic status (SES) moderate the
      intervention effect on physical activity (PA) levels and functional outcomes at 20 and 52
      weeks.

      Specific Aim #3: To examine the effect of the PA intervention on longitudinal changes in
      beliefs, attitudes and preferences (KAPs) and PA levels, and the extent to which changes in
      these factors mediate intervention effect on functional outcomes.

      Specific Aim #4: To determine the effect of the PA intervention on surrogate biomarkers
      associated with breast cancer prognosis and functional disability.
