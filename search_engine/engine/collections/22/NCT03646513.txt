    
      This is a single arm, consecutive series study to collect relevant clinical, laboratory and
      radiological data in up to 26 subjects, who have been implanted with the SMF Short Modular
      Femoral Stem THA system at 1 site in Australia.

      The Baseline visit will be determined as the first visit to site after Ethics approval. This
      will be approximately 8-9 years post implant. Enrolled subjects will be followed up to 20
      years post SMF implant.

      Eligible patients will be contacted and patient status and implant revision status will be
      assessed at this initial contact. The subject will be given the option to participate in a
      prospective 12 year on-site follow-up visits for which they will provide written informed
      consent. Subjects who are lost to follow-up, deceased or are unwilling/unable to participate
      in the prospective study will be noted in the subject files and this data will be captured
      for analysis of study results. Data will be collected on the operative date, and implant
      status.

      Post Baseline, the study will allow for metal ion assessments every 3 years for asymptomatic
      subjects and annual assessments for subjects with pain, swelling, and/or functional
      limitations if assessed by the Principal Investigator to be related to the SMF implant,
      having ruled out all other probable causes for the subject. If the subject has elevated whole
      blood cobalt or chromium (defined as >7ppb) a MARS MRI or CT will be obtained. These types of
      imaging techniques are aimed at detecting inflammatory degenerative evolution of peri
      articular soft tissues including pseudo-tumours. A functional Questionnaire, HOOS JR
      Questionnaire will be completed at all patient site visits.

      Safety will be evaluated by assessing the frequency and nature of adverse events, serious
      adverse events and revisions.
