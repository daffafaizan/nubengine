      transmitting microcurrents of brain stimulation and releasing various neurotransmitters such
      as endorphin and downstream hormones to modulate autonomic nervous system, as a result, for
      treating anxiety, depression, insomnia, and pain.

      Acute postoperative pain annoys patients receiving surgery. Once acute postoperative pain is
      poorly controlled, it may result in adverse acute effects (i.e., physiologic and psychologic
      stress), chronic effects (i.e., delayed long-term recovery and chronic pain), and, in
      consequence, excess length of hospitalization and extra costs. Besides, inflammatory
      reactions mediated by immune system are formed after tissue injury (e.g. trauma, surgery,
      etc), release serial inflammatory cytokines and are related to pain signal transmission.
      However, clinical studies and applications of CES focus on management of chronic pain,
      modulation of mood and insomnia rather than acute postoperative pain in recent years.

      The investigators investigate a double-blind, randomized controlled trial to figure out if
      intraoperative CES could decrease dosage of intraoperative anesthetics and patient-controlled
      analgesia (PCA) consumption in patients undergoing colon cancer surgery. The investigators
      also collect blood samples before and after surgery for analysis of serum cytokines.
      Meanwhile, Bispectral IndexTM (BISTM) monitoring and Analgesia Nociception Index (ANI) are
      prescribed during the surgery not only for measuring of the effects of anesthetics and
      sedatives on the brain, but also evaluating perioperative analgesia. Thereby, the
      effectiveness of CES for management of acute postoperative pain may introduce clinicians for
      alternative application of pain control after surgery in the future.
