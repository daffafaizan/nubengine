      polyethylene wear failures within knee implants and to help design a prosthesis that most
      closely approximates the normal knee. Therefore, the objectives for this study are to compare
      the in vivo kinematic patterns for subjects implanted with either a Stryker Triathlon
      Posterior Cruciate Retaining (PCR) Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) or Zimmer NexGen PCR TKA
      design to determine if there are any kinematic differences between these TKA designs. Each
      subject will be asked to undergo a fluoroscopic evaluation while performing weight-bearing
      activities under surveillance using the University of Tennessee's new mobile tracking
      fluoroscopic unit while performing deep knee bend and ramp up and ramp down activities. The
      mobile fluoroscopy unit is approved for use by the State of Tennessee on a study-by-study
      basis after IRB approval is obtained for each study.
