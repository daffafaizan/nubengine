      management of ischemic foot ulcers.

      Methods: All consecutive patients presenting with a foot ulcer at the outpatient Vascular
      surgery clinic of our hospital were evaluated. Preoperative evaluation included foot pulse
      assessment, ankle-brachial-index (ABI) and duplex scanning. If non-invasive parameters
      suggested peripheral arterial disease (PAD) anatomic imaging (CTA and/or DSA) was performed
      and a PTA was carried out when feasible during the same session. All patients were followed
      until healing, amputation, death, or for at least two years. Short-term and long-term
      clinical success of PTA was evaluated based on ulcer size and appearance. Patients with
      worsening ulcers after PTA underwent bypass grafting or amputation.
