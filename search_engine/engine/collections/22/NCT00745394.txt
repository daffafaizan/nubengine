      the use of the NIRS monitor, will be implemented during the patient's operation and
      post-operatively in the intensive care unit with few modifications. These modifications
      include: (1) the placement of an oximetric probe in the lumen of the cardiopulmonary bypass
      circuit tubing which will output continuous blood oxygen content during bypass, (2) the
      addition of extra connectors to the bypass tubing to allow blood draws during surgery, (3)
      placement of doppler blood flow probes on the tubing to measure blood flow velocity, and (4)
      the addition of LFTs during the post-operative phase, if followed. Patients that receive
      operations that require circulatory arrest and/or selective cerebral perfusion will be
      followed in the ICU for 5 days. Data from the bypass machine along, data collected from the
      NIRS and oximetric probe monitor, and serum data will be interfaced into a data collection
      system.

      Data to be collected: Minimum patient demographic data (age, sex, ethnic origin), NIRS data,
      serum blood gas data, serum lactate levels, hemoglobin levels, vital signs, doppler blood
      flow data, LFT analysis, clinical course events/data (i.e. need for dialysis, length of stay,
      surgical time points, etc), diagnostic test results (EKGs, ECHOs, etc), significant medical
      history data, and standard of care laboratory results.

      The investigator wishes to evaluate the relationship of this data with the patient's
      diagnosis, operation performed, post-operative course, and outcome. Validation of the use of
      the NIRS monitor and further characterization of the NIRS monitor will also be sought.
