      china, because of the difference of medical conditions, some areas especially the basic level
      hospitals without the condition of X-ray examination, which can not be clearly diagnosed
      RDS.In 2013, the scholars analyzed the disease of neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) need to
      be exposed to radiation, and RDS was in the first place. There is no conclusion whether it
      bad for newborn to exposure more. But in animal models, there is a correlation between
      exposure to radiation and cancer.

      Hyaline membrane disease(HMD) is common occur in preterm infants .pulmonary surfactant(PS) is
      a safe and effective treatment for neonatalHMD.Bahadue F L meta analyse conclusion is early
      application of PS is more benefit for HMD.

      So investigator hypothesize that pulse oximetry with clinical assessment have high
      sensitivity,specificity ,positive and negative predictive value to lung disease.The aim is to
      reduce radiation exposure to neonate and to preterm infants with RDS can early application of
      PS.

      Symptomatic definition:with grunting,nasal flaring,retraction,cyanosis,tachypnea,stridor.

      Pulse oximetry positive criteria:1.atrial oxygen saturation (SpO2)<90%;2.heart rate>180 or
      <100 per minute.

      Clinical assessment:1.respiratory physical examination:non-symmetry,decrease breathing
      sound,bubbles sound.2.Delivery history:caesarean,premature rupture of membranes,liquor,mother
      conditions,Apgar score.

      Congenital heart disease classification:1.critical:defects causing of the death or needing
      intervention before 28 days.2.serious:defects needing intervention before 1 year of
      age.significant:defects persisting longer than 6 months of age ,but not classified as
      critical or serious.4.non-significant:defects not physically appreciable and not persisting
      after 6 months of age.
