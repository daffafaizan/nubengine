    
      Aim: feasibility and safety study = evaluation of the possibility for a fully automated
      ventilator to safely manage the ventilation and oxygenation after cardiac surgery

      Hypothesis:

      Intellivent will maintain the patient with " optimal ventilation " better than during usual
      management with a minimal number of interventions

      Monocentric: IUCPQ, Hôpital Laval, Québec Randomized controlled safety study, unblinded
      Patients after elective cardiac surgery Two arms Intellivent (fully automatic ventilation)
      Protocolized ventilation 4 hours study 60 patients planned to be included Primary outcome:
      number of episodes in the " not acceptable " zone of ventilation and duration

      Secondary outcome:

      Number of episodes in the " acceptable " zone of ventilation and duration Number of manual
      settings and duration of interventions Comparison of arterial blood gases Time to wean the
      FiO2 the PEEP Time to begin the assisted ventilation Duration of mechanical ventilation
