      early pterygium recurrence were selected and invited to participate in the study. Recurrence
      was defined as the presence of corneal vessels with concomitant conjunctival hyperemia within
      the first trimester after primary pterygium removal, and only patients with primary pterygium
      recurrence were included. Patient related factors such as pregnancy, women seeking to become
      pregnant, and lactating women were excluded from the study. All patients received three
      subconjunctival bevacizumab (2.5 mg/0.05 ml) injections (basal, 2 and 4 weeks) in the
      recurrence area of the pterygium, and were photographed at the third, sixth and twelfth
      months after the last bevacizumab injection. Photographic analyses were performed taking into
      account two pterygium areas: the first measure included only the vessel area in the corneal
      surface, while the second measure included, both, conjunctival and corneal vessel area
      (corneal-conjunctival area of hyperemia). Neovascularization area of each pterygium was
      determined using digital slit lam pictures, which were analyzed using Photoshop CS4, in order
      to get pixels measurements of the lesion.
