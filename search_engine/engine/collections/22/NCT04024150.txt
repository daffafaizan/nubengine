      transmission of mother-to-child viruses. Molecules of the class of anti-integrases are still
      little used during pregnancy, but their prescription is increasing given their intrinsic
      effectiveness and their overall tolerance profile.

      The integrase of HIV-1, responsible for the integration of viral DNA in cellular DNA, has a
      functional similarity with human RAG1 / 2 proteins, responsible for V (D) J recombination.
      RAG1 / 2 proteins alteration is associated in human clinic with immune disturbances of varied
      severity.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate at birth, the diversity of the T repertoire of
      newborns exposed in utero to anti-integrases in comparison with a control group of children
      exposed to other antiretroviral drugs.
