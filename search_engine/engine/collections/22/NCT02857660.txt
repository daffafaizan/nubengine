      with additional protein supplementation on Sarcopenic Obesity parameters in independently
      living men 70 years and older with sarcopenic obesity. The randomized controlled study
      compares three groups with 36 subjects each: (1) WB-EMS with additional protein
      supplementation, (2) protein-only and (3) passive control group, over a period of 16 weeks of
      WB-EMS -training. Group (1) conducts 1.5-times/week a 20 minute-sessions of WB-EMS with
      additional protein, group (2) is limited to protein supplementation (only) and group (3) is
      constrained to maintain their habitual living behavior and physical activity. Based on an
      individual nutrition analysis the protein intake will be adjusted to 1.5-1.7 g/kg/
      bodymass/d. All groups will be supplemented with a maximum of 800 IE Vitamin D.

      Primary study endpoint will be changes of the Sarcopenia Z-Score with skeletal muscle mass
      assessed via bio-impedance analysis (BIA). Secondary study endpoints are changes of Obesity
      (i.e. body-fat as assessed via BIA), cardiometabolic risk (i.e. Metabolic Syndrome Z-Score),
      strength parameters evaluated via Dr. Wolff BackCheck and Physiomed LegPress, quality of life
      (SF-12) and functional disability (late life physical disability index).
