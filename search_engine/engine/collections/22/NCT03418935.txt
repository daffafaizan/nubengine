      conditions other than tumor (predominantly by cholelithiasis; ICD-10 codes K80 and K83.1).
      The patients will be screened in the 15 days preceeding the appointed drainage surgery. The
      treatment will be started in the first 6 hours after the drainage surgery and continue for 7
      days.

      Following screening, patients who meet the inclusion criteria and have no criteria for
      exclusion will be randomly assigned into three study groups in the proportion of 1: 1: 1):

      Group I: treatment with Remaxol 400 ml IV + Ringer solution 400 ml IV for 7 days.

      Group II: treatment with Remaxol 800 ml IV for 7 days. Group III (control): Ringer solution
      800 ml IV for 7 days.

      Physical examination data, vital signs, biochemistry panel (including bilirubin, alanine
      aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, GGTP) will be assessed on
      days 1-8, on day 11 and day 14.

      Diagnostic abdominal ultrasound will be performed before surgery and on days 3 and 8.

      Neurophysiological test for the evaluation of the degree of encephalopathy will be performed
      before surgery, on days 3, 5, 8, and 14.

      All patients will be followed up for 14 days.
