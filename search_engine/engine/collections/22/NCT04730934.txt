      duration of physical pain. However, when added to the economic stress due to social
      isolation, pain may worsen in patients with chronic pain, especially fibromyalgia, prone to
      anxiety and depression. Due to the fact that many occupational sectors, which concern the
      whole society, have come to a halt, being obliged to live a sedentary life due to inability
      to perform their profession may have caused an increase in the body mass index of people.
      During the pandemic days, our concentration and health services may have shifted from the
      diseases of our branch to COVID-19 and the branch health services offered may be disrupted.
      However, the call of the country administrators to stay home and the concept of social
      isolation caused the routine outpatient clinic follow-ups to be delayed. Lack of sufficient
      data on how fibromyalgia patients were affected in previous pandemics and the pandemic we are
      in, the disease levels of the patients in this period, restrictions in their social
      environment, difficulties in reaching the doctor may have exacerbated the course of the
      diseases. In this study, the effects of the symptoms related to the diseases of patients with
      fibromyalgia during the COVID-19 pandemic, their limitations in their social and business
      life, the need for different drugs, stress levels and the effect of the pandemic on the
      disease activity will be evaluated. The data to be obtained can be a guiding resource for us
      in the ongoing pandemic and in the fight against future pandemics due to the mutated genetic
      structure of the virus.
