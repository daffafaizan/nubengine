    
      Hysterectomy is the most common major gynaecological operation performed worldwide.

      The overall average rate of hysterectomy in the United States is 5.6 per 1000 women. There
      are three different procedures to perform a hysterectomy. The surgery can be approached
      abdominally, vaginally or as a laparoscopically assisted hysterectomy.

      This study will contribute to the improvement of knowledge in short and long term
      complications and especially the prevalence of occult and subclinical haematomas and vaginal
      abscesses after abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy. The occurrence of short and long term
      complications will have an influence on the general well being of the patient. We will also
      evaluate the physical and mental well being of the patient after a hysterectomy.

      After statistical analysis of the study outcome parameters, some conclusions can be drawn for
      the treatment policy after an abdominal or vaginal hysterectomy to reduce the complication
      rate and improve the general well being of our patients.
