      intravenous (IV) thrombolysis using recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rtPA) and
      endovascular thrombectomy (ET). Those new interventions constitute a landmark change in
      stroke treatment. Since early mobilizing patients after stroke as early as possible might
      prevent immobility-related complications and promote brain recovery, previous studies
      supported that early mobilization should commence at some point within 72 hours of stroke.
      However, increased risk of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or ischemia-reperfusion
      injury underlies concerns early mobilization of patients treated with rtPA or ET. Bedside, a
      limited amount of research has investigated what specific timing for starting early
      mobilization after intravenous IV rtPA or ET would optimize recovery potential during the
      acute period after cerebral infarction. Further research is needed to understand whether the
      outcomes resulting from starting mobilization within 72 hours of onset for a stroke treated
      with rtPA or ET is better than that of starting mobilization later. Therefore, the purpose of
      the study will to test the hypothesis that combining early out-of-bed mobilization within 72
      hours of stroke onset with treated by IV rtPA or ET would result in a greater benefit than
      standard early rehabilitation within 72 hours of stroke onset with treated by IV rtPA or ET.
