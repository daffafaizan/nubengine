    
      This is a multicenter, US-only, phase 1, open-label, dose and age escalation, parallel design
      (heterologous and homologous prime-boost) study to examine safety, tolerability, and
      immunogenicity of investigational Chimpanzee Adenovirus serotype 68 (ChAd) and
      self-amplifying mRNA (SAM) vectors expressing either Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
      Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike alone, or spike plus additional SARS-CoV-2 T cell epitopes
      (TCE) in healthy adult subjects. Stage 1 will compare ChAd and SAM vaccines encoding only the
      spike protein in a 2-group dose escalation trial in subjects 18-60 years old, and a 3-group
      dose escalation trial in subjects over 60 years old, focusing on heterologous ChAd prime/SAM
      boost and homologous SAM prime/SAM boost regimens including sentinels, and staggered
      enrollment for dose and age escalations. Stage 2 will compare optimal doses of ChAd and SAM
      vaccines (determined in Stage 1) encoding both spike and TCE, in subjects 18 years and older
      enrolled into up to 6 groups simultaneously to receive homologous SAM prime/SAM boost,
      homologous ChAd prime/ChAd boost and heterologous ChAd prime/SAM boost combinations. Up to 70
      (Stage 1) and up to 70 (Stage 2) males and non-pregnant females >/= 18 years of age who are
      in good health, do not have high risks for SARS-CoV-2 infection or for severe Coronavirus
      Disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease progression, and meet all eligibility criteria will be
      enrolled. Subjects will be enrolled at one of at least 3 distinct US-based Infectious
      Diseases Clinical Research Consortium (IDCRC) sites into different groups based on their age
      (18-60 and >60 years old). The primary objective of this study is to assess the safety and
      tolerability of different doses of ChAd-S (or ChAd-S-TCE) and SAM-S (or SAM-S-TCE) when
      administered as prime and/or boost in healthy adult subjects including older adult subjects.
      The secondary objective of this study is to assess the humoral and T cell responses to ChAd-S
      (or ChAd-S-TCE) and SAM-S (or SAM-S-TCE) when administered to healthy adult subjects
      including older adult subjects.
