      Taiwan Taiwanese patients who are receiving two different dosing regimens of Aggrenox and
      Aggrenox placebo. The first group will start with placebo on days 1-4, daily dose on days
      5-14, and following by b.i.d treatment on 15-28 days. This group will also receive a matching
      placebo in the morning and one Aggrenox capsule in the evening before on days 5-14. It
      enables to reduce the perception of dipyridamole-associated headache. The second group will
      receive the placebo twice daily on days 1-4, and medication twice daily for the remaining
      course. The third group will receive the placebo twice daily for the whole course.

      Study Hypothesis:

      NULL AND ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES

      From a subject diary, asking for the most frequent side effects observed in the ESPS2 trial,
      the cumulative headache (intensity x frequency) per day based on the first three days of
      treatment period defines the primary endpoint.

      I: H0: Median cumulative headache is equal for all treatment groups vs. HA: Median cumulative
      headache is not equal for all treatment groups

      II: H0: Median cumulative headache of low dose regimen?Median cumulative headache of regular
      dose vs. HA: Median cumulative headache of low dose regimen < Median cumulative headache of
      regular dose
