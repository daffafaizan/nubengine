    
      This is a retrospective, non-interventional study of participants with CD or UC. The study
      will review the medical charts of participants who have initiated the first or second line
      treatment with vedolizumab or another biologic agent (infliximab, adalimumab, or golimumab
      [UC only]) (index event) during the eligibility period to evaluate the treatment
      effectiveness, treatment patterns, health care utilization and safety of vedolizumab, and to
      provide the real-world treatment landscape with anti-TNF alpha therapies.

      The study will enroll approximately 400 participants, with 200 participants in each treatment
      cohort. All participants will be enrolled into two observational groups:

        -  Cohort 1: Vedolizumab

        -  Cohort 2: Other Biologics

      The data for participants will be collected in two main periods:

        -  Pre-index Event Period: From the data of diagnosis of UC/CD until one day prior to the
           date when vedolizumab or other biologic treatment was initiated during the eligibility
           period.

        -  Post-index Event Period: From the date when vedolizumab or other biologic treatment was
           initiated during the eligibility period until the earliest of 6 months (post-index
           treatment discontinuation, death of participants, lost-to-follow up, or date of chart
           abstraction initiation.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Spain and Portugal. The overall time for data
      collection in the study will be approximately 12 months and the overall duration of the study
      is approximately 24 months.
