      I. Determine whether the addition of an IGFBP-2 vaccine to neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases
      the rate of complete pathologic response (CR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether the addition of an IGFBP-2 vaccine to neoadjuvant chemotherapy increases
      progression free survival at 12 months.

      II. Determine whether the addition of an IGFBP-2 vaccine to neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves
      overall survival.

      III. To determine whether IGFBP-2 vaccination in combination with chemotherapy increases the
      level of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) in the tumor.

      IV. To assess the level of IGFBP-2 type 1 helper cells (Th1) elicited with vaccination
      concurrent with chemotherapy.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore whether there is a predictive genomic signature for CR induction when IGFBP-2
      vaccination is used in combination with chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour
      followed by IGFBP-2 vaccine intradermally (ID) 2 weeks later. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks
      for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After
      completion of 3 cycles, patients then undergo cytoreductive surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and then once a
      year for 5 years.
