      called EOAD and LOAD. These two categories are distinguished by the localization of brain
      atrophy : severe and 'posterior' in EOAD and more 'anterior' in LOAD. Neuro-pathologic data
      suggests some atypical focal cortical atrophy, characterized by a respect of episodic memory,
      may be classified within EOAD.

      PiB-based PET imaging allows the in-vivo visualization and quantification of amyloïd load.

      We want to answer the question whether the amount of amyloïd protein may be lower in LOAD
      than EOAD in patients showing the same level of dementia, and thus identify ageing-specific
      cognitive disorders and understand witch factors influence etio-pathology of typical and
      atypical Alzheimer's disease.
