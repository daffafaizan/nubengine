      has demonstrated non-inferiority to Atripla in treatment na√Øve patients out to 144 weeks
      (GS-102). Stribild also has statistically significant less Central Nervous System side
      effects, sleep disturbances and lipid elevations compared to Atripla. This study will
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, changes in Central Nervous System abnormalities and sleep
      disorders following a switch from virologically suppressed subjects on Atripla to Stribild.
