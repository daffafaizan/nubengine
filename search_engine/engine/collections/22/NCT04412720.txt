      of symptoms and reduced the use of medications, the number of crises, exercise induced
      bronchoconstriction (EIB), and improvement in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). This
      study will be a randomized and controlled trial (RCT) with 2 parallel arms and blinded
      assessment. Fifty-four moderate or severe patients with asthma under optimized medication
      will be randomly assigned (computer-generated) into either aerobic+breathing exercises (AB)
      or aerobic+stretching exercises (AS). All patients will receive the same educational session
      and will perform the physical exercise proposed for the group for 12 weeks, 2 times/week,
      60-minute sessions; however, the AB group will perform Buteyko breathing technique and AS
      will perform muscle stretching exercise. All patients will be assessed to clinical control,
      quality of life, psychosocial symptoms, pulmonary function, functional capacity, physical
      activity levels, sleep quality, thoracoabdominal mechanics, hyperventilation symptoms, and
      asthma exacerbation. The data normality will be analyzed by Kolmogorov-Smirnov. The variables
      obtained before interventions will be compared using the t-test or Mann-Whitney U-test.
      Comparisons of the outcomes initial and final data will be analyzed with repeated measures
      ANOVA with appropriate post hoc test. The significance level will be set to 5% for all tests.
