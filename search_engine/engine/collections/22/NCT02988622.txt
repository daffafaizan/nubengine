      the scar will be treated with the Fraxel Laser and the other half of the scar will be treated
      with the CO2 Laser. This study is a blinded, prospective comparative, split-scar study
      whereby 100 participants will be recruited, enrolled and followed for a period of 9 months.
      The study population will include male and female participants, age 18 and over with scars
      secondary to surgery or trauma on any part of the body. The study will recruit participants
      with light colored skin, Fitzpatrick Type I-IV, because colored skin has a significantly
      higher risk of keloid scarring. The scar must measure a minimum of 4 cm in length to
      accommodate for the split-scar treatment. The participants will undergo laser treatments on
      Visit 1, Visit 2 and Visit 3 and each visit will be 4 weeks apart. The participants will
      return for evaluation and follow-up 3 months and 6 months following the last laser treatment.
      At each visit, photographs will be taken using identical camera settings, lighting and
      participant positioning. Evaluation of the scars will be completed by the participants and by
      blinded dermatology physicians. Participants will use a complete visual analogue scale at
      each visit, the Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS) and a satisfaction score.
