      properties. Clobetasol propionate foam 0.05% (Olux-E), a Class 1 corticosteroid, is
      formulated in an ethanol free petrolatum base that provides the benefits of a super-potent
      corticosteroid combined with moisturizing ingredients in the treatment of corticosteroid
      responsive dermatoses. The current study is designed to show efficacy and safety in the
      treatment of moderate to severe chronic hand dermatitis.
