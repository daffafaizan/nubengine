      in head and neck cancer patients. Almost all these patients develop mucositis during the
      treatment, which usually leads to treatment interruptions and affects the efficacy of the
      treatment. Prophylactic gastrostomy has been accepted for these patients with improvement of
      quality of life. However, there is no prospective study confirming superiority of such
      treatment.

      The investigators enrolled head and neck cancer patients who had the plan of
      chemoradiotherapy. The patients will be informed about both treatment arms and will decide
      the arm that they preferred. The treatment interruptions, body weight and nutritional status
      will be assessed every 2 weeks during treatment period.
