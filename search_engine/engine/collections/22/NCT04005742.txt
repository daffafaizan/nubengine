      investigators observed associations between age and nutritional factors, including selenium
      and folate, and biomarkers of colorectal health.

      The BFU Study will investigate the relationships between ageing (12+ years) and such
      biomarkers longitudinally. It is anticipated that the project will produce novel data on (i)
      changes in biomarkers of colorectal cancer risk with age and (ii) the effects of obesity and
      lifestyle factors on biomarkers of colorectal cancer risk. These biomarkers include
      differentially expressed proteins, DNA methylation markers and inflammation markers.
