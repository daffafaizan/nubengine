    
      Friedreich's ataxia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive degenerative disorder characterized by
      ataxia, dysarthria, sensory loss, diabetes and cardiomyopathy. The discovery of the abnormal
      gene in FA and its product (frataxin) has provided insight into possible pathophysiological
      mechanisms and novel approaches to treatments in this disease. While such methods for
      assessing disease progression may be useful, evaluation in clinical trials will require
      specific clinical outcome measures.

      This is a multicenter natural history study which aims to expand the network of clinical
      research centers specializing in Friedreich's Ataxia and to advance clinical care, research
      and therapeutic approaches in FA through the development and validation of clinical outcome
      measures. Study sites aim to collect quantitative serial clinical data on patients with FA
      and expand the existing research network. In addition, the study will support various genetic
      modifier studies, biomarker studies, and frataxin protein level assessments in patients with
      FA, in carriers, and in controls.

      This study will recruit up to 1500 patients with Friedreich ataxia worldwide, to be assessed
      annually for up to 15 years. All individuals with a genetic or clinical diagnosis of FA can
      participate.

      Study participation involves yearly assessments of a core set of clinical measures and
      quality of life assessment measures in addition to optional collection of a cheek swab and/or
      blood sample.
