      medication adherence by targeting brain regions implicated in impaired insight, a primary
      contributor to medication nonadherence in patients with SCZ. Participants will be randomized
      to receive either active or sham tDCS. tDCS will be administered twice-daily for 10 days (20
      sessions) excluding weekends. Brain scans will be performed before and after 10 days of tDCS.
      Antipsychotic drug adherence will be assessed based primarily on pill-count, and secondarily,
      plasma level concentrations and clinician-judgement.
