    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment protocol with up to six treatment
      cohorts, each of which receives a single intravenous infusion of an escalating dose of
      RTL1000. Each dosing group will have six subjects: two who will receive a single dose of
      placebo and four who will receive a single dose of RTL1000. Subjects are observed in the
      hospital during the infusion and for 24 hours afterward, and are then followed weekly for 28
      days and at 1 and 2 months post-infusion to evaluate safety parameters.

      Objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety profile of a single dose of RTL1000
      administered by intravenous infusion, to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of RTL1000 in a
      subset of subjects, and to evaluate the feasibility of assessing immunologic parameters in a
      subset of subjects.

      Endpoints include vital signs, electrocardiogram and physical examination results, adverse
      events, and serious adverse events and safety laboratory parameters (e.g., clinical
      chemistries and hematology values). Disease parameters, such as neurological findings,
      expanded disability status scale (EDSS), 25-ft timed walk, 9-hole peg test, and magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) will be measured to ensure that study treatment does not make disease
      worse. Subjects will also be tested at the beginning and end of the study for antibodies to
      the drug and its components.
