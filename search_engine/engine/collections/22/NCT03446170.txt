      ages 18 to 30 years inclusive who report smoking at least 100 lifetime cigarettes and now
      smoking on all or some days. Participants must also reside in the metro Washington, DC area.
      The first portion of the study is a within-subjects experiment simulating point of sale
      cigarette purchase behaviors based on 2 packaging features: (1) graphic warning messages
      framed to emphasize either the health benefits of quitting (i.e., gain framed) or the health
      risks of smoking (i.e., loss-framed) and (2) industry branded or plain (i.e., standardized
      unbranded) packaging. In the second portion of the study, the same participants take part in
      a prospective experiment to determine the impact of graphic cigarette warning message framing
      (gain versus loss) and packaging (branded versus plain) on motivation to quit and smoking
      behavior. Participants are randomized to use 1 of 4 experimentally adapted cigarette packs in
      place of their regular packs for 4 weeks, or to a control condition which will continue to
      use their regular packs. All participants complete baseline and follow-up assessments and
      respond to daily mobile phone text message prompts on their personal mobile phones during the
      4 week exposure period. Participants complete follow-up assessments capturing motivation to
      quit, smoking behavior, and quit attempts at the conclusion of the 4 week exposure period and
      1- and 3-months later.
