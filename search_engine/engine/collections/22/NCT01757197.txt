    
      This clinical trial is testing a drug called Tocilizumab (a monoclonal antibody) as a first
      line therapy for subjects with steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease (acute
      GVHD) after undergoing a bone marrow transplant. The purpose of the study is to test the
      safety and efficacy of Tocilizumab at differing dose schedules. There are 2 phases to this
      study. Both phases include subjects with acute GVHD have not responded to steroid treatment.
      Subjects enrolled in Phase IIp will receive Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every week or every 2 weeks.
      Subjects enrolled in Phase II will receive one of two dose schedules determined by the
      results of Phase IIp. Depending on the dose they are assigned to, subjects will receive
      Tocilizumab every week or every 2 weeks for a total of 8 doses. The study medication may be
      interrupted, withheld or stopped for different reasons. However, subjects will be asked to
      follow up periodically for one year after starting Tocilizumab treatment.
