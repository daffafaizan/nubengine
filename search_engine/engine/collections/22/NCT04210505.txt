      to an intervention that includes nasal povidone-iodine at each hemodialysis session to
      determine whether nasal povidone-iodine prevents infections. The nasal povidone-iodine will
      be donated by 3M. This formulation of nasal povidone-iodine was developed under the Tentative
      Final Monograph for Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products 21 CFR Parts 333 and 369 (Docket #
      75N-183H), Federal Register Volume 59, Number 116, Friday, June 17, 1994, Proposed Rules.
      However, the product need not be controlled like a pharmaceutical drug. The product may be
