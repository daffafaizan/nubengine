      currently engaged in, or within 6 weeks of discharge from VA Mental Health Residential
      Rehabilitation Treatment Programs (RRTP), Psychosocial Rehabilitation and Recovery Centers
      (PRRC), and other mental health treatment settings (inpatient or outpatient mental
      healthcare) will be recruited. Veterans will have their cognitive functioning assessed.
      Following this, mismatch negativity (MMN) will be assessed via electroencephalography (EEG).
      Participants will undergo a 1 hour computerized cognitive training program. They will be
      interviewed about their attitudes about EEG and computerized cognitive training. They will be
      followed monthly for a total of 4 months from study entry to assess recovery trajectory. This
      study aims to enroll 104 Veterans from the VA San Diego Healthcare System.

      The Specific Aims of this proposal are 1) Determine whether MMN is related to functioning,
      psychosocial recovery in VA rehabilitation milieus and programs; 2) Determine whether MMN is
      linked to cognition and predicts cognitive remediation exercise performance in a heterogenous
      group of Veterans with mental illness. The proposal will also assess feasibility and
      acceptability of using biomarker-guided cognitive rehabilitation interventions in VA mental
      health rehabilitation settings.

      Information gained from this study will help establish a precision-medicine approach towards
      cognitive rehabilitation for Veterans with mental illness.
