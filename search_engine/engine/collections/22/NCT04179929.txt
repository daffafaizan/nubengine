    
      Patients will be uniformly treated with four drug-induction: vincristine (VCR), prednisone
      (PDN), pegylated asparaginase (PegASP), daunorubicin (DNR).

      Resistant patients will receive a second induction with fludarabine, Ara-C,
      G-Colony-Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) and idarubicin (FLAG-IDA).

      Patients with adequate MRD clearance after induction will receive 3 blocks of early
      consolidation. If adequate MRD clearance and good genetic background, the patients will
      proceed to delayed intensification, reinduction and maintenance. The remaining patients will
      receive early or delayed alloHSCT.
