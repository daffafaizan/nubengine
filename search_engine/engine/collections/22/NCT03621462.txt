      per their standard clinical practice (not utilizing AIDA™). If a lesion meeting the
      inclusion-exclusion criteria is referred for biopsy, informed consent will be obtained and
      the subject will be enrolled. Subjects will then have images acquired by the AIDA™ system.
      All lesions scheduled for biopsy (Subgroup A) will be imaged along with at most 2 additional
      lesions meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria but not referred for biopsy (Subgroup B). For
      each lesion imaged using AIDA™, the investigator will manually segment the lesion image and
      list any lesion features which contributed to their recommendation to biopsy or not biopsy.
      The investigator will first score the lesion according to the ABCD rule using the standard
      dermoscopy image displayed. They will then state their diagnosis (malignant, dyplastic, or
      benign) and their diagnostic confidence using a visual analog scale. Once standard demoscopy
      diagnosis has been collected, the process will be repeated with the use of AIDA™ software
      outputs. Investigators will also provide an estimate of lesion depth based on AIDA™ depth
      images. All biopsy results will be recorded by the pathologist. Histopathology determination
      will be used as the definitive diagnosis of either positive (malignant/dysplastic) or
      negative (benign). Complete de-identified pathology reports may also be collected.
