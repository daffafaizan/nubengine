      in type 2 diabetic patients using or considering using statins to lower CV risk in terms of

      hypothesis is that 3 months after the index discussion, significantly more patients
      randomized to STATIN CHOICE are using statins, are adherent to statins, are knowledgeable
      about the statin choice, and are satisfied with their decision than patients randomized to
      usual care consultation, and that these benefits will be achieved without deterioration in
      quality of life.
