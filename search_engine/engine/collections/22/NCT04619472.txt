      through the bronchial pathway. Then the lung lesions will be treated with radiofrequency
      ablation using the pulmonary radiofrequency ablation system and the disposable pulmonary
      radiofrequency ablation catheter. During the study, eligible subjects will be followed up
      intraoperatively, 24 hours after operation, before discharge/ 7 days after operation
      (whichever occurs first), 30 days (±7 days) after operation, 3 months (±15 days) after
      operation, 6 months (±15 days) after operation, 9 months (±15 days) after operation, and 12
      months (±15 days) after operation.
