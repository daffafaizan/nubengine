      serum and salivary concentrations of MLT after drinking a glass of red wine, containing this
      indoleamine. Hence, in this study, the investigators will investigate the levels of MLT, in
      serum and saliva, soon after the intake of the MLT-rich red wine, and, correspondingly, they
      will verify the antioxidant power of the same biological fluids.

      This will be a randomized, crossover, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with two
      treatment arms. Twelve healthy volunteers will be recruited to receive both 125 mL of red
      wine rich in MLT (10 ng mL-1) and without MLT (placebo), via a randomized, cross-over, and
      double-blind design.

      Serum and salivary MLT will be measured by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
      (LC-MS) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent (ELISA), respectively. The ferric ion reducing
      antioxidant power (FRAP) will be also analyzed.

      For serum analyses, samples will be collected at 0, 30, 60 and 90 min. For saliva analyses,
      samples will be collected at 0, 45 and 120 min.
