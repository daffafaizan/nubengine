      contractions which frequently causes twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures
      of the trunk, neck, face, or arms and legs. In focal dystonia, the abnormal movements involve
      a single area of the body. A commonly described form of focal dystonia is cervical dystonia
      (CD). Botulinum toxin treatment can be offered as a treatment option for the treatment of CD.

      The current practice for botulinum toxin injection treatment is to inject patients every 3
      months. However, not all patients receive continuing benefit from botulinum toxin injections
      for an entire 3 months. In a recent survey, approximately 45% of patients report that they
      would prefer a treatment cycle of less than 10 weeks.This study will compare Xeomin®, a
      botulinum toxin treatment, in shorter treatment intervals (Short Flex dosing) to the standard
      interval dosing (Long Flex dosing) to determine if the response to treatment is comparable in
      both how it works and any side effects. Xeomin® is approved by the United States Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of CD. The use of Xeomin® is investigational in
      regards to shorter treatment intervals. An investigational use is one that is not approved by
      the FDA.

      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the efficacy of the Short Flex dosing of
      Xeomin® compared to the Long Flex dosing regimen of Xeomin®, using a standard scale completed
      by the doctors and subjects as well as questionnaires that ask subjects to rate symptoms of
      CD.
