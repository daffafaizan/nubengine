      and critical illness. Suppression of respiratory drive and respiratory muscle activity can
      contribute to diaphragm dysfunction and increase the risk of prolonged mechanical
      ventilation.

      The objective of this study is to determine whether diaphragm inactivity or injurious loading
      of hte diaphragm during mechanical ventilation leads to the development of diaphragm
      weakness. To address this question, we are monitoring the diaphragm longitudinally over the
      first week of mechanical ventilation.

      Diaphragm activity is monitored by measurements of transdiaphragmatic pressure and diaphragm
      electrical activity. Diaphragm function is assessed by maximal transdiaphragmatic pressure
      generation and by measurements of diaphragm neuromuscular coupling. Diaphragm structure is
      assessed by daily ultrasound imaging.

      Study measurments commence at enrolment (within 36 hours of intubation) and continue for the
      first 7 days of the study (or until extubation or death, if earlier).
