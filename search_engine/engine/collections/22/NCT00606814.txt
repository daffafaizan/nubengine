    
      IPI-504 is a novel small molecule inhibitor of heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), an emerging and
      recently identified target for cancer therapy. Hsp90 is a protein chaperone that plays a
      central role in maintaining the proper folding, function and viability of various "client
      proteins". Many of the client proteins stabilized by Hsp90 are oncoproteins and
      cell-signaling proteins important in cancer cell proliferation and cancer cell survival.

      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalating study in which patients will be treated
      with a fixed dose of docetaxel followed by IPI-504 following one of three dosing schedules.

      Once an MTD has been defined, up to 20 additional patients with non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) will be enrolled.
