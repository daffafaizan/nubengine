      three escalating doses/ schedules (0.5mg every other day, 0.5mg daily every other week, or
      0.5mg daily) for 12 months with the aim of reducing polyp burden. Patients will serve as
      their own controls. Patients will be assessed with surveillance endoscopy at baseline, 6
      months, and 12 months for change in polyp burden. Correlation between immune markers and
      clinical outcomes will be explored.

      This is a Phase IIa trial which will enroll at approximately 6-8 sites within the United
      States that have specialty expertise in FAP treatment and surveillance. The trial is
      anticipated to last approximately 24 months for treatment and follow up.

      The trial will enroll 30 patients with the genetic or clinical diagnosis of FAP. The clinical
      diagnosis includes individuals with 100 or more cumulative tubular adenomas throughout the
      colorectum. Patients must be undergoing surveillance for known FAP and can include those with
      intact colons as well as those who have undergone surgical therapy. For those patients who
      have undergone partial or total colectomy, they must have documented residual polyps in their
      rectum for which they are receiving active surveillance.
