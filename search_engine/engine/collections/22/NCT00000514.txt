      More than 3 million persons in the United States over the age of 60 have isolated systolic
      hypertension. They face an excess risk (2-3 fold) of stroke, other cardiovascular disease and
      death. Population-based data show that the prevalence rises from approximately 8 percent in
      the age group 60-69 years to approximately 20 percent over the age of 80. Based on available
      data, an annual stroke rate of 2.0 percent has been estimated in this population. The
      full-scale clinical trial followed a pilot study conducted from 1980 to 1983. Recruitment in
      the trial began in March 1985 and was finished in January 1988. Follow-up ended in February
      1991. Data analysis continued through October 1996.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A randomized, double-blind trial in which 2,365 subjects were assigned to active treatment
      and 2,371 to placebo. For the active treatment group, a stepped-care regimen was used which
      included chlorthalidone 12.5 or 25 mg/day, and as needed, addition of atenolol 25 or 50
      mg/day or reserpine, 0.05 or 0.10 mg/day. Treatment goal was to reduce systolic blood
      pressure by at least 20 mm Hg from baseline and to below 160 mm Hg with minimal amounts of
      study medication. The primary endpoint was the incidence of fatal and non-fatal stroke.
      Secondary endpoints were cardiovascular and coronary morbidity and mortality, all-cause
      mortality, and quality-of-life measures.
