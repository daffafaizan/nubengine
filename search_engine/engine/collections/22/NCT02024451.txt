      from the outpatient clinic of Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation in Shin Kong
      Wu Ho-Su Memorial Hospital .

      The patients will be randomized to either treatment groups: group 1, radial extracorporeal
      shock wave therapy (RSWT group) and group 2, acupuncture group (AC group).

      All treatments will be given in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, and
      will be handled by a physiatrist who is familiar with both kinds of therapy.

      The RSWT is delivered at 2 Hz with 2000 shock waves and the energy level of 0.056 mJ / mm2 in
      the trapezius muscle. Treatment point is the origin attachment of upper trapezius at the
      external occipital protuberance. RSWT will be performed once per week, and will be continued
      for 3 weeks.

      Acupuncture is performed at Fenfchi (GB20) point over upper back. This acupoint is a common
      local point for treating upper back pain. Acupuncture therapy will be provided by the same
      physiatrist to all patients.

      The primary outcome measures are VAS for pain and pain threshold. The secondary outcome
      measures are neck disability index, and patients' satisfaction. All subjects will be assessed
      by an independent, blinded investigator at baseline, post treatment and at 1-month after the
      treatments are completed.
