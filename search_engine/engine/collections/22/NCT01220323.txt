      applied via scalp electrodes to modulate the level of cortical excitability.Several studies
      have demonstrated that tDCS applied over the sensory-motor cortex has been able to decrease
      pain sensation and to increase pain threshold in healthy subjects and in chronic pain
      patients.

      The aim of this study was to test whether daily sessions of anodal tDCS repeated for 5
      consecutive days may be effective in reducing pain in a large number of chronic pain
      patients.

      Patients will receive sham tDCS or real tDCS in a 5-day period of treatment in a randomized,
      sham controlled study. The participants will be divided to 2 groups of 50 each. One group
      will receive 5 days period of 20 min 2mA tDCS over the lt M1 and the other will receive sham
      stimulation. X week later the groups will switch to the other arm.

      Pain will be measured using visual analog scale (VAS) for pain and the short form McGill
      questionnaire (SF-MPQ). Disability will be measured using the ( Pain Disability Index (PDI)
      of Life-54 scale (MSQoL-54). Depressive symptoms and anxiety will also be evaluated using the
      Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale and the State-trait Anxiety Inventory
      (STAI). Cognitive function will be mesured using minimental test. Evaluations will be
      performed at baseline, immediately after the end of treatment, and once a week during a
      3-week follow-up period.
