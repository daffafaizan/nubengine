      intervention for co-occurring SUDs and anxiety. In the proposed study, the investigators will
      develop, refine, and pilot-test an innovative cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for patients
      who suffer from substance use disorders as well as anxiety. The goal of the research group in
      the proposed study is to design a protocol that can be testable on a larger sample within an
      externally-funded, randomized controlled trial. The investigators plan to submit a proposal
      for this larger grant to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, as outlined in our external
      funding statement.

      Research questions include determining whether a broadly-applicable anxiety sensitivity based
      intervention can significantly decrease both substance misuse and anxiety. Secondary aims
      include examining the impact of this intervention on general functioning and
      depressive/anxious symptoms. In this translational research project, strategies that have
      been demonstrated to impact the psychological mechanisms thought to underlie both illnesses
      will be tested in a "real world" clinical setting.
