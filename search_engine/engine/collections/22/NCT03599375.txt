      recurrent or refractory CD19+ B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia patients will be
      enrolled.After recruiting eligible patients,autologous peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells(PBMCs) will be purified from whole blood.The CD3+ T cells were subsequently selected
      and re-stimulated by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies.T cells will be transduced
      with lentiviral vector for the generation of the CD19 CART cell and administered by i.v.
      injection.The purpose of current study is to determine the safety and clinical efficacy of
      CD19 CAR T cells therapy in patients with recurrent or refractory CD19+ ALL.
