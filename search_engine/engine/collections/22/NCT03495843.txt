      routine. It is often performed as a manual PA-pressure test in the prone position. The spinal
      stiffness is the result of the resistance from the active, passive and neurological
      subsystems, like muscles (active), ligaments, joint capsule and the skin (passive). Further
      research had shown, that the spinal stiffness depends also from other factors. It is
      increased by axial compression. A better understanding of spinal stiffness leads to novel
      insights into spinal stabilization mechanisms.
