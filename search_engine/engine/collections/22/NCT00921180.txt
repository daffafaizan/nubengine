      millions worldwide. Currently, peginterferon alfa-2a or oral nucleos(t)ides are approved for
      the treatment with HBeAg positive CHB, with the overall HBeAg seroconversion far from
      satisfactory. Therefore, efforts on the various combinations with the currently available
      drugs are needed to improve the overall response rates. The simultaneous combination therapy
      with oral nucleoside and peginterferon alfa-2a from large-scaled randomized trials did not
      show a superior response rate over peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy. Recently, sequential
      monotherapy with lamivudine for the first 4 weeks, followed by weekly peginterferon alfa-2a
      has shown favorable HBeAg seroconversion rate over peginterferon alfa-2a monotherapy, based
      on the assumption that early viral suppression by lamivudine can restore the immune function
      to facilitate the later immunomodulatory response by peginterferon alfa-2a. With the recent
      introduction of entecavir, the more potent oral nucleoside with few drug resistance,
      sequential monotherapy with entecavir can potently suppress HBV DNA with 4 weeks of
      treatment, which may facilitate the response of peginterferon alfa-2a to achieve HBeAg
      seroconversion. Therefore, we aimed to conduct a placebo controlled randomized control trial
      to evaluate of adding entecavir early in the course of therapy can improve the treatment
      response.
