      recruited from seven hospitals in China. On the basis of standard-of-care, patients in
      treatment group inhaled H2-O2 (66% hydrogen; 33% oxygen) at 3 L/min via nasal cannula by
      using the Hydrogen/Oxygen Generator (model AMS-H-03, Shanghai Asclepius Meditech Co., Ltd.,
      China) until discharge. Patients in control group received standard-of-care (consisting of
      oxygen therapy) alone until discharge. Clinical assessments included the five-category
      ordinal scale, four-category ordinary scale of dyspnea, coughing, chest distress and chest
      pain (0: None; 1: Mild; 2: Moderate; 3: Severe; 4: Very severe) and adverse events, performed
      on admission, at enrollment, at day 2 and 3 after randomization, and the day before
      discharge. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with improved disease severity
      (by at least one scale). Secondary endpoints comprised the change from baseline in oxygen
      saturation and symptom scales.
