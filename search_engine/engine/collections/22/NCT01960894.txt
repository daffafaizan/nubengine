      precluding routine use in the majority of patients, or fail to discriminate myocardial,
      hemodynamic and structural factors, rendering assessment imprecise and incomplete.

      Key question: Can we reliably obtain LV functional characteristics by non-invasive means,
      while being able to differentiate more precisely the factors involved? Proposed research: We
      aim to develop a non-invasive method for pressure-volume analysis (NIPVA) of the LV by
      combining echo-Doppler, peripheral blood pressure measurements and biomechanical modelling.
      The validity of this approach will be established by comparison with gold standard invasive
      measurements of pressure-volume relationships in patients undergoing cardiac catheterization.
      Test-retest reproducibility will be also assessed . We hypothesise that NIPVA will provide
      reproducible and valid measures of LV function and be more widely applicable.
