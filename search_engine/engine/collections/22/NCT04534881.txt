      therapy has increased manifold in the last decade. Testosterone therapy in transgender men
      (also known as female-to-male transgender or transmen) and estrogen therapy in transgender
      women (also known as male-to-female transgender or transwomen) respectively is the mainstay
      of hormone regimen.Transwomen, who are genetically men, receive estradiol replacement with
      the aim of suppressing serum testosterone and achieving serum estradiol concentrations that
      mimic the serum concentrations of biological women. This leads to an increase in fat mass,
      breast growth and decreases in lean mass and masculine pattern hair. However, the results of
      these changes are often less than satisfactory and additional therapy is required.

      Breast development is a major concern for transgender females. There is a great deal of
      variability among individuals, as evidenced during pubertal development.Transgender women do
      not achieve the same level of breast development as cisgender women do after puberty.
      Typically, transgender women plateau at Tanner stage III and half of the transgender women
      have a AAA cup size or less.Investigators plan to conduct a randomized, placebo controlled
      double blind study evaluating the effect of adding progesterone for 6 months to transwomen
      who are being treated with estradiol. The hypothesis is that progesterone will decrease serum
      testosterone concentrations as compared to placebo and increase breast size. Investigators
      will also assess its role in mood, sleep, scalp hair and androgenic hair growth.
