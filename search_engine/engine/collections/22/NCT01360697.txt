    
      In 2007, supported by an educational grant, a charitable organization named the Asia Diabetes
      Foundation (ADF) (www.adf.org.hk) was established to develop the Joint Asia Diabetes
      Evaluation (JADE) Program, which comprises a web-based disease management program to enable
      doctors, nurses and other care personnel to manage people with diabetes in an integrated and
      effective manner. The JADE electronic portal (e portal) provides a virtual platform to
      facilitate implementation of evidence-based clinical protocols with ongoing data collection,
      management and analysis to track performance for quality assurance and improvement purposes.
      The JADE Program also incorporates validated risk equations developed by the Chinese
      University of Hong Kong (CUHK) Diabetes Care & Research Group to stratify patients into
      various risk levels for recommendation of triage into different care protocols with decision
      supports. This clinical information, presented in the forms of charts and time trends, can be
      communicated to patients and care providers to motivate behavioral changes, set treatment
      goals and attain targets.

      By participating in the JADE Program, the doctors will be able to create their own diabetes
      registry to benchmark their performance including adherence to procedures, recall of default
      patients and rate of attainment of treatment targets. In this regard, the implementation of
      the full JADE Program requires changes in the practice environment and deployment of
      additional manpower (e.g. a nurse and a HCA) to enter data and provide reminders to patients
      and doctors to improve adherence to protocols.

      It is anticipated that the cost-effectiveness of the structured (JADE group) versus usual
      (non-JADE group) care on rates of attainment of multiple treatment targets, which will
      translate into clinical outcomes in the long term, will eventually change practice and policy
      to make quality diabetes care more affordable, sustainable and accessible in China.

      In this 1-year multi-centre randomized study, the investigators shall use a web-based disease
      management program (JADE e portal) to facilitate implementation of structured care with the
      following objectives:

        -  To evaluate the reach, adoption and acceptability of the JADE e portal by patients and
           health care team

        -  To compare the effectiveness of the JADE versus non-JADE Program in attainment of
           treatment targets, improvement of quality of life and changes in behaviours

        -  To document the pattern of complications, risk factors, use of medications and quality
           of life in type 2 diabetic patients in Jiangsu and Anhui, China.
