      I. To develop and test the feasibility of a standardized 12-week online hatha yoga
      intervention (n=30) of breathing and movement incorporating both restorative poses, breathing
      techniques, guided meditation.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the yoga intervention in relation to self-reported levels of stress and
      quality of life in cancer survivors (n=30).

      II. Feasibility of collecting blood and saliva at baseline and post-intervention for stress
      biomarkers, including cortisol and norepinephrine.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To determine how behavior change, quality of life (QoL), and biomarkers of adrenergic
      stress, inflammation, and immunosuppression are affected by a 12-week online yoga program
      completed by cancer survivors.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive online yoga intervention once a week (QW) for 12 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 3 months.
