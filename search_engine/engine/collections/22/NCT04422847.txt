      clinicaltrials.gov, the study will include patients meeting inclusive criteria for whom
      primary surgery for a cleft facial defect will be indicated.

      Patients will be divided into two groups based on the type of surgery. Group 1 will include
      patients with unilateral or bilateral cleft lip and alveolus (U/BCLA) or unilateral or
      bilateral cleft lip, alveolus and palate (total cleft; U/BCLAP) who underwent primary lip
      reconstruction within 0-3 months of age. Group 2 will include patients with isolated cleft
      palate (ICP) and patients with U/BCLAP who underwent primary cleft reconstruction between 6
      and 18 months of age.

      Patients in the pediatric plastic surgery clinic of the Department of Pediatric Surgery,
      Orthopedics and Traumatology will be randomized with a 1:1 allocation based on the day of
      operation to the intervention group (3D protective obturator) and the control group (standard
      procedure without the 3D obturator). Patients enrolled in the intervention group will have an
      intraoral scan of the palate, alveolar arch, and upper vestibular area before surgery. Based
      on this 3D visualization of precise anatomical conditions in the oral cavity, a form
      (negative unique impression of the upper jaw and palato-alveolar conditions) for casting of a
      protective obturator (splint), used during intubation to cover the defect of the alveolar
      arch and palate will be created on a 3D printer, in cooperation with the Faculty of
      Mechanical Engineering (Department of Mechanics of Bodies, Mechatronics and Biomechanics) of
      Brno University of Technology. For the production of the obturator, a silicone certified for
      use in the oral cavity will be used.

      The main objective of the research will be to find out how the use of a protective obturator
      (splint) will improve the protection of tissues at the cleft site and whether intubation will
      be facilitated in pediatric patients with orofacial clefts with congenital atypical
      anatomical conditions in the oral cavity.
