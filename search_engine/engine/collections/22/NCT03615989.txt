      Canada suffer from osteoporosis. Research that emphasizes the treatment of this disease is
      important, but so is research that focuses on prevention; reducing bone loss and/or
      increasing bone mass when young. In addition, inflammation is an issue as it strongly relates
      to chronic disease. Countermeasures to improve bone health and inflammation, such as
      nutrition and exercise, should be explored and implemented. The proposed research combines
      both nutrition and exercise along with the assessment of bone turnover markers and
      inflammation in healthy young females, and aims to determine whether dairy with and without
      creatine versus a carbohydrate-based beverage positively impacts acute bone turnover and the
      inflammatory response following a bout of resistance and plyometric exercise.

      Design: Randomized controlled crossover trial.

      Participants: 10-15 healthy university aged females.

      Methods: Participants will be asked to complete up to 3 different acute exercise and
      nutritional supplement trials. Each trial will be assigned in random order. The three trials
      are: 1) exercise+carbohydrate (CHO), 2) exercise+milk (Milk), and 3) exercise+milk+creatine
      (Cre). The whole study will take a maximum of 8-12 weeks to complete as each supplement trial
      will be separated by 2-4 weeks. Each treatment is outlined below.

      Anticipated Results: The investigators anticipate that dairy and exercise will have a greater
      positive impact on acute bone cell activity and inflammation in healthy young females more
      than exercise and CHO. Creatine+milk may impact bone more so than milk alone. Inflammation
      may not be impacted by creatine.
