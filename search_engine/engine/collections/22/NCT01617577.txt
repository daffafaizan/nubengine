      placebo followed by GCSF=Arm2). Total length of study for each subject was 14 weeks, with
      crossover on week 7.

      Linear regression models could not be used because of the small number of subjects; n = 5 in
      the first Arm who received G-CSF before crossover to the placebo phase and n = 3 in Arm 2
      (who received placebo first before crossover to the G-CSF treatment phase). The general rule
      for the sample size required for regression analysis is n = 15 per covariate. Therefore,
      comparison of the final cognitive scores on visit 5 (week 14) were compared to scores at
      baseline (visit 1) for all subjects (n = 8) using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Plasma
      cytokine changes were plotted to compare effects following G-CSF to that following placebo,
      regardless of the order of treatment. Wilcoxon sum rank test was used to test differences
      between G-CSF treatment and placebo treatment at specific intervals after treatment.
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS Version 19) was used for all data analysis.
