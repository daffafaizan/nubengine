      risk of cardiovascular (CV) disease and mortality. A major factor contributing to increased
      CV risk in these patients is chronic elevation of sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity.
      New therapeutic strategies to safely and effectively ameliorate SNS over-activity are of
      paramount importance to improve clinical outcomes in this highly prevalent and high-risk
      patient population.

      This study will test whether mindfulness meditation (MM) improves sympathetic function in
      chronic kidney disease (CKD) and whether transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS)
      optimizes the sympatho-inhibitory effects of mindfulness meditation (MM) and restores
      autonomic balance in CKD patients.
