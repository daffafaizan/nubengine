      Cochin Hospital for severe adhesive capsulitis for whom first-line medical treatment is not
      effective. The first-line treatment including analgesic, NSAIDs and / or intra-articular
      infiltration of a corticosteroid derivative and multi-weekly physiotherapy

      These patients are integrated into a usual protocol (routine care) consisting of performing
      an MRI with intravenous injection of gadolinium to confirm the diagnostic and eliminated
      others causes of shoulder stiffness. IV gadolinium-enhanced MRI can increase the performance
      of the signal analysis changes of the Synovium and capsule in the Axillary Recess and Rotator
      interval as compared with unenhanced measures The treatment consists in one to three
      arthrographic distensions by physiological serum, xylocaine 1% and injection of an ampoule of
      corticosteroids (DIPROSTENE) associated with intensive (immediate mobilization, recovery of
      maximum amplitudes by the physiotherapist and on arthro-motor). The primary objective of
      arthrographic distension is the expansion and rupture of the glenohumeral capsule in the
      subscapularis recess. It consists after local anesthesia, in an injection under pressure of
      air or liquid - opacifier or physiological serum - in the glenohumeral joint associated with
      an infiltration of cortisone derivatives at the end of the operation. Physical treatment
      aimed at rapid amplitude gain is started immediately after the arthrographic distension,
      under the effect of local anesthesia. It is at best continued daily at a rate of 2 to 8 hours
      per day for one to 2 weeks. Depending on the effect obtained on pain and the daily
      progression of rehabilitation, arthro-distension may be repeated once or twice during the
      mobilization period.
