      chemotherapy. In hematology, dysgeusia depends on the type of graft and the treatments
      themselves. It impacts the quality of life, leads to significant emotional and social
      consequences, affects the intake, weight and nutritional status of patients.

      Olfactory-taste disorders can be assessed using subjective and objective tests. There are no
      international clinical recommendations for the management of taste and olfactory disturbances
      associated with chemotherapy in hematological cancers. Also, this study proposes to evaluate
      a taste and olfaction rehabilitation program based on national standards and recent research.
      It will help fill gaps in the assessment and management of autografted patients treated with
      high-dose Melphalan.

      Hypothesis is that this sensory rehabilitation program should make it possible to reduce the
      olfactory-gustatory changes in patients who have been treated with Melphalan and
      significantly improve their quality of life, their psychological well-being and their
      nutrition.
