        -  Determine the efficacy of photodynamic therapy with porfimer sodium in patients with
           pre-malignant lesions, carcinoma in situ, select superficial squamous cell carcinoma of
           the oral cavity, oropharynx, or larynx, or condemned mucosa syndrome in the upper
           aerodigestive tract.

        -  Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease condition (benign vs malignant).

      Patients receive porfimer sodium IV over 3-5 minutes on day 1 and laser light activation on
      day 3 or 4.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 3 and 4 months and then
      periodically for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 47 patients will be accrued for this study.
