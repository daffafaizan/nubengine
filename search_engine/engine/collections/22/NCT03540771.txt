    
      This is a two armed multicenter cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT), to assess the
      effectiveness of two pragmatic PC models for patients with ESLD (Consultative PC vs. Trained
      hepatologist led PC). To prevent bias at the level of providers, randomization will take
      place at the level of clinical centers; however patients will be the unit of inference.
      Parallel to this cluster-RCT, a qualitative study will be undertaken to evaluate the
      patient/caregiver experiences in the two PC models, using semi structured interviews.

      To execute this project, we have identified 14 clinical centers to participate; 7 Veterans
      Health Administration (VHA) systems and 7 non-VHA, Academic Medical Centers.

      Comparative Approaches:

        1. Consultative PC led approach (Model 1): The PC model will include: 1) routine PC
           consults, using a standardized checklist , 2) in-person visits at initial, 1, 2 and 3
           months. .

        2. Trained hepatologist led PC (Model 2): The Hepatologist Led PC model will comprise: 1)
           Hepatologist training (through E Learning modules), and 2) in person visits utilizing
           the same PC checklist as utilized in Model 1. The in-person visits will occur at
           initial, 1, 2 and 3 months i.e. similar to Model 1 and follow the same visit specified
           agenda.

      Adult patients 18 years of age or older will be enrolled. With 14 clinical centers in
      different geographic locations and diversity in race/ ethnicity, 1260 patient/ caregiver
      dyads will be enrolled.
