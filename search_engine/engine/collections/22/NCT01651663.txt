      Health Organization estimates that the average global burden of interpandemic influenza is
      approximately 1 billion cases of influenza, from 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and
      from 300 000 to 500 000 deaths annually. Arbidol (Umifenovir) is currently licensed for the
      treatment and prevention of influenza in Russian Federation. Arbidol (Umifenovir) has a
      direct antiviral effect. Arbidol (Umifenovir) belongs to fusion inhibitors; it interacts with
      the virus hemagglutinin and thus prevents fusion of the viral envelope with cell membranes.
      The aim of the study is to obtain additional data on safety and therapeutic efficacy of
      investigational product Arbidol (Umifenovir) in patients with a diagnosis of influenza and
      common cold. Furthermore, study of viral resistance in patients with seasonal influenza
      infection treated with Arbidol (Umifenovir) will be performed.
