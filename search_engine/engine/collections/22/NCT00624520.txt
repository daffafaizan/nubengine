    
      The study is a randomized controlled small clinical trial designed to determine whether a
      10-week program of group cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) versus a control
      "Patient Education" program can improve hemodynamic responses to mental stress testing in
      patients with Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillators. Comparison will be made between groups
      of heart rate and blood pressure responses to mental arithmetic and anger-recall mental
      stress, psychometric profiles, arrhythmia frequency and implantable cardioverter
      defibrillator firings before, immediately and up to 6 months after intervention. If benefit
      of CBSM is proven, study findings could lead to wider use of stress management programs, with
      increased life expectancy for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator patients.
