      mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis on admission and fulfilling criteria of weaning
      from mechanical ventilation (MV), will undergo diaphragm ultrasound during spontaneous
      breathing trial on T-piece. We will measure diaphragm excursion (DE), diaphragm thickness
      (DT) and calculate diaphragm thickness fraction (DTF):

      DT during inspiration - DT during expiration / DT during expiration

      According to weaning outcome, patients will be divided into 2 groups:

        -  Successful weaning group

        -  Weaning failure group

      By statistical analysis we will define the cut off value and area under curve (AUC) for DE
      and DTF and we can confirm if DE and DTF using ultrasound can be used as predictors for
      weaning from MV or not
