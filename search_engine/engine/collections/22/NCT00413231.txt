      rest of the body. An aneurysm is a weakening in the artery wall that will become a bulge in
      the aorta. If left untreated, this bulge may continue to grow larger and may rupture (break
      open) with fatal consequences. In this research study we are investigating a device that can
      be placed in the aorta to exclude the weakened part of the artery wall and restore blood
      flow. Information will be collected on the performance of the device for 5 years.
