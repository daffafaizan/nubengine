      chosen for two fundamental reasons for this study: 1) The use of muscle contraction to
      generate a detectable evoked potential signal allows for targeting of a precise area within
      M1 with tFUS, and 2) It is known that M1 is involved in fast learning of sequential motor
      tasks By targeting M1 with tFUS in neurologically healthy volunteers, we can study the
      effects of tFUS on motor learning measures (e.g., reaction time, accuracy) while a subject is
      performing a finger tapping motor learning task. If ultrasound is proven efficacious for
      stimulating the motor cortex, non-surgical ultrasound could potentially replace costly and
      risky surgery for the treatment of brain disorders as is common with deep brain stimulation
      for essential tremor or Parkinson's disease. There is currently no way to affect brain tissue
      deep into the cortex without surgery, genetic alteration or viral vectors (the latter two are
      not approved for human use). This technology is non-surgical and as invasive as any
      diagnostic ultrasound exam. With success, transcranial focused ultrasound could become useful
      world-wide as a cheap, portable and effective tool for human brain mapping efforts as well as
      for the diagnosis and potential treatment of a broad range of psychiatric and neurological
      disorders.
