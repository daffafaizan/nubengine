      stabilizing muscles. This might be achieved by using a sling suspension exercise systems.
      Redcord is a trademark for Sling Exercise Therapy. Suspension exercise training has been
      shown to improves functional movement patterns more effectively than traditional exercise by
      creating a challenging and pain free environment for movement re-training. Another commonly
      used option in the treatment of juvenile osteochondrosis is Gymball, also known as Swissball
      core training programmes that are popular trends in physiotherapy and strength and
      conditioning programs. Benefits of Gymball core training exercises that facilitate spinal
      stability and balance have often been emphasized by researchers in development of strength
      and endurance, flexibility, and neuromuscular control as a cost effective and enjoyable way
      to treat and prevent back pain. Both exercises modes are used in treatment of back pain and
      muscle training in young people with juvenile osteochondrosis, what is why this study aims to
      compare Sling Suspension therapy with Gymball exercise in this population.
