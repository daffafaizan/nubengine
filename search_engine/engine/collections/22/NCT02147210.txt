      poor prognostic factor affecting transplant survival. Diagnosis remains only microscopic and
      lesions are irreversible. Recent studies prove that there is a strong correlation between CTG
      and antibody mediated rejection (AMR) with a possible link with chronic aggression of the
      endothelial cell. However, for unknown reason, all AMR does not lead to a CTG. Our recent
      data on mice demonstrated that ephrin-B1 is expressed in the glomerular endothelial cells and
      knockout mice for the gene encoding ephrin-B1 develop progressively ultrastructural
      glomerular lesions close to modifications observed in CTG, as well as proteinuria and chronic
      renal failure, suggesting that ephrin B1 could participate to CTG. Moreover, in a preliminary
      study on human kidney transplant biopsy we observed decrease in ephrin-B1 immunofluorescence
      on glomerulus when CTG, even in low grade. These data, and ultrastructural modifications in
      Knock Out (KO) mice suggest that early regulation of kidney expression of ephrin-B1 in the
      glomerulus may occur during the process leading to the CTG as antibody-mediated kidney
      rejection (AMR).

      The purpose of the study is to determinate if ephrin-B1 expression is modified in CTG.
