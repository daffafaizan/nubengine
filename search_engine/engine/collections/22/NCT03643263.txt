      patients with bronchiectasis, and the relationship between pH and the severity of
      bronchiectasis. Further clarify the link between EBC pH and the risk of future acute
      exacerbations, mortality and lung function decline through a one-year follow-up. Hoping to
      explore new validated biomarkers of the disease severity and progression in bronchiectasis.
      During the observation, EBC pH and other valid indicators will be measured when patients were
      enrolled. In the subgroup study, these indicators were tested repeatedly in exacerbation
      start, exacerbation recovery (after 14 days of antibiotic therapy), stable2 (at the second
      stable measurement 6 months later). To determine whether it could be used as an "signal
      searching" or "early efficacy" end-point for new antibiotics or anti-inflammatory therapies
