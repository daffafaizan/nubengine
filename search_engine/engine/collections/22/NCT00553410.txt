      Primary

        -  Compare the disease-free survival (DFS) of postmenopausal women treated with continuous
           letrozole for 5 years vs intermittent letrozole over a 5-year period.

      Secondary

        -  Compare overall survival of patients treated with these two regimens.

        -  Compare distant DFS of these patients.

        -  Compare breast cancer-free interval of these patients.

        -  Compare sites of first DFS failure in these patients.

        -  Compare second (nonbreast) malignancies in these patients.

        -  Compare deaths without prior cancer events in these patients.

        -  Compare adverse events resulting from these two regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to treatment center
      and type of prior endocrine therapy (selective estrogen receptor modulators [SERMs] alone vs
      aromatase inhibitors [AIs] alone vs both SERMs and AIs each for at least 1 month). Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral letrozole daily for 5 years.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral letrozole daily for the first 9 months of years 1 through
           4, followed by 12 months in year 5.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed annually.
