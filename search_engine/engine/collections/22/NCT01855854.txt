      invasion, metastasis, and resistance to apoptosis.EGFR is overexpressed in many epithelial
      malignancies and therefore makes an attractive therapeutic target.This study is designed to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of icotinib in treating advanced carcinoma of the
      gastroesophageal junction and esophagus with EGFR overexpression (IHC 3+) or positive FISH,
      the primary endpoint is objective response rates. Secondary endpoints include progress-free
      survival, overall survival, safety and so on.
