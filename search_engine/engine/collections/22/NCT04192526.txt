      estimated that around 30% of global suicides are due to pesticide self-poisoning . Metal
      phosphides pesticides are highly toxic, low cost, and are easily accessible as rodenticide
      agents and used for self-poisoning . aluminum phosphide (ALP) are among the most important
      metal phosphides. Poisoning with these agents is frequently seen in India, Srilanka and Iran.
      In a recent study, the incidence of fatal aluminum phosphide poisoning cases referred for
      phosphine analysis was 5.22 and 37.02 per million of population of Tehran, Iran in 2006 and
      2013, respectively (9).The mechanism of toxicity is not clearly defined. ALP toxicity is
      related to the production of phosphine gas. Phosphine inhibits cytochrome c oxidase and
      causes mitochondrial destruction and inhibits oxidative respiration which leads to anaerobic
      metabolism, severe metabolic acidosis, multi-organ dysfunction and death. Phosphine can lead
      to severe cardiac suppression and cardiogenic shock. One of the proposed mechanisms of
      toxicity is the reduction of the true cholinesterase and serum cholinesterase
      (butyrylcholinesterase) enzyme, but usually do not show obvious clinical manifestations .
