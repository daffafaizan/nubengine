      more with losing weight, and drop out of treatment more frequently than those without
      attention difficulties. Adaptive working memory training has been used to strengthen working
      memory and to mediate the symptoms associated with ADHD. The adaptive training becomes
      progressively more challenging as participants master each level of the training, while
      non-adaptive training remains at the same level throughout. Both groups will attend 24
      weekly, in-person weight management classes on the University of Vermont Campus. Both groups
      will do cognitive training on their own home computers five days a week for 30-40 minutes for
      five weeks concurrently while engaged in the weight loss program.
