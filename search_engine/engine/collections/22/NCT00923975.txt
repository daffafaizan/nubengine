      information to lay persons and their health care professionals. With this data management
      system glucose results from the DIDGET TM meter can be uploaded to a secure website and used
      by adults with diabetes, by parents and guardians of children with diabetes, and by health
      care professionals to monitor diabetes by recognizing trends and patterns in blood sugar
      levels. During the study subjects performed specific tasks, such as uploading meter results
      and displaying reports. The study evaluates the subjects' success in using the software
      program, the program's ease of use, clarity and usefulness of user instructions, and user
      satisfaction with the diabetes data management program.
