      Magnesium , Zinc and is a good source for polyphenols .Polyphenols molecules have been found
      to possess antioxidant properties and may effects the expression of different genes . Recent
      studies indicate that among foods that contain polyphenols, juice extracted from the
      pomegranate has the highest concentration of measurable polyphenols . Pomegranates have shown
      inhibitory effect on NF-κB and the MAP kinases JNK and ERK, which are critical steps in the
      cascade of events leading to inflammatory response. The NF- κB pathway is activated in
      response to bacterial infection and initiates the inflammatory cascade, which may explain the
      protective effect of Pomegranates on bacterial infections.
