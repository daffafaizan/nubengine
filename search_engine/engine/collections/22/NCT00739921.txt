      in the nose and home environment can be correlated with the outcomes of the following quality
      of life (QOL) instruments: Medical Outcomes Study 36-item Short Form (SF-36) and the
      Sino-Nasal Outcomes Study - 20 Questions (SNOT-20).

      The study design involves case control Polymerase Chain reaction (PCR) analysis of nasal
      mucosal swabs, saliva swabs, blood serum, and home vacuum cleaner bags in patients with
      sinusitis and normal controls.

      The hypothesis is that the quantity and type of fungal DNA present in the nose and home
      environment are directly correlated with quality of life. Our research aims to both quantify
      the amount of fungi present in the nasal mucosa as well as to measure the severity of the
      patient's chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) as a function of SNOT-20 and SF-36 outcomes
      questionnaires. We hypothesize that the amount and type of fungi present in the nose and home
      environment will correlate with the severity of the patients' symptoms of CRS.
