      vaccine response is modified according to the clinical phenotype of the disease and/or
      treatment with corticosteroids and immunosuppressants. However, sarcoidosis is accompanied by
      numerous disturbances of the immune system, including a tendency to anergy which may affect
      the efficacy of the vaccine, especially when the disease is active and severe. In addition,
      the tolerance of influenza vaccination in patients with sarcoidosis has not been studied
      yet.The influenza vaccination in sarcoidosis is a common practice among medical specialists
      who care for patients with sarcoidosis, either internists or lung specialists.. However, the
      practice of this vaccination is not based on scientific evidence, because there are no data
      establishing the efficacy and safety of influenza vaccination in sarcoidosis.Thus, it is
      possible that the influenza vaccine is less immunogenic in patients with sarcoidosis than in
      healthy adults, which may reduce the clinical effectiveness of vaccination. It therefore
      seems essential to determine the efficacy and safety of this vaccine, which is widely
      practiced. Poor efficiency could lead to the development of different vaccination strategies,
      based in particular on the administration of adjuvanted vaccines.
