      recruited to participate in a 3 month clinical trial on the efficacy of trazodone versus CBT,
      with a 6 month follow up. The primary outcome measure will be objective sleep duration as
      measured by both actigraphy and polysomnography. The secondary outcome measure will be
      subjective severity of sleep disturbance.
