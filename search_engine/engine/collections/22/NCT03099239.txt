      two, and three intravenous doses of hCT-MSC in young children with ASD. Children ages two to
      11 years with ASD will be eligible to participate. All participants will receive intravenous
      infusion(s) of CTCs. The first cohort of three patients will receive a single dose. If there
      are no safety concerns, the second cohort of three patients will receive two doses, given two
      months apart. The third cohort will consist of six patients, each of whom will receive three
      hCT-MSC infusions with a two-month interval between doses. All participants will have an
      initial clinical evaluation to verify the diagnosis of ASD and confirm protocol eligibility.
      The main endpoint is safety, for which acute infusion reactions and incidence of infections
      will be assessed. ASD-specific outcome measures, described below, will be assessed at
      baseline and six months from baseline and results will be described.
