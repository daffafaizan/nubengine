    
      In consecutive patients scheduled for DIEP flap surgery, all hemodynamic and respiratory
      variables are recorded electronically for subsequent off line analysis.

      A systolic blood pressure of minimal 100 mmHg will be maintained during surgery by
      optimization of the cardiac preload and titrated norepinephrine (1.5 µg/kg/h) or
      phenylephrine (15 µg/kg/h) administration. Cardiac preload optimization will be based on
      pulse pressure variation (PPV) measurement, which is calculated by pulse contour analysis of
      the radial arterial pressure curve. Following the international goal-directed fluid therapy
      guidelines, plasmalyte will be administrated if the PPV>11%.

      The tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) will be measured by transthoracic
      echocardiography (TTE) to evaluate the inotropic effect of norepinephrine and phenylephrine.
      In addition, TTE will be used to measure the cardiac output to calibrate the PPV
      measurements.
