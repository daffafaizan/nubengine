      insulin resistant subjects. An increase in intrahepatic lipids (hepatic steatosis) is highly
      prevalent in patients with the metabolic syndrome and may be used as a marker of altered
      hepatic lipid metabolism. Such an increased hepatic lipids content can be experimentally
      produced in healthy humans by a 6-day high fructose diet.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether coffee prevents hepatic lipid deposition in
      healthy male subjects fed a fructose-rich hypercaloric diet. Both caffeine and antioxidants
      (yet unspecified) may be involved.. To sort out the role of caffeine and antioxidants, we
      will test 3 different soluble coffee, ie fully torrefied decaffeinated coffee , partially
      torrefied decaffeinated coffee, and partially torrefied caffeinated coffee.
