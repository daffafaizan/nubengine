      Department. After verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria by principal
      investigator and signature of consent, patients will be randomized by 1: 1 randomization
      (centralized randomization by statistician into 2 groups at M0). They will participate in
      sessions in a deferred manner due to two per week for each group:

        -  Interventional "A" group: 32 sessions (on average 2/week) performed from M0 to M4 in 15
           patients.

        -  Control "B" group: 16 sessions (on average 2/week) performed from M2 to M4 in 15
           patients.

      Patients of "B" group will be not performing sessions with "A" group patients. Sessions
      lasting about 45 minutes will be proposed from Monday to Friday in a room planned from this
      activity within the CHU. Exercises will be adapted and personalized according to each one.
      Evaluations will be carried out at M0, M2 and at the end of the protocol at M4.

      Assessment of pain and stress will be done before and after each session. Final assessment
      will be done at 4 months after randomization. Fitness assessment and tai chi sessions will be
      conducted by APA student.
