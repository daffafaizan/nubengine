      infertility will reveal lower binding percentages than in couples with an identifiable cause
      of infertility either male factor or tubal factor We would like to determine if patients with
      abnormal HBA binding have decreased IVF outcome: decreases clinical pregnancy rate,
      implantation rate, and increased miscarriage rate
