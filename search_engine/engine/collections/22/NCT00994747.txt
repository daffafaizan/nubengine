      randomized into one of six groups (N=10-15 per group) differing in the timing and type of
      formula that the infant will be fed during each month of the 7-month exposure period. Each
      mother-infant dyad will be studied from the 2-3rd week of life until approximately 9 months
      of age. When the infant is less than three weeks of age and the mother's decision to formula
      feed is well established, infants will be randomized into one of six groups differing in the
      timing and type of formula that the infant will be fed during each month of the 7-month
      exposure period. One group (Control EEEEEEE) will be assigned to a milk-based formula,
      Enfamil (E), whereas another group (NNNNNNN) will be assigned to Nutramigen (N) during the
      entire 7-month period of this study. The other 4 groups will be assigned to feed Nutramigen
      for specified periods during their first seven months of life (Groups ENEEEEE, EEENEEE,
      ENNNEEE).

      A variety of methodologies developed in our laboratory will be employed to capture the
      infants' responses to a particular flavor or taste after the exposure period. That is, at the
      end of the exposure period, infants will be videotaped while they are 1) feeding formulas; 2)
      feeding foods (e.g., cereal; soups) that differ in flavors; and 3) exploring scented toys.
      Each month, infants will be weighed and measured for length as well as evaluated for
      cognitive and motor development and mothers will completed standardized questionnaires
      regarding infant temperament. A cheek swab from the mothers and infants will be obtained and
      genotyped for taste receptor and taste- and obesity- related genes.
