        -  Determine the clinical benefit, as measured by time to progression and overall survival,
           of chemo/hormonal therapy compared to androgen ablation alone, when given as the initial
           systemic treatment in patients with acinar adenocarcinoma of the prostate that is not
           amenable to local therapy.

        -  Validate the clinical significance of PSA criteria for progression.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients are treated with medical or surgical castration followed by an
           anti-androgen therapy with either flutamide, bicalutamide, or nilutamide.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive chemo/hormonal therapy for 3 eight week courses, followed by
           total androgen blockade. Each course consists of 6 weeks of cytotoxic therapy with
           doxorubicin, ketoconazole, vinblastine, and estramustine followed by 2 weeks of rest.
           These patients are also maintained on hydrocortisone both during treatment and during
           rest.

      Patients in arm II have a long-term central venous access device inserted.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 368 patients will be accrued for this study.
