      some patients it is refractory to conservative therapies such as physical therapy,
      acetaminophen, or NSAIDs. Subacromial injection of a corticosteroid can be used to improve
      shoulder pain in subacromial bursitis, however, there are few well done clinical trials
      guiding which type of corticosteroid and the dose that would be maximally effective and with
      the least amount of side effects.

      Methods: Our hypothesis is that both Methylprednisolone and Triamcinolone are equipotent but
      that 20 mg provides less relief that 40 mg injected. Subjects will be enrolled in this trial
      which lasts 6 weeks. Subjects will be randomized to 40 mg of methylprednisolone, 20 mg of
      methylprednisolone, 40 mg of triamcinolone, or 20 mg of triamcinolone. No placebo will be
      used as prior studies suggest that placebo with lidocaine is inferior to corticosteroid
      injection.

      Outcomes: Primary outcome with be the improvement in a functional measure of the shoulder,
      the QuickDASH Â®, at 6 weeks. Secondary outcomes will be improvement in reported pain (visual
      analogue scale) at 6 weeks and adverse events at all time points. Data will be collected in
      person at the time of injection and then by phone at day 3, day 21 (3 weeks), and day 42 (6
      weeks).
