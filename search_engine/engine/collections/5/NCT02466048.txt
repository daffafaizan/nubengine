    
      This study is an open-trial study. The study will be explained to the subjects and they
      voluntarily agreed to participate in it. Their eligibility to participate in the study will
      be checked, either the right or left side of one patient will be selected for the study
      group, and the other, for the control group, through randomization. In the area for the study
      group, autogenous bones and SurgiFillTM will be grafted; and in the area for the control
      group, only the autogenous bones will be grafted. They will be asked to follow the guidelines
      of the investigators during the study and to visit the hospital seven times, including for
      screening. At each visit, the subjects undergo an examination with doctors, a CT scan, a
      X-ray, and a SPECT/CT procedure to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SurgiFillâ„¢. (*If the
      subject gets surgery on the screening date, the total number of his or her visits will be
      six).
