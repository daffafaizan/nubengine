      safety of metformin for the treatment of simple and complex endometrial hyperplasia (EH)
      without atypia. Enrollment of patients will occur at UNC-Chapel Hill and Southern Pines
      Women's Health Center. Fifteen patients will be enrolled over the course of 1 year. Metformin
      will be initiated at 850 mg orally once daily, and titrated up to twice daily over a minimum
      of 1 months time. Treatment will last 12 weeks and then patients will undergo repeat
      endometrial biopsy to assess for regression or persistence of EH.
