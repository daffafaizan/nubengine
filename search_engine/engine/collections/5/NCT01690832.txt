    
      Patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) are at increased risk for acute kidney injury
      (AKI) when they undergo urgent/emergency coronary angiography.

      The optimal medical treatment for preventing the occurrence of contrast induced - acute
      kidney injury is still controversial.

      Fenoldopam mesylate is a dopamine A1 receptor agonist that augments renal plasma flow that
      has reduced the risk of radiocontrast dye nephropathy in some (but not all) preliminary
      studies.

      Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) is a new biomarker predictive for AKI
      already shown to be useful for earlier diagnosis of contrast induced nephropathy.

      The primary objective of this study is to to test the hypothesis that fenoldopam, in addition
      to standard treatment, reduce the occurrence of contrast induced - acute kidney injury in
      patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) undergoing urgent/emergency coronary angiography
      and/or percutaneous coronary intervention.

      Patients will be randomized to standard i.v. 1 ml/kg/h saline infusion (Gr. A, N= 50) or to a
      combination of i.v. 1 ml/kg/h saline infusion and fenoldopam administration (0.08 mcg/Kg/min)
      from 6 hours before the procedure to 12 hours after the procedure.

      Primary End-points

      • Incidence of contrast induced acute kidney injury

      Secondary End-points

      • Post-angiographic 48-h absolute increase in creatinine, absolute increase in estimated
      glomerular filtration rate, and Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) value
