      to improved memory, language and executive function compared to patients who receive a sham,
      control treatment. The improvement is defined as having higher performance on the California
      Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). Secondary Hypotheses are that:

        -  1: rTMS- will lead to higher performance on secondary cognitive measures relating to
           executive function and naming compared to performance by participants in the sham
           treatment group at the termination of treatment; and that

        -  2: rTMS-induced memory improvement parallels changes in serum and cerebrospinal fluid
           (CSF) brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels after treatment.
