      the factor VIII gene, that are associated with the development of inhibitors in severe
      hemophilia A and response to antigenic challenge by factor VIII. The study will involve three
      phases, enrolling family groups composed of brother pairs and their parents (Phase I) and
      siblings, a family group composed of a person with severe hemophilia and his parents (Phase
      II), and a group of unrelated people with severe hemophilia for the purpose of confirming
      associations identified in Phases I and II.
