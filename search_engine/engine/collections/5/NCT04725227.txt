      enables evaluation of the pulmonary blood flow. EIT might be helpful in establishing the
      hypoxemia etiology at bedside via combining regional ventilation and perfusion information.
      The objective of this study was to describe the physiological effects of prone position on
      respiratory mechanics, ventilation and pulmonary perfusion in patients with ARDS.
