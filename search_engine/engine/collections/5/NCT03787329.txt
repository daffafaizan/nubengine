      younger patients. Although the exact pathophysiology of AVN has not yet to be elucidated, the
      disease is characterized by a vascular insult to the blood supply of the femoral head, which
      can lead to collapse of the femoral head and subsequent degenerative changes. Mesenchymal
      stem cells (MSCs) are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into multiple mesenchymal
      tissues, including tenocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as well as being a source of
      multiple growth factors to establish an environment conducive to soft and hard tissue
      regeneration. As bone marrow concentration has high concentration of mesenchymal stem cells,
      several studies have applied the autologous bone marrow concentration in halting the
      progression of AVN of femoral head. However, a higher level of evidence for its use on
      patients suffering from femoral head avascular necrosis has not been reported. This clinical
      trial will evaluate and compare the eligible patients who undertake core decompression
      surgery plus intraoperative bone marrow concentration with those who received core
      decompression surgery only. All patients will be followed for one year and clinical and
      imaging outcomes will be compared and analyzed.
