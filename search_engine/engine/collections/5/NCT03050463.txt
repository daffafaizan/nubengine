      I. Examine affect reactivity and regulation among women with a recent diagnosis of breast
      cancer in comparison to healthy controls.

      II. Relate affect reactivity and regulation to choice of bilateral mastectomy (BLM).

      regulation.

      OUTLINE: Study plans to recruit total of 170 women. Participants will be assigned to 3 arms.
      For women diagnosed with breast cancer (total of 130) 65 with BLM as part of their cancer
      treatment and 65 non-BLM. The 3rd arm being 40 women with no cancer diagnosis as controls.

      Study protocol will be the same for all 170 Study participants. Active participation by each
      participant will be approximately 8 hours at baseline and 2 hours at 6, 12, and 18-month
      follow-ups. Baseline assessment involve completing a set of questionnaires, participating in
