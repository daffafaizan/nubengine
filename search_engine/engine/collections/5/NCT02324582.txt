      Phase I safety and efficacy study of MK-3475 therapy used in combination with bladder infused
      BCG treatment. The study will determine the safety of administering MK-3475 at a fixed dose
      every three weeks in conjunction with intravesicular BCG treatment in non-muscle invasive
      bladder cancer patients who had recurrence after two courses of induction (6 doses)
      intravesical therapy (two BCG courses, or one BCG course and one other approved intravesical
      therapies) administered within 12 months, or after one induction (6 doses) and one
      maintenance (3 doses) intravesical therapy (BCG). Subjects will have confirmation of bladder
      cancer non-invasive to the muscle. Approximately 20 subjects will be screened to treat 15
      eligible subjects with high risk superficial bladder cancer who have had transurethral
      resection of their bladder tumor.

      The rationale for the use of the indicated dose of TICEÂ® BCG is based upon FDA approved and
      commercially provided package insert/ instructions for use of the product. BCG installation
      has been used to treat non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer for more than 30 years. It is one
      of the most successful biotherapies for cancer in use. Despite long clinical experience with
      BCG, the mechanism of its therapeutic effect is still under investigation.

      The first 3 subjects will be treated at a dose of 100 mg MK-3475 to ensure safety for the
      combination. If no safety or efficacy issues are present, dosing will be escalated to 200 mg
      MK-3475 every 3 weeks.
