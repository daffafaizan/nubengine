      Primary

        -  Determine the intracranial response rate in patients with brain metastasis secondary to
           non-small cell lung cancer treated with whole brain radiotherapy and temozolomide.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to radiological progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to neurological progression (confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging
           (MRI)) in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo whole brain radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 2 weeks (10
      fractions). Patients also receive concurrent oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-14.

      Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients receive oral
      temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in
      the absence of neurologic (Central Nervous System, CNS) progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients were followed every 3 months for 2 years.

      ACCRUAL: A total of 26 patients were accrued for this study.
