      radiation retinopathy. Radiation retinopathy is a progressive condition that leads to
      blindness in over 50% of cases within 5 years of treatment.

      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein is believed to play a critical role in
      angiogenesis and radiation retinopathy. It is one of the key contributors to physiological or
      pathological conditions that can stimulate both the formation of new blood vessels and normal
      vessel incompetence. Ranibizumab is a recently approved vascular endothelial growth factor
      (VEGF) inhibitor shown to be effective in treating exudative macular degeneration.
      Ranibizumab binds to and inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A), which has
      been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis.

      This is an open label, non-randomized active treatment, Phase I trial to assess the safety
      and tolerability of intravitreal ranibizumab and its ability to reduce radiation retinopathy
      and potentially limit vision loss associated with this disease.
