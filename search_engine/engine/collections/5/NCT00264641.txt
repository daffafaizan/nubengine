      high and low activity in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Earlier studies have shown that
      high RAS activity is associated with a more pronounced cognitive impairment during
      hypoglycaemia compared to low RAS activity in both type 1 diabetic patients and healthy
      volunteers. We intend to examine brain activity by oxygen-15 labelled water-PET scanning
      during hypoglycaemia in response to cognitive function testing in 20 healthy male volunteers
      with high and low RAS activity, respectively.
