      study consisting of 3 periods i.e. Screening, Treatment, and Treatment withdrawal. Patients
      were planned to be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Placebo b.i.d. or EMA401 100 mg b.i.d..
      Concomitant use of pregabalin or duloxetine at stable doses was allowed. Based on historical
      data, it was planned that the study would enroll approximately 50% of patients who were on
      stable doses of concomitant pregabalin or duloxetine in the study. At the end of treatment
      period the 100mg b.i.d. arm was re-randomized (1:1) to the same treatment or placebo. Placebo
      arm stayed on placebo. The planned duration of treatment period was 12 weeks and 1 week of
      treatment withdrawal at the end of treatment period.

      The study was terminated early due to pre-clinical toxicity data that became available after
      start of trial. Novartis implemented a Urgent Safety Measure (USM) which instructed sites to
      discontinue study treatment immediately and to have all patients return for additional
      laboratory assessments (full hematology including coagulation and clinical chemistry panel).
      Safety data from the USM was presented as a separate outcome measure table and not included
      in the Adverse Event section
