      patients treated with implant-supported fixed prosthesis. Methods and Materials: 55 patients
      received cross-shaped incision were assigned into thick-gingiva group (29 cases) and
      thin-gingiva group (26 cases). Follow-up examination was carried out 3 and 12 months after
      final restoration. Clinical and radiographic evaluation including gingival papilla height,
      modified plaque index, modified sulcus bleeding index, periodontal depth, and crestal
      marginal bone level were utilized.
