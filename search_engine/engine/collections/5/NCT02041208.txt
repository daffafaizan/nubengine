      variability, the following patterns of hemoglobin level change will be established:

        -  Target range hemoglobin (TRH): patients with hemoglobin values in the range of
           11.0-12.0g/dl throughout the study period.

        -  Low hemoglobin (LH): patients with levels below 11.0g/dl

        -  High hemoglobin (HH): patients with levels above 12.0g/dl

        -  Low-amplitude fluctuation with low hemoglobin (LALH): patients with at least one
           measurement of hemoglobin levels <11.0g/dl and at least one measurement in the range of
           11.0-12.0g/dl, but without hemoglobin measurements >12.0g/dl.

        -  Low-amplitude fluctuation with high hemoglobin (LAHH): patients with at least one
           measurement of hemoglobin levels >12.0g/dl and at least one measurement in the range of
           11.0-12.0g/dl, but without hemoglobin measurements <11.0g/dl.

        -  High-amplitude fluctuation (HAH): patients with at least one measurement of hemoglobin
           levels <11.0g/dl and at least one measurement >12.0g/dl.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To determine potential factors influencing hemoglobin variability.

        -  To assess the influence of hemoglobin variability on cardiovascular risk of patients
           according to the REGICOR function at the end of the study period.
