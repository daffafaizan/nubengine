      communication or usual care. An existing iPad communication application (Proloquo2Go) that
      allows picture or text to voice communication was tailored to needs of adult mechanically
      ventilated (MV) patient. In the tailored application, common messages for an adult MV
      population are depicted on picture tiles organized into folders. When patients touch a
      picture tile either additional message options appear or a phrase or word is spoken by the
      device. Access to a pop-up keyboard on each screen allows patients to easily type unique text
      to voice messages.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized to either an iPad with the tailored communication
      application or usual care. Patients randomized to the iPad group will be given a brief
      introduction to the communication application and then will be asked to communicate four
      messages to verify understanding. Patients who are unable to successfully use the iPad with
      the initial introduction will remain in the study. Research staff will continue to assist the
      patient daily and a speech language pathologist will be consulted to facilitate the patients
      ability to use the device. The iPad will remain at the bedside to be used for communication
      as desired for the remainder of the time the patient is on the ventilator. A manual providing
      instruction for the iPad and application operation will be at the bedside of all patients
      randomized to the intervention group. Research staff will visit patients daily to assist with
      any problems encountered and will also be available by phone to assist as needed. Although
      patients will be encouraged to use the iPad for communication, use of other strategies or
      tools will not be restricted.
