      builds skills and stimulates practice. We are evaluating different materials, which may
      encourage caregiver participation, enable user interaction, and promote better assimilation
      of concepts. We are designing the program to help to enhance caregivers' skills to deal with
      demanding tasks of caregiving, alleviate related stress, and improve quality of life.

      Research Program Steps:

        1. Caregivers will be asked some simple questions about themselves and their family members
           to see if they are eligible for the project (fill out Enrollment Form and Informed
           Consent).

        2. A Program survey will be sent, which can be completed online, or returned in a
           pre-mailed envelope.

        3. A DVD, materials, link to our website, login information, and instructions will be
           mailed to participants. We ask participants to watch the DVD, read printed materials,
           use the website, and follow instructions. Materials are expected to help participants in
           their caregiver role.

        4. After completing the program, the second and final survey should be filled out online or
           returned by pre-mailed envelope.
