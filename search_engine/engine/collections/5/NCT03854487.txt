      recruited from 2 hospitals - Hong Kong and Guangzhou, in 1 and a half years, were randomly
      assigned to three groups; mirror therapy, sham therapy (in the form of a transparent glass
      wall), and control (covered mirror). The treatment programme for all groups consisted of 12
      sessions (4 per week for 3 weeks) movement practice for the hemiplegic arm involved 5
      table-top tasks graded according to the severity of patients' arm impairments. Blinded
