        1. To determine if vorapaxar safely improves arteriovenous (AV) fistula functional
           maturation when administered during the maturation process compared with placebo.

        2. To determine if vorapaxar safely improves AV fistula patency, allowing for secondary
           procedures to aid in fistula maturation compared with placebo.

        3. To determine if vorapaxar safely facilitates successful cannulation of AV fistulas for
           hemodialysis compared with placebo.

      This is a randomized placebo-controlled double-blind pilot trial. Study procedures will be
      conducted at Stanford University Medical Center, and standard-of-care (SOC) procedures will
      be conducted at Stanford and it's affiliated hospitals (Veteran's Affairs Palo Alto Health
      Care System and the Stanford Vascular Surgery Clinic at Valley Medical Center). The
      investigators expect to enroll 128 patients. Patients will be assigned to treatment groups
      with a 1:1 randomization in blocks of 4 at the conclusion of the AV fistula creation.
      Patients will be stratified based on fistula location (lower arm versus upper arm).

      Participation in this study will not affect standard care of patients with AV fistulae
      receiving hemodialysis. The only additional treatment is administration of the study drug or
      placebo and additional monitoring, including one additional ultrasound, for 6 months.
