      either face to face, or using the Internet. The study seeks to determine how feasible the
      internet method is for this type of health education, and how it compares to the face to face
      method. Patients will be recruited from Boston Medical Center. They will do baseline surveys
      and have blood drawn. They will then be randomized into receiving their diabetes education in
      a face to face group at BMC, or receiving it online while at home. The online group will
      receive a computer to access the Internet program and Internet access. Both groups will
      participate in 8 diabetes education groups, and 4 individual counseling sessions. Subjects
      will complete surveys before and after the study to measure changes in physical activity,
      diet, and use of medications, and will have blood tests drawn at BMC before and after the
      study to measure changes in diabetes control, cholesterol. They will also have blood pressure
      measured before and after the study period.
