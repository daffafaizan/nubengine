      (DVT), is a major health problem in the world. There have been many clinical studies
      evaluating VTE, although data on low-risk PE, including incidental PE and asymptomatic PE has
      been quite limited. However, low-risk PE was reported to account for a large proportion of
      all the diagnoses of PE detected on computed tomography in daily clinical practice, and
      optimal management strategies for these patients are becoming clinically more relevant. The
      current American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) guidelines weakly suggest the same
      approach for low-risk PE patients with cancer as other PE patients with cancer. However,
      whether anticoagulation therapy should be continued indefinitely remains uncertain and the
      duration of treatment in these patients might vary widely in daily clinical practice.
      Recently, some observational studies reported that low-risk patients with cancer have a high
      risk of VTE recurrence, suggesting the benefit of prolonged anticoagulation therapy. In this
      open-label, superiority trial, the investigators randomly assign low-risk PE patients with
      active cancer to receive either rivaroxaban for 6 months (short DOAC group) or rivaroxaban
      for 18 months (long DOAC group).
