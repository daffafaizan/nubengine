    
      The study will be a non-randomized, prospective study of men with suspected local recurrence
      of prostate cancer post-prostatectomy with negative conventional re-staging studies (bone
      scan and CT of the abdomen and pelvis; MRI of the pelvis as part of re-staging is allowed
      where it is the institutional standard of care). The clinician will develop an initial
      treatment plan based on conventional re-staging information.

      Patients enrolled onto trial will undergo hybrid PET/MR imaging using 18F-FCH (sites without
      access to a hybrid PET/MR scanner will conduct a 18F-FCH PET/CT in addition to a full body
      MRI). A consensus staging report based on local and centralized review of the 18F-FCH PET
      imaging will be provided to the attending clinician, who will document a second treatment
      plan based on this additional information. The treatment plan to be implemented (initial or
      second) will be left to clinician discretion, but will be documented.
