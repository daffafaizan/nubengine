      nationally at 14.7%. Genotype 4 (and subtype 4a in particular) dominates the HCV epidemic in
      Egypt. For decades the antiviral therapy of chronic HCV infection was based on the
      administration ofInterferon(IFN), initially alone and then in combination with Ribavirin
      (RBV), but this regimen was effective in only 50% of patients with genotype 1, with
      significant side effects. The introduction of direct acting antiviral agents, in particular
      sofosbuvir (SOF), has revolutionized the treatment for chronic hepatitis C virus.
