      years and above with advanced cancers. it is also evaluating whether there may be any
      correlation between these assessments and toxicity and treatment and outcome.

      The assessments include: Frailty score, nutritional assessment, comorbidity score and quality
      of life. In addition sarcopenia will be assessed using timed walk, grip strength and muscle
      mass measurement from imaging performed as part of routine clinical care.

      The assessments will be performed at baseline, week 12 and week 24.

      There is the option for patients to also donate blood samples for research purposes.
