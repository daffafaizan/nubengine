      effects of marine n-3 fatty acids on intermediary metabolism have not been completely
      elucidated. In a previous study of a high intake of marine n-3 fatty acids during 9 wk we
      demonstrated reduced insulin sensitivity and altered proportion of carbohydrate vs. fat
      oxidation in subjects with type 2 diabetes. These results question the use of high doses of
      n-3 supplements in type 2 diabetes. It is not known to what extent such effects in type 2
      diabetes can be reproduced by intravenous administration of n-3 fatty acids and/or whether
      short term intravenous administration has other effects.
