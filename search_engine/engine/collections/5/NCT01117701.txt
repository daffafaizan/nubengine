      needed to move the ureteroscope up and down the ureter.

      Although a safety guidewire (SGW) is commonly recommended in order to reduce the complication
      rate it may well be that the SGW itself may inhibit the passage of the ureteroscope due to
      increased friction.

      The forces needed to move the ureteroscope in the ureter have not been investigated properly.

      The intention in this study is to measure the forces needed to advance and withdraw the
      ureteroscope in the ureter with and without the SGW in place.
