      for 30 minutes. Hemodynamic parameters will be acquired directly prior to switching off, 15
      respectively 30 minutes after switching off, and 15 minutes after switching back on. To gain
      insight in the natural course of stunning, this routine will be repeated the next morning. No
      additional hemodynamic interventions will be allowed in these periods.
