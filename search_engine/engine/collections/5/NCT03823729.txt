      with rheumatic disease or traumata. The Elosan therapy to be investigated aims to treat
      chronic pain by applying an electrical charge to the body surface and by disruption of
      positive bio-feedback to restore physiological reflex relations between the periphery and the
      central regulation. The electric charge is created by a generator which can produce an
      electrostatic field. The electrical voltage is delivered to the hands via a metal handle in a
      closed cabin and is spread over the entire body surface.

      A total number of 42 patients will be included into this trial in order to show a
      statistically significant reduction of pain compared to reduction of pain in the control
      group.
