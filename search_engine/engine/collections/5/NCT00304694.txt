      locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), induction chemotherapy followed by
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been the preferred therapeutic approach.Although it would be
      of great advantage to identify non-responder during or immediately after therapy to formulate
      an alternative treatment strategy, non-invasive methods for early evaluation of therapeutic
      response for advanced NPC patients have not been fully evaluated. Decrease of tumor volume in
      anatomical images and relief of symptoms in clinical follow-up have been used in many
      conventional approaches to evaluate the effectiveness of therapy. However, an effective
      therapy could very well have resulted in early subclinical alterations in tumor physiology
      and biochemistry. These alterations may have occurred long before changes in the tumor mass
      become apparent. Thus therapeutic effect may not be assessed accurately using the
      conventional anatomical imaging studies, such as CT and MRI.Recent studies have shown that
      18F-FDG PET, a whole-body imaging technology based on glucose metabolism, can effectively
      detect subclinical and clinical therapeutic responses at stages that are earlier than those
      detected by conventional approaches.We therefore propose to conduct a prospective study to
      evaluate therapeutic response using 18F-FDG PET before and after induction chemotherapy for
      locally advanced NPC patients.
