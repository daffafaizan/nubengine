      dose melphalan chemotherapy for patients with advanced multiple myeloma. II. Determine the
      response rate to high dose dexamethasone therapy using sequential noncrossresistant
      chemotherapies for patients with advanced multiple myeloma.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive high dose dexamethasone on days 1-4, 9-12, and 17-20, followed by 4
      weeks rest. Cyclophosphamide (CTX) is administered intravenously in combination with mesna
      following dexamethasone therapy. Sargramostim (GM-CSF) is initiated subcutaneously 1 day
      later and is continued for 10 days to support stem cell collections, which begin 10-14 days
      after CTX induction. Following 4 weeks of rest, melphalan (L-PAM) is administered over 1
      hour. Stem cell rescue is begun 48 hours after L-PAM therapy. Three to 4 months after the
      first L-PAM course, a second L-PAM and stem cell rescue is undertaken. Interferon alfa-2b
      (IFN-A) maintenance is administered 3 times per week following bone marrow recovery from the
      first or second L-PAM courses. Patients achieving complete remission following the first
      course of L-PAM may proceed directly to IFN-A maintenance. Patients achieving greater than
      grade 3 nonhematologic toxicity or not achieving an absolute neutrophil count of greater than
      1,000/mm3 by day 21 posttransplant are not eligible for dose escalation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 30 patients will be enrolled.
