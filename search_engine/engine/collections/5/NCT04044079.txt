    
      hysteroscopy is commonly used in the diagnosis and treatment of intrauterine lesions such as
      polyps, Ô¨Åbroids, septa, and adhesions, and in the presence of abnormal bleeding and during
      the removal of an intrauterine device or foreign body. Cervical ripening is made possible by
      the use of medication through different routes. The most commonly used agent is misoprostol,
      a synthetic prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) analog that is frequently administered in off-label use
      in obstetrics and gynecology for medical abortion, labor induction, endometrial biopsy,
      dilatation and curettage, intrauterine device insertion, myomectomy, postpartum hemorrhage,
      and cervical ripening. In contrast, dinoprostone, a natural PGE2, is mostly used in
      obstetrics for cervical ripening and the stimulation of uterine contractions to induce labor.
