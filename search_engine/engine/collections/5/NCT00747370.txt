      cystourethroscopy, cystourethrography and ultrasonography.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
      offers a new tool for evaluation of morphology and function of the urogenital compartment of
      the female pelvis. Moreover, MRI gives opportunity to study function of the pelvic floor
      organs in terms of mobility and reactions during different physiological and provocative
      activities.

      The aim of the present study was by means of dynamic MRI to evaluate the behaviour of the
      mid-urethra, bladder neck, cervix and rectum in different maneuvers in three different study
      groups. Sixteen healthy volunteers with no complaints of urinary symptoms or urogenital
      prolapses, 42 stress urinary incontinence patients and 16 women with third degree genital
      prolapse were examined respectively.
