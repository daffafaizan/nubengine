      A. To study the potential links between cognitive impairment and quality of life 4 months
      after discharge from the Intensive Care Unit.

      B. To study the associations between variables measured during hospitalization. Is there
      "clustering" among certain symptoms during hospitalization?

      C. To study the associations between variables measured at two and four months after ICU
      discharge. Is there clustering among these symptoms?

      D. To study potential risk factors for cognitive problems at 4 months after ICU discharge.

      E. If objective C determines the presence of clusters, is the presence / absence of these
      clusters related to the variables (or clusters of variables) measured during hospitalization?

      F. To study potential risk factors for poor quality of life at 4 months:
