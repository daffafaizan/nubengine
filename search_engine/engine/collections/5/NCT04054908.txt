    
      This is a pilot feasibility study designed to investigate the alterations in the gut
      microbiome that occur during the course of treatment for colorectal cancer (CRC). Three
      patient cohorts will be followed. Cohort A: patients treated with oral fluoropyrimidine CAP
      as part of standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy. Cohort B: patients treated with TAS-102
      including those receiving it in combination with Y-90 radioembolization as part of a clinical
      trial. Cohort C: patients receiving CAP plus immunotherapy (pembrolizumab) and bevacizumab as
      part of a clinical trial. Investigators will replace participants as needed to ensure a
      minimum of 10 evaluable participants per cohort (or minimum total of 30 evaluable patients).
      Evaluable participants are defined as patients with two analyzable stool samples including a
      baseline sample and at least one on-treatment sample to be used in endpoint analysis
