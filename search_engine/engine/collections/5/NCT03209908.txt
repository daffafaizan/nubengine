      high HBV DNA loads of Pregnant women before delivery is the most important factor resulting
      in mother-to-child transmission of HBV, therefore, how to drop HBV DNA levels of pregnant
      women before delivery to the level that can markedly decrease the rate of HBV MTCT on the
      base of HBIG combined hepatitis b vaccine injection for newborns, which is the most important
      method to improve HBV MTCT. Although Nucleoside analogue antiviral treatment during late
      pregnancy can dramatically reduce the rate of HBV MTCT, security problems of NA treatment
      during pregnancy has not been demonstrated, On account of the above problems, our study is to
      investigate the effect of starting to use Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate(TDF) antiviral
      treatment from the 32 weeks of gestation to block mother-to-child transmission of hepatitis B
      virus(HBV MTCT).
