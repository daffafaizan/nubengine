      radiotherapy as adjuvant treatment for early stage breast cancer. Successful completion of
      this project may provide a rationale to offer this treatment for select patients with the
      benefit of potentially less tissue damage and a shorter overall course of therapy. These
      improvements may ultimately allow more patients the opportunity of breast conserving therapy
      to treat their cancer
