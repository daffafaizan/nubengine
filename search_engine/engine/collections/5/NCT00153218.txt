      trastuzumab alone or trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy or hormonal therapy as it
      has shown to increase survival. There is currently minimal information as to how long
      trastuzumab should be given after disease progresses on trastuzumab. This study is a chart
      review of the above-mentioned population which will capture information such as;

        -  what chemo or hormonal therapies are chosen by clinicians for Her-2 positive metastatic
           patients to combine with trastuzumab

        -  what the number of treatment regimens are (chemo or hormonal) given with trastuzumab

        -  what the clinical outcome of patients treated is

        -  what happens to the patients cardiac status with long term administration of trastuzumab

        -  what treatment patterns exist in the management of central nervous system metastases

      This study aims to generate a hypotheses that can be tested from the information collected
      after is has been analyzed to give clinicians further meaningful data to guide treatment
      decisions beyond treatment progression.
