    
      HealthTexas Provider Network primary care practices with at least 10 Medicare diabetes
      patients over the age of 65 were randomized to one of 3 intervention arms: physician feedback
      of process measures using Medicare claims data ("Claims"); feedback of Medicare claims data
      plus clinical measures from medical record abstraction ("Claims+MR"); or both types of
      feedback plus a practice-based DRN ("DRN"). For the 12 months prior to the intervention and
      12 months post-intervention, performance data on diabetes related processes of care (annual
      HbA1c testing, annual LDL cholesterol screening, annual hypertension screening, annual eye,
      foot, and renal assessment) and patient outcomes (HbA1c level, LDL cholesterol level, blood
      pressure) were collected from medical record abstraction and Medicare claims data. Pre-post
      change scores will be compared between intervention arms to examine effectiveness of
      physician profiling and care coordination by a diabetes resource nurse.
