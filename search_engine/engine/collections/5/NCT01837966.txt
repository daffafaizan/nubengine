      Pharmacologic anxiolytics require monitoring and cause excess sedation which often interferes
      with the ability to assess and obtain consent from a patient in the preoperative holding
      area. Lavender aromatherapy is an alternative treatment for anxiety which is safe,
      inexpensive, easy to administer, and not overly sedating. In addition to its benefits in the
      preoperative setting, anxiolysis and reduction in sympathetic drive can lead to reduction in
      the intraoperative anesthetic and postoperative analgesic requirements. This in turn can lead
      to faster recovery and expedited discharge from the post anesthesia care unit.

      In the proposed study, we would evaluate the efficacy of aromatherapy with lavender oil in
      reducing anxiety prior to breast surgery. The study group would receive lavender oil
      preoperatively and the placebo group would receive unscented oil preoperatively. Before and
      after treatment, anxiety level would be measured using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory. Additionally, vital signs and Bispectral index (BIS) will be measured before and
      after treatment, as further indicators of anxiety level. We hypothesize that lavender
      aromatherapy will decrease anxiety and subsequently will reduce blood pressure, heart rate,
      and BIS.
