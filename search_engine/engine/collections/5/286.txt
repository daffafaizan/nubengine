632. pulmonary alveolar proteinosis.  a study using enzyme histochemistry,electron microscopy, and surface tension measurementlung biopsies from 4 patients with pulmonary al-veolar proteinosis were studied using histochemical me-thods, electron microscopy, and surface tension mea-surement.  the lipid-rich intraalveolar fluid containedmaterial with the staining reactions and ultrastructureof phospholipid.  although many alveoli were lined byenzymatically active, secreting granular pneumonocy-tes, extracts of proteinotic tissue were not surfaceactive, and, in fact, inhibited normal surfactant.  someof the cells free in the intraalveolar material were de-generating sloughed granular pneumonocytes.  at themargins of the lesions were lipid-filled macrophageswhich appear to play a role in the removal of the mate-rial.  these observations indicate that alveolar protein-osis is not a primary overproduction of surfactant andare consistent with the concept that the alveolar clear-ing process is defective in this disease.
