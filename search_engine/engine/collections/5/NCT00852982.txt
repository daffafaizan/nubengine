      the risk of developing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Implementing and
      maintaining changes of lifestyle is, however, known to be difficult. In this study we wished
      to investigate the effects of an exercise intervention that is feasible to most people with
      type 2 diabetes or at risk of developing that disease. The intervention was Nordic walking
      (with walking poles) for five hour per week, during four months. We chose to determine
      effects on health related quality of life, clinical parameters related to body weight/body
      composition, blood pressure, glucose metabolism, insulin resistance, blood lipids, oxygen
      uptake and physiological effects in skeletal muscle cells related to glucose metabolism.

      On inclusion and after four months the participants were therefore subject to clinical
      measurements, blood samples, maximal oxygen uptake tests on an ergometer cycle and muscle
      biopsies at inclusion and after four months of participation. They also answered an extensive
      questionnaire focusing on health related quality of life.
