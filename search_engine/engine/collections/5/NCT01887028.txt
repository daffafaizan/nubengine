      groups: Group 1: 12mmHg intraperitoneal pressure with cool, dry CO2 gas (n=20), Group 2:
      12mmHg intraperitoneal pressure with warmed, humidified CO2 gas (n=20), Group 3: 8mmHg
      intraperitoneal pressure with cool, dry CO2 gas (n=20), Group 4: 8mmHg intraperitoneal
      pressure with warmed, humidified CO2 gas (n=20).

      Normal peritoneum is collected from the parietal wall at the beginning of laparoscopic
      surgery and at 1 and 2 hours. Expression of genes encoding components of the fibrinolytic
      system, extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules, and inflammatory cytokine signaling
      molecules in peritoneal tissues are measured by real-time PCR.

      Quality of post-operative recovery by QoR-40, post-operative pain by Visual Analog Scale, per
      or post operative complications and intraoperative core temperature are assessed and
      compared.
