      and dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) can reduce or interrupt malaria transmission in
      medium to low transmission settings by reducing vector survival and the human reservoir of
      infection. The research questions include the following:

        1. Will MDA with IVM plus DP (3 rounds per transmission season) in communities with high
           coverage of vector control interventions further reduce malaria transmission (up to
           local elimination)?

        2. Will MDA with IVM suppress the vector population?

        3. What is the most socially acceptable and sustainable way of achieving and maintaining
           high coverage of MDA with IVM and DP, and of embedding it within local communities and
           stakeholders?

        4. What is the impact of MDA with IVM on prevalence of ectoparasites and helminths

        5. What is the cost and cost-effectiveness of this intervention compared to standard
           malaria control measures?
