      biennium, points to the occurrence of about 600,000 new cases of cancer, and breast cancer
      (58000) in women will be the most frequent. One study revealed that only 12% of women
      undergoing chemotherapy in CM who participated in a physical exercise program had to
      readjusted the dose of the medications, while 34% of those who received the conventional
      treatment needed to readjust the Treatment doses, with neuropathy being one of the most
      present adverse effects that influenced this adjustment. In this sense, the conduct to keep
      the patient at rest during the treatment seems to potentiate her side effects, and
      sedentarism is another factor detrimental to the patient's health. Objective: To verify the
      effect of the intervention of a program of physical exercises and health education in women
      with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Methodology: A sample will consist of 136 (136)
      Women, over 18 years of age, sedentary, diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer and
      initiating the first cycle of chemotherapy. They will be divided into two groups, randomly
      and stratified: control group: (CG n = 68) and exercise group: (eg n = 68) that will undergo
      a supervised training program of combined exercises for 24 weeks, with a frequency of 3 times
      Weekly and duration of 60 minutes, an unsupervised flexibility training program 2 times a
      week and both groups (GC and EG) will attend lectures on health education, which are held
      monthly.
