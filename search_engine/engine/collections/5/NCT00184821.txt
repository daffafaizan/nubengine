      levels are monitored. In the first 8 patients intravenous insulin is administered as needed,
      to reach target glucose levels between 5-7 mmol/l. Patients will be subjected to 10 minutes
      of forearm ischemia (non-dominant arm), combined with handgripping at 50% of maximal force
      until exhaustion. Upon reperfusion, Tc-99m-HYNIC-Annexin A5 will be injected intravenously.
      Targeting of annexin A5 to thenar muscle and forearm flexor muscle will be quantified as the
      percentage difference in radioactivity between experimental and control side. This procedure
      will be performed twice (randomized cross-over design), with at least 2 week interval, either
      with or without 10 minutes ischemia followed by 10 minutes of reperfusion prior to ischemic
      exercise.

      Depending on the results of this study, substudies will be performed to study the effect of
      diazoxide (K-ATP channel opener, may mimic ischemic preconditioning), glibenclamide (K-ATP
      channel blocker, may inhibit ischemic preconditioning) or adenosine (infusion into brachial
      artery of non-dominant arm as a substitute for ischemic preconditioning).
