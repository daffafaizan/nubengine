      prostate in order to ensure that the tightly conformed dose distribution does not miss the
      prostate and result in either significant tumor underdosage, an increased dose to the rectum
      or bladder, or both. Precise delivery has been addressed using a variety of pre-treatment
      localization systems. The most direct localization of the prostate involves the use of
      ultrasound, computed tomography (CT), or radiography of permanently implanted fiducial
      markers.

      In this study the safety and performance of a novel investigational tracking system will be
      evaluated. The Radiation Therapy Positioning System (RTPS) is a radioactive tracking system
      integrated into the radiotherapy set-up workflow. The System is composed of the Clinical
      Positioning System (CPS) and a radioactive soft tissue implanted fiducial (Blip), which is
      permanently implanted in the prostate. By tracking the implanted Blip, the CPS can monitor
      positional changes prior to and during the treatment.

      The accuracy of the RTPS localization will be compared to the CBCT in at least 5 radiation
      therapy sessions per patient.
