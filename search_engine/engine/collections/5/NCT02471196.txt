      suggest that the compound may have positive effects on both cognitive and neuropsychiatric
      symptoms of Alzheimer's Disease. In this study, the effect of ORM-12741 will be evaluated on
      agitation/aggression symptoms and other neuropsychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, cognition and
      psychotic and depressive symptoms will be evaluated.
