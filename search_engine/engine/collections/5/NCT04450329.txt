      intravitreal [IVT] injection 2 mg [0.05 mL] every 4 weeks for the first 3 months (i.e., at
      Weeks 0, 4, and 8), followed by 2 mg [0.05 mL] once every 8 weeks). At Week 32, subjects in
      Eylea速 treatment group will be randomised again in a 1:1 ratio to either continue on Eylea速
      treatment or be transitioned to SB15 treatment. In the 8-week treatment cycle, IPs (SB15 or
      Eylea速) will be administered up to Week 48, and the last assessment will be done at Week 56,
