      which then leads to swelling. Symptoms include shortness of breath, breathing difficulty, and
      coughing. Flash pulmonary edema, which develops suddenly and can be life-threatening, is
      usually caused by heart failure. It occurs when the left ventricle of the heart is weakened
      and does not function properly, potentially impeding the flow of blood from the heart to the
      rest of the body. Blood pressure and fluid volume then increase, and excess blood accumulates
      in the blood vessels and tissues of the lungs. Flash pulmonary edema requires immediate
      treatment, including supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or medication. This study
      will determine if a new form of MRI testing can be used to identify probable abnormalities in
      blood flow to the lungs and predict increased risk of developing flash pulmonary edema among
      older adults.

      This study will enroll people who are at risk of developing flash pulmonary edema. At a
      baseline study visit, participants will undergo a medical record review, a physical exam,
      blood collection, questions about cardiovascular health, and an MRI stress test. For the
      stress test, participants will first receive the medication dobutamine, which will increase
      their heart rate and reduce the blood supply to their heart. Participants will then be placed
      in an MRI machine and images of their heart will be taken. All participants will complete
      follow-up cardiovascular health questionnaires three times a year for 1 to 10 years,
      depending on when participants are enrolled into the study.
