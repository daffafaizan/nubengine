    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open-label Phase 3 study of a microbiota suspension of
      intestinal microbes. The primary assessments for this study are (i) safety via assessment of
      treatment-emergent adverse events and (ii) efficacy of RBX2660 preventing recurrent episodes
      of CDI measured at 8 weeks after treatment. Follow-up office visits occur at 1 week and 8
      weeks after completing the initial study treatment. Telephone assessments occur at 4 weeks,
      and 4 and 6 months after the study. Patients who have had at least one recurrence of CDI
      after a primary episode and have completed at least one round of standard-of-care oral
      antibiotic therapy or have had at least two episodes of severe CDI resulting in
      hospitalization may be eligible for the study. Subjects may receive a second RBX2660 enema if
      they are deemed treatment failures following the initial enema per the protocol-specified
      treatment failure definition.
