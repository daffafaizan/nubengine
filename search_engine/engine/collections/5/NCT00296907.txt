      intervention (child, parents) shall be studied in 30 siblings of newly diagnosed pediatric
      cancer patients. After a baseline assessment 3-4 weeks after diagnosis participants are
      randomly assigned to an intervention or waiting list group. Both are re-assessed at 3 and 6
      months by means of standardized questionnaires assessing psychological adaptation and
      behavior. The intervention is provided to the waiting list group after the 6-month
      assessment.
