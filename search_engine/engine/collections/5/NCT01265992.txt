    
      This observational study is designed to collect data to evaluate safety and effectiveness
      during 6 months of therapy with paricalcitol capsules prescribed in accordance with the terms
      of the marketing authorization for patients with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Stages 3-5 not
      yet on dialysis. Data will also be collected on patient quality of life and costs associated
      with patient care. A retrospective chart review of patient laboratory and medication history
      will provide historical data to determine drivers for initiation of paricalcitol therapy.

      The primary goal of this post-marketing observational study (PMOS) is to further characterize
      the prescribing habits and patient management practices of physicians prescribing
      paricalcitol capsules and to assess the metabolic safety and effectiveness of paricalcitol
      capsules for the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism in Stage 3-5 CKD patients not yet
      on dialysis under conditions of usual clinical care. Focus will be to examine the practice of
      dose titration in early stages of CKD, understand real-world management of intact parathyroid
      hormone levels, understand real-world incidence and management of abnormalities in serum
      calcium and phosphate, and to examine patient bone and mineral profiles and medical history
      to understand drivers for paricalcitol capsules use.

      Patients prescribed paricalcitol therapy for the first time will be asked to participate in
      the study. Enrolled patients will be followed for 6 months.
