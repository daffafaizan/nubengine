      improving pressure pain thresholds (PPTs), functionality, range of motion (ROM), low back
      pain-related disability, pain, and quality of life in patients with non-specific low back
      pain. Methods: A randomized controlled trial in which participants with non-specific low back
      pain (NP) were randomly assigned to either an experimental (VT) or a comparison physical
      therapy program (PTP) group.
