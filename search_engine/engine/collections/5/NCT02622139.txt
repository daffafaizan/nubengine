      evaluation of disease activity in IBD patients. As current methods for the evaluation of
      intestinal inflammation in IBD have relevant restrictions, new, non-invasive, quantitative,
      and accurate modalities are urgently needed. In comparison to other techniques, MSOT provides
      relevant advantages such as non-invasive imaging, high spatial resolution (this is of special
      importance for the evaluation of the intestine, which can be only a few millimeters thick),
      and highly sensitive detection of specific molecules such as total hemoglobin or oxy-
      /deoxygenated hemoglobin. These advantages suggest MSOT as an outstanding technique for
      evaluating disease activity in IBD.

      The proposed study incorporates nearly no risk for participating patients and might provide
      relevant data for more a more in depth analysis of MSOT for IBD diagnosis.
