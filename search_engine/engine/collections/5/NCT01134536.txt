    
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label (all people involved know the identity of the
      intervention), single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile (how drugs are
      absorbed in the body, how they are distributed within the body and how they are removed from
      the body over time), safety and tolerability of tapentadol 1 mg/kg oral solution (OS) in
      children aged from 6 to less than 18 years after scheduled surgical procedures that routinely
      produce acute, moderate to severe postsurgical pain. A screening phase, as per standard of
      care but not exceeding 30 days, will include the preoperative evaluation, the surgical
      procedure and its immediate post recovery, and will be followed by the open-label treatment
      phase and end-of-study assessments. Study drug administration will take place after the
      surgery has been completed, when the patient is alert, orientated, able to follow commands
      and complete the required postoperative procedures, and able to tolerate fluid and medication
      orally. Confinement to the study center for a patient will be as per standard of care, and
      will include the surgery, the entire 15-hour postdose evaluation period and the end-of-study
      evaluations. Children with a body weight less than 20 kg will be dosed with a single dose of
      tapentadol 4 mg/mL OS and children with a body weight of 20 kg or greater will be dosed with
      a single dose of tapentadol 20 mg/mL OS.
