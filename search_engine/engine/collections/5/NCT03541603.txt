      hemodynamic effects in subjects with pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. Clinical
      studies that have been conducted in subjects with right heart failure and pulmonary
      hypertension suggest levosimendan may be an effective therapy in treatment of subjects with
      PH-HFpEF. This study will provide demonstration of levosimendan/OR-1896's effectiveness in
      critical measures of hemodynamic response in weekly administration of levosimendan and the
      concomitant response as measured by exercise capacity, subject quality of life, and changes
      in functional capacity. These data will support and guide the Phase 3 development of
      levosimendan in PH-HFpEF subjects.
