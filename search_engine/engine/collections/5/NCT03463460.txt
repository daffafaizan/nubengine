      I. To evaluate the efficacy of pembrolizumab and sunitinib malate (sunitinib) for the
      treatment of patients with thymic carcinoma that have progressed on prior platinum based
      chemotherapy as measured by objective response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety profile and toxicity of combination pembrolizumab and sunitinib
      malate as per Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v) 4.0.

      II. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients
      treated with combination pembrolizumab and sunitinib.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine objective response rate (ORR), PFS, and OS by PD-L1 expression > 50% tumor
      proportion score (TPS) (by 22C3 assay) II. To determine whether sunitinib treatment leads to
      increase in PD-L1 expression and tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and decrease in
      myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC) in both tumor and peripheral blood.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and sunitinib
      malate orally (PO) daily on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days for 24 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of the study treatment, participants are followed up for 30 days, every 6
      weeks for 1 year, and every 9 or 12 weeks thereafter.
