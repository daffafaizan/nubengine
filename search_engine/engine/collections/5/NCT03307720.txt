      been used specially to avoid hyperstimulation syndromes (OHSS). Indeed, the substitution of
      the classical HCG triggering by the agonist one, reduces almost to zero the risk of OHSS.

      On the other hand poor responder patients to ovarian stimulation represent a challenge in
      assisted reproduction. Defining poor responders is not easy, but we can define them as those
      patients with less than 4 eggs obtained after oocyte retrieval.

      Different strategies have been proposed to overcome this problem. In other words, to obtain
      more oocytes. These include an increase in FSH doses, an increase in FSH action by adding
      sensitizers agents.

      Among the possible strategies, investigators propose the agonist triggering. HCG (classical)
      triggering represents the use of a LH-like product (with a prolonged action). The
      administration of a GnRH agonist provoke the production and liberation of both FSH and LH.
      Thus, the pro-ovulatory action is more physiologic , and possibly, more effective.

      So, the use of a triggering protocol that nowadays is being used among high responders (thus
      reducing the OHSS risk) is proposed for both poor responder and normo-responder patients
      trying to achieve more oocytes, and specifically more mature oocytes.
