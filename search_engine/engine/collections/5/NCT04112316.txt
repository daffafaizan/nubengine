      administering oral LT3 therapy in the study population of participants with heart failure
      with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Each treatment period will be approximately 8 weeks
      in duration, with weekly titration of study drug for 4 weeks, followed by a maintenance dose
      for 4 weeks, then 2-week washout before crossing over to the other arm (placebo or drug). LT3
      will be titrated to T3 levels.
