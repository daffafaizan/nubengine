      monitoring committee will evaluate the data every 6 months. Ponatinib is given orally 30 mg
      daily, with dose adjustment to 15 mg daily once a BCR-ABL1 level smaller or equal to 0.1%
      (MMR) has been achieved and confirmed in the next test, 4 weeks apart. A return to prior, 30
      mg, dose is due in case of return of BCR-ABL1 transcripts level to > 1%. Dose adjustments for
      toxicity are detailed in the protocol. Treatment time will be 52 weeks, during which study
      drug will be provided free-of-charge by ARIAD Pharmaceuticals, upon approval of the protocol.
      Treatment is discontinued at any time in case of failure or treatment-related SAEs. After one
      year of treatment, upon request of the local investigator and upon confirmation of the
      Treatment Advisory Committee (TAC, see section 23), ARIAD Pharmaceutics, Inc. will continue
      to provide ponatinib for the study patients who will benefit from treatment continuation, for
      at least 2 years, until the drug will be approved with that indication.
