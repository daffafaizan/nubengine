      as the main target of the inflammation. Patients with RA require chronic treatment with
      disease modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX), which
      constitutes the mainstay of treatment. Underlying immune dysfunction and the additional
      immune suppression associated with treatment render patients with RA more susceptible to
      infection. Thus, vaccination of the preventive diseases is crucial and recommended in all
      patients unless contraindicated.

      However, low dose of glucocorticoids, conventional DMARDs and biological DMARDs including
      tumor necrosis factor inhibitors have been reported to substantially decrease vaccine
      response (4); MTX has been reported to be associated with a decreased response to seasonal
      influenza vaccination by up to 15%.

      To optimize a vaccine response, vaccination should be administrated before the treatment with
      immunesuppressive medications is initiated. However, most patients with RA are already on
      stable dose of MTX at the time of when vaccinations. To improve the vaccine response, a short
      term discontinuation of MTX could be considered. In a prior study, we discovered that a
      temporary discontinuation of MTX for 4 weeks during peri-vaccination period tended to be
      associated with an improved response to vaccination with trivalent influenza vaccination
      (Figure 1). It remains to be defined whether MTX discontinuation for shorter period increases
      the vaccination efficacy while minimizing the RA flare rate.
