      is impacting people with chronic diseases and influencing health care outcomes. This study
      will help bridge the research to practice gap and further our knowledge about the outcomes of
      evidence?based programs that are widely disseminated.

      Investigators hope to learn the answers to the following questions for English and
      Spanish-speaking populations:

        1. How does the CDSMP impact a person's general health?

        2. Does the CDSMP increase the use of healthful behaviors?

        3. Does the CDSMP impact health care utilization?

        4. What are the characteristics of those who benefit from the CDSMP?

        5. Can these benefits be maintained over 6 and 12 month periods?

        6. For people with type 2 diabetes, and hemoglobin A1c be impacted by the CDSMP?
