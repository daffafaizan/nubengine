    
      This study is a prospective, multi-center, physician-initiated study, with intra-center
      control arm of patients with advanced heart failure undergoing cardiac resynchronization
      therapy (CRT) with or without defibrillator therapy.

      Approximately 300 patients will be included in the study and followed-up for 6 months.
      Patients recruitment will consist of two sequential phases:

      Phase 1 - Conventional CS lead placement (Conventional subgroup). The first 100 patients will
      be implanted with a CRT device with or without defibrillator (P/D) as per standard clinical
      practice, without CS lead pacing specific optimization. In these patients RLD is measured
      blind to implanting physician who will place CS lead according to his/her clinical practice.
      Since these patients follow strictly standard clinical practice, their implantation data can
      be collected prospectively or even retrospectively when available.

      Phase 2 - Targeted CS lead placement (RLD subgroup). In the second 200 patients CS placement
      will be guided by RLD measurement. Physician will place the CS lead in the site of longest
      RLD with a stable and acceptable pacing threshold.
