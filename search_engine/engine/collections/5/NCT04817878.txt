      intrauterine nutrient reserves, burden of various diseases after birth, and persistent
      nutrient liabilities. The growth retardation of premature infants at different developmental
      stages has an important impact on both short-term survival and long-term health. The growth
      and development data of premature infants during hospitalization and after discharge are very
      limited in foreign countries. Domestic researches on growth retardation of preterm infants
      only involve retrospective cross-sectional studies during hospitalization, and lack of
      prospective follow-up study data on growth and development data of premature infants during
      hospitalization and after discharge.

      In this cohort, prospective clinical cohort study was used to establish a follow-up cohort of
      preterm infants with different gestational ages. The regular monitoring indexes of physical
      development and neuropsychological development of preterm infants from birth to 3 years after
      birth were collected. The influencing factors of preterm infants' development at different
      stages were recorded, and the high-risk factors leading to different stages of preterm
      infants' growth retardation were analyzed. In order to provide a strong scientific basis for
      the development evaluation and intervention of premature infants in China, a systematic and
      scientific clinical cohort study method was explored to improve the overall medical quality
      and medical level of the Department and further promote the development of the discipline.
