      underwent MVD. Patients were allocated into two groups. The study group (Gr. D) received
      intraoperative dexamethasone 4 mg iv and ondansetron 4 mg iv, whereas the control group (Gr.
      N) received placebo (0.9% normal saline 1 ml iv and 0.9% normal saline 2 ml iv). The
      incidence and severity of PONV were observed at 1, 2, 4 and 24 hr post-surgery.
