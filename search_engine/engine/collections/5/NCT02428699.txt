      digestion these lipids are subject to hydrolysis, in particular by pancreatic triglyceride
      lipase. To facilitate the action of the enzyme, lipids are emulsified by the action of bile
      salts. By increasing the surface area of the fat globules, emulsification increases access to
      the lipids by pancreatic triglyceride lipase. This study is designed to compare iAUC0-24h of
      plasma levels of n-3 fatty acids (sum of total and free EPA and DHA) after ingestion of an
      emulsified product and a non-emulsified reference control of free flowing cod liver oil at
      the lowest appropriate dose that is practically acceptable, and as near as possible to the
      test products' recommended daily dose.
