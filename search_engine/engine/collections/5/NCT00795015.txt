      surgical intensive care unit (SICU) with a target blood glucose range from 80 to 120mg/dL.
      After five years of implementation, we were able to achieve a mean BG of 117 mg/dL in the
      SICU. 2% of glucose values were <60 mg/dL in the SICU. Given the concern of safety while
      optimizing glycemic control, we investigated the etiologies for these hypoglycemic episodes
      and have found two frequent risk factors; the failure to consistently measure blood glucose
      every hour and in patients with end stage renal failure.

      We will investigate whether a computer-based algorithm for the titration of IV insulin will
      translate to better clinical outcomes and less hypoglycemia. Therefore, we will conduct a
      prospective randomized trial comparing the Glucommander, a computer-based algorithm with our
      Van den Berghe protocol for titration of IV insulin in patients after cardiovascular or
      transplant surgery. This computer based algorithm was invented in 1984 in Atlanta by Dr.
      Davidson and Dr. Steed who have used it in a variety of applications of IV insulin.
