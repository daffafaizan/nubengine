      of growth hormone (GH) treatment on adult women with Turner syndrome. The endpoints will be
      changes in body composition and heart function evaluated by echocardiography (ECHO) and
      positron emission tomography (PET).

      Phase one: 6 months of GH or placebo treatment. Phase two: "open label" all participants are
      treated with GH for 12 months. At baseline, healthy controls will be examined, but will not
      receive any treatment
