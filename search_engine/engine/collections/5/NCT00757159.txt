      main goal of periodontal therapy. While conventional surgical therapy only offers limited
      potential towards recovering tooth-supporting tissues, more recently developed techniques
      lead to a greater and more predictable regeneration of the periodontal structures. Among
      these techniques, application of enamel matrix proteins or bone grafts can promote
      periodontal regeneration.

      The study is a prospective, controlled, mono-center, randomized, clinical trial, that is open
      to the operator, blinded to the examiner. It will be conducted in a parallel group design.
      Participants who have at least 1 intra-bony periodontal defect will receive regenerative
      surgery at baseline with the randomly selected devices. A newly developed synthetically
      manufactured bone grafting material made of hydroxyapatite (Ostim) will be the product under
      investigation. An enamel matrix protein derivative (Emdogain) will act as control device.
      Both materials will be applied in intra-bony defects during periodontal flap surgery.
      Follow-ups will take place at 7 and 14 days post surgery, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

      The primary aim is to compare the effectiveness of the test product with the control in the
      treatment of 1- and 2-wall intrabony periodontal defects on the amount of bone fill 12 months
      after surgery. Secondary parameters will be the clinical attachment level gain and reduction
      of probing pocket depth at 6 and 12 months.
