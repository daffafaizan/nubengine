      with a study clinician regarding their symptoms. Heart rate variability and galvanic skin
      response will be measured in the patient-provider dyads and the visits video recorded.
      Subjects will receive a two-month supply of amitriptyline (10 mg/day), along with
      instructions for taking it. Subjects will complete a daily GERD symptom diary during the
      first and eighth weeks of the study. At the end of the 8-week observation period, subjects
      will complete follow-up measures of GERD symptom severity and quality of life.
