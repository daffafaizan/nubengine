      settings.1 Several studies have identified the inappropriate use of antimicrobials as
      important risk factor for antimicrobial resistance and the important area of opportunity for
      increasing patient safety and improving patient outcomes.2 High rates of antimicrobial use
      have been linked to high rates of antimicrobial resistance,3 and increased exposure to
      antimicrobials has been associated with an increased probability of colonization with
      resistant pathogens. It has also been shown that antimicrobial control results in significant
      cost savings4 and it may reduce antimicrobial resistance Surveys reveal that 25 - 33% of
      hospitalized patients receive antibiotics6 and that 22 - 65% of antibiotic use in
      hospitalized patients is inappropriate.7

      Reasons for inappropriate antimicrobial therapy include:

        1. treating anybody with fever (even when it is not caused by infection) with broad
           spectrum antibiotics

        2. treating colonization or contamination (rather than real infection)

        3. continuing antibiotics even when infection was cured or is unlikely8

      It is quite clear that clinicians need reliable marker for bacterial infections that would
      allow an early diagnosis, inform about the course and prognosis of the disease and facilitate
      therapeutic decisions.9 Procalcitonin covers these features better as compared to other, more
      commonly used biomarkers (such as CRP).10 It has been shown recently that procalcitonin
      guidance substantially reduces antibiotic use in community-acquired pneumonia without
      compromising patients' safety. 11, 12 However, the efficacy and safety of PGAD in
      hospitalized patients with undefined fever has not been previously investigated.

      We think that PGAD should be equally safe and effective intervention in hospitalized patients
      with fever of unknown etiology. It should help to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use and in
      effect, help to control antimicrobial resistance.
