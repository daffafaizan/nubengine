      emergency, redux surgery, ventricular assisting device or extracorporeal live saving). At
      investigator's knowledge, there is not recommendations in France about antibiotic prophylaxis
      in adult heart transplantation. So, investigators aimed to study the antibiotic prophylaxis
      use in adult heart transplantation in France.

      Investigators conduct a French national survey about antibiotic prophylaxis used in adult
      heart transplantation center. Clinical situations such as elective, emergency, redux surgery,
      ventricular assisting device or extracorporeal live saving are investigated.

      Study was performed after Institutional approval was obtained from the local Ethics Committee
      (Comite de Protection des Personnes Nord Ouest III). An electronic survey was sent to all
      French adult heart transplantation centers (22) on march 1st, 2015. Reminders were planned on
      week 2 and 4 after initial sending. On june 2015, nonresponding centers were contacted by
      phone. Data were collected by a single investigator.
