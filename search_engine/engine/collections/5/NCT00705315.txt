      is highly active first-line therapy for metastatic breast cancer, with acceptable toxicity
      profile. Recently initial therapy of metastatic breast cancer with paclitaxel plus
      bevacizumab demonstrated prolonged progression-free survival, as compared with paclitaxel
      alone. This study will evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of docetaxel-epirubicin combination
      plus bevacizumab as first line treatment in patients with metastatic and HER2 negative breast
      cancer. Furthermore, the efficacy of the combination therapy will be correlated with the
      presence of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in this population.
