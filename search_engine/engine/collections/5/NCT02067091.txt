      coronary intervention) will be screened. After thrombus aspiration, patient will be asked for
      oral consent if TIMI flow 2-3. Patient will then be randomized between drug eluting stent
      (Xience pro, Abbott Vascular Solutions) and bioresorbable scaffold (Absorb, Abbott Vascular
      Solutions). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) will be performed before stenting and after
      final result. Stent will be deployed without further predilatation if possible. Follow up at
      12 months (clinical, angio with OCT and multislice CT coronary angiogram (MSCT-CA)) and 24
      months (MSCT-CA).
