      mg/day or placebo will be added for 8 weeks to the stable ongoing antipsychotic treatment of
      90 schizophrenia patients. Participants will be assessed at baseline and after 2, 4 and 8
      weeks of treatment. A battery of research instruments will be used for assessment of efficacy
      and safety (psychopathology, and side effects). In addition, cholesterol and triglyceride
      levels, liver and thyroid function tests and a blood cell count will be monitored at baseline
      and during therapy.
