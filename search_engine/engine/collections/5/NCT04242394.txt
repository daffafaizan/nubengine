      faster recovery for common bile duct stone patients. However, according to our retrospective
      study, ERCP will has a mostly 10% possibility to get an acute purulent cholecystitis which
      often requires emergency intervention, when patients combined with chronic gallbladder
      diseases, such as chronic cholecystitis, asymptomatic gallstones, and gallbladder wall
      thickness, the incidence of PEC will increase accordingly. The aim of this study is to
      observe if chronic gallbladder disease will increase the occurence of PEC and develop a
      high-risk PEC model.
