    
      The aim is to study the cognitive and brain development of children with absence epilepsy. In
      addition, this study aims to identify prognostic factors for cognitive deterioration and/or
      poor seizure control.

      Objective:

        1. To study the development of cognition in children with absence epilepsy and the
           functional brain organization over time.

        2. To find prognostic factors in terms of clinical, 24h-video-EEG or/and MRI
           characteristics for cognitive deterioration and/or poor seizure control in patients with
           absence epilepsy.

      Study design:

      2 year prospective longitudinal, controlled, comparative, clinical, follow up.

      Study population:

      60 children with recently diagnosed (<2 years) absence epilepsy, aged 6 to 12 years. In
      addition, this study includes a control group of 15 age and gender matched healthy
      volunteers.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Endpoints are the development of clinical parameters (semiology, 24h-video-EEG and seizure
      control), neuropsychological/behavioural outcomes, structural/functional MRI parameters, and
      educational performance.
