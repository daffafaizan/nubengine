    
      Background: Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) has a huge impact on the quality of life (QoL)
      in women and its treatment is challenging. Intraurethral laser may be an additional treatment
      option.

      Study aim: The aim is to study the effectiveness of intraurethral laser therapy in women with
      SUI.

      Design: randomized double blinded sham - controlled clinical study

      Study population: women which have been diagnosed with SUI I-IIÂ°, aged between 18-80 years.

      Study groups: Participants will be randomized (1:1), without stratification. The Intervention
      group will receive 2 treatments of intraurethral laser therapy and the Control group will
      receive 2 treatments of intraurethral SHAM laser therapy.

      Sample size: A sample size of 20 women, 8 per group including a 20% Drop Out Rate, was
      calculated.

      Primary outcome: impact of SUI on the VAS scale 3 months after laser therapy versus sham
      laser therapy.

      Secondary study outcomes were defined as subjective SUI, objective SUI, QoL, treatment
      satisfaction, intraurethral microbiome, 3 months after laser therapy versus sham laser
      therapy.
