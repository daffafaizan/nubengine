    
      Ischemic postconditioning is studied using cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and moderate
      hypothermia (32-34Â°C) in a patient population undergoing surgery of the aortic valve
      (repair/replacement ) or the ascending aorta. Postconditioning is applied by introducing
      reperfusion/ischemia via the cardioplegia line while the aorta is still cross-clamped thereby
      preventing the risk of additional neurological complications. All patients > 20 years
      eligible for aortic or aortic valve surgery and not affected by exclusion criteria, will be
      included.

      The study is carried out as a randomised controlled multicenter study including 5-6 heart
      surgery centers.
