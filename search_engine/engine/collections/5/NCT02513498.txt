    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the proportion of subjects with treatment failure by 6 months of ixazomib
      (ixazomib citrate) treatment for chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine 3 month overall (complete + partial), and complete response rate.

      II. Determine 6 month overall (complete + partial), and complete response rate.

      III. Report overall survival, non-relapse mortality, primary malignancy relapse, failure-free
      survival, treatment success, and discontinuation of immune-suppressive therapy at 6 months
      and 1 year.

      IV. Examine functional outcome (2-minute walk test) and patient-reported outcomes (Lee
      Chronic GVHD Symptom Scale, quality of life [Short Form Health Survey (SF)-36, Functional
      Assessment of Cancer Therapy Bone Marrow Transplant (FACT-BMT)], Human Activity Profile
      [HAP]) at study enrollment, 6 months, and 1 year.

      V. Study biologic effects of proteasome inhibition.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ixazomib citrate orally (PO) once weekly on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response, partial response, or stable disease
      may receive an additional 6 courses of ixazomib citrate.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months.
