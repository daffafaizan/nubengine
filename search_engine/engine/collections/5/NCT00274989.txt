      transplantation are not curative treatment options in B-CLL; nearly all patients will
      eventually relapse. Also monoclonal antibodies are not curative for B-CLL patients in
      monotherapy, their impact on survival in combination with conventional chemotherapy is
      currently validated. In addition, there is no standard combination therapy for patients with
      relapsed CLL. Therefore there is an urgent medical need to identify new strategies.

      The combination of rituximab (monoclonal antibody) and bendamustine (chemotherapy) has shown
      encouraging activity in patients with relapsed/refractory NHL or mantle cell lymphoma. In
      vitro studies have been used to investigate the effects of bendamustine and rituximab on
      programmed cell death (apoptosis) and have shown synergistic effects of both drugs. The
      mechanisms of action of these two active drugs may provide a treatment with good therapeutic
      potential in CLL. However, though bendamustine has been used for over 30 years there is still
      a need to define a standard regimen for the use of bendamustine in combination with
      monoclonal antibodies (mAb) especially in the treatment of CLL.
