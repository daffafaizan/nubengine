      Illuminate Cream topically to affected areas for 20 weeks. The change in Melasma Area and
      Severity Index (MASI) score will be evaluated a baseline and Weeks 4, 12, and 20.

      The MASI score is a validated test, calculated by subjective assessment of 3 factors: Area
      (A) of involvement, Darkness (D), and Homogeneity (H), with the forehead, right malar region,
      left malar region, and chin, corresponding to 30%, 30%, 30% and 10% of the total face,
      respectively. The area of involvement in each of these 4 areas is given a numeric value of 0
      to 6 (0 = no involvement; 1 = <10%; 2 = 10%-29%; 3 = 30-49%; 4 = 50-69%; 5 = 70-89%; and 6 =
      90-100%).

      Darkness and homogeneity are rated on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 = absent; 1 = slight; 2 = mild;
      3 = marked; and 4 = maximum). The score is calculated by adding the sum of the severity
      ratings for darkness and homogeneity, multiplied by the value of the area of involvement, for
      each of the 4 facial areas.
