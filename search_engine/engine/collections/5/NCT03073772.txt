      Umeå. In total 161 patients with diagnosed exhaustion disorder were recruited consecutively
      to the study from March 2010 until June 2013. Participants were all in age span 18-60 years
      old, had an ongoing employment and were assessed as suitable for a 24-week multimodal
      rehabilitation, which consisted of cognitive behavioural therapy in group (maximum eight
      persons), prescription of physical activity/exercise (FaR©) and vocational measures with
      rehabilitation meetings. A randomization by group was performed after 12 weeks of multimodal
      rehabilitation to one of three conditions; A/ continued multimodal rehabilitation, B/
      addition of a computer-based cognitive training, and C/ addition of physical fitness
      training. The added training was performed during the last 12 weeks of rehabilitation (week
      12 to 24) and with three weekly training occasions. Primary endpoint was change in cognitive
      functioning, estimated as a global brain score. Secondary endpoints were changes in different
      specific neuropsychological tasks, estimated psychological wellbeing, physical capacity, work
      ability, health-related quality of life and cost-effectiveness. A long-term follow-up was
      performed one year after termination of the interventions (at week 76).
