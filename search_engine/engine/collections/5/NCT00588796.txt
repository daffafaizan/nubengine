    
      In this protocol, we will investigate fibrinogen metabolism in burn and trauma patients,
      using an 8h infusion of stable isotopes labeled amino acids (1-13C-phenylalanine,
      2H5-phenylalanine, and 2H3-ketoisocaporate). The increase of the labeled amino acids
      incorporating into fibrinogen during the infusion and the decay of labeled fibrinogen after
      stopping the isotopes infusion (as measured by GC-MS) will be used to calculate fibrinogen
      synthesis and degradation. Stable isotopes are non-radioactive.
