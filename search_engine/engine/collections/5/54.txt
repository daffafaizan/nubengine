ehrlich ascites tumor cells agglutination.. the interference exerted byepsilonaminocaproic acid (eac) and its acetyl derivative (eaca) .the activity of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (eac) and of its acetylderivative (eaca) was studied on antigen-antibody reactions, membraneantigens and immune globulins .in vitro eac and eaca do not affect immune globulins, but they doalter the membrane antigens of ehrlich ascites tumor cells and inhibitthe agglutination reaction induced by a specific antiserum . inhibitionis only partially due to the antigenic alteration observed, and itrepresents more prominently a direct interference at the level of theantigen-antibody reaction .the membrane antigen alternations induced by the drugs and by nitrogenmustard were compared, taking into account their toxicity.. eac and eacawere found to be much more active and more specific than nitrogenmustard .
