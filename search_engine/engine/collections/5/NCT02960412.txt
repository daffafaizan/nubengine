    
      Cystoscopy is performed routinely after urogynecologic surgery to ensure there was no injury
      to the urinary tract (urethra, bladder, or ureters). In order to confirm that no damage
      occurred to the ureters, a jet of urine must be visualized from each ureteral opening.

      The time it takes to confirm this ureteral patency is variable and some sources suggest using
      furosemide to decrease the time it takes to see these jets. This study will evaluate what
      effect, if any, this medicine has on time to confirming ureteral patency.
