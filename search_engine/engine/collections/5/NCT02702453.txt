    
      This proposal is innovative in a number of ways:

        -  The intervention is based on a full understanding of the complex nature of sexuality
           with its bio- (functional), psycho- (confidence), and social (relationship components).
           It incorporates modules that address each of these factors and their inter-dependencies.

        -  The intervention is sensitive to critical points in sexual recovery and to patient and
           partner preferences in the context of therapies for prostate cancer. The intervention
           acknowledges that there are certain time points at which concerns typically arise (e.g.,
           when preparing for definitive treatment). The effectiveness of the intervention is
           increased by the use of tailoring linked to patient reported outcomes (e.g., decreased
           erectile function, increases in depression indices) and to patient/partner preferences.

        -  The intervention includes partners as equal stakeholders in the sexual recovery and
           legitimizes their needs for sexual fulfillment and support

        -  The intervention demonstrates a sensitivity to sexual orientation and cultural diversity

        -  The intervention is scalable and available at limited or no cost to prostate cancer
           survivors and their partners regardless of geographical location or system of care.
