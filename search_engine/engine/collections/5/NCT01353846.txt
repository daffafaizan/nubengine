      ovarian function, it is necessary to synchronize the cycle of the egg donor with the
      recipient, usually through endometrial preparation of the recipient by artificial cycle, by
      administering a GnRH agonist on day 21 of cycle and then administered increasing doses of
      estrogen therapy to achieve adequate endometrial thickness.

      The necessity of synchronization between donors and recipient, has made possible not
      routinely the natural cycle for oocyte donation.

      The investigators have recently introduced oocyte vitrification and it allows us to plan the
      egg donation in a different way. Now the investigators can previously cryopreserved donor
      oocytes and at the time that the investigators have a compatible receiver, then, plan the
      donation In this study it will be possible compare the results of oocyte donation cycles in
      terms of pregnancy rate, implantation and liveborn, depending on whether the recipient has
      made an artificial cycle of preparation endometrial or a natural cycle.
