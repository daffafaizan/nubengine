      disorder characterized by loss of epidermal melanocytes and progressive depigmentation
      clinically, affecting from 0.5% to 1% of the world population and about 1% in China Vitiligo
      can be a psychologically crushing associated with low quality of life, especially in colored
      skinned individuals. The pathoetiology of vitiligo is multifactorial and has genetic,
      immunological, and environmental components. Several environment-associated mechanisms have
      been implicated to explain melanocyte disappearance, including ultraviolet (UV) radiation
      exposure, repeated mechanical or thermal stress, and exposure to chemicals (especially
      phenols or catechols), but epidemiologic data remain limited.

      Broader gut dysbioses have been identified as potential causes or contributing factors to
      human autoimmune diseases; however, human studies have not yet identified microbial
      compositional or functional triggers that are predictive of skin autoimmunity or vitiligo.
      Metabolites from intestinal microbiota are key determinants of host-microbe mutualism and,
      consequently, the health or disease of the intestinal tract. However, whether such
      host-microbe crosstalk influences inflammation in peripheral tissues, such as the skin, is
      poorly understood.

      The investigators will perform a metagenome association study and serum metabolomics
      profiling in a cohort of vitiligo Chinese individuals.
