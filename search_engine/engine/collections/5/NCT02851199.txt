           performed additional 3 minutes of hyperventilation in the sitting position

        2. A group of 15 children who will undergoe an EEG recording with 3 minutes of

           another 5-10 minutes of recording with normal breathing. . Finally the participants will
           performed additional 3 minutes of hyperventilation in the prone position.

      Participants who will not be able to perform all the steps of the study will be excluded The

      pediatric epilepsy who will confirm whether the EEG recording show epileptic discharge (sharp
