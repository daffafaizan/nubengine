      second most common after low back pain, is seen in the society at a rate of 22-31%, and as it
      becomes chronic, it leads to an increase in doctor visits. KBA, which often originates from
      the spine and its surrounding soft tissues, can also be reflected from extravertebral
      tissues. Common clinical problems that cause neck pain include pathologies such as
      discopathies of cervical origin, spondylosis, stenosis, myofascial pain syndrome, and
      mechanical trauma caused by factors such as overuse and improper posture.It is known that
      being physically inactive in musculoskeletal system pain causes the pain to become chronic.
      However, CBA may prefer to remain physically inactive due to pain avoidance behaviors in
      individuals. Kinesiophobia, known as movement aversion; It is defined as "excessive avoidance
      of movement due to pain, re-injury and sensitivity". In addition to pain and impairment in
      functionality, CBA can lead to movement avoidance behaviors, many neuromuscular system and
      biomechanical disorders in individuals.In the studies in the literature, there are no studies
      that determine the effectiveness of the treatment approaches applied in individuals with CBA
      on functional status and pain, as well as movement avoidance and double-duty walking, which
      are effective in daily life. In this context, the aim of the study is to reveal the
      effectiveness of neck-specific exercises consisting of TENS, US and
      stretching-posture-strengthening exercises on pain intensity, functionality, kinesophobia and
      double and single task walking speed in individuals with CBA.
