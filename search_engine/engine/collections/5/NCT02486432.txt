    
      This is a single centre, open-label, single period study in healthy subjects. Each subject
      will receive the following regimen:

      On Day -2, 10 mg domperidone administered every 8 hours 3 times a day (for illustrative
      purposes, dosing at 07:30, 15:30 and 23:30) On Day -1, 3 doses of 100 mg Sinemet® (every 8
      hours) administered as 2 × Sinemet® 12.5 mg/50 mg tablets containing 13.5 mg carbidopa
      (equivalent to 12.5 mg anhydrous carbidopa) and 50 mg levodopa. Subjects will receive
      concomitant 10 mg domperidone 30 minutes before every Sinemet® dose.

      On Day 1, Sinemet® 12.5 mg/50 mg containing 13.5 mg carbidopa (equivalent to 12.5 mg of
      anhydrous carbidopa) and 50 mg levodopa administered every hour for 16 consecutive doses
      (total dose of 800 mg). Subjects will also receive concomitant domperidone up to 20 mg 30
      minutes before the first Sinemet® 50 mg dose and every 8 hours (total of 3 doses) after
      treatment initiation.

      It is planned to enrol 6 subjects to ensure there are 6 evaluable subjects. A subject is
      considered to be evaluable if they have received all 16 Sinemet® 50 mg doses.
