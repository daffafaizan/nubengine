    
      1. Establish a clinical data base for the lung cancer patients treated with radiotherapy in
      Tongji Hospital.

        1. Data including age, gender, smoking state, KPS, pulmonary function, disease history,
           histology, stage, surgery, chemotherapy, dosimetric parameters of radiotherapy were
           collected.

        2. Peripheral blood was collected from all patients enrolled.

        3. All patients enrolled in this study are examined during and one month after
           radiotherapy. Then, the patients are followed every three months for the first year and
           every six months thereafter. At each follow-up visits, all patients are asked to undergo
           a chest X-ray or CT and clinical information, including symptoms, is collected. RP is
           graded by two radiation oncologists according to the Common Terminology Criteria for
           Adverse Events 4.0.

      2. Select candidate genes and pathways which may be associated with radiation pneumonitis and
      identify their tagSNPs by Haploview.

      3. Use Kaplan-Meier and Cox model to analyze the association of all the factors collected
      with radiation pneumonitis.

      4. Establish a biological prediction models for radiation pneumonitis based on the statistics
      analysis.
