      early rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the best dosage for GCs, related to both, efficacy and
      safety, is not known.

      OBJECTIVE: To compare two standard p.o. GC starting dosages and the non-use of GCs in the
      treatment of patients with early active RA on the background of the established 'anchor'
      therapy with methotrexate (MTX).

      METHODS: Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial with two treatment arms (starting
      with 10 or 60 mg of p.o. prednisolone (P), tapered down to 5 mg P per day within 8 weeks) and
      one placebo arm, each arm comprising 150 patients. Duration of intervention is 12 weeks. In
      parallel, all patients start medication with MTX, usual dosage 15 mg/week. Primary efficacy
      endpoint is progression of radiographic damage after one year compared to baseline. Secondary
      endpoints are: percentage of patients in remission, changes of functional capacity etc.
      Safety monitoring is performed.

      The analysis is performed in three hierarchical steps. First step is an analysis of
      covariance to compare the group with an initial P dosage of 60 mg (V60) and the placebo group
      (Pl). In case of a statistical significant result (α = 0.05), a comparison of the group
      starting with 10 mg P (V10) and Pl will be done in a second step (α = 0.05). In case of
      superiority of V10 versus Pl, a third step will be a non-inferiority test for V10 versus V60
      (α = 0.025).
