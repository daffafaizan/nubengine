    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of osimertinib (AZD9291) in combination with
      navitoclax in patients with EGFR-mutant non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) following
      resistance to prior EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI).

      II. To evaluate the feasibility of treatment with AZD9291 plus navitoclax for patients with
      T790M-mediated acquired resistance to EGFR TKI.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study the pharmacokinetic profile of the combination of AZD9291 plus navitoclax.

      II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity.

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To study plasma genotype levels as a response biomarker in patients with EGFR-mutant lung
      cancer.

      II. To explore tissue biomarkers of apoptosis and their association with treatment response.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study followed by a dose-expansion study.

      Patients receive navitoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and osimertinib PO QD on
      days 4-28 (days 1-28 during dose-expansion). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
