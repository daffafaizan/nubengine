      website (randomization.com) by a non-involved researcher. At study beginning, volunteers will
      be evaluated through structured questionnaire. They will be submitted to the following
      evaluations: (i) Unified Parkinson's disease Rating Scale (UPDRS); (ii) Parkinson's disease
      Sleep Scale; (iii) Parkinson's disease questionnaire; (iv) Short version of Balance
      Evaluation Systems Test; (v) Timed up and go; (vi) 5-times sit to stand test; (iv) Patient
      Global Impression of Change Scale. The cortical activity of the patients will be assessed
      through electroencephalography and transcranial magnetic stimulation.

      Treatment - Participants will be randomly allocated to one of the following experimental
      protocols: (i) real high frequency rTMS + physical therapy protocol; (ii) real low frequency
      rTMS + physical therapy protocol; (iii) rTMS sham + physiotherapeutic protocol. The sessions
      will be performed five times a week for two weeks. Individuals allocated to the high
      frequency rTMS group will be performed the following protocol: first the coil center will be
      positioned over Cz for the first 1000 pulses. Then the coil will be moved to C4 and C3, where
      1000 pulses will be delivered to each hemisphere. The intensity will be set to 100% of the
      motor threshold. The high frequency stimulation will be delivered at 10 Hz, offered in 20
      50-pulse trains, with 30-second train intervals. The low frequency will be performed at 1 Hz.
      All groups will be treated with physical therapy immediately after rTMS.
