      control) on clinical outcomes, 2) test for endogenous opioid mechanisms of the intervention
      (indexed by the difference in laboratory evoked pain response between placebo and naloxone
      drug conditions), and 3) test the effects of the intervention on morphine responses (indexed
      by the difference in evoked pain response between placebo and morphine laboratory drug
      conditions).

      This project will determine whether enhancing endogenous opioids (via aerobic exercise
      training) permits achieving desired levels of analgesia with lower dosages of opioid
      analgesics, and fewer side effects and abuse-relevant drug effects. This 4 year project will
      test study hypotheses in a sample of 116 chronic low back pain patients. The study will have
      two key elements: 1) a randomized, controlled aerobic exercise manipulation in CP patients
      completing daily electronic pain diaries and 2) laboratory evoked thermal pain protocols pre-
      and post-exercise permitting direct examination of changes in both opioid analgesic effects
      (in response to a series of incremental morphine doses) and EO activity (indexed by comparing
      pain responses after placebo vs. opioid blockade).

      The study will use a 6 week supervised aerobic exercise manipulation, with subjects randomly
      assigned to the exercise protocol or a no exercise control condition.

      The study will employ a mixed between/within-subjects design using double-blind,
      counterbalanced, placebo-controlled administration of both an opioid antagonist (naloxone)
      and an opioid agonist (morphine). All participants will undergo three identical laboratory
      pain-induction sessions (each â‰ˆ5 days apart) prior to randomization to experimental
      condition, and again at the end of the 6 week exercise manipulation period (regardless of
      exercise group assignment) during which they will receive the 3 study drugs and participate
      in controlled laboratory evaluation of evoked thermal pain responsiveness.
