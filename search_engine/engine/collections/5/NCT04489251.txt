    
      Aim 1: This study will correlate proteins in the TGF- β signaling pathway and micro RNA
      levels with invasive (catheterization) and non-invasive (echocardiography) measurements of
      pulmonary artery pressures to assess for the presence and severity of PAH and compare these
      measurements to the established biomarkers of NT Pro BNP and CRP levels.

      Hypothesis 1: Plasma levels of proteins of the TGF-β pathway; bone morphogenic protein (BMP)
      2, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10 along with activin A and TGF-β1 protein as well as CHIP
      (carboxyl-terminus of Hsp70-intracting protein), an enzyme that regulates the activations and
      exports of TGF- β to the nucleus will be significantly different in subjects with PH over
      control subjects.

      Hypothesis 2: Plasma levels of proteins in the TGF- β pathway; BMP 2, 4, 6, 7, 9 and 10 along
      with activin A and TGF-β1 protein as well as CHIP will show better correlation with the
      presence of PAH and its severity than NT-Pro BNP and CRP levels.

      Hypothesis 3: The micro-RNA profiles in plasma will be significantly different in subjects
      with PAHPH over control subjects.

      Aim 2: To correlate protein/micro-RNA levels with clinical status in PAH subjects as assessed
      by functional status, exercise testing, and PAH drug regimen to determine if they can
      correlate with disease severity.

      Hypothesis 1: Clinical findings in PAH patients will correlate with disease severity and
      study proteins and micro-RNA levels better than established biomarkers.

      Aim 3: To correlate evidence of genetic abnormalities through whole exome sequencing
      especially in regions known or suspected to cause PAH (e.g. BMPR2, ENG, and ALK1 mutations),
      within the TGF-β pathway or lung development with the tested protein/micro-RNA levels.

      Hypothesis 1: Genetic evaluation of patients with PAH will show abnormalities within the
      TGF-β pathway or lung development.
