      Foundation Trust (ESNEFT) in collaboration with University of Suffolk (UoS). This research
      study is being led by the Haematology Clinical team.

      We aim to analyse subsets of lymphocytes in the prospective blood smear slides using machine
      learning and AI algorithm obtained from patients with a positive qPCR test for COVID-19 who
      have required a hospital admission. The control group will consist of archived blood smear
      slide data from patients both with i) non-suspected viral infections, and ii) those with a
      non-COVID-19 viral infection obtained prior to the emergence of COVID-19 infection in the
      United Kingdom. In total, 785 blood smear slides will be analysed. The aim of our study is to
      establish the diagnosis of COVID 19 infection based on lymphocyte morphology on patients with
      COVID-19 infection from other patients with non COVID -19 viral infections. A high definition
      single cell lymphocyte image from patients with COVID 19 infection and control group will be
      analysed using open source histopathology imaging software CellProfiler against very fine
      cytoplasmic and nuclear details of the cells through supervised and unsupervised machine
      learning algorithm to identify recurring pattern that is unique to COVID 19 infection. The
      study will also assess other relevant clinical, haematological and biochemical parameters in
      conjunction with the above morphological features to develop a risk stratification tool to
      predict the clinical outcome of patients with COVID-19 infection with high specificity and
      sensitivity using bioinformatics pipeline.
