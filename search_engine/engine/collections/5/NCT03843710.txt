    
      This is a single-center open label pilot, sequential group, investigator blinded study of the
      CNS metabolic effects, safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of CNM-Au8 in patients
      who have been diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis within twelve months of Screening.
      The Sponsor will select a starting treatment dose of CNM-Au8 for the initial treatment.
      Investigators and patients will be blinded to each cohort's study dose. Upon completion of
      the first treatment cohort, the Sponsor will select a single dose or two different doses for
      the subsequent second cohort from a pre-specified dosing selection plan based on the
      evaluation of the 31P-Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (31P-MRS) changes versus baseline in
      the first cohort. Up to a total of two treatment cohorts may be studied (n=12
      patients/cohort, total n=24 patients). All patients will receive daily oral treatment over
      twelve consecutive weeks during each cohort's Treatment Period.

      There will be three study periods per treatment cohort:

      A four-week screening period (Screening Period); A twelve-week treatment period (Treatment
      Period); A four-week follow-up period (End-of-Study Assessment).

      The primary study outcome, CNS metabolic changes, will be assessed based upon each patient's
      Week 12 study visit versus the pre-treatment baseline. The primary endpoint is the brain
      metabolic effects of treatment with CNM-Au8 as assessed by an improvement of 31P-MRS
      assessment of Brain Tissue Cellular Redox Potential defined by the measured tissue ratio of
      NAD+:NADH concentrations following 12 weeks of once daily treatment.
