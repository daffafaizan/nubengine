      pain. Subjects will complete two screening sessions before completing four study sessions
      that will occur once weekly. Participants will receive double blind doses of study
      medications the morning of each experimental session day and will undergo standardized pain
      testing, physical functioning assessment, blood draws, ratings of drug effects and cognitive
      testing.
