      early-stage breast cancer. Adjuvant radiotherapy may encounter technical difficulties in
      patients with pendulous breasts when treated in supine position.

      Based upon literature and our own preliminary experiences, we hypothesize that for large
      pendulous breasts, breast irradiation in supine and prone position are equivalent with regard
      to coverage of the PTV, but with a better dose homogeneity in prone position and a smaller
      radiation exposure of lung and heart. However, no quantitative data are yet available to test
      this hypothesis. Therefore, the aim of our study is to compare the 3-D dose distribution in
      PTV and normal tissues in prone position versus supine position. For treatment in
      prone-position an in-house developed device, the "mammaboard" was used.
