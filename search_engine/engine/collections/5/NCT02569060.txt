      achieving long-term control of blood sugar levels (glycemic control) and preventing
      diabetes-associated complications. This education is often difficult to access for highly
      vulnerable and marginalized adults in the United States. Furthermore, foods for a diabetic
      diet are often out of reach for food insecure households. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the extent to which food banks and food pantries can help reach this population
      with effective DSME, food, and access to primary health care. The investigators' primary
      outcome of interest is HbA1c improvement in the intervention group compared to a wait-listed
      control group of food pantry clients living with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.
