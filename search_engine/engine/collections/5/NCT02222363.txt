    
      This Phase I, open label dose escalation study of VLX600 in patients with refractory advanced
      solid tumors will determine the safety profile and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of VLX600
      when administered by intravenous infusion on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day treatment
      cycle. Dose escalation will proceed according to the standard "3 + 3" design using doubling
      doses. The doses are: 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 210 mg VLX600.
