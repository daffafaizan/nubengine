    
      Serum BDNF, proBDNF and MMP-9 in all participants will be measured before and after the
      comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation during subacute stroke phase. At 3 months after stroke
      onset, serum BDNF, proBDNF and MMP-9 will also be measured.

      In addition, motor impairment with Fugl-Meyer assessement will be assessed at same time
      points with serum analysis.

      We will compare potential serum biomarkers with motor impairment in stroke patients
