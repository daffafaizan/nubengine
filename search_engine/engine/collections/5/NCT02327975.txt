        -  Evaluate effectiveness of a physical exercise program for 10 weeks to improve fitness,
           cardiovascular, anthropometric and body composition parameters in people over 53 years.

        -  Examine effects of exercise intervention delivered through a mobile application
           (WhatsApp) on fitness, cardiovascular risk factors, anthropometric and body composition
           in people over 53 years.

      Hypotheses of the study:

        -  An intervention of exercise administered via mobile application (WhatsApp) is effective
           in reducing cardiovascular risk factors in people over 53 years.

        -  An intervention of exercise administered via mobile application (WhatsApp) is effective
           to increase physical fitness in people over 53 years.

        -  An intervention of exercise administered via mobile application (WhatsApp) is effective
           in reducing BMI, percent body fat; and in increasing the percentage of muscle mass in
           people over 53 years.

        -  10-weeks face-to-face intervention of physical exercise obtains greater improvements in
           fitness parameters than an intervention delivered via mobile application in people over
           53 years.

        -  10-weeks face-to-face intervention of physical exercise obtains greater improvements in
           anthropometric and body composition than an intervention delivered via mobile
           application in people over 53 years.
