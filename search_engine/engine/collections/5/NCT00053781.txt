        -  Determine the efficacy of perifosine, in terms of response rate, in previously untreated
           patients with metastatic or recurrent malignant melanoma.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral perifosine daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who
      achieve a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) receive 2 additional courses after
      documentation of CR or stable PR (i.e., no further tumor shrinkage).

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18
      months.
