      anemia mechanism before and after red packed cells transfusion: iron status, vitamin assays,
      hemolysis markers.

      The patient selection criteria are:

        -  age > or = 18 years

        -  No history of transfusion > or = 2 years

        -  Anemia (any etiology known or assumed)

        -  Decision of red packed cells transfusion for the current episode

        -  Transfusion performed at BEAUJON Hospital

        -  Agreement of patient for the study

      Number of subjects required: 100 patients

      Study duration and duration of participation for each patient:

        -  duration of the study: 1 year

        -  for each patient the participation to the study began at baseline after the decision of
           transfusion and stopped at the second sample ie at least 72 hours after the transfusion
           of red blood cells.

      The maximum contribution for one patient is 5 days.

      Methodology: It is a prospective non interventional monocentric (BEAUJON Hospital) study. Two
      blood tests will be performed; one before transfusion and the other from 48 to 72 hours after
      red packed cells transfusion.

      The following parameters will be measured before and after red packed cells transfusion:

      Complete blood count (CBC) with reticulocyte count; complete iron status (ferritin, serum
      iron, transferrin, transferrin saturation), soluble transferrin receptor; serum and
      intraerythrocytic folate levels, vitamin B12; lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), bilirubin (total
      and free), haptoglobin, orosomucoid, direct coombs test; creatinine; CRP.

      The aim of this work is to study the changes of key assays useful for the understanding of
      anemia mechanism before and after red packed cells transfusion: iron status, vitamin assays,
      hemolysis markers.
