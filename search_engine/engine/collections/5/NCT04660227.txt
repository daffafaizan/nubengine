      cerebellar and cognitive dysfunctions due to the destruction of the central nervous system.
      These disorders may cause limitation of physical activity in people with POMS. In a study
      comparing people with POMS with monophasic acquired demyelinating syndrome (mono-ADS) and
      healthy controls in terms of physical activity levels, it was reported that people with POMS
      performed less physical activity compared to other groups. In addition, it has been reported
      that people with POMS have increased complaints such as depression and fatigue and their
      quality of life decreases. The aim of this study is to examine the effect of online exercise
      training on physical activity, balance, fatigue and quality of life in pediatric-onset
      multiple sclerosis patients.Participants will be randomly divided into two groups, the online
      exercise program group and the control group, after the evaluations. Participants in the
      online exercise program group will be given a treatment protocol consisting of aerobic
      exercise and strengthening exercises in the presence of a physiotherapist for a total of 8
      weeks, 1 hour on 2 days a week. The exercise program will be created according to the
      condition of the people and progression will be provided every 2 weeks. After the exercises
      are completed, cooling will be done with stretching exercises. Participants in the control
      group will be put on the waiting list after all assessment methods are applied and will be
      re-evaluated at the end of 8 weeks. Application of the exercise training online will prevent
      the difficulties of continuing the exercise program due to transportation problems,
      disability level or pandemic and will facilitate the participation of people with POMS in the
      study.
