      Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA) which is significantly overexpressed in prostate tumor
      cells. By attaching radioactive isotope 68Ga to PSMA ligands, PET/CT molecular imaging can
      provide information regarding prostate cancer relapses and metastases with high contrast .
      Several recent studies showed the potential of 68Ga-PSMA PET in many application correlated
      with prostate cancer such as staging, identifying reoccurrence, guided biopsy and others . In
      the study, we wish to utilize the new hybrid PET/MR technology and combine 68Ga-PSMA PET
      studies with MRS information in order to explore correlation between the data obtained by
      both modalities and investigate the implication on the disease characteristics.
