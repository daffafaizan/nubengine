      (3-AP) in patients with solid tumors by evaluating the safety and tolerability, maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended dose for Phase II studies, pharmacokinetics, and tumor
      response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive 3-aminopyridine-2-carboxaldehyde
      thiosemicarbazone (3-AP) IV over 2 hours on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of 3-AP until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity. Patients are followed for 4 weeks or until recovered.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 21 patients will be accrued for this study.
