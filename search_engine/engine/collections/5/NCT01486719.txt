      the same finger was used in 12 fingers in 12 patients. The flaps ranged in size from 2.0 ×
      2.0 cm to 2.8 × 2.2 cm. The mean pedicle length was 1.2 cm. Neurorrhaphy between the dorsal
      branches of the PDN and PDN was performed in both sides in all cases. Sensibility of the
      reconstructed finger pulp was evaluated by static 2-point discrimination (2PD) and
      Semmes-Weinstein monofilament test. The range of motion of the donor fingers was measured.
      The data were compared to those of the opposite sides.
