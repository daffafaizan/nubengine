    
      Primary Objectives

        -  To investigate by magnetic resonance (MR) imaging the spatial and temporal distribution
           of topotecan in tumor-infiltrated brain administered by convection-enhanced delivery
           (CED) in patients with recurrent/progressive WHO grade III or IV (high grade) glioma
           (HGG) who have failed standard therapy comprising surgical biopsy and/or resection and
           adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy, following a clinically-indicated resection of
           the contrast enhancing tumor mass.

        -  To investigate by MR imaging the influence of catheter positioning, on the spatial and
           temporal distribution of topotecan administered by CED in patients with
           recurrent/progressive HGG

        -  To evaluate the extent of spatial distribution of topotecan, by MR imaging, when
           delivered into non-enhancing tumor tissue (as defined on pre-operative conventional MRI
           imaging with and without intravenous gadolinium) in the intraoperative setting, the
           immediate peri-operative setting, and in the post-operative setting.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To investigate the extent to which CED-mediated delivery of topotecan

        -  To investigate the extent to which infusate can be distributed in the 2 cm margin around
           the resection cavity by administration by CED

        -  To assess the safety, tolerability and toxicity profile of topotecan administered by CED
           using different infusion rates.

        -  To observe evidence of activity of single-agent topotecan administered by CED to
           patients with recurrent/progressive HGG who have failed standard therapy comprising
           surgical biopsy and/or resection and adjuvant chemotherapy and radiotherapy.
