      Primary

        -  Determine the frequency of complete response in patients with stage III or IV melanoma
           who have achieved either a partial response or stable disease after prior systemic
           chemotherapy and are treated with maintenance biotherapy comprising interleukin-2 and
           sargramostim (GM-CSF).

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the effects of this regimen on lymphocyte subsets in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to response to prior systemic chemotherapy (stable
      disease [SD] vs partial response [PR]).

      Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-14 and low-dose
      interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, and 22-26. Treatment repeats every 28 days
      for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      also receive pulses of high-dose IL-2* IV continuously over 42 hours on days 1 and 2 of
      courses 2, 3, 5, 6, 8, 10 and 12.

      NOTE: *Low-dose IL-2 and GM-CSF are not administered on days 1 and 2 of high-dose IL-2
      administration

      Patients who continue to have SD or a PR after 12 courses of therapy may continue to receive
      treatment with GM-CSF and low-dose IL-2 as described above and high-dose IL-2 on days 1 and 2
      of every third course.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-58 patients (10-29 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study.
