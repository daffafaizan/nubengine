    
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether this vaccination schedule induces
      sufficient protective immunity (serotype-specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)
      and opsonophagocytosis (OPA) response rates) in AAV-patients receiving immunosuppressive
      therapy.
