      chemotherapeutic regimen considered to be best standard of care and consisting of either
      nitrosoureas, platinum compounds, temozolomide, procarbazine, PCV, (procarbazine, lomustine
      (CCNU) & vincristine), CPT-11, or Etoposide. A planned interim analysis of the primary
      efficacy endpoint will be conducted after approximately 50% of the required events have been
      observed.
