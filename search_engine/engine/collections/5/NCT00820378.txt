      levels in a large group of Chinese population with clinically evident arterial disease or
      cardiovascular risk factors to further explored the risk factors and potential alternative
      pathomechanisms for the development of aortic dilatation. Comprehensive transthoracic M-mode,
      2-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiographic studies will be performed using commercially
      available equipment. The aortic dimensions were assessed at end-diastole at the different
      levels: (1) the annulus, (2) the mid-point of the sinuses of Valsalva, (3) the sinotubular
      junction, (4) the ascending aorta at the level of its largest diameter, (5) the transverse
      arch, (6) the descending aorta posterior to the left atrium, and (7) the abdominal aorta just
      distal to the origin of the renal arteries. The extension of dilation is defined as the
      number of dilated aortic segments. The relations among aortic dimensions and clinical
      characteristics will be assessed by multiple regression analysis. The current study was to
      determine the association of risk factors of CVD and atherosclerosis diseases with aortic
      dimension in Chinese patients with clinical event atherosclerotic disease or risk factors of
      atherosclerotic disease.
