    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To demonstrate that biweekly intravenous (IV) pegaspargase beginning with Consolidation
      and ending with completion of delayed intensification (DI) in combination with hemi-augmented
      BFM therapy (hABFM) is feasible and safe in children with high risk (HR) acute lymphoblastic
      leukemia (ALL).

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to risk assignment (high-risk [HR]-average [day 29
      minimal residual disease (MRD) < 0.01%] vs HR-high [MRD >= 0.01%, presence of central nervous
      system [CNS]3 leukemia, testicular disease, myeloid/mixed lineage leukemia [MLL]
      rearrangement, hypodiploidy, or steroid therapy within the past month]). Patients are
      assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.*

      (Note: *Amendment 2 [4-22-2011] requires changes in the regimens. See the changes below,
      after Maintenance therapy.)

      INDUCTION THERAPY: All patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1; vincristine
      sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; prednisone IV or orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days
      1-28; daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; methotrexate IT
      on days 8 and 29*; and pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on day 4.

      (Note: *Patients with CNS3 disease [white blood cells [(WBC)] >= 5/uL and positive for blasts
      on cytospin] also receive methotrexate IT on days 15 and 22.)

      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY (begins on day 36 of induction therapy):

      GROUP A (HR-AVERAGE): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 29;
      cytarabine IV over 15 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-4, 8-11, 29-32, and 36-39;
      mercaptopurine PO once daily (QD) on days 1-14 and 29-42; vincristine sulfate IV on days 15,
      22, 43, and 50; methotrexate IT on days 1, 8, 15*, and 22*; and pegaspargase IV over 1-2
      hours on days 15 and 43.

      GROUP B (HR-HIGH): Patients receive cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, mercaptopurine, vincristine
      sulfate, and methotrexate as in Group A. Beginning on day 1, patients also receive
      pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours every 2 weeks. Patients with CNS3 disease undergo cranial
      radiotherapy QD for 10 days and patients with testicular disease undergo testicular
      radiotherapy QD for 12 days, beginning on day 1 of consolidation.

      (Note: *Patients with CNS3 disease [WBC >= 5/uL and positive for blasts on cytospin] do not
      receive methotrexate IT on days 15 and 22.)

      Interim maintenance (IM) therapy (begins on day 57 of consolidation):

      GROUP A: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 11, 21, 31, and 41; methotrexate
      IV over 10-15 minutes on days 1, 11, 21, 31, and 41; methotrexate IT on days 1 and 31; and
      pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on days 2 and 22.

      GROUP B: Patients receive vincristine sulfate and methotrexate as in Group A. Beginning on
      day 1, patients also receive pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours every 2 weeks.

      DI therapy (begins on day 57 of IM):

      GROUP A: Patients receive vincristine sulfate IV on days 1, 8, 15, 43, and 50; dexamethasone
      IV or PO BID on days 1-7 and 15-21; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1,
      8, and 15; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 29; cytarabine IV over 15 minutes or SC on
      days 29-32 and 36-39; thioguanine PO on days 29-42; methotrexate IT on days 1, 29, and 36;
      and pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on days 4 and 43.

      GROUP B: Patients receive vincristine sulfate, dexamethasone, doxorubicin hydrochloride,
      cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, thioguanine, and methotrexate as in Group A. Beginning on day
      1, patients also receive pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours every 2 weeks.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY (MT; begins on day 57 of DI): All patients receive vincristine sulfate IV
      on days 1, 29, and 57; prednisone PO BID on days 1-5, 29-33, and 57-61; mercaptopurine PO on
      days 1-84; methotrexate IT on day 1; and methotrexate PO BID on days 8, 15, 22, 29*, 36, 43,
      50, 57, 64, 71, and 78.

      In both groups, MT repeats every 12 weeks until total duration of therapy is 2 years from the
      start of IM for female patients and 3 years from the start of IM for male patients. Patients
      in Group B who did not undergo radiotherapy to the brain during consolidation therapy undergo
      prophylactic cranial radiotherapy (CR) daily for 8 days.

      ([Note: *Patients in Group A also receive methotrexate IT on day 29 of courses 1-4 [no oral
      methotrexate]).

      REVISED MT (RMT): The regimen is the same as standard MT, but 2 of the doses of IT
      methotrexate are omitted (day 29 of courses 3 and 4).
