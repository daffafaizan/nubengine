      was collected prior to randomization to account for size and ICU baseline prevalence of MRSA
      in randomization scheme. Randomization occurred at the hospital level.

      Eligibility survey was conducted to determine exclusion criteria.

      As of May 2010, enrollment has been closed. 45 hospitals were randomized, but two were found
      to meet exclusion criteria and were excluded. As-randomized (or as-assigned) analysis
      included 43 hospitals, representing 74 ICUs. Individual (patient-level) subject enrollment
      during intervention is 74,256.
