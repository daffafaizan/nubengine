      third leading cause of pancreatitis after biliary and alcoholic etiology.
      Hypertriglyceridemia can be caused by primary causes, lipid metabolism disorders and
      secondary causes.

      Hyperlipidemic pancreatitis can be provoked when triglyceride levels (TGL) exceed 11.3 mmol/l
      (1,000 mg/dl). Except for standard symptomatic treatment, plasmapheresis and insulin have
      been performed to rapidly reduce TGL and chylomicron levels in the blood.The therapeutic
      efficacy of intensive insulin, standard insulin, and plasmapheresis in patients with
      hypertriglyceridemia induced moderate/severe acute pancreatitis on the course and outcome of
      disease.After acceptance patients will be randomized by random envelope in the 3 groups:
      Group A: intensive insulin (glycemic control 4.4-6.1mmol/L), Group B: standard insulin
      (glycemic control 7.8-10.0 mmol/L), and Group C: plasmapheresis.
