      with inflammatory or degenerative changes, often accompanied by fatigue and sleep problems,
      in addition to anxiety, depression and cognitive dysfunction. Its prevalence in Europe for
      adults is estimated at 2.5% with a higher proportion of women. The treatment incorporates
      physical activity and exercise as one of its therapeutic aims has shown positive effects on
      health outcomes.However, it has been reported that women with fibromyalgia are less active
      than others with similar socio-demographic characteristics.Theories of behavioral
      self-regulation that taking into account motivational and volitional processes
      (implementation intentions) provide a conceptual framework to work with the incorporation and
      maintenance of the exercise, helping these people to create strong goals and handle the
      different self-regulation problems that can arise. These include the ones related to the
      preference for avoidance goals (pain or fatigue avoidance) against performing or keep doing
      an activity (walking exercise). This work searches to help women with fibromyalgia to manage
      the above mentioned inhibitors to incorporate and maintain long-term physical exercise
      walking. We consider the heterogeneity of people with fibromyalgia in pain catastrophizing,
      which makes necessary to adapt interventions aimed to promote physical exercise.

      We expect participants with high catastrophizing and implementation intentions to control the
      preference for avoiding pain or fatigue will walk more time than the other conditions.
