      they are associated with decreased quality of life, increased psychological distress, and
      increased use of health care services, the assessment of somatic symptom burden is essential
      in evidence based patient care and research. The Patient Health Questionnaire-15 (PHQ-15) is
      a frequently used questionnaire to assess somatic symptom burden, but in which there are not
      any mental symptoms listed. Recently, we developed the Somatic Symptom Scale China (SSS-CN)
      which includes common mental symptoms and more comprehensive somatic symptoms to assess
      somatic symptom burden, but its assessment value has not yet been widely tested.

      The aim of our study is to investigate the reliability and validity of the SSS-CN compared
      with the PHQ-15. We also try to use the SSS-CN to investigate the prevalence of somatic
      symptoms in patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) based on multi-centers
      inpatients.
