      patients (for each phase) with known T2DM and hospitalized for any cause. Therefore, being
      the data collection retrospective, patients will be managed according to routine clinical
      practice. During phase 2, 36 randomized centers, out of the 54 ones enrolled, will receive an
      educational intervention based on outreach visit (EOV), a 3-h face-to-face meeting between a
      trained diabetes specialist from outside the Center and the staff of the Center itself. This
      method was selected being considered as one of the most effective to modify professional
      practice and improve health care outcomes. In addition, at least 50% of the physicians who
      are part of the staff of the Center will receive distance learning (FAD). The contents of the
      educational program will be defined by the study Steering Committee, on the basis of
      guidelines, and possible deviations from the best medical practice detected during phase 1.
      In order to minimize the "awareness bias" (i.e. the possibility that participation to the
      project significantly influence clinical attitudes in phase 3), only one physician of the
      Centers of the "Control" group (not receiving EOV) will be made aware of the study design and
      procedures, and he/she will be eventually supported in the study data collection by nurses,
      or physicians who do not have the possibility of prescribing, in particular regarding the new
      categories of antidiabetic drugs.
