    
      Gaucher disease is characterized by lysosomal accumulation of glucosylceramide due to
      impaired glucosylceramide hydrolysis. Type 1 Gaucher disease, the most common form accounts
      for greater than (>) 90% of cases and does not involve the central nervous system (CNS).
      Typical manifestations of Type 1 Gaucher disease include splenomegaly, hepatomegaly,
      thrombocytopenia, anemia, skeletal pathology and decreased quality of life. The disease
      manifestations are caused by the accumulations of glucosylceramide (storage material) in
      Gaucher cells which have infiltrated the spleen and liver as well as other tissue. Eliglustat
      tartrate is a small molecule developed as an oral therapy which acts to specifically inhibit
      production of this storage material in Gaucher cells.

      This study was designed to determine the efficacy, safety, and pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      eliglustat tartrate in adult participants (>16 years) with Gaucher disease Type 1. The study
      consisted of 2 periods: The Double-Blind Primary Analysis Period (PAP [Day 1 to Week 39]) and
      the Long Term Treatment Period (LTTP/Open-Label Period (post-Week 39 [Day 1 of the Open-Label
      Period] through study completion).
