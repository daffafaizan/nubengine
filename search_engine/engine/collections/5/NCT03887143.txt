      treatments (IV thrombolysis, endovascular treatments) and adapted management pathways in
      adult patients. Nevertheless randomized trials did not enroll patients under the age of 18
      years old and data concerning these treatments in children are scarce. As it is much less
      frequent than in adults, recognition of stroke is often delayed in children. Consequently,
      acute phase trials are difficult to set up and perform. The phase I multicentric
      international prospective trial TIPS (Thrombolysis in Pediatric Stroke) was prematurely
      stopped because of poor enrollment. Published retrospective regional (Paris-Ile-de-France
      region, France) and national (Switzerland) studies addressed the feasibility of such
      treatments but, because of small samples (less than 20 patients in each study), efficiency
      and prognostic factors could not be addressed.

      Exhaustive retrospective studies in a definite geographic area but with a sufficient number
      of patients in a limited inclusion period would provide these crucial data and address these
      questions with good relevance and limited bias.
