      many different organizations. Such efforts at improvement in care are warranted, because CAP,
      especially severe CAP remains the leading cause of death in the world. Despite advances in
      antimicrobial therapy, rates of mortality due to severe CAP have not decreased significantly
      since penicillin became routinely available.

      traditional Chinese Medicine, has been used for thousands of years in treating pneumonia. To
      date, it has become popular and widely practiced in many countries around the world. In the
      past decades, Evidences from both clinicians and patients suggest that there is some
      beneficial effect of TCM on severe CAP.

      At present, there are many therapies available for patients with severe CAP, it is difficult
      for us to identify the most suitable therapy. Thus, this study aims to compare the efficacy
      of combination conventional drug and TCM to the conventional drug and placebo, and then
      determine which one is the better therapy, providing a scientific basis for clinical
      decision.

      This is a multi-center, randomized, controlled trial to compare the efficacy of two therapies
      for patients with severe CAP. 198 subjects will be randomly assigned to one therapies
      (conventional drug, and the combination of conventional drug and TCM) for 28 days treatment.
      After the treatment period, subjects in two arms will be followed up for 12 weeks. The
      primary outcomes will include treatment failure, and secondary outcomes Time to clinical
      stability, length hospital stays, in-hospital mortality, SOFA questionnaire, quality of life
      (CAP-PRO ) and health economics.
