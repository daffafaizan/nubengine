      can vary considerably between 1 mm and 10 mm. In order to standardize the placement of the
      suburethral sling we choose two different distances between urethra and sling.

      Transobturator tape (TOT) are placed according to the surgical technique described by Delorme
      et al. in patients with a previous cervico-sacropexy (CESA) or vagino-sacropexy (VASA).
      Before final fixation of the sling and suturing the vaginal skin a Hegar dilator sound with
      either 8 mm or 6 mm diameter is placed in the urethra and a second Hegar dilator sound with
      either 4 mm or 3 mm diameter is placed between the tape and the urethra. After suturing the
      vaginal skin the Hegar sounds are removed.

      According to the used Hegar dilator sounds two different techniques are used:

      TOT 8/4 or TOT 6/3.
