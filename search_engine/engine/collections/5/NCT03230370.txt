      participants will be randomly assigned into two experiment groups (enhanced upper extremity
      program; and enhanced lower-extremity program).

      Both groups receive routine rehabilitation including daily 50 mins of physical therapy and 50
      mins of occupational therapy.

      The enhanced upper extremity program group receives additional daily 50 mins program focusing
      on training of the hemiplegic upper extremity, while the enhanced lower-extremity program
      group receives additional daily 50 mins program focusing on training of the hemiplegic lower
      extremity. The participants receive 20-day training over a 4-week period. The additional
      program is designed to be specific to either upper-extremity or lower-extremity. Accordingly,
      one group can be used as the control group of the other one.
