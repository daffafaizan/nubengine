      mother-child interaction and post-operative rehabilitation. Its management is important for a
      quick recovery and allow the mother to take care and link with her newborn. Currently,
      intrathecal opioids are the most commonly used technique and provide the foundation for
      post-cesarean analgesia. This technique combined with multimodal analgesia reduces the doses
      of morphine consumed, including these side effects. Spinal anesthesia is the standard
      anesthetic technique for caesarean section; it offers several advantages including the
      possibility of prescribing oral analgesics. An ideal analgesic protocol is one that is simple
      to implement, cost-effective, and has minimal impact on the work staff. It would have a good
      safety profile, a low incidence of side effects and complications, and respond to wide
      inter-patient variability. It relieves the mother of high quality pain while having minimal
      interference with her, newborn care and anesthesia while allowing safe breastfeeding.

      The aim of this work is to compare the quality of an multimodal oral analgesia with
      intravenous analgesia and to demonstrate non-inferiority of the oral route pain relieve in
      postoperative caesarean section period. The secondary objectives was to evaluate the maternal
      tolerance of the drugs (piroxicam, nefopam, paracetamol) used postoperatively of a caesarean
      section.
