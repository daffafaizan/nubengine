      and 14 asymptomatic women without complaints of POP and UUI in the control group. Biopsy
      samples were collected from bilateral USL tissues during vaginal or abdominal hysterectomy.
      Total RNA was extracted from USL tissue and analyzed by qPCR. The protein expression levels
      were also analyzed with ELISA.
