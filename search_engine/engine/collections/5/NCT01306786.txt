      (esomeprazole 20mg b.d., bismuth subcitrate 120mg q.i.d., tetracycline 250mg q.i.d. and
      metronidazole 250mg q.i.d.) or EAC (esomeprazole 20mg b.d., amoxicillin 1g b.d. and
      clarithromycin 500mg b.d.). H. pylori status was rechecked by 13C urea breath test 8 weeks
      after treatment. Patients who failed their respective therapy were invited to undergo H.
      pylori susceptibility testing and crossover to receive the alternative regimen for the same
      duration.
