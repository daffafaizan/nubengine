      Freiburg, Germany in 2005 for the assessment of skeletal muscle perfusion deficits in
      peripheral arterial disease (PAD). It has been reported previously by the investigators that
      the contrast agent wash-in is significantly prolonged in PAD with respect to the extent of
      disease and with respect to the degree of collateralization.

      The goal of this study is to examine the effect of revascularization procedures on muscular
      perfusion in 15 PAD patients undergoing lower limb artery bypass surgery and 15 PAD patients
      undergoing percutaneous angioplasty (PTA) before and after intervention. Based on the data
      from a pilot study, a power calculation for an alpha = 5% with a power of 80% and an assumed
      standard deviation of 10 s yielded a necessary patient number of 29 per group to detect a
      decrease in wash-in time of 7.5 s. In this intra-individual comparison we aim to compare 30
      patients pre with the same 30 patients post revascularization.

      We hypothesize 1) that the contrast agent wash-in in the target muscle will significantly
      improve after revascularization and 2) that standard non-invasive tests such ankle-brachial
      index (ABI) will not correlate with the CUPI findings. The results of this trial will help to
      further understand the diagnostic accuracy of CUPI in quantifying limb muscle perfusion
      deficits.

      Patients with symptomatic PAD and an indication for revascularization will undergo CUPI less
      than 8 weeks prior and less than 3 weeks after the revascularization procedure. A second
      follow-up CUPI examination is performed 3 - 6 months after the revascularization procedure.
