      clinics on a yearly basis. During the health visits PHNs assess and promote the health and
      wellbeing of the whole family through health discussions.

      In this study we aim to evaluate whether the addition of gamified method into the health
      discussion promotes healthy behaviors and mindfulness of the families and increases the
      family-centered approach of health visit compared to the traditional method.

      WellWe-intervention includes the use of gamified WellWe app at home and during the health
      discussion in the Child health clinic. Usual care includes paper-based questionnaires filled
      by the parents and health discussion using these questionnaires in the Child health clinic.
