      population. Anemia is a condition in which a patient has below normal levels of hemoglobin,
      the substance in red blood cells that carries oxygen to all parts of the body. People with
      severe anemia may experience fatigue and shortness of breath with activity. Therefore, this
      condition can have a negative influence on a person's quality of life. Epoetin alfa, used to
      treat anemia in cancer patients, is a genetically engineered protein that stimulates red
      blood cell production. This study investigates treatment of anemia using epoetin alfa during
      chemotherapy in adult patients with cancer. The study is intended to collect information on
      normal medical practice and routine anemia management performed at the participating centers.
      This is an observational, non-randomized, prospective, comparative, parallel-group survey
      performed in The Netherlands. Patients with various severities of disease may enter the
      survey as soon as their epoetin alfa treatment starts and will be followed until the end of
      their epoetin alfa treatment. Patient data are collected in Case Report Forms (CRFs) until 4
      weeks after the end of treatment with epoetin alfa. At the end of treatment completed CRFs
      will be collected. The assessment of effectiveness/response will be based on the following:
      cancer type and status, chemotherapy and other anti-cancer treatment, hemoglobin levels, use
      of blood transfusions, and serum iron levels and iron supplementation. Safety evaluations
      include the incidence of serious and non-serious adverse events. Because the study is
      observational, dosage, administration and duration of treatment is at discretion of treating
      physician.
