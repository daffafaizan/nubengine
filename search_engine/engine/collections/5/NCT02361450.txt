      defecation disorders are important issues the Spina Bifida National Reference Center has to
      deal with. Indeed, more than half of patients are concerned. These disorders are mainly due
      to fecal stasis. Treatments include laxatives and hygiene recommendations. Colonic irrigation
      can also be useful, especially to achieve colonic vacuity and improve continence. The use of
      intra-rectal balloon inflation probes and the control of instillation flow improved
      retrograde colonic irrigation efficacy. Nevertheless, this technique is currently not
      evaluated in young adults suffering from Spina Bifida functional digestive sequelae, who are
      mainly concerned by Malone enema.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the efficacy of retrograde colonic irrigation
      associated with usual care (medical treatments, patient education) on anorectal dysfunction
      (incontinence and/or constipation), compared to usual care only.
