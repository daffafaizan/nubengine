      I. Perform a phase I clinical trial to clearly define the toxicity profile of IV HER2Bi armed
      T cells in patients with neoplasms of digestive system.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate phenotype, cytokine profiles and tumor markers, cytotoxicity directed at
      laboratory Her2 positive cancer cell lines.

      II. Evaluate the clinical symptoms and signs, clinical responses, imaging examination of
      pretherapy and post-treatment, cytokine profiles and tumor markers in serum before and after
      treatment, time to progression, and overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a safety study of IV infused HER2Bi-armed activated T cells. Patients
      receive HER2Bi armed T cells IV weekly for 4 weeks. Patients also receive low-dose
      Interleukin subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning 3 days before the first HER2Bi armed T cells
      infusion. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
