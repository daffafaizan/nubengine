      11/100 000 per year in Denmark.

      The disease can potentially affect the entire gastrointestinal tract, though the most common
      affected area is terminal ileum and the adjacent part of colon.

      CD is a result of both genetic and environmental factors together with the intestinal
      microbiota, however the precise etiology is unclear.

      A change of the intestinal microbiota with a reduced occurrence of e.g. Bacteroides species,
      Firmicutes and the anti-inflammatory bacteria Faecalibacterium prausnitzii is found in CD
      patients compared to healthy controls. Also a reduction of the mucosa-associated
      Bifidobacteria has been associated with the risk of mucosal inflammation.

      The hypothesis that an imbalance between potentially beneficial and pathogenic bacteria
      contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD, including CD, has led to the suggestion that
      manipulation of the microbiota may be an attractive target for therapeutic interventions in
      IBD.

      A new probiotic bacterium, Bifidobacterium breve Bif195 (Bif195) has been identified and has
      shown great effects on preventing enteropathy and ulcers on the gut mucosa in healthy
      volunteers given acetylsalicylic acid (13), and thereby Bif195 has also shown a potential in
      reducing gut permeability defects. This bacterium has not yet been investigated in CD
      patients.
