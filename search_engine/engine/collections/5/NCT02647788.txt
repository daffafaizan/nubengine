    
      Primary Objective:

      To establish, through a randomized control trial, whether post-operative Acetaminophen and
      Ibuprofen (non-opioid regimen) would provide equivalent post-operative analgesia to
      ambulatory hand surgery patients compared to Acetaminophen and Codeine (opioid regimen).

      Secondary Objective:

      To establish whether the opioid versus non-opioid post-operative pain regimen influences
      patient satisfaction.

      Sixty-three patients enrolled for each group (non-opioid and opioid). Approximately 145
      patients will be required to achieve complete data for 63 patients in each group (assuming
      15% lost to follow-up & failure to comply with study protocol).
