      management. In the traditional model of care, blood samples are taken from patients at the
      clinic and are sent to the laboratory for analysis and the results may not be available for a
      number of hours/days after the clinic visit.

      A new analyser has been developed (Allegro™) which allows the tests to be undertaken at the
      clinic, with the results available in a few minutes. This means that patients can get
      immediate feedback and that the doctors/nurses can adjust treatment before the patient leaves
      the clinic. It is obviously important that this analyser performs to a similar degree of
      accuracy to the laboratory analyses.

      The aim of this research study is to assess the accuracy of the Allegro™ analyser compared to
      laboratory analyses on finger prick capillary blood samples and urine samples. Fifty (50)
      patients with diabetes will be invited to give a venous blood sample, finger prick capillary
      blood sample and urine sample. The venous blood sample, finger prick capillary blood sample
      and urine sample will be analysed by both the Allegro™ analyser and laboratory analyses and
      the results compared. The Allegro™ results will not be used in the management of the
      patients' diabetes.
