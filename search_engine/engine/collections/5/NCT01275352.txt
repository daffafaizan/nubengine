      homozygous for the ClC-Ka Gly/Gly83 and the ClC-Ka Arg/Arg 83 allele. All patients will be on
      background therapy with an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin
      receptor blocker (ARB) at least mid range dosing. If patient is not at recommended dose of
      ACE or ARB they must be titrated up and be stable on a midrange dose of ACEI or ARB for at
      least 4 weeks before they can be entered into the study. There will be 2 treatment phases.
      Phase 1 will be up to 4 weeks in duration and will consist of randomization to one table of
      eplerenone (25 mg) or matching placebo. On week 2 the patient will be up titrated to two
      tablets of eplerenone (50 mg) or matching placebo, to achieve a target dose of 50 mg of
      eplerenone. If the patient cannot tolerate two tablets of eplerenone or matching placebo they
      can be down titrated to one tablet of eplerenone or matching placebo. The target BP on study
      medication is < 130/80 mmHg. After the patients have been up titrated to the maximally
      tolerated dose of study medication, the background hypertension therapy can be adjusted to
      reach the target BP of < 130/80 mmHg by the end of week 4. Phase 2 will be 52 weeks in
      duration to assess the effects of placebo or eplerenone on LV hypertrophy. Serum potassium
      will be monitored throughout the study, and if necessary, doses of eplerenone will be
      titrated down as necessary.
