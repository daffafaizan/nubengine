    
      The 5 ml/Kg surfactant is warm to room temperature. Using standard laryngoscope without
      premedication while the infant is maintained on continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP.
      The the laryngoscope should be removed after stabilizing the vascular catheter between 2
      fingers at the level of lips (weight +6 cm). The surfactant will be administer by boluses of
      0.25 -0.5 ml at a time over 20-30 seconds and 10 seconds apart while maintain the vital
      signs.

      The procedure should be stopped if the vital signs deteriorate, CPAP pressure and oxygen
      requirement might need to adjusted to restore baseline vital signs. If the vital signs
      remained unstable the catheter should be removed and the infant managed according by positive
      pressure ventilation (PPV) or intubation by endotracheal tube (ETT).

      At the end of the procedure the catheter should be flushed with 0.5 ml of air then catheter
      should be removed.

      FiO2 (fraction of inspired oxygen), oxygen saturation and CPAP pressure will be recorded
      before during and after the procedure.

      Complication like bradycardia (Hear rate below 100 beat per minute) or Apnea (pause of
      respiration for more than 20 second or less than 20 seconds but associated with bradycardia)
      All other neonatal outcome will be recorded (IVH [Intra-ventricular Hemorrhage], ROP
      [Retinopathy of prematurity], duration of ventilation, duration of hospital stay, infection,
      duration of oxygen requirement and others.
