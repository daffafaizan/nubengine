      malignancies. However, post CD19-CART relapses occur at high rate due to the CD19 antigen
      loss or the exhaustion of CART cells. Furthermore, the success of treating
      relapsed/refractory B cell lymphoma (BCL) such as primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL)
      and CNS-involved BCL has been limited. To overcome tumor escape and prolong in vivo CART
      efficacy, we have developed a novel multiple CAR-T therapy regimen including booster and
      consolidation CART applications to to target highly-refractory cancer. Selected patients will
      be enrolled after target antigen confirmation including CD19, CD20, CD22, CD70, CD13, CD79b,
      GD2 and PSMA through immunostaining of their tumor specimens. The aim is to evaluate safety
      and long term efficacy of the multiple CART therapy strategy in the BCL patients.
