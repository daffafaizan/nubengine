      complete a series of 21 sessions of rTMS over the course of four weeks.During the first
      visit, they will be asked to undergo 1 hour of EEG (Electroencephalograph) before they start
      the repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation sessions (rTMS), 0.5-hour of memory testing
      using MoCA and Trail Making Test (Trial A and B), 1 hour of rTMS and 1 hour of EEG after
      rTMS. The second visit will start approximately 24-72 hours after the first visit. During
      visit 2 to visit 20, participants will receive about 1 hour of TMS session 5 days a week for
      4 weeks. During the 21st visit, which will be approximately one day after the last TMS
      session, participants will be asked to repeat 1 hour of EEG before TMS; 0.5-hour of memory
      testing using MoCA and Trail Making Test (Trial A and B), 1 hour TMS and 1 hour of EEG after
      TMS. For this study, a questionnaire concerning any potential side effects will be
      administrated before and after each session.
