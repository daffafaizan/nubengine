    
      Prospective clinical study in ICU of ventilated patients with ARDS. The morphologic pulmonary
      effects of IPV with VDR4 are not known to the investigators' knowledge.

      The main aim is to quantify recruited, normally aerated and overinflated parts of the lungs
      after a 1 hour treatment with IPV.

      Patients with ARDS (focal and non focal) consecutively admitted to the investigators' ICU are
      enrolled after informed consent.

      Patients are intubated and ventilated with Servo-I (GE) and ventilation is optimized
      according to ARDS-network recommandations.

      A first thoracic CT-scan is performed with ICU ventilator and then the patient is ventilated
      with VDR4 during 1 hour.

      A second thoracic CT-scan is then performed and the patient re-ventilated with ICU
      ventilator.

      Arterial blood gases and hemodynamic parameters are recorded during experiments.

      CT-scan are analysed and compared for normally aerated, overinflated and recruited lung
      parenchyma. Regions are determined thanks to their Hounsfield units (HU).
