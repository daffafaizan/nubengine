      acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSIs) caused or suspected to be caused
      by susceptible isolates of designated Gram-positive microorganisms. This is a Phase I, single
      center, double-blind, study evaluating the PK and safety of a new formulation of oritavancin
      by adjusting infusion time, concentration and reconstitution/administration solutions, of a
      single 1200 mg intravenous (IV) infusion of oritavancin in healthy adult subjects.
