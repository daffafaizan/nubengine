      alternative to the use of gastric bypass operative techniques as a means of re-routing food
      and altering the gut-hormone axis. The EndoBarrier® SANS™ provides an alternate passage of
      chime through the duodenum and proximal sixty centimeters of jejunum replicating in part the
      bypass of bariatric surgery.

      This study will be conducted at a single clinical site in Malaysia. Approximately 16 subjects
      will be enrolled in two cohorts of 8 subjects. The two cohorts will be implanted one week
      apart with the implantation of the second cohort triggered by the absence of major technical
      or clinical issues (i.e. safety, tolerability) observed in the first cohort in the first
      seven days.
