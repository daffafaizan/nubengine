      medication adherence questionnaire. Results from each arm will be compared to the ambulatory
      medication list on file with the clinic and a separate medication review interview conducted
      by a trained clinician. We intend to compare adherence patterns and medication use
      discrepancy rates between each approach. This data will help us to determine what strategies
      work best to solicit an accurate medication history from the patient.
