      as of 2015 with an annual death toll of 1.5 million, and the overwhelming majority of these
      have Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Hypertension is a common comorbidity of diabetes and
      present in more than 50% of diabetic patients. The risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD) is
      four-fold higher in patients with both DM and hypertension as compared to the normotensive
      non-diabetic controls. Obesity, with a prevalence of over 500 million, is another common
      comorbidity of diabetes. These are chronic diseases associated with increased risks of
      cardiovascular disease, stroke, and decreased quality of life.

      Neurotronic developed a novel catheter for denervation procedure. Chemical agent is delivered
      locally into the adventitial space and ablates the sympathetic nerve and nerve endings in the
      adventitial space of the target arteries.

      The purpose of the study is to assess the safety and feasibility of chemical denervation of
      the target arteries for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and its comorbidities.
