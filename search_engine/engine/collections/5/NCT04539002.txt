      young adulthood, affecting more than 2.5 million people worldwide. Permanent disability in MS
      is caused by recurrent demyelination due to episodic inflammation, followed by neuronal
      damage, axonal degeneration, and progressive failure of remyelination. There is an urgent
      need to restore activity and participation in people with MS (pwMS), and remyelination is the
      most promising therapeutic strategy to accomplish this goal.

      Remyelination in pwMS will likely require integration of pharmacologic and rehabilitative
      approaches to ensure effective remyelination of appropriate neural pathways. Aerobic exercise
      is an ideal complement to remyelinating medications because aerobic exercise 1) improves
      walking function in pwMS, and 2) promotes remyelination in animal models both independently
      and synergistically with medications. However, there are many unknowns that need to be
      addressed before aerobic exercise can be explored in multimodal clinical trials for
      remyelination. First, it is imperative to understand how myelination impacts disability in
      MS, as many other factors could contribute to reduced activity and participation.
      Additionally, as remyelination occurs over 12 to 24 weeks, it is imperative to establish the
      feasibility of similar duration of aerobic exercise interventions, and explore if exercise
      independently influences established remyelination outcomes before integration into
      multimodal strategies.

      This is a randomized, single-blind, parallel clinical trial of a 24-week aerobic stationary
      cycling intervention to determine feasibility and explore if aerobic exercise independently
      promotes remyelination in pwMS.
