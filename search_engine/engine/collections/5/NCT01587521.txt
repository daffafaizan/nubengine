      population. The criterion for metabolic syndrome in Asian people including: elevated waist
      circumference (male ≥ 90cm, female ≥ 80cm), elevated triglycerides ≥ 150mg/dL, reduced HDL
      cholesterol: male < 40mg/dL, female < 50mg/dL, elevated blood pressure: ≥ 130/85 mmHg,
      elevated fasting glucose: ≥ 100mg/dL. Several factors have been found to be associated with
      metabolic syndrome in schizophrenia, e.g. age, antipsychotic drugs, smoking, family history
      of metabolic disorder, stress, and quality of life.

        2. Identify the factors associated with metabolic syndrome in patients with schizophrenia.
