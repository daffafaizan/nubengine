    
      Aim 1: The clinical and virological status of chronic Hepatitis B (HBV) infection is defined
      by distinct patterns of immune effector and regulatory responses: The investigators propose
      that one or more immune regulatory are induced during chronic hepatitis B that define the
      extent of immune tolerance vs. activation with associated disease activity and viremia.
      Towards this end, the immune effector and regulatory responses relative to serum HBV DNA,
      alanine aminotransferase (ALT), Hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), Hepatitis B surface antigen
      (HBsAg) and liver histology will be examined in a cross-sectional manner in patients with
      chronic HBV and control groups.

      Aim 2: Clinical hepatitis flares during chronic hepatitis B reflect altered balance between
      immune regulatory and effector responses.
