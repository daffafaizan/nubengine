      evaluate older adults after their falls, but the typical evaluation consists of an injury
      assessment alone. There is a critical need for an ED-based intervention that addresses
      reasons for the fall and provides on-the-spot assessment and guidance to prevent subsequent
      falls. Failure to prevent subsequent falls will result in increased morbidity, mortality,
      healthcare utilization, loss of independence, and rising health care costs as the population
      of older adults increases.

      Participants in GAPcare will be older adults (â‰¥65 years-old) who present to the ED for a
      fall. We will pursue the following specific aims to test and further refine the GAPcare
      intervention: (1) Examine the feasibility of recruitment and retention of eligible patients
      into the GAPcare intervention, (2) determine the initial efficacy of the GAPcare intervention
      in reducing subsequent falls and healthcare utilization at 6 months. Our long-term goal is to
      prevent the early morbidity and mortality of older adults who present to the ED after a fall.
      The overall objective of this survey is to gather preliminary data on the feasibility of an
      ED based fall prevention project.
