      represent 9.5 % of the population which is the third large category appendix (3). So without
      the early detection of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis for that age group, bad impacts will
      be implemented for Egyptian society by causing disabilities and psychological problems for
      these children.

      The early detection of scoliosis is of a great importance as curve detection before skeletal
      maturation gives a good opportunity for early treatment or prevention of curve progression.
      Scoliosis has a bad effect on cosmetic appearance, quality of life, Psychological well-being,
      disability, back Pain, breathing function. It may also progress in adulthood and need further
      treatment. So a multidimensional and comprehensive evaluation of scoliosis patients is
      necessary to design a complete therapeutic approach.
