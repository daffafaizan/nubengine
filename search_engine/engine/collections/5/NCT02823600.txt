      patient population (~300,000 Americans). Approximately 50% of this population has End-stage
      Retinal Disease (ESRD) due to diabetes. Dialysis patients are among the most debilitated
      patients, and thus, have even more barriers to receiving their recommended annual retinal
      evaluation. The advent of the RetinaVue hand-held retinal camera holds great promise in this
      population, as dialysis patients access medical care 3 times a week, for several hours at a
      time at their dialysis clinic.
