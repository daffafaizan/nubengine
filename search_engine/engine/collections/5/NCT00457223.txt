      auto-graft with promising outcome. Less recurrent rate, less discomfort and halve surgical
      time were reported.

      Up to our knowledge,there is no report of fibrin glue in pterygium excision with amniotic
      membrane transplantation(AMT). There is conventional technique to use AMT in King
      Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital because some benefits over conjunctival auto-graft e.g.

        -  Preserve healthy superior conjunctiva for future glaucoma filtering surgery

        -  Can use in big or 2-headed pterygium

        -  Not contract as conjunctival graft esp. in case of fibrin glue

        -  Potential easier to use with fibrin glue

           using fibrin glue compare to suture after pterygium excision.
