      physical examinations for these people, including ecg, X-ray, HIV,blood pressure, specific
      gamma-interferon detection(γ-IFN) ,collection of medical history and the like .These subjects
      who meet the standard are considered as study population I. Population I are injected
      intradermally with ESAT6-CFP10 and Tuberculin purified protein derivative(TB-PPD) at
      different arm of the same subject and get at least 360 participants whose three kinds of
      detection result are all negative(specific gamma-interferon detection ,TB-PPD and ESAT6-CFP10
      ) and are considered as study population II.Then,they are immune to the Bacillus Calmette
      -Guerin(BCG) vaccine or the placebo of the BCG(BCG and the palcebo ratio of 2:1 ),they are
      incorporated into the Population III. Do specific gamma-interferon detection before the skin
      test,then inject intradermally with ESAT6-CFP10 and TB-PPD at different arm of the same
      subject 12 weeks after immunity. Evaluate the specificity of the ESAT6-CFP10 allergen by
      negative coincidence rate for BCG vaccinated crowd ,and the safety of ESAT6-CFP10 in all
      participant,and the correlation between ESAT6-CFP10 ,TB-PPD and γ-IFN.
