    
      Women with postmenopausal hot flashes will be recruited via social media and randomly
      assigned to an intervention or control group. The intervention group will be asked to consume
      a low-fat, vegan diet including Â½ cup (86g) cooked soybeans (30 g uncooked) for 162 weeks.
      Support will be provided by weekly meetings conducted via an Internet video conferencing
      platform (e.g., Zoom), along with individual counseling as needed. The control group will be
      asked to make no diet changes for 12 weeks but will be offered instruction in how to follow a
      vegan diet and about the potential role of soybeans after the 12-week point. The frequency
      and severity of hot flashes will be assessed before, during, and after the 12-week
      intervention.
