    
      CAPAMETRIM 2 aims to characterize epileptic motor patterns by a quantitative
      three-dimensional analysis of movements.

      The project is planned in three phases:

        -  Installation of 3-D accelerometric and magnetic sensors acquisition systems on the
           hospital (extension of a preceding study CAPAMETRIM).

        -  Collection of data on epileptic patients. Sensors will be positioned on the right and
           left hands and on the head. A 3-D analysis of movements will be done according to the
           collection by tagging data with visual analysis made on video.

        -  Development of a motor pattern classification system used for seizure detection.
