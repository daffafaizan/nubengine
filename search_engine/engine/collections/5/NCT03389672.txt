      training process, practice period, and resident's attitude are important factors for
      determining performance. During the training process, neuraxial anesthesia safety is related
      to the operator's experience. Ultrasound can improve resident performance; however, using
      ultrasound technologies in well-established training programs may not be practical for all
      residencies.

      The paramedian approach bypasses most of the bony structures that may impede the advancement
      of an epidural needle in the midline approach. However, the paramedian approach requires a
      sharpened three-dimensional insight compared with the midline approach. We hypothesized that
      the higher the three-dimensional barrier, the higher the complications and number of puncture
      attempts. A modified paramedian approach may improve residency training and patient safety.
      The aim of this study was to investigate whether the modified method decreased practice
      attempts and patient complications.
