      formulation consists of four components:

        1. a duplex of synthetic, non-chemically-modified siRNA (C05C)

        2. a cyclodextrin-containing polymer (CAL101),

        3. a stabilizing agent (AD-PEG), and

        4. a targeting agent (AD-PEG-Tf) that contains the human transferrin protein (Tf). The
           cationic polymer interacts electrostatically with anionic siRNA to assemble into
           nanocomplexes below approximately 100 nm in diameter that protect the siRNA from
           nuclease degradation in serum. The siRNA-containing nanocomplexes are targeted to cells
           that over express the transferrin receptor (TfR). Upon reaching a target cell,
           transferrin binds to TfRs on the cell surface and the siRNA-containing nanocomplex
           enters the cell by endocytosis. Inside the cell, chemistry built into the polymer
           achieves unpackaging of the siRNA from the nanocomplex, permitting it to function via
           RNA interference.
