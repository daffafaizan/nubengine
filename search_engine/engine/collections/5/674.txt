experimentelle nierenvergroberung nach unilateralernephrektomie bei rattenuntersuchungen mit 3h-thymidinin this paper it is attempted to clarify certain questions as to the mechanismof compensatory renal hypertrophy by means of histological, cytological, andautoradiographical examinations in nephrectomy experiments on young and grownrats.  based on the results of this investigation the process of compensatoryrenal hypertrophy must be imagined as follows:as early as two hours after unilateral nephrectomy, a distinct increase of themitosis index without a simultaneous increase in dna-synthesizing cells wasobserved in the remaining kidney.  it is assumed that a cell division ofpolyploid cells is involved, which were in a prolonged premitotic rest phase.after a latent period of 48 hours, the dna-synthesizing cells and dividingcells start to increase.  the maximum of the regenerative processes is reachedbetween the 3rd and 4th day after nephrectomy.  twenty days after unilateralnephrectomy, the regenerative processes are largely concluded.all tubule sections participate in the compensatory renal hypertrophy.although the regenerative processes are most marked in the central section,one cannot speak of the development of an actual indifference zone in theregenerating kidney.in young test animals, compensatory renal hypertrophy is determined moreby mitotic cell division, in older test animals more by polyploidizationprocesses.the results of these investigations provide no certain indications for theassumption that amitotic nuclear divisions play a major part in compensatoryrenal hypertrophy.proliferation processes which in extent and localization run parallel to theregeneration of the parenchyma, are also observed in the cells of theconnective tissue of the renal vessels.
