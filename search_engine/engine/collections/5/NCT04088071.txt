    
      The REAL AF Registry is an observational, prospective, multi-center, non-randomized registry
      designed to obtain real-world clinical experience of Paroxysmal and Persistent ablation RF
      technologies (e.g., THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH®, THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® SF). Future new contact
      force technologies may be included as they become available in the market. Patient
      assessments will occur at the following time points: 1) pre-ablation, 2) procedure, 3) 10-12
      weeks, 4) 6 months (monitor only) and 5) 1 year post ablation.

      The objective of this registry is to assess clinical outcomes, including procedural
      efficiency, safety, long-term, effectiveness of RF ablations in the treatment of patients
      with Paroxysmal or Persistent atrial fibrillation. The outcomes of the registry are: 1) long
      term effectiveness defined as freedom from atrial arrhythmia recurrence post 90 day blanking
      period, and 2) acute and late onset complications.

      Sites selected for this registry will already have the following pre and post procedure
      assessments as part of their standard of care:

      Patient assessments at the following time points: (1) pre-ablation or baseline, (2)
      procedure, (3) 10-12 weeks, (4) 6 months (monitor only) and (5) 1 year post ablation.

      Pre ablation/baseline assessment should include: TTE (within 6 months of procedure),
      CHADS2Vasc, sleep apnea, AAD status, OAC, Medical and Arrhythmia History 10-12 Week Follow-Up
      Office Visit: Physician evaluation, AAD status, OAC usage, repeat TTE, and Arrhythmia
      Reoccurrence and Treatment Assessment Monitoring: 96-hour continuous heart rhythm monitor
      scheduled at 6 months and 12 months post ablation, with an event monitor ordered as needed
      for symptomatic arrhythmias.

      12 Month Follow up Office Visit: Physician evaluation, AF Type, AF Monitoring method, Sleep
      apnea, Post-procedure arrhythmia treatments, AF related symptoms and QOL improvement, AAD and
      OAC usage, CHA2DS2VASC and Arrhythmia Reoccurrence and Treatment Assessment
