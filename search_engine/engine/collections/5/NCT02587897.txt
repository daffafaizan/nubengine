      minimal retrospective and controlled prospective task exposure-for two years and compare them
      to a non-exposed cohort of occupational therapy students to investigate the primary aims.
      This research is directed at the National Occupational Research Agenda's (NORA) Healthcare
      and Social Assistance sector with a focus on the National Institute of Occupational Safety
      and Health's (NIOSH) Exposure Assessment and Musculoskeletal Disorders cross-sectors.
      Intermediate outcomes of this research will establish sonographic imaging as an early
      detection tool for workplace-screening and inform methods for combining measures of nerve
      morphology, neurophysiology, and subjective symptoms for predicting the development of
      work-related carpal tunnel syndrome. This work will also inform the development of targeted
      preventive interventions for task components of intensive hand activities that are related to
      changes in tissue morphology. Identifying morphologic changes in early-stages of pathology
      and the specific task components linked to these changes are the first steps toward early
      detection and prevention of work-related carpal tunnel syndrome.
