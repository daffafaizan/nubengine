      The overall objective is to measure the effect of growth hormone treatment (GHt) on physical
      and psychosocial health in adults of 30 years or older with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).

      The primary objective is to measure the effect of GHt on lean body mass as measured by Dual
      Energy X-ray Absorptiometry scan in adults of 30 years or older with PWS.

      The secondary objective is to measure the effect of GHt on total fat mass, bone density,
      physical health cardiovascular fitness, laboratory measurements, muscle strength, endurance,
      and psychosocial functioning in adults of 30 years or older with PWS. Also the occurrence of
      side-effects will be assessed.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      Randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled crossover trial for two years with a washout
      period of 3 months.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      50 adults with PWS of 30 years or older who have not been treated with GH during the past
      three years.

      INTERVENTION:

      subcutaneous injections of growth hormone (Genotropin, 5.0 mg/mL) in a dosage of 0.6 - 0.8
      mg/day. The comparator is placebo.
