      chronic HCV for the next several years, there are a number of complimentary antiviral agents
      in development including protease or polymerase inhibitors, RNA vaccines and immunomodulators
      (5). However, it would be unlikely to have FDA approval for any of these newer agents before
      the next 3 - 5 years, i.e. 2010-2012.

      Betaine, a naturally occurring anti-oxidant metabolite of choline and an amino acid analog
      (tri-methyl-glycine), serves as a methylation agent to re-methylate damaged cell proteins or
      enzymes (6). By virtue of its metabolic role in decreasing toxic metabolites, betaine also
      protects against alcohol-induced fatty liver and apoptosis. Recently, pilot studies performed
      both at the Mayo Clinic and here at UNMC showed its applicability as a treatment of
      non-alcoholic fatty liver in human subjects (7, 8).

      Betaine has also recently been found to promote interferon function by overcoming HCV -
      induced inhibition of interferon signaling (9). Naturally-occurring HCV proteins during human
      infection can hypo-methylate proteins integral to the Jak - STAT (signal transducers and
      activators of transcription) pathway, thereby inhibiting the antiviral activity of
      interferon. In cultured cells betaine administration, in a physiologically attainable
      concentration, restored STAT methylation and improved interferon signaling (9).
