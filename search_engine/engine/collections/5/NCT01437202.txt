           kinase in CML cells. However, some of the patients failed to achieve optimal response,
           and a substantial proportion of patients develop resistance to IM.

        2. IM is a substrate for the adenosine triphosphate binding cassette (ABC) transporters,
           ABCB1 and ABCG2, while the active uptake of IM into cells is mediated by the human
           organic cationic transporter-1 (hOCT1). Also, IM is metabolized through first pass drug
           metabolism by the cytochrome P450 - CYP3A4 and CYP3A5. In addition, it is delivered in a
           bound form with a plasma protein referred to Î±1-acid glycoprotein (AGP).

        3. Accordingly, the intracellular or systemic level of imatinib should be influenced by
           these factors such as ABCB1, ABCG2, hOCT1, CYP3A4, CYP3A5 or AGP genes. Inter-individual
           variability of 5 candidate genes associated with drug transport/metabolism (i.e. ABCB1,
           ABCG2, hOCT1, CYP3A4/3A5 and AGP) could affect the expression of corresponding proteins,
           thus influencing the treatment outcomes of imatinib therapy.

        4. In the investigators' previous study, the investigators reported the cumulative
           incidences of MCyR and CCyR was significantly affected by the predictive model using 2
           genotypes and disease stage. These predictive models for CCyR/MMoR or LOR/treatment
           failure seemed to work well. However, external validation of these predictive models is
           warranted especially using ethnically different independent cohort.
