      disease (CKD) progression. Emerging evidence in patients with CKD show that vitamin D and its
      analogs can reduce proteinuria or albuminuria in the presence of angiotensin-converting
      enzyme inhibithion. While some of the studies reported that vitamin D receptor activation has
      been associated with increased serum creatinine and reduced estimated glomerular filtration
      rates. Therefore, the investigators plan to conduct a randomized clinical study to evaluate
      the efficacy and safety of Calcitriol in the treatment of mild proteinuria (<1.0g/d) CKD
      patients,which has no specific treatment at present.
