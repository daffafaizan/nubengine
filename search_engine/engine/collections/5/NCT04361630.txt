      into a thick biotype by using recombinant human growth factor technology. A recent review
      stated that growth factors could enhance soft tissue regeneration which includes restoration
      of mucogingival architecture and regeneration of periodontal hard and soft tissues including
      bone, cementum and periodontal ligament fibers. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), a
      heparin-binding cytokine with strong angiogenic activity stimulates the proliferation of
      undifferentiated mesenchymal cells. These functions can be applied in mucogingival surgery as
      FGF-2 promotes bone and cementum formation and exhibits an increased potential to promote
      periodontal regeneration in recession defects.
