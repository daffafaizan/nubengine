      work, and enjoy activities that were once pleasurable. It is characterized by several
      symptoms, including as the following: persistent sad, anxious, or "empty" mood; feelings of
      hopelessness or pessimism; and feelings of guilt, worthlessness, or helplessness. The
      receptor-G protein-adenylate cyclase enzyme complex (AC enzyme complex) is a major cell
      signaling system in the brain, blood, and other tissues in the body. Changes in this
      signaling system among blood cells have been observed in people with major depressive
      disorder. Research has shown that treatment with the benzodiazepine alprazolam corrects the
      signaling problem, and thereby improves symptoms of MDD. This study will determine whether
      impairments in the AC enzyme complex exist among depressed individuals. This study will also
      evaluate the effectiveness of desipramine, an antidepressant, in improving blood cell
      signaling, and thereby decreasing symptoms of depression in people with major depressive
      disorder.

      Both healthy and depressed participants will be recruited for this study. All depressed
      participants in this study will first be assessed for depression severity using the Hamilton
      Depression Rating Scale. If eligible for the study, participants will be examined to
      determine AC enzyme complex functioning in both platelets and mononuclear leukocytes. A
      cohort of the depressed participants will be treated with desipramine. They will be examined
      to determine the drug's effect on AC enzyme complex functioning, as well as its effect on MDD
      symptoms, at Weeks 1, 4, and 6.
