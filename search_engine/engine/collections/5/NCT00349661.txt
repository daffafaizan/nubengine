      the anti-platelet agents aspirin and clopidogrel. This regime is kept up for between 1 and 6
      months, depending on the type of stent deployed in the angioplasty. The biological
      effectiveness of the clopidogrel treatment can be assessed by the VASP test, a new platelet
      test, results on which have been shown to correlate with risk of thrombosis. A study we ran
      recently strongly suggested that omeprazole was associated with a poor response to
      clopidogrel. Omeprazole is an anti-ulcer agent frequently prescribed to prevent unwanted
      side-effects of aspirin, making it frequently associated to clopidogrel in the aftermath of
      angioplasty.

      Study population: 120 patients from the Cardiology Department of Brest University hospital,
      Brest (France), receiving a standard treatment comprising a loading dose of clopidogrel
      followed by a daily dose of 75 mg associated to 75 mg aspirin, will be randomized between 20
      mg/day omeprazole and 20 mg/day placebo treatment groups. The efficacy of clopidogrel will be
      assessed by inter-group comparison on the VASP test.

      Study period: 7 days' treatment per patient. Total study period estimated at 6 months.
