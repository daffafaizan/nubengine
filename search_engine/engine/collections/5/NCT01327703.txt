    
      This is an open-label, Phase IV, multicenter, randomized, two-period cross-over study to
      compare the efficacy and safety of Panzytrat® 25,000 to Kreon® 25,000 in participants aged 7
      years and older suffering from CF and EPI. The study consists of a qualification phase (5 to
      15 days); two treatment periods of 14 days each (plus a 3-day window if needed) and a 3-day
      stool collection will be performed from Days 12 to 15.

      A safety follow-up phone call will be arranged 7-10 days after completion of the treatment
      phase or after an early discontinuation.
