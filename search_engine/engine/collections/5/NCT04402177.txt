    
      hypersensitivity Pneumonitis patients will be divided in two groups : non- fibrotic
      hypersensitivity Pneumonitis patients ( nfHP) and fibrotic hypersensitivity Pneumonitis
      patients ( fHP), based on HRCT findings.

      All patients will undergo the following assessment at the beginning of the study: High
      resolution CT (HRCT) of chest , Spirometry to assess forced expiratory volume in 1 second
      (FEV1), Forced vital capacity (FVC) and FEV1 to FVC ratio , 6minute walk test , Oximetry to
      measure percentage of oxygen in blood. Then all patients took methyl prednisolone 0.5mg/kg
      /day orally for 8 weeks .

      During the treatment period Pulmonary spirometry will be done every 2 weeks and 6 minute walk
      test will be done every 4 weeks as follow up At the end of the treatment period all these
      assessments will be repeated to compared the patients functional and clinical statues before
      and after taking methylprednisolone.
