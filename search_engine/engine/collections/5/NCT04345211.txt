    
      Study design A 4-week program will be implemented with sessions 2 days a week, 45-60 minutes
      per session. It would be convenient for each group to have 30 participants each. Group1:
      walking group. 40 minutes walking with supervision of the physiotherapist. 2 times per week.;
      Group 2: walking (40 minutes) plus self-administered thorax manual therapy (20 minutes). It
      will be applied in group and supervised by a physiotherapist. 2 times per week.; Group 3:
      walking (40 minutes) plus thorax exercises with elastic-band (20 minutes). It will be applied
      in group and supervised by a physiotherapist. 2 times per week.;Group 4: control group will
      do usual life and assessments as the rest of the groups.

      Oucome measures Pulmonary function: pulmonary function evaluation via forced spirometry
      dynamic lung volumes (forced vital capacity, FVC; forced expired volume at 1 second, FEV1).
      Chest wall expansion: A measuring tape is used to measure chest expansion in centimetres (cm)
      at two levels of the rib cage: upper chest expansion and lower chest. Exercise tolerance: 6
      Six Minute Walk Test. Smoking Index. The smoking index is a unit for measuring cigarettes
      consumption over a long period. Musculoskeletal Pain: visual analog scale. The pain VAS is a
      unidimensional measure of pain intensity, which has been widely used in diverse adult
      populations. Perception of change after treatment: Patient Global Impression of Improvement.
      Quality of life. Trigger points pain: by algometer. Change in thorax position: Distance
      between acromion-bed. Functional capacity: Sit-to-stand. Frailty: FRAIL Questionnaire.
      Motivation and self-efficacy: Participation motives are measured with the Exercise Motivation
      Index.
