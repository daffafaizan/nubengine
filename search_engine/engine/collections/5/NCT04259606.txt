      visit where written informed consent, clinical history, anthropometric measurements and blood
      samples will be performed.

      The second or initial visit (day 0) consists of review of laboratory results, hemodynamic
      studies (i.e brachial - ankle pulse wave velocity and index for arterial stiffness and flow
      mediated dilation on brachial artery for endothelial function with VP1000 and UNEX EF devices
      respectively), and after randomization, start of intervention (either cassia cinnamon or
      placebo).

      The third and fourth visits (day 30 and 60) consist of evaluation of treatment adherence,
