      the efficiency and effectiveness of cognitive functions including learning, memory,
      problem-solving and goal management, leading to significant functional disability. More
      intervention options are needed.

      We set out to test different possible interventions. Individuals with traumatic brain injury
      (TBI) and chronic executive control dysfunction participate in interventions, with pre- and
      post-intervention measurements of cognitive functioning. Training in Goal-oriented
      attentional self-regulation (GOALS) was administered in comparison to Brain Health Education
      (EDU).

      GOALS is designed to train attention regulation skills along with meta-cognitive strategies
      for goal management, with a emphasis on application to participant-selected projects. This is
      a group-based intervention.

      Brain Health Education is designed to increase knowledge and understanding of key factors
      that affect brain functioning. This is a group-based intervention matched to the GOALS
      intervention.
