      This bacterium has caused many outbreaks in Africa and Europe in recent past. It has been
      responsible for outbreaks between 2006 and 2010 in Kenya, Niger, Togo, Uganda, and Burkina
      Faso, the latter with at least 1,300 cases of serogroup X meningitis among the 6,732 reported
      annual cases. The WHO has expressed concerns over the lack of a serogroup X vaccine and has
      encouraged more research into it. As a result, Serum Institute of India Private Limited
      (SIIPL) has developed the candidate vaccine MCV-5 (currently renamed NmCV-5), which is a
      polyvalent conjugate vaccine composed of serogroups A, C, Y, W, and X of Neisseria
      meningitidis capsular polysaccharides, conjugated to protein carriers, CRM and tetanus
      toxoid, with aluminum phosphate as an adjuvant. It is intended for the prevention of
      meningitis and/or septicemia caused by serogroups A, C, Y, W, and X of N. meningitidis in
      countries where the disease is endemic and causes large epidemics, such as the countries in
      the African meningitis belt.

      The three-group design of the study will allow safety evaluation of the adjuvanted and
      nonadjuvanted MCV-5 formulations. MenactraÂ® has been chosen as the control vaccine, because
      of the large safety database accumulated since the vaccine has been introduced in the USA in
      2005 and progressively in other countries
