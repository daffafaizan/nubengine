      range of severity, natural history, molecular etiology, and pathophysiology of a number of

      congenital anomaly syndromes. The goal of the research is to develop a knowledge base that
      allows proper clinical and molecular diagnosis of patients with rare congenital anomaly

      disorders. Our paradigm is the previous work we have done with Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS)
      and Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS), where we have successfully used a combined
      clinical-molecular approach. Using this strategy, we have brought 50-100 patients or families
      with these disorders to the NIH clinical center (NIH CC) for a comprehensive clinical
      evaluation with follow-up at a frequency appropriate to the disorder. We have also clinically
      and/or molecularly evaluated many additional patients with atypical or non-classic
      presentations of PHS and GCPS and have conducted exploratory studies of other phenotypes to
      determine how they might fit into the more general models generated to explain PHS and GCPS.
      We are currently generalizing this approach to a number of disorders including talipes
      equinovarus, atrial septal defect, Robin sequence, and persistent left superior vena cava
      (TARP) syndrome. Specimens from patients participating in both the laboratory and clinical
      arms of the protocol will be collected and evaluated in the laboratory by linkage analysis,
      physical mapping, candidate gene characterization, mutation screening and targeted exome
      sequencing, and cell biologic studies of normal and mutant proteins.
