    
      A single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study to evaluate oral microbiology
      and safety of multiple C16G2 Strip applications in male and female dental subjects 12-75
      years of age.

      The study will compare multiple study drug administrations of 9.2 mg, 18.4 mg, and 36.8 mg
      C16G2 Strip or Placebo in Study Arms 1 through 3, respectively. Enrollment of subjects in
      Study Arms 1 through 3 will occur sequentially in an ascending dose-escalation manner. Before
      dosing of study drug, eligible subjects will receive professional dental prophylaxis between
      Days -7 and -2. Subjects will receive 11 doses administered over approximately two weeks.
      Each subject will receive a single dose on Day 0, followed by 5 days of AM and PM dosing
      starting on Day 7. To evaluate the durability of S. mutans suppression, study subjects will
      be followed for microbiology for up to 1 month after the last study drug administration.

      Clinic visits include Visit 1 (Screening/Days -30 to -1), Visit 2 (Prophylaxis/Day -7 to -2),
      Eligibility Confirmation & Baseline Visit 3, Follow-up Visits 4-7 (Safety and Microbiology),
      Visits 8-17 (Study Drug Administration), Follow-up Visits 18-20 (Safety and Microbiology) and
      Follow-up Visits 21-22 (Microbiology only).
