      mother's own milk, are susceptible to infectious diseases including sepsis and necrotizing
      enterocolitis. Infants with history of prenatal inflammation including chorioamnionitis may
      be at higher risks of acquiring these infectious diseases. Limited knowledge is available
      regarding a comprehensive temporal profile of circulating markers in preterm infants from
      birth to disease onset. This current study aims to provide a comprehensive temporal profile
      of circulating markers, via -omic techniques (proteomics and/or epigenetics), during the
      first 4 weeks of life in preterm infants with various systemic complications. Thus, this will
      elucidate a profile of early markers consistently associated with pathological conditions in
      the whole study period. Depending on the outcome, a subsequent study for validation may be
      performed.

      Primary objective: To characterize circulating markers associated with the early life
      complications including chorioamnionitis, LOS and NEC in preterm infants during the first
      four weeks of life.

      Secondary objective: To characterize how different feeding regimes and diets may affect these
      markers during the first four weeks of life in preterm infants
