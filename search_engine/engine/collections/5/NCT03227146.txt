      burns to elucidate the benefit of a tissue-engineered autologous skin substitute for the
      patient group with the highest mortality rates. Particular emphasis, apart from safety, will
      be placed on efficacy, including the ratio of covered surface area to harvested surface area
      and scar quality, in comparison to meshed STSG.
