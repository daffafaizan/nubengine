      early stages of healing. The aim of this work was investigate different factors associated
      with graft resorption in allogeneic bone block graft surgery.

      Materials and methods: Twenty-eight patients referred for implant placement and with
      insufficient bucco-lingual (BL) alveolar bone width (<4 mm) were included in the study.
      Patients received freeze dried bone allograft (FDBA) blocks of either allogeneic cancellous
      or cortico-cancellous bone obtained from the iliac crest. The aforementioned groups were
      compared in regards to bone resorption using General Estimating Equations (GEE) and logistic
      regression. Demographic data, trabecular bone density, graft site were also analyzed.
