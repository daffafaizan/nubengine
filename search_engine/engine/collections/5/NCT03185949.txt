      randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Endobar System for the treatment
      of obesity. Efficacy, Safety, and secondary outcomes will be evaluated at 6 and 12 months to
      allow expansion of the investigation into a larger, pivotal clinical study.

      Study Design This is a prospective randomized, single blind, active treatment and sham
      controlled, single-center trial . After the informed consent and screening process are
      completed, all subjects who are eligible and wish to participate in the study will undergo
      baseline testing. Those who complete baseline testing will be randomized to either Endobar
      Therapy (ET) or Sham Treatment (ST) for 52 weeks. Both groups will be given lifestyle therapy
      for weight loss, which involves treatment with a behavioral education weight loss program
      delivered as 19 individual sessions in person over 52 weeks. Endobar Therapy involves
      catheter-based embolization of the left gastric artery. After 26 weeks, the ET group will
      continue to be monitored for an addition 26 weeks and the ST subjects will be given ET and
      monitored for 26 weeks. The duration of the entire study will be 52 weeks.
