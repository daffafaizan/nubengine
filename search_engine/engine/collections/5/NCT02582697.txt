      chemotherapy for intermediate- and poor-risk metastatic germ cell tumours (GCTs). Cure rates
      are over 90% for good-risk disease, 85% with intermediate-risk, and about 70% for poor-risk
      disease. Previous strategies to improve first-line chemotherapy have failed to improve cure
      rates and were more toxic than BEP. New strategies are needed for patients with intermediate
      and poor-risk disease. BEP is accelerated by cycling Cisplatin and etoposide 2-weekly instead
      of 3-weekly. The Australian and New Zealand Urogenital and Prostate Cancer Trials Group
      (ANZUP) is conducting a trial comparing accelerated BEP with standard BEP. The aim of this
      study is to determine if accelerated BEP is superior to standard BEP as first-line
      chemotherapy for intermediate and poor risk metastatic GCTs.
