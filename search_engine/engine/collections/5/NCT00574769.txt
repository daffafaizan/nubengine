      treatment period, the patient will be given docetaxel/bevacizumab on day 1 followed by RAD001
      continuously on days 2-21 and this is called a treatment cycle. Patients will be able to
      continue to receive multiple treatment courses as long as the cancer does not get worse and
      the person does not develop other problems that would prevent him from staying in the study.
      The final part of the research is the study completion period which includes an end of
      treatment visit and subsequent follow-up visits. These visits take place whenever the
      research medication is stopped, even if it is stopped early. For the patient's safety, he/she
      should at least complete the end of treatment visit.
