      III-secretory pathway may be important in the pathogenesis of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). The studies will quantify bacterial
      effector proteins in serum and sputum and the immune response to specific products as
      reflected by antibodies in serum. Candidate effector proteins include: (1) exotoxin A, a
      non-type III-dependent ADP-ribosyltransferase and cytotoxin that does not use the Type III
      secretory pathway, (2) ExoS, a type III pathway-dependent extracellular
      ADP-ribosyltransferase with cytotoxic activity, (3) ExoU, another type III-dependent
      cytotoxin, that is responsible for epithelial injury in acute lung infections, and (4) PcrV,
      a homolog to the V antigen of Yersinia.
