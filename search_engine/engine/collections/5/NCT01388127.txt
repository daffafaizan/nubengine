      a clear beneficial neuroprotective effect in animal models of multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's
      disease, Huntington's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Animal models provide
      promising evidence of minocycline's ability to improve outcomes in an animal stroke model.

      In light of these findings, we will perform a double blind controlled study to investigate
      the efficacy of oral administration of 200 mg minocycline, on the neurological and functional
      outcome after acute hemorrhagic stroke and the effect on blood brain barrier permeability.
