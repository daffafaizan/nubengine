      Primary

        -  Determine the 2-year recurrence-free survival of patients with minimal metastatic
           colorectal cancer after hepatic resection when treated with adjuvant monoclonal antibody
           3H1 anti-idiotype vaccine and monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Beginning 6-12 weeks after curative hepatic resection, patients receive monoclonal antibody
      3H1 anti-idiotype vaccine and monoclonal antibody 11D10 anti-idiotype vaccine
      intracutaneously at separate sites on days 1, 15, 29, and 45, then subcutaneously monthly for
      4 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 63 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months.
