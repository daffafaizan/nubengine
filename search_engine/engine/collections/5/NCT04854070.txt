      placing the stent. In this study 2 currently utilized methods of visualizing coronary
      arteries during PCI are compared: intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and angiographic guided PCI
      for patients with complex coronary lesions.The use of IVUS during PCI is suggested to give
      better results than angiographic guided PCI.

      The IVUS-CHIP trial is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, international, post-marketing
      study. A total of 2020 patients, in 7 European countries and approximately 40 hospitals, will
      be included, randomized in a 1:1 fashion to IVUS-guided PCI versus angio-guided PCI, and
      followed up for at least 2 years.

      The IVUS-CHIP is an event-driven study; primary analysis of the data will take place after
      169 patients have experienced an event.
