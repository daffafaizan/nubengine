      disorder is characterized by marked or intense fear of social or performance-based situations
      where scrutiny or evaluation by others may occur. Feared situations often include speaking in
      public, meeting new people, and talking with authority figures.

      There are several reasons to expect that stuttering may be associated with social anxiety
      disorder. To begin with, stuttering is accompanied by numerous negative consequences across
      the lifespan which may increase vulnerability to social and psychological difficulties. These
      consequences are intensified during the school years when children become more involved in
      social and speaking situations. As a result, children and adolescents who stutter frequently
      experience peer victimization, social isolation and rejection, and they may also be less
      popular than their non-stuttering peers.
