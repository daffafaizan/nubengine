      recurrence were randomly divided into three groups:

      Group A: Endostar combined chemotherapy AI Endostar: Endostar 45mg/d, D1-5 iv, Q3W, that is,
      continuous intravenous pump injection for 120 hours for 5 consecutive days, one cycle.
      Endostar takes 15 medicines per cycle, and a Baxter pump per single cycle. Subjects buy and
      use them at their own expense every two cycles.

      AI: Doxorubicin (ADM) 60mg/m2 iv D1+ Ifosfamide (IFO) 2g/m2/d D1-5+ Mesna 400mg/m 2
      (ifosfamide start infusion, time after infusion 4 hours, 8 hours injection) D1-5, Q3W.

      Group B:Chemotherapy AI AI: Doxorubicin (ADM) 60mg/m2 iv D1+ Ifosfamide (IFO) 2g/m2/d D1-5+
      Mesna 400mg/m 2 (ifosfamide start infusion, time after infusion 4 hours, 8 hours injection)
      D1-5, Q3W.

      Group C: Observation group Best supportive treatment, observation and follow-up. The dose of
      Endostar is not adjusted, and the specific adjustment plan of the chemotherapy regimen is
      adjusted according to the clinical experience of the investigator.

      Patients with no disease progression (local tumor recurrence, distant metastasis, or the
      appearance of new lesions of the same tumor subtype) and the adverse reactions can be
      tolerated, continue to use the drug for 6 cycles, and cannot receive other anti-tumor
      treatments. During the medication, if the disease progresses or the researcher believes that
      the patient is not suitable for continuing medication, the medication will end.
