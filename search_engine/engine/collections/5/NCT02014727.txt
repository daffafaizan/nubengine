    
      The project aims are :

      -To evaluate the safety of 50 µg AMA1-DiCo malaria vaccine candidate with GLA-SE and
      Alhydrogel® as adjuvant, in healthy European adults not previously exposed to the parasite
      Plasmodium falciparum and in healthy African adults exposed to the parasite.

      T-o assess the humoral immune response to the vaccine antigens by measuring the level of IgG
      in all volunteers.

      To assess the cellular immune response by measuring the T cell cytokines IL-5 and IFNγ
      production following in vitro stimulation with the vaccine antigens in all volunteers.

      Design :

      This trial is a staggered Phase Ia/Ib, Randomised, Double-blind, Multi-center Centre trial.

      Two different adjuvants will be assessed, Alhydrogel® and GLA-SE. One dosage of 50 µg/3
      injections of AMA1-DiCo will be evaluated for each adjuvant.

      Sixty six (66) healthy volunteers will be included into the 2 following cohorts (A and B):

      Cohort A: 30 Non-exposed European Volunteers (France) Cohort B: 36 Malaria Exposed African
      Volunteers (Burkina Faso)

      The non-exposed European volunteers (cohort A) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio into two
      groups of 15 volunteers per group.

      The malaria exposed African volunteers (cohort B) will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio, into two
      groups of 18 volunteers per group.

      European Volunteers: Cohort A (30):

      Group A1 (15): 50µg AMA1-DiCo + Alhydrogel® Group A2 (15): 50 µg AMA1-DiCo+ GLA-SE

      African Volunteers Cohort B (36) :

      Group B1 (18): 50 µg AMA1-DiCo + GLA-SE Group B2 (18): Placebo (isotonic saline solution)

      In order to start recruitment in cohort B (Africa), the safety will be evaluated on the data
      of all European volunteers until Day 7 after 1st immunisation of the last European volunteer
      Data will be presented to an Independent Data safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) that will be
      appointed for this trial
