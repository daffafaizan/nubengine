        -  Compare the efficacy of chemoresection with 4 weekly intravesical instillations of
           mitomycin vs transurethral resection followed by 1 instillation of mitomycin in patients
           with low-risk superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.

        -  Compare the disease-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Determine the response rate at 6 weeks in patients treated with chemoresection.

        -  Determine the percent of patients with tumor at 6 weeks treated with transurethral
           resection.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the side effects of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease status (primary vs recurrent) and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo chemoresection with intravesical instillation of mitomycin once
           weekly for 4 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo transurethral resection followed within 1-6 hours by
           intravesical instillation of mitomycin.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at week 1 (arm II only), at week 5 (arm I only), and
      then at week 6.

      Patients are followed at weeks 6 and 19, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 2
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients (500 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5 years.
