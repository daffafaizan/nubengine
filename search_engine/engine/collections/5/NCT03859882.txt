      countermeasure to maintain the performance of sleep deprived subjects. However, the
      effectiveness of caffeine is characterized by a large individual variability, also observed
      on side effects. This variability could notably be related to polymorphisms of the adenosine
      receptor 2a gene (ADORA2A) and Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha, a pro-inflammatory cytokine whose
      increase is observed during sleep deprivation.

      This study, under conditions of total sleep deprivation in the laboratory (40 hours of
      continuous awakening), examine the cross-influence of two polymorphisms (ADORA2A: rs5751876
      and TNF-alpha: rs1800629) on the sensitivity to caffeine and on the degradation of
      attentional performances. Physical performance, mental performance, immuno-inflammatory
      responses and the occurrence indesirable effects will be evaluate.

      This work aims to understand the mechanisms that contribute to increasing individual
      vulnerability and promoting protective countermeasures. The purpose of this project is to
      improve the recommendations concerning the daily use of caffeine and during periods of
      prolonged awakening, particularly in the military environment.
