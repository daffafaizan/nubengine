      characterised by a rash and severe itching, which is an allergic reaction to the eggs and
      feces the females deposit as they tunnel under the skin. Oral ivermectin is a very safe and
      beneficial drug which has been shown to be highly effective for the treatment of scabies and
      more than a dozen different neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), many of which are associated
      with important public health problems. Current label indications for ivermectin prevent use
      in small children weighing less than 15 kg, due to limited safety data in this group. Many of
      the NTD treatment options for small children rely on compounds that are less safe and/or
      efficacious compared to oral ivermectin. Our proposal will establish the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of escalating doses of ivermectin (200, 400, 800 Âµg/kg) to treat scabies
      infected children weighing 5 to less than 15 kg. The safety assessment will provide crucial
      evidence on the use of ivermectin for numerous diseases in children weighing 5 to less than
      15 kg. The information from measuring drug concentrations in the patients will inform the
      optimal dosing of this drug in small children. Assessment of the efficacy of ivermectin,
      compared to permethrin cream, for the treatment of scabies in small children can provide an
      important alternative treatment for this widespread disease.
