    
      This study is an open-label Phase 1/ 2 evaluation of CB-839 in combination with nivolumab in
      patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and non-small cell lung cancer.

      During Phase 1, patients will be enrolled into escalating dose cohorts to determine the
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      In Phase 2, patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma, melanoma, and non-small cell lung
      cancer will be enrolled into separate cohorts.

      All patients will be assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics, biomarkers and tumor response.
