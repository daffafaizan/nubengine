central regulation of enzyme activity and synthesisin embryonal and adult mammalian tissuesactivity of non-specific hexokinase (hk) in soluble fraction and,particularly, in mitochondria of embryonal liver is much higher thanin the adult rabbit; it decreases in the prenatal period, graduallyapproaching adulthood values postnatally (fig.1).  embryonal liverlacks specific glucokinase (gk) (1,2), although during the second halfof embryonic development there occurs incretion of insulin, knownto induce gk synthesis in the liver of alloxan diabetic animals (3,4).activity of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (g6p dh) insoluble liver fraction is subject to quite similar changes duringembryonic development.
