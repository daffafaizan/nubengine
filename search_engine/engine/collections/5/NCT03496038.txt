    
      This is a randomized controlled clinical trial with parallel group design. A total of 40
      patients, needing transcrestal sinus lift (T), will be enrolled.

      Under local anesthesia, the required T and implant placement will be performed and ISQ values
      will be recorded. Afterwards a CBCT will be taken for control. Randomization will be
      performed by computer generated random codes, using random permuted blocks with a block size
      of 4 to avoid uneven splits and minimization for the key prognostic factors RBH. Allocation
      will be concealed to the surgeons at completion of the common part of treatment, by opening
      an opaque envelope. At the same time an oral implant(s) will be inserted in the augmented
      area.

      After 6 months a CBCT will be taken for control of the bone healing and the measurements of
      the newly formed bone. The abutment will be placed on top of the osseo-integrated implant(s)
      under local anesthesia. ISQ values will be recorded. Follow-up will be till 1 year.
