      consent and teaching prior to their planned surgery for endometrial cancer or standard
      consent and multimedia video aid with targeted teaching. This video will be an adjunct to the
      standard consent process and supplement the pre and post-operative teaching that is currently
      not formalized. The primary outcome is patient satisfaction. The secondary outcomes include
      patient understanding and physician satisfaction. The investigators hypothesize that patients
      will be more satisfied when their consent for surgery is done in conjunction with this
      multimedia aid.
