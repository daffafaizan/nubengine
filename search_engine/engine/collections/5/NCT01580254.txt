    
      Prospective, randomized, single blinded study of the duration of 3 months, involving subjects
      affected by POAG or OH under therapy with different Latanoprost drugs (Galaxia, Iopize or
      Latanoprost Rathiopharm).

      A total of 120 patients affected by POAG or OH newly diagnosed or already under topical
      therapy. will be recruited.

      After a recruitment visit to assest eligibility of each subject, a "run-in" therapy composed
      of timolol 0,5% 2 drops per day will be prescribed for 4 weeks.

      Then a baseline visit will be performed to evaluate IOP values and adverse effects in each
      subject. All subjects elegible for a therapy with a single dose of Latanoprost will be
      randomized into 3 arms.

      After 4 weeks of therapy a second visit will be made to assest IOP changes and safety.
      Therapy will be continued for another 4 weeks, and after that, a final visit will be made.
