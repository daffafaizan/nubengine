    
      The investigators are proposing to initiate a study assessing a common desensitization
      protocol for peanut/tree nut allergy. This study would enable the investigators to better
      determine the potential benefit of desensitization in individuals with peanut/tree nut
      allergy.

      More specifically, the investigators will address the following research objectives:

      Objectives A. To develop a protocols for peanut/tree nut desensitization with high (300mg)
      and low (30mg maintenance dose).

      B. To determine the rate of desensitization to peanut/tree nut. C. To characterize predictors
      of successful desensitization. D. To characterize molecular mechanisms involved in the
      process of desensitization

      These objectives will be evaluated through a randomized controlled trial
