      profound analgesia than topical anesthesia during facial cosmetic filler injections. The
      study is a single group study design. The attending surgeon or residents will perform the
      procedure. Each procedure will start with a randomized coin flip to determine which side of
      the face will be anesthetized with local anesthesia or topical anesthesia. The head side of
      the coin will coincide with local anesthesia on the patient's right side. The tail of the
      coin will designate the patient's left side for local anesthetic injections.

      To evaluate whether the additional anesthesia of a nerve block brings more pain relief than
      the initial pain of receiving a nerve block, the pain value will be collected from each nerve
      block administered. Procedural injection pain data will be collected from the nerve blocked
      facial half and from the topical anesthetic facial half to provide a comparison of anesthesia
      during the procedure. The primary outcome will be the collection of "overall" pain data from
      each side of the face 5-10 minutes after the procedure. Facial anesthesia preference data
      will also be collected at one week post treatment to determine overall pain perceptions from
      each method of facial anesthesia.
