      treat solid tumors. Patients with malignant pulmonary nodules will undergo a series of CT-
      guided percutaneous RFA procedures. During the procedures，percutaneous needles will be
      inserted into the target tissues under CT guidance，the needles deliver thermal energy and
      then destroy the tumors by causing coagulation necrosis via tissue heating. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of RFA in pulmonary nodules （maximum
      tumor diameter ≦30 mm） was 10 mm apart from the big trachea, primary bronchi, esophagus,
      great vessels，heart and pleura. Preoperative and postoperative evaluations，including recent
      laboratory tests evaluated and imaging studies reviewed，will be performed both before and
      after the procedures.
