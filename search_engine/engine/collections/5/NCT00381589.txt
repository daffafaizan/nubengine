      medications in treating schizophrenia, clozapine continues to remain the gold standard for
      treatment-refractory schizophrenia. However, treatment with clozapine continues to be limited
      by its many side effects. The second most common side effect, occurring in 31% of clozapine
      treated patients, is hypersalivation or sialorrhea. Sialorrhea can be profoundly stigmatizing
      and functionally disabling in certain patients, and may increase discontinuation rates in
      this high-risk patient population. Several studies have evaluated the efficacy of
      anticholinergic agents mainly in small, uncontrolled studies or anecdotal reports and are
      often complicated by difficulties in medication administration and systemic side effects.
      Open label and case series studies have demonstrated promising results with ipratropium
      bromide (IPB) treatment of clozapine-induced hypersalivation, acting on anticholinergic
      receptors with minimal systemic absorption. However, no randomized controlled trials have
      evaluated IPB in the treatment of this problematic side effect.The primary goals of this
      study is to determine the efficacy of ipratropium bromide in reducing clozapine-induced
      hypersalivation, as per the Toronto Nocturnal Hypersalivation Scale, which is a modified
      hypersalivation scale incorporating the Drooling Severity Scale and the Nocturnal
      Hypersalivation Rating Scale, and reduced measurements on visual analogue scales for
      hypersalivation distress and severity. Our hypothesis that Ipratropium bromide use at bedtime
      will result in a significant reduction in nocturnal clozapine-induced hypersalivation as
      measured by the Toronto Nocturnal Hypersalivation Scale (TNHS) through its local
      anticholinergic activity.
