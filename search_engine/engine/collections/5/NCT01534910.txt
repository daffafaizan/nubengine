      arteries. The investigators will enroll patients in a double blind study, where half the
      patients will receive placebo, and have the patients undergo a series of tests of plaque (CT
      scan of the heart, carotid ultrasound) and follow the patients on the drug or placebo and
      then repeat the tests and blood work at the end of one year. The investigators will assess if
      being on aged garlic extract adds any benefit to plaque in the coronary or neck arteries. The
      investigators will also assess the effect of aged garlic extract on markers of inflammation.
      Patients will receive free drug, free testing and be compensated, and learn more about their
      heart and neck arteries. if successful, more patients can use this drug to benefit their
      health. The harms include the radiation from the CT scan and the medication, which has mild
      side effects. The study will perform advanced CT angiography at baseline and follow up along
      with carotid intimal media thickness testing, to see if plaque is slowed down by Aged Garlic
      Extract
