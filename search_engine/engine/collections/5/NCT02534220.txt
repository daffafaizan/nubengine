      To the investigators' knowledge, a clinical evaluation of the safety of these toothbrushes
      after surgical root coverage procedure have not been published. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate the gingival margin stability with the use of oscillating-rotating toothbrushes
      compared to manual toothbrushes.

      METHODS Sixty healthy patients with at least a single Miller Class I or II gingival recession
      underwent surgical root coverage procedure. Soft-bristle manual and powered toothbrushes were
      given to participants randomly assigned to control and test group, respectively. Full-mouth
      plaque score, Full-mouth Bleeding Score, Probing Pocket Depth and Recession Depth were
      recorded 1, 3 and 6 months after completion of surgical procedure. Longitudinal analyses were
      performed using linear random-intercept models to take into account within-subject
      correlations over time. Temporal trend differences across treatments by including
      treatment-time interaction terms were then tested using a global Wald test.
