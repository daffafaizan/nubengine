      Primary

        -  Evaluate the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome
           (PLD) when administered with lapatinib, particularly in terms of cardiac safety, in
           patients with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the optimally tolerated regimen (OTR) of PLD when administered with lapatinib
           in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profiles of lapatinib and PLD when given in combination at
           the OTR.

        -  Describe any preliminary evidence of efficacy of lapatinib and PLD in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of pegylated doxorubicin HCl liposome
      (PLD).

      Patients receive oral lapatinib once daily on days 1-28 and PLD IV over at least 30 minutes
      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Lapatinib may be continued alone in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of PLD until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completing study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study.
