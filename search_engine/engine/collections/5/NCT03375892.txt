      breast cancer that minimizes exposure to the heart, as noted by mean heart dose. Both prone
      (lying face down) radiation and DIBH (Deep Inspiration Breath Hold) are more labor-intensive
      and usually require longer treatment times for patients than traditional supine (lying face
      up) free-breathing radiation treatments. Thus, identifying people that benefit most from
      these techniques can better utilize resources. This study compares supine and prone
      positioning, with or without DIBH, to further assess which positioning technique will achieve
      the lowest cardiac radiation doses.

      A pilot portion of this trial will determine the presence or absence of echo abnormalities
      and EKG findings predictive of Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction in breast
      cancer patients prior to, soon after, and in follow-up after radiation therapy for breast
      cancer. Ejection fractions are expected to be normal in study patients but there may be
      evidence of risk markers after radiation.

      This study will measure mitochondrial function in leukocytes (peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells) from patients prior to and after undergoing radiation therapy, and a gradual decline
      in mitochondrial energy biomarkers over time after radiation therapy is expected.
