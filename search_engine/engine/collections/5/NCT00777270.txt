      second-grade tearing of the perineum. One group was repaired with continuous non-locking
      suture in the vagina, perineum and subcutaneous tissue. The other group used continuous
      locking suture of the vagina, interrupted sutures in the perineum muscle and interrupted
      transcutaneous suture. The threads used for stitching were identical in both groups. The same
      questions were asked concerning the sensation of pain and the use of painkillers, the second
      and the tenth day and at the three months.
