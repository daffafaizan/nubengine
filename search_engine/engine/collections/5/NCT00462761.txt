      open-label, dose escalation study was designed to characterize the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of orally administered AC220 as a single
      agent given daily for 14 days. Cohorts of 3 patients received AC220 until dose limiting
      toxicity was noted (DLT). At that point cohorts expanded to 6 patients until MTD was
      determined. Patients not experiencing DLT or significant disease progression at Day 15 may
      have continued receiving AC220 at the discretion of the Investigator and Sponsor. FLT3
      positive and negative patients were allowed to participate.
