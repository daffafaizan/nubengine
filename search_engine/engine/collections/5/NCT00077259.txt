    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of epothilone D as second-line treatment, in terms of
           objective response rate, in patients with advanced or metastatic refractory colorectal
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the response duration in patients responding to treatment with this drug.

        -  Determine time to tumor progression and overall survival in patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Correlate efficacy and safety with plasma concentrations of this drug and its major
           metabolites in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive epothilone D IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-69 patients will be accrued for this study.
