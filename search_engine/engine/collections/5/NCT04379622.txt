    
      In the study investigators will voluntarily enroll health and active 200-400 participants
      within inclusion/exclusion criteria that are willing to participate in the study.
      Investigators anticipate that for this number of adults (aged 18-80 years) will require
      approx. 10-20.000 invited candidates, of both sexes.

      The methods to be used are standardized food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) that is sensible
      for different dietary patterns (to analyzed the daily dietary intake, for conventional
      component the investigators will use Dietplan7 Pro dietary assessment software (Forestield
      Software Limited, Horsham, UK), while for dietary supplements the investigators will use Res
      Pons d.o.o. servises, company that professionally manages a database with all dietary
      supplements and medicine products available on the Slovenian market.

      BC status the investigators will use self-reported data from bioimpedance body composition
      monitor (Tanita, Tokyo, Japan), for basic anthropometric status the investigators will use
      medically approved body weight scale and body gauge (in the medical centers; body height,
      body weight, and BMI), and for lifestyle status the investigators will use three standardized
      questionnaires for: (1) habitual and organized physical activity, and the frequency of
      sitting (IPAQ-long), (2) quality of sleep (PSQI), and (3) socio-demographic, economic status
      adopted by Slovenian NIH.

      Additionally, with added questionnaire the investigators will assessed the motives for VEG
      and non VEG dietary pattern. Investigators will record the participants maximum (lifetime)
      body weight (and therefore maximum BMI), and used self-reported CVD biochemistry results,
      measured in a standard and comparable method (plasma lipids, BP) in national medical centers.
