      persistent pattern of motor and vocal tics. Tics are intermittent movements or sounds that
      occur repeatedly. They can be either brief, rapid, and darting movements or more purposeful
      movements, such as repetitively locking and unlocking a door. Vocal tics can be simple, as in
      sniffing or grunting, or more complex, such as complete words or phrases. Tic disorders can
      cause considerable distress in affected children, and can lead to social and academic
      impairment. If left untreated, CTDs can last into adulthood. The standard treatment for
      suppressing CTDs is medication; dopamine-blocking drugs are used most commonly. These
      medications, however, are associated with a range of adverse effects that can result in poor
      treatment compliance and premature treatment termination. Recent research suggests that HRT
      may be an effective, lower risk treatment for CTDs. HRT is a behavioral treatment based on
      increasing awareness of one's behaviors and replacing unwanted behaviors with less bothersome
      ones. This study will determine the effectiveness of CBT with HRT in treating CTDs in
      children and adolescents.

      Participants in this double blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either CBT plus
      HRT or standard care, which will consist of psychoeducation and supportive therapy. All
      participants will partake in 8 sessions of their assigned therapy over the course of 10
      weeks. After the initial 10 weeks, those who responded to treatment will report back to the
      study site for 3 monthly booster sessions. Changes in tic severity, effects of the therapies
      on overall functioning and quality of life, and possible predictors of treatment outcome will
      be assessed.
