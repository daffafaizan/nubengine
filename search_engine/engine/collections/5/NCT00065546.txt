      functions of cell membranes, cholinergic neurotransmission, and lipid transport/metabolism.
      Choline is obtained from the diet and from endogenous biosynthesis catalyzed by the enzyme
      phosphatidylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PEMT). The major premise for this proposal is
      that humans require a dietary source of choline and that this requirement has significant
      individual variation and is modulated by estrogen and common genetic polymorphisms. The
      promoter of the PEMT gene is estrogen responsive, and we hypothesize that estrogen status
      influences the dietary requirement for choline. We identified other common single nucleotide
      polymorphisms (SNPs) that increase or decrease the likelihood that a human will develop organ
      dysfunction when fed a low choline diet. Experiments are proposed that will refine our
      understanding of estrogen-mediated induction of the PEMT promoter; determine whether
      postmenopausal women treated with estrogen have a decreased susceptibility to developing
      organ dysfunction associated with choline deficiency; determine the prevalence of SNPs that
      increase susceptibility to choline deficiency in the population and examine dietary choline
      requirements in humans with these SNPs.
