      simulate usual circumstances to inform their everyday clinical decisions on the utility of
      negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). A prospective randomized open label blind endpoint
      (PROBE) trial design was chosen. All patients scheduled to undergo elective colorectal
      resections (CRR) at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) will be identified at the time of a
      pre-operative clinic visit with one of the 13 surgeons performing CRR at their institution.
      Included patients will be randomized to receive either usual care or usual care plus NPWT.
      All patients will be followed for 30 post-operative days to identify the development of an
      SSI and other secondary outcomes. Given the nature of the intervention, the surgeon and
      patients cannot be blinded to the intervention. Outcome assessors and statisticians will be
      blinded to the patient's allocated group.
