    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the maternal and infant safety of the dapivirine
      (DPV) vaginal ring (VR) and daily oral Truvada in HIV-uninfected pregnant women and their
      infants.

      Participants will be assigned to one of four cohorts based on gestational age:

        -  Cohort 1: 36 0/7 weeks - 37 6/7 weeks

        -  Cohort 2: 30 0/7 weeks - 35 6/7 weeks

        -  Cohort 3: 20 0/7 weeks - 29 6/7 weeks

        -  Cohort 4: 12 0/7 weeks - 19 6/7 weeks

      Within each cohort, participants will be randomized to receive either DPV VR or oral Truvada.
      Participants randomized to the DPV VR will use the VR continuously for approximately one
      month, replacing the VR each month. Participants taking the Truvada tablet will take one
      tablet orally per day. Participants will use their assigned study product until their
      pregnancy outcome, but no later than 41 6/7 weeks of gestation.

      Participants will attend several study visits throughout the study and study staff will also
      contact participants by phone at different timepoints throughout the study.

      The total duration of study participation will vary depending on gestational age at time of
      enrollment and length of pregnancy prior to pregnancy outcome, and will range from
      approximately 12 weeks or less for Cohort 1 to approximately 36 weeks or less for Cohort 4.
      Infants born to study participants will be followed for approximately 52 weeks.
