      I. Determine the minimum effective dose of suramin that will reduce resistance to
      chemotherapy with paclitaxel and carboplatin in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell
      lung cancer (phase I). (Phase I closed to accrual 1/29/02).

      II. Evaluate pharmacokinetic interactions of this drug combination in these patients (phase
      I). (Phase I closed to accrual 1/29/02).

      III. Determine the objective response rate in patients treated with this regimen (phase II
      [chemotherapy-naive patients closed to accrual 9/1/03]).

      IV. Determine the time to tumor progression, progression-free rate at 6 months, and 1-year
      survival of patients treated with this regimen (phase II [chemotherapy-naive patients closed
      to accrual 9/1/03]).

      OUTLINE: Patients in phase II are stratified according to prior treatment (chemotherapy naive
      [closed to accrual 9/1/03] vs chemotherapy refractory). Phase I (phase I closed to accrual
      1/29/02):

      Patients receive suramin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2. Patients also receive paclitaxel
      IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of suramin until the target dose is
      determined. The target dose is defined as the dose at which at least 5 of 6 patients achieve
      optimal plasma concentrations of suramin and no more than 1 of 6 patients exceed optimal
      level. Doses of paclitaxel are adjusted until the maximum tolerated dose in combination with
      suramin and paclitaxel is determined.

      Phase II (chemotherapy-naive patients closed to accrual 9/1/03): Patients receive the target
      dose of suramin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 2. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over
      3 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3-6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 82 patients (18 for phase I [phase I closed to accrual
      1/29/02] and 64 for phase II [chemotherapy-naive patients closed to accrual 9/1/03]) will be
      accrued for this study.
