3831. lysosomes in the rat sciatic nerve following crushperipheral nerves undergoing degenerationare favorable material for studying thetypes, origins, and functions of lysosomes.the following lysosomes are described(a) autophagic vacuoles in altered schwanncells.  within these vacuoles the myelinand much of the axoplasm which it enclosesin the normal nerve are degraded (wal-lerian degeneration).  the delimitingmembranes of the vacuoles apparently formfrom myelin lamellae.  considered aspossible sources of their acid phosphatase aregolgi vesicles (primary lysosomes), lysosomesof the dense body type, and the endo-plasmic reticulum which lies close to the vacuoles.(b) mebranous bodies that accu-mulate focally in myelinated fibers in a zone extending2 to 3 mm distal to the crush.these appear to arise from the endoplasmic reticulumin which demonstrable acidphosphatase activity increases markedly within 2 hoursafter the nerve is crushed.(c) autophagic vacuoles in the axoplasm of fibersproximal to the crush.  the break-down of organelles within these vacuoles may havesignificance for the reorganizationof the axoplasm preparatory to regeneration.(d) phagocytic vacuoles of alteredschwann cells.  as myelin degeneration begins, someaxoplasm is exposed.  thisis apparently engulfed by the filopodia of the schwanncells, and degraded within thephagocytic vacuoles thus formed.  (e) multivesicularbodies in the axoplasm of myelina-ted fibers.  these are generally seen near the nodes of ranvier.
