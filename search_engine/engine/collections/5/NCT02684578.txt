    
      This is a phase II, single-blind, randomized, evaluation of the safety and efficacy of
      metformin use to decrease geographic atrophy (GA) progression in non-diabetic patients with
      dry Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD). Approximately 186 study subjects throughout four
      separate study sites will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the treatment group and the
      observation group. The treatment group will be assigned to the study intervention (oral
      Metformin) for 18 months while the observation group will receive no intervention for 18
      months, instead continuing with standard of care ophthalmic exams and close monitoring of
      their disease. There will be one additional follow up visit at 24 months. Throughout the 24
      month study period, the progression of subjects' GA or drusen growth will be measured via
      ocular imaging taken at standard of care follow-up examinations, including fundus
      autofluorescence imaging, optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fundus photography.
