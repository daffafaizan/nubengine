    
      In patients with liver parenchymal disease or normal liver parenchyma who are scheduled to
      undergo either liver resection or liver biopsy are included.

      Referred patients undergo multiparametric MRI including perfusion, diffusion, elastography
      and fat quantification before surgery or biopsy.

      The pathophysiologic changes are evaluated using multiparametric MRI, and compared between
      normal/early fibrosis and advanced fibrosis.
