      hernia repair with the 3D prosthesis named ProFlor. Scope of the study was to determine the
      presence, quantity and quality of the neural ingrowth within the implant fabric. Histology
      revealed the presence of multiple nerve clusters that, starting from the early stage
      post-implantation, increased in number and degree of maturation. In the long term, neural
      elements assumed the typical aspect of normal nervous structures complete in all components.
      The development of highly specialized tissue such as nerves, together with other components
      of the abdominal wall already described in literature, seems to finalize a regenerative
      response. This kind of behavior, being the expected result from a device intended for the
      cure of inguinal hernia and its degenerative source, seems to be coherent with the
      pathogenesis of the disease.
