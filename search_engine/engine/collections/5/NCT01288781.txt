      the reason why some individuals suffer from High Altitude Headache and others do not remains
      unknown. It is widely believed that elevated pressure within the brain leads to stretching of
      pain sensitive fibres and thus headache. However, evidence of raised intracranial pressure
      during High Altitude Headache is currently unavailable. Therefore, this study aims to examine
      a proxy measure of intracranial pressure (Optic Nerve Sheath Diameter) in persons visiting
      High Altitude, half of whom have been given the drug acetazolamide that is known to reduce
      headache symptoms.
