      intended to provide ventricular support with adjustable inflatable chambers to reduce annular
      dilation, correct papillary muscle displacement, and restore mitral valve leaflet coaptation.
      In doing so, Mardil Medical is interested in exploring the anatomical and geometric annular
      and ventricular changes that occur when strategically positioned external inflatable chambers
      are applied to the outside of the heart. Favorable benefits of circumferential reduction in
      ventricular wall stress favoring left ventricular (LV) remodeling and acute reshaping of LV
      segments subtending the deformed mitral valve apparatus needs to be better understood. Mardil
      Medical is pursuing this study as an initial phase in the Acute Evaluation of Anatomical and
      Geometric Changes using the Bladder on a Stick System (BOSS).
