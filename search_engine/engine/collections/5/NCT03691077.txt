    
      The first dose of ocrelizumab will be administered as two 300-mg IV infusions (600 mg total)
      in 250 mL 0.9% sodium chloride each separated by 14 days (i.e., Days 1 and 15), followed by
      one 600-mg IV infusion in 500 mL 0.9% sodium chloride every subsequent doses (i.e., every 24
      weeks) for 72 weeks.

      Premedication with 100 mg of methylprednisolone (or an equivalent) approximately 30 minutes
      prior to each ocrelizumab infusion and additional premedication with an antihistaminic drug
      (e.g., diphenhydramine) approximately 30 - 60 minutes before each infusion of ocrelizumab to
      reduce the frequency and severity of infusion-related reactions (IRRs). The addition of an
      antipyretic (e.g., acetaminophen/ paracetamol) may also be considered.

      Patients will undergo PET scan with 18F-DPA714 and MRI exams at different time points as
      mentioned in the assessment table.

      Disease will be clinically monitored at different time points with classical tests including
      EDSS, MSFC, BICAMS.

      Laboratory analyses on complete blood count, lymphocytes subsets count, neurofilament will be
      done. Analyses will not be limited to the above mentioned list.

      Pregnancy tests and genetics will be done. An optional lumbar puncture will be performed at
      baseline to assess cytokinic profile predictive of disease evolution and cortical pathology.
      Patients who refuse to have a lumbar puncture can be included in the clinical trial if they
      have eligibility criteria.

      TSPO polymorphism will be checked at baseline with other screening lab tests.
