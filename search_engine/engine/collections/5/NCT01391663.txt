    
      Alogliptin is a selective, orally available inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 being
      developed by Takeda Global Research & Development Center, Inc. as a treatment for type 2
      diabetes mellitus. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) prolongs the action of 2
      important incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent
      insulinotropic peptide (GIP). These hormones are responsible for increasing insulin
      synthesis, regulating Î²-cell proliferation, inhibiting gastric emptying and inhibiting
      glucagon secretion.

      Evaluations of alogliptin and its clinical efficacy have been conducted in multiple countries
      including the United States and Japan. As development of alogliptin expands to other
      countries, additional studies are needed to bridge between the data previously acquired.

      The main objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of
      alogliptin in healthy Korean participants.
