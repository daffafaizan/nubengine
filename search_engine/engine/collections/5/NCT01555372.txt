      clavicular fractures (Neer 2b). The recognized treatment alternatives are Hook plate.Notably,
      criticisms on this fixation method also appeared and the potential risks of hook migration,
      loosening, subacromial impingement or rotator cuff injury, and acromial osteolysis were still
      unsolved. Recently, Herrmann et al.and Largo et al.stabilized the distal clavicle with
      Locking plate (LP) and these studies offered encouraging support for LP. Because of small
      sample size (27 patients) and nonrandomization, the convictive power of these researches is
      not strong enough.
