      Accordingly, we believe that in a parallel-group design (1% or 10% gradient) established in
      controlled and randomized way we could answer the hypothesis that muscle overload provide
      superior gains to VO2max and aerobic performance. Moreover, considering the first hyphotesis,
      such developments on the running at 10% slope also promote significant gains in climb
      performance and also in the plan. Unlike the speculate that the gains from the 1% training
      does not help performance a 10% incline.
