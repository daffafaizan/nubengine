the pathogenesis of viral influenzal pneumonia in mice .the pathogenesis of influenzal pneumonia in mice was studied byelectron microscopy . mice were inoculated with 1.5 ld of pr8 influenzavirus and killed at varying intervals after inoculation . observationsby light microscopy were correlated with those by electron microscopy inorder to evaluate the lesions produced .at the periphery, the earliest lesions were focal areas of edema ofalveolar lining cells, the capillary endothelium and the interposedbasement membrane . this caused an appreciable thickening of theblood-air pathway . hypertrophy, degeneration and desquamation of thealveolar lining and proliferation of alveolar macrophages resulted incomplete consolidation, which was progressive up to 1 week afterinfection .the central areas of the lung were affected somewhat differently . at3 days after infection, the nonciliated bronchiolar cells showedconsiderable hyperplasia of endoplasmic reticulum and apical cytoplasmicedema . viral particles matured at the lumen surface of these cells andwere then released into the bronchiolar lumen . the bronchiolar cells,both ciliated and nonciliated, underwent degeneration and sloughed intothe bronchiolar lumen . the regenerating epithelium was stratified, andthe surface cells were elongated and flattened . the peribronchiolarinterstitial tissue gradually became totally infiltrated by cells,mostly of the mononuclear type .
