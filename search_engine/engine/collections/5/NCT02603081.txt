    
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled safety, pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic study
      of oral SPI-1005 in adults with Meniere's disease. All subjects will undergo baseline
      audiometric testing and have their severity of sensorineural hearing loss, tinnitus and
      vertigo determined before the start of a 21-day course of treatment with SPI-1005 or placebo.
      During treatment with SPI-1005, and 7 days and 28 days following the cessation of SPI-1005,
      subjects will have their hearing loss, tinnitus and vertigo assessed. Additional testing
      including electrocochleography will be performed at baseline, at the end of SPI-1005
      treatment, and 28 days after the SPI-1005 treatment has stopped. Six outpatient visits will
      be performed over a 7-week period.
