    
      Study Objectives: To study the toxicity, safety and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH)
      responses of DNP-modified autologous tumor cell vaccine (L-Vax) in patients with resectable
      NSCLC:

        -  To determine the tolerability and toxicity of L-Vax

        -  To determine whether L-Vax induces a DTH response to autologous, DNP-modified NSCLC
           cells of similar magnitude to responses observed with melanoma

        -  Determine whether L-Vax induces a DTH response to autologous unmodified NSCLC cells

        -  To determine whether the DTH responses to autologous, unmodified NSCLC cells that have
           been fixed with ethanol correlate with DTH responses to autologous, unmodified NSCLC
           cells that are not fixed

      Study Population: Patients with resectable NSCLC whose therapeutic tumor surgery provides a
      mass, which yields adequate tumor, cells for vaccine preparation and DTH testing

      Study Design: A Phase I/IIa double-blind, three-dose, single center study

      Investigational Product: L-Vax: DNP-modified autologous NSCLC cell vaccine

      Dosage Form: Cell suspension

      Route of Administration: Intradermal

      Dosage and Treatment Schedule: Prior to vaccine administration, patients will be tested for
      DTH to autologous NSCLC cells that have been: DNP-modified, or unmodified and irradiated, or
      unmodified and irradiated and fixed with ethanol (if sufficient cells available) Three doses
      of vaccine will be tested: 5 x 105, 2.5 x 106, or 5 x 106 DNP-modified autologous NSCLC
      cells. An initial dose of DNP-modified autologous NSCLC cells* without Bacillus of Calmette
      and Guérin (BCG) followed by cyclophosphamide (CY) then weekly doses of DNP-modified
      autologous NSCLC tumor cells mixed with BCG for 6 weeks, and completed with one dose of
      DNP-modified autologous NSCLC tumor cells mixed with BCG as a 6-month booster, if adequate
      number of cells available.

        -  count determined prior to aliquoting for cryopreservation

      Endpoints: Treatment-emergent and related adverse events, serious adverse events, and Grade 3
      and 4 laboratory abnormalities for safety assessments

      Other Parameters: · DTH skin reactions for assessing the induction of immune responses to
      DNP-modified and unmodified autologous NSCLC tumor cells· Survival· Exploratory analysis of
      in vitro studies of peripheral blood lymphocytes obtained from study subjects

      Duration of Treatment: Up to 9 months

      Duration of Subject Participation in Study: Three months from the patient's last vaccine

      Duration of Follow-up: Survival information and disease status will be collected via phone or
      visit on a quarterly basis for each patient beginning 30 days after the last scheduled visit
      until the last patient has been followed for three months from his/her last vaccine

      Number of Subjects Required to Meet Protocol Objectives: Up to 42 evaluable subjects

      Number of Study Centers: Three

      Number of Individual Blood Draws: 15 draws over nine months

      Volume of Blood Drawn: 13 Draws of 30 mL/draw (total 360 mL) and two draws of 50mL in
      heparinized tubes
