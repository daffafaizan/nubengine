      I. To determine the proportion of patients with recurrent, metastatic, or primary
      unresectable adrenocortical carcinoma who achieve an objective response to R-(-)-gossypol
      acetic acid.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES::

      I. To evaluate the safety of this drug in these patients. II. To determine the
      progression-free and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid once daily on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
