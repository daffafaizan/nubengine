      the popularity of outpatient total hip and knee arthroplasty in a select group of eligible
      patients. However, one of the main impediments to same-day discharge is the prolonged motor
      block post-spinal anesthesia, as patients are routinely kept in the post-anesthesia care unit
      (PACU) until they demonstrate that the spinal anesthesia has worn off.

      At The Ottawa Hospital, the standard treatment for people receiving anesthesia during a total
      arthroplasty is the use of the anaesthetic, Bupivacaine. Mepivacaine and Ropivacaine are
      alternative anaesthetics that are also in use at The Ottawa Hospital. They are growing in
      popularity as anaesthetics because they and allow quicker recovery time when compared to
      Bupivacaine. Bupivacaine results in a long-lasting sensory-motor block, meaning that in the
      area that the local anesthesia was used, there is no sensation and limited movement for long
      periods of time. During hip or knee replacement surgery, you may want to have no sensation
      and the inability to move your lower limbs. However, it is not ideal for after surgery where
      weakness in the legs puts a person at increased risk for falls. Therefore, hospitalization
      after surgery typically lasts for a longer duration. Mepivacaine and Ropivacaine have a
      shorter motor block duration, allowing for a potentially earlier hospital discharge.
