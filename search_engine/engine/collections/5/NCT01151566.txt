      in any radiology department, used widely in evaluating pathology in any part of the body.

      Historically, it is well known that the use of contrast agents for CT scans may result in
      nephropathy, or renal failure. Nephrotoxicity associated with the injection of CT contrast
      agents may occasionally occur in healthy individuals and more commonly in those with
      borderline renal function. If abnormal kidney function is known to exist in a patient sent
      for CT scan, the examination is performed without the valuable assistance of contrast
      enhancement. Further, if prior hypersensitivity to the contrast agent for CT scan is known,
      again, the scan will be performed without the use of contrast agent.

      Ultrasound (US) performed conventionally in grayscale and with Doppler is able to evaluate
      most abdominal and pelvic organs and also provides vascular information related to large
      vessel blood flow. Contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) provides more precise information on
      blood flow than is available with Doppler and has been shown to be comparable to CT scan in
      some circumstances. We believe that a comparison of conventional US, with CEUS, and
      unenhanced CT scan would clearly favor ultrasound for detection of soft tissue pathology on
      the basis of its inherent tissue contrast differentiation.
