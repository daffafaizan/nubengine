      years. Lactobacillus reuteri (L.reuteri) is a naturally occurring bacterial species in the
      human gut. L. reuteri has been widely studied in clinical trials of adults and children and
      treatment with L. reuteri is safe and is associated with health-promoting effects in humans.
      In animal models, L. reuteri has anti-inflammatory effects and in ovariectomized mice
      supplementation with L. reuteri partly prevented the bone loss induced by estrogen
      deficiency. Furthermore, both bone density and bone formation increased in male mice in
      another mice model. In mice with medically induced diabetes mellitus, L. reuteri reduced
      blood glucose and in a mouse model mimicking the metabolic syndrome, L. reuteri prevented
      diet-induced obesity. The present study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized,
      study in 90 elderly women with osteopenia recruited from the population. These women will be
      treated with L. reuteri or placebo orally twice daily for 12 months. The effects on bone will
      be investigated with dual energy x-ray absorptiometry, high-resolution peripheral
      quantitative computed tomography, and bone turnover markers. Hormones and markers of
      inflammation and metabolism will be followed as well as changes in the gut microbiota
      composition.
