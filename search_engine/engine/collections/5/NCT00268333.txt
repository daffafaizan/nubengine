      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent metastatic colorectal cancer
           treated with neoadjuvant oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium followed by
           radiotherapy and concurrent fluorouracil and oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the overall survival and disease-free survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Determine the primary site of recurrence and time to recurrence in patients treated with
           this regimen.

        -  Determine quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study.

        -  Neoadjuvant chemotherapy: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours and leucovorin
           calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients also receive fluorouracil IV continuously
           over 46 hours beginning day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for 4 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Two to 5 weeks later, patients
           with stable or responding disease proceed to chemoradiotherapy.

        -  Chemoradiotherapy: Patients receive fluorouracil IV continuously 5 days a week for 5
           weeks and oxaliplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29. Patients also undergo
           radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks beginning on day 1.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 week after the completion of neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy, on days 15, 30, and 42 of chemoradiotherapy, and at 1 and 2 months after the
      completion of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.
