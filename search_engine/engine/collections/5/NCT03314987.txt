    
      This is a placebo controlled, randomized, double-blind, interventional trial investigating
      the efficacy of carnosine in reducing the effects of particulate matter air pollution
      (PM2.5). A total of 240 participants from the Louisville metropolitan and neighboring areas
      will be randomized into two dietary supplement study groups - carnosine (n=120) versus
      placebo (n=120). Intervention of study dietary supplements will occur from May through
      September, when the levels of PM2.5.are highest in the Louisville, KY area. Study
      participants will be given a daily oral dose of total of 2 grams of carnosine (or placebo)
      for a total of 12 consecutive weeks (during May through September).

      Urinary levels of carnosine will be used to screen and identify potential candidates with low
      carnosine levels. Those with levels less than the median levels of the population, will be
      invited to participate in the study. The following measurements will be performed - blood and
      urine sample collection, physical examination, arterial stiffness, physical function, and
      self-reported surveys on environmental exposure, sleep, diet, and exercise. Supplement
      intervention (carnosine or placebo) will be initiated at the time of Baseline Assessment and
      will continue for 12 weeks from that date. Two follow up visits will occur at 6 weeks and 12
      weeks respectively after initiating supplementation.

      This innovative clinical investigation will provide an insight into the pre and post
      intervention effects of a cheap, safe, and over-the-counter available dietary supplement in
      countering the effects of air pollution.
