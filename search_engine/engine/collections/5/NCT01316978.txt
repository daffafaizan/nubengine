    
      The study is a single dose, randomized, three-way crossover study in 30 healthy subjects,
      with equal numbers of males and females (minimum of 13 of either gender). Drop-outs will not
      be replaced. The three doses of medication given in the study (a single dose in each of the
      three study periods) will each be separated by a washout period of at least 7 calendar days.
      In each study period, eighteen (18) blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be taken
      over 12 hours. Blood samples will be centrifuged and concentrations of ibuprofen
      (R-enantiomer and S-enantiomer) in plasma will be measured using a validated chromatographic
      assay. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated from plasma concentration data
      [R-enantiomer, S-enantiomer and total (sum of both enantiomers)]. The rate and extent of
      absorption of the formulations will be compared.
