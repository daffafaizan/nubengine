      reduce marijuana use that can be used to develop better behavioral treatments for marijuana
      dependence. The application will focus on adult daily marijuana users who try to stop or
      reduce their marijuana use in a real-world setting. Although prospective, natural history
      studies describing attempts to stop or reduce alcohol, heroin and tobacco use have proved
      useful, we know of no such study among adult marijuana users. Two pilot studies will develop
      measures and assess compliance with our procedures. The main study will recruit up to 400
      adult marijuana smokers with the goal of a sample size of 200 participants with adequate
      compliance. Participants will call an Interactive Voice Recording (IVR) system daily for 3
      months to report marijuana use, quit/reduction attempts, and events that might increase or
      decrease the probability of initiating a quit/reduction attempt or the success of an attempt.
      Follow-up at 6 months will track recent marijuana and other drug use. Knowing what motivates
      marijuana users to try to stop or reduce, and knowing which strategies for stopping marijuana
      use are successful, can help develop treatments for marijuana dependence. For example, if
      stopping tobacco when trying to stop marijuana decreases the chance of stopping marijuana,
      then smoking cessation should be done after stopping marijuana. Or if reducing marijuana
      often leads to cessation, then convincing those not interested in quitting marijuana to first
      try reducing may be helpful.
