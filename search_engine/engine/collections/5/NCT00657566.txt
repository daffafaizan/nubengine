      using intent to treat analysis. Patients will be identified and after informed consent is
      obtained, will be randomized to receive antibiotics for 3 to 5 days (4 Â± 1 days) after the
      initial surgical or percutaneous intervention or antibiotics until two calendar days after
      the patient's white blood cell count, systemic temperature, and gastrointestinal function
      have normalized (maximum of 10 days). The primary endpoint is the composite rate of
      in-hospital death and/or recurrence of intraabdominal infection and/or occurrence of surgical
      site (wound) infection. Secondary endpoints include the occurrence of any infection at any
      site and infection with antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Patient data through the thirty days
      following the initial intervention or until hospital discharge (whichever is longer) will be
      tracked
