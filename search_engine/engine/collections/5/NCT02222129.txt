      the typical 6 - 8 hours up to 72 hours. The prolonged duration of liposomal bupivacaine was
      initially demonstrated in mice in 1994. Two randomized controlled trials using liposomal
      bupivacaine for bunionectomy and hemorrhoidectomy resulted in FDA approval for its use in
      humans. More recently, liposomal bupivacaine has also been found to improve pain control for
      patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty. Infiltration of a local anesthetic into
      laparoscopic port sites is a common practice that has been shown in some studies to improve
      postoperative pain. To compare liposomal bupivacaine and 0.25% bupivacaine for local
      analgesia following laparoscopic and robotic urologic surgery, a randomized
      comparison-controlled trial was performed.
