      disappear spontaneously, but they may become complicated before regressing. Apart from
      complication, the natural evolution of these cysts, which are said to be "simple" because
      they are liquid on ultrasound, is towards regression in the first months of neo-natal life.

      Surveillance during the 1st year of life showed that simple cysts regressed during the 1st
      trimester. In the case of complicated cysts, oophorectomy was necessary in 9 cases. In the
      1-year follow-up, the ovarian recovery rate was significantly different depending on the
      appearance of the cyst (p<0.0001); 60 ovaries out of 89 homolateral to the cyst were
      follicular, of which 48/49 (98%) were carriers of fluid cysts and 12/40 (30%) were initially
      heterogeneous. The origin of these cysts is unknown, the ovary is again physiologically
      stimulated during the onset of puberty. No series in the literature gives the long-term
      ovarian prognosis for these patients. We wish to evaluate the pubertal evolutionary profile
      of patients followed at the University Hospital for KOF. The data collected concerning
      puberty (age of menses) will be examined in relation to the age of menses in the siblings and
      in the mother, as well as to the data in the literature on the age of the first menses in
      France.
