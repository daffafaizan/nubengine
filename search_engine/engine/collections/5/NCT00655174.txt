      children per 10 000 live births suffer from the disorder, which is three to four times more
      common in males than in females. It is characterized by social and and communicative deficits
      and restricted, repetitive interests and behaviours. Most autistic children are delayed in
      the acquisition of both verbal and non-verbal communication skills and many never develop
      useful language. Three-quarters of autistic children have mild to severe mental retardation
      and a quarter develop seizures during later childhood or adolescence. Its etiology is
      heterogenous and there is no cure. Although behaviour therapy is an important tool in
      management, pharmacotherapy remains a necessity for many children. Current therapy is limited
      to antipsychotic drugs that can carry an unacceptable risk of chronic neurotoxicity (tardive
      dyskinesia) or tricyclic antidepressants that have undesireble cardiovascular effects. This
      study proposes to evaluate the potential benefit of selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors
      (SSRIs) in autism.

      All autistic children whose symptoms are not currently well controlled will be offered entry
      into the trial. Each child will randomized to eight weeks of fluvooxamine, sertraline, or
      placebo. If they do not improve on their initial dose, they may have a dose increase and
      continue in the study for a further eight weeks. Due to the significant amount of within- and
      between- patient variability, multiple baseline evaluations will be completed prior to the
      initiation of drug therapy. Parents may choose to continue therapy that was effective for
      their child; if their child was randomized to placebo, parents may choose to try an SSRI for
      a period of 8 weeks to assess effectiveness.
