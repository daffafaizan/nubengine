    
      All women (n=56) who had undergone CO2 laser laparoscopic radical excision of deep
      infiltrating endometriosis with active involvement of colorectal surgeon and/or urologist
      were selected retrospectively from the list of all patients (n=more than 2000) operated at
      the Leuven University Fertility Centre (LUFc) between September 1996 and July 2004.

      All 56 multidisciplinary operated patients were asked to complete the Oxford Endometriosis
      Quality of Life questionnaire, a sexual activity questionnaire and visual analogue scales
      (VAS) for dysmenorroe, chronic pelvic pain and deep dyspareunia, to compare their status
      before surgery and at the moment of the evaluation (January 2005).
