      in number and location. These tumors include facial angiofibromas, forehead plaques, shagreen
      patches, periungual fibromas, and gingival fibromas. The tumors are permanent, slow growing,
      and often disfiguring. The purpose of this study is to elucidate the molecular basis for
      these tumors. Specifically, we plan to identify the genetically altered cells in these
      hamartomatous lesions, and to quantify factors (e.g. cytokines) produced by these cells which
      induce the growth of these tumors. To accomplish this, we plan to obtain samples of these
      cutaneous tumors, to test tumor DNA for loss of heterozygosity, and to measure RNA and
      protein expression levels.
