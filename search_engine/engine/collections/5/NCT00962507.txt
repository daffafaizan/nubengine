      Primary

        -  To evaluate the safety and feasibility of combining panobinostat with everolimus in
           patients with recurrent or refractory lymphoma or multiple myeloma.

        -  To define the maximum tolerated dose of panobinostat in combination with everolimus in
           these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To obtain preliminary data for response to this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  To perform correlative studies relevant to this treatment regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of panobinostat.

      Patients receive oral panobinostat 3 days a week and oral everolimus once every other day for
      4 weeks Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Blood and bone marrow samples may be collected for pharmacokinetic and correlative laboratory
      studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for â‰¥ 4 weeks.
