      combined with Russian Electrical Stimulation on pain, mobility, functionality, range of
      motion, muscular strength, and activity in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.

      Design: Randomized controlled double-blind study. Setting: Specialist Rehabilitation
      Services. Participants: Eighty participants with knee osteoarthritis were randomized.
      Intervention: Participants were randomized into four groups: Group I (n=20; LLLT over three
      weeks followed by an eight-week receiving Russian electrical stimulation), Group II (n=20;
      Placebo laser over three weeks followed by an eight-week receiving Russian electrical
      stimulation), Group III (n=20; LLLT over three weeks followed by an eight-week receiving LLLT
      application combined with Russian electrical stimulation), Group IV (n=20; Placebo laser over
      three weeks followed by an eight-week receiving Placebo laser application combined with
      Russian electrical stimulation). The groups treated with LLLT received treatments with
      invisible infrared laser (904 nm, 3 Joules/point). The Placebo groups received identical
      treatment, but the infrared laser output was disabled. The sessions occurred three times a
      week.

      Main outcome measures: The primary outcome was the change in knee pain and functionality
      (Lequesne). Secondary outcomes included change in mobility (8 meters and Timed Up and Go
      test), range of motion (goniometer), muscular strength (dynamometer), activity (Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis questionnaire) and medication intake.
