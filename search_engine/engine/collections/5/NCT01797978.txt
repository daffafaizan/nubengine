      part in managing septic shock, but the choice of vasopressor is still under-investigated, and
      area of uncertainty.

      The response to vasopressor is sometimes unsatisfactory, and in that case, the outcome of the
      patients is poor.

      Recently, small size clinical trial has investigated the effect of methylene blue (MB), and
      showed promising results. However, large sized phase III trial has not been performed yet.

      Large sized phase III clinical trial is needed to establish the effect of MB in septic shock.
