      marker, and a previous pilot study in lymphoma patients has demonstrated that autologous Id
      protein can be formulated into an immunogenic, tumor specific antigen by conjugation to a
      carrier protein (KLH) and administration with an emulsion-based adjuvant. The goals of
      vaccine development in the current study are to develop vaccines: 1) with improved potency
      and 2) which are more effective at inducing cell-mediated immune responses. The selection of
      GM-CSF as the immunological "adjuvant" is a direct extension of our laboratory studies in
      small animal models demonstrating that GM-CSF can enhance the potency of the prototype Id-KLH
      vaccine by augmenting almost exclusively the cellular arm of the immune response.

      The objectives of this study are: 1) to evaluate cellular and humoral immune responses
      against the unique idiotype of the patient's lymphoma and 2) to evaluate the ability of the
      Id vaccine to clear the bone marrow of malignant cells detectable by pathologic examination
      or molecular examination (polymerase chain reaction amplification of the rearranged bcl-2
      oncogene).

      The goal of this study is to treat previously untreated patients with follicular lymphomas to
      complete remission or minimal residual disease with ProMACE chemotherapy. Three to six months
      after completion of chemotherapy, in an effort to reduce the relapse rate (by eradicating
      microscopic disease resistant to chemotherapy), patients will receive an autologous Id
      vaccine administered in combination with GM-CSF. Id-KLH (0.5 mg) is administered
      subcutaneously. GM-CSF is administered subcutaneously locally with the vaccine on the day of
      vaccination and for the three consecutive days following vaccination as close to the initial
      vaccination site as possible at one of two doses.
