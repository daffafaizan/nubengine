      mg. This intravenous infusion is being tested to treat adult patients with relapsed or
      refractory CD30-positive peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL) (excluding anaplastic large cell
      lymphoma (ALCL)) and pediatric patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL or
      Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).

      This survey is an observational (non-interventional) study and will look at the safety of
      adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL (excluding ALCL) and pediatric
      patients with relapsed or refractory CD30-positive PTCL or HL in the routine clinical
      setting. The number of observed patients will be approximately 86 as total (80; Adult
      participants and 6; Pediatric participants).

      This multi-center observational survey will be conducted in Japan.
