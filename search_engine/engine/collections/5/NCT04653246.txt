    
      This is a multi-center, single-arm, open-label, Phase 2 study in patients with newly
      diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM) eligible for high dose therapy (HDT) and autologous stem
      cell transplant (ASCT).

      In this research study, investigators are evaluating whether isatuximab is safe and effective
      in participants with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma when given in combination with
      lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethsone.

        -  This research study involves administration of a four-drug chemotherapy regimen that
           combines the Investigational drug isatuximab with a standard chemotherapy regimen
           comprised of lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone.

        -  This 4-drug regimen is not considered standard of the treatment of newly diagnosed
           multiple myeloma.

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug or combination of drugs to learn whether the
      drug works in treating a specific disease. "Investigational" means that the drug is being
      studied.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved lenalidomide, bortezomib, and
      dexamethasone as treatment options for this disease but the combination of these agents with
      isatuximab hasn't been approved.
