    
      A standard "3+3" dose escalation design to determine Maximum Tolerated Dose with consecutive
      different dose level cohort recruitment.

      The following dose levels to be investigated: 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5.0 mg/kg, 10
      mg/kgm 20 mg/kg. The study for each patient consists of 14-days screening period, single dose
      administration of MBC-11 followed by 7-day safety monitoring and then 2 cycles of multiple
      use of MBC-11 (28 days each cycle, study drug is administered at Days1-5). In case of partial
      metabolic reaction/stable metabolic reaction therapy maybe prolonged up to 4 cycles (at
      investigator and sponsor consideration)
