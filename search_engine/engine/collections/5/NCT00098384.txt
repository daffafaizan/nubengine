      age from industrialized regions were randomized to receive a poorly absorbed antibiotic,
      rifaximin, in one of three doses at mealtime (when they are exposed to diarrhea-causing
      bacteria), 200 mg once a day, 200 mg twice a day or 200 mg three times a day versus a placebo
      starting on arrival (within the first 72 hours) to Mexico and continuing for two weeks with
      diaries of symptoms recorded for three weeks. Adverse events in the subjects were followed
      for five weeks. If mild diarrhea (1 or 2 unformed stools/24 hours plus an enteric symptom) or
      diarrheal illness (>2 unformed stools/24 hours plus an enteric symptom) developed, subjects
      provided a stool sample to determine cause of illness. Forty subjects provided stool samples
      after 7 days and 14 days treatment to see if their intestinal bacterial flora had developed
      resistance to rifaximin and to see the level of drug achieved. Stool samples from these forty
      subjects were studied for enteric pathogens to look for asymptomatic infection during the
      period of prophylaxis. The stool samples collected were initially processed in our enteric
      laboratories in Guadalajara, Mexico. Specialized tests such as studies of toxigenicity for
      enterotoxigenic E. coli and enteroadherence for enteroaggregative E. coli were done in
      Houston.
