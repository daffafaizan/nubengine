      (SAD) for transurethral resection of bladder and ureteroscopy in urological surgery .
      Classical laryngeal mask airway (LMA-C) and I-Gel SADs are being used already. The aim of
      this study was to evaluate and compare the performance of a new type of SAD the Baska Mask®
      with I-gel and LMA-C regarding their insertion times, durations, perioperative complications
      and effects on hemodynamic parameters, peak airway pressures (Paw) and airway plato pressures
      in urological surgery as well.

      The main suggestion about the Baska Mask® is that it's the most appropriate airway device
      with high Paws. In high Paws, higher air leaks may occur from the sides of cuff and this
      causes hypoventilation. So the main aim of this study is to evaltuate three devices in terms
      of insertion and ventilation times, the "first attempt" success rates, the additional
      maneuvering requirements and complications developed after intervention.

      The secondary objective of the study was to evaluate all three SADs in terms of airway
      pressures producing sufficient tidal volume and hemodynamical parameters.
