      Procalcitonin (PCT) is a promising marker for identification of bacterial sepsis. The aim of
      this study was to determine the diagnostic accuracy of serum PCT concentration in patients
      with suspected sepsis admitted to mixed medical-surgical Intensive care unit (ICU).

      Material and Methods: A cross-sectional study conducted at section of Chemical Pathology,
      Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and ICU. Patients with suspected sepsis were
      included, serum PCT cut off â‰¥0.5 ng /ml was taken for diagnosing sepsis. Diagnostic accuracy
      was measured in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and
      negative predictive value (NPV) taking blood culture as gold standard. Furthermore, different
      cut offs were compared by using receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). Data analysis
      was done on SPSS version.
