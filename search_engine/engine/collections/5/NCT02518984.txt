    
      Given the advances in Atrial Fibrillation (AF) management and the availability of new
      European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, there is a need for the systematic
      collection of contemporary data regarding the management and treatment of AF in the member
      ESC countries. It is now nearly 10 years since the last European registry of AF management
      was undertaken (as part of the ESC Euro Heart Survey programme), and a new registry was
      needed.

      New guidelines on the management of AF have recently been published by the ESC, but it
      remains unclear how often clinicians adhere to them. Since the last Euro Heart survey, a
      change in management strategy has necessitated an update on prevalent management practices in
      AF. This is influenced by clinical availability of catheter ablation as a routine procedure
      and new antiarrhythmic drugs, and also by developments in stroke thromboprophylaxis and
      medical therapy options. Under the EURObservational Research Programme (EORP), an AF ablation
      sentinel pilot registry was launched in 2010.

      A survey of AF management under the EORP programme will enable a timely assessment of the
      uptake of the new ESC guidelines, allow monitoring of implementation and uptake of catheter
      ablation, new antithrombotic drugs and new antiarrhythmic agents, and will inform about
      outcomes related to guideline-adherent management of AF.
