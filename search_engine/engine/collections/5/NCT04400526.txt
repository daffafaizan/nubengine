      video competition for anti-drug abuse, (2) development of a community-based network through
      training 150 peers aged 13-18 as anti-drug ambassadors (ADAs) to deliver anti-drug messages
      based on the AWARD model, and (3) a mass promotional campaign organized by ADAs in the
      community. A one-group pre-test and repeated post-test design will be adopted to evaluate the
      overall effectiveness of the community-based network. We will assess the knowledge, attitudes
      and practices regarding anti-drug abuse of the ADAs. Data collection will be conducted at
      baseline, post-training, 3 months and 6 months after the training workshop.
