      cisplatin that is given by intravenous (IV) infusion and radiation, which is delivered from a
      machine that precisely targets the tumor. One common and unfortunate side effect of treatment
      with cisplatin and radiation is oral mucositis, which refers to irritation of the lining of
      the mouth. Oral mucositis is a serious problem 1) because the open mouth sores from oral
      mucositis may lead to severe pain, nutritional problems and dehydration from an inability to
      eat and drink, an increased risk of infection from bacteria and fungus and delay or
      discontinuation of treatment and 2) because there is only one approved therapy to treat or
      prevent it.
