    
      150 participants with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical score I-II who
      underwent elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy between the ages of 18-70 will be enrolled.
      Participants will be divided into two groups using granisetron and control.

      All participants will be premedicated with 0.05 mg kg-1 midazolam 30 minutes before the
      operation. ASA, age, sex, weight demographic data of the participants who were taken to the
      operating room will record. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SPO2), noninvasive blood pressure
      and electrocardiography (ECG) will monitored. A venous cannula will place on the back of the
      hand. Participants will randomly divide into 2 groups by closed envelope method.

      Five minutes before the induction of group G, 1 ml (1 mg / ml) iv granisetron, group K will
      receive 1 ml saline. Propofol at induction will be administered at a dose of 0.6 mg / kg of
      rocuronium at a dose of 2 mg / kg. Pre-induction, post-intubation and every five minutes
      SPO2, diastolic arterial pressure (DAP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), systolic arterial
      pressure(SAP) and heart rate (HR) will record. Intubation quality will be evaluated by evans
      score.
