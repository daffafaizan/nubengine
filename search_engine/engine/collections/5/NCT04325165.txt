      small series of chronic SCI patients will aim to examine safety, feasibility, and potential
      efficacy. This research will investigate the effects of electrode implantation, electrical
      stimulation and intensive locomotion training over a 1-year period. Motor assessments will be
      performed at regular intervals with stimulation on and off in a double-blind fashion
      (subjects and researchers will be unaware of stimulation setting), to determine if subjects
      have improved ambulation with stimulation on compared with off, and if their ambulation
      improves over the course of the study observation period with stimulation on.
