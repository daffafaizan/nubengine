    
      Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a highly potent and selective α2-adrenoceptors (α2R) agonist used in
      clinical practice for sedation, analgesia, and anxiolysis, was recently shown to have
      beneficial effects on early cognitive changes by reducing delirium in humans. It also reduced
      memory impairment after surgery and isoflurane anesthesia, both in elderly mice (20-22
      months) and in pups exposed to anesthesia in the early postnatal period. Importantly,
      co-treatment with DEX has been shown to restore learning and memory function in rats exposed
      to propofol in utero. Therefore, the investigators set out to investigate whether DEX has an
      effect on cognitive dysfunction months after surgery and whether it accelerates cognitive
      recovery from anesthesia and surgery.

      This is a multi-site trial facilitated by Clinical Trials Ontario (CTO). Participants will be
      randomized 1:1 in permuted blocks of 4 to 8. The randomization sequence will be computer
      generated and stratified by 2 factors, planned procedure (CABG/CABG + valve or valve only
      procedure) and study site.

      In hospital outcomes include delirium (assessed twice daily post-operative day (POD) 0-10,
      death, hemodynamic instability requiring vasopressors, time to extubation, re-intubation (and
      reason), length of stay (in Cardiovascular Intensive Care Unit and total hospital), POCD,
      depressive symptoms between POD 4-10, post-operative complications (infection [surgical site,
      sepsis, pneumonia], myocardial infarction, renal replacement therapy, re-operation,
      cumulative opioid consumption (to POD 5), in-hospital mortality.

      Post-operative outcomes include POCD (3/6/12 months), depression (3/6/12 months), mild
      cognitive impairment (MCI) at 3/6/12 months (defined as 1-2 standard deviations below age
      matched controls), persistent surgical site pain at sternotomy/thoracotomy/graft harvest site
      (Brief Pain Inventory, 3/6/12 months), recovery (3,6, 12 months).
