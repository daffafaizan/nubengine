      (HCC),but still has a higher recurrence. Sorafenib as neo-adjuvant therapy in combination of
      RFA was not reported yet. There's a theoretical advantage of this combination. Hence in this
      study the efficacy and safety of pre-administrative Sorafenib and Latter radiofrequency
      ablation (RFA) in Recurrent HCC will be tested in a multicenter prospective cohort study.
      Eligible cases will be assigned into the experimental group and the control group. For
      experiment group, sorafenib tablet will be given for two weeks, and then perform
      radiofrequency ablation. For the control group, RFA will be performed immediately.
