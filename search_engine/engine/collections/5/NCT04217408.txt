      striatum. They will receive standard follow-up and device programming over the span of 52
      weeks. After that, they will enter a 5 week double blinded crossover phase consisting of 2
      weeks of ON or OFF stimulation, separated by 1 week of 'washout', during which stimulation
      will be OFF.
