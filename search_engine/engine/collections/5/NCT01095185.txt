      hemorrhage, a direct consequence of portal hypertension. In addition, survivors of an episode
      of active bleeding have a 70 % risk of recurrent hemorrhage within two years of the bleeding
      episode and the highest risk it is situated in the first six weeks after the hemorrhage
      episode.

      The recommended treatment in AASLD guidelines is the combination of non selective
      Betablockers with endoscopic treatment with EVL, with high recurrence (30% in 2 years).

      The hypothesis of this study is that statins are candidates for improving portal hypertension
      treatment in patients with cirrhosis, improving vascular function as well as preventing
      venous thrombotic events.

      Patients with liver cirrhosis and variceal bleeding with standard treatment will be
      stratified and after randomized to undergo either statins (20 mg for 15 days, and after 40
      mg/day) or placebo. They will be followed up for 12 months.
