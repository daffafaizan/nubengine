      acceptability and preliminary efficacy of the ENACT Group Visit intervention compared to a
      comparison arm.

      The ENACT Group Visit intervention aims to engage patients in an interactive discussion of
      key ACP concepts and support patient-initiated ACP actions (i.e. choosing decision-maker(s),
      deciding on preferences during serious illness, discussing preferences with decision-makers
      and healthcare providers, and documenting advance directives). The group visits involve two
      2-hour sessions, one month apart, facilitated by a geriatrician and a social worker. The
      ENACT Group Visit is based on an intervention manual that guides the structure, facilitator
      considerations, session format, and documentation and billing details. The discussions
      include sharing experiences related to ACP, considering values related to serious illness,
      choosing a surrogate decision-maker(s), flexibility in decision making, and having
      conversations with decision-makers and healthcare providers. The facilitators support an
      interactive discussion that promotes opportunities for patients to learn from others'
      experiences.
