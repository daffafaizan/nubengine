    
      This study involves patients who have experienced either an in-hospital or out-of-hospital
      cardiopulmonary arrest, and who meet the 2015 American Heart Association (AHA)
      inclusion/exclusion criteria for targeted temperature management [i.e., they are comatose or
      exhibit no meaningful response to verbal commands with return of spontaneous circulation
      (ROSC) after cardiac arrest]. After induction of hypothermia protocol after cardiopulmonary
      arrest (i.e., targeted temperature management), patients will undergo ocular ultrasound at
      three time points.
