      patients and patients with other sarcomas that share similar chromosomal translocations to
      Ewing sarcoma (FET-family translocations), including but not limited to desmoplastic small
      round cell tumor.

      A safety lead-in dose escalation and dose expansion will be conducted assessing the
      combination of seclidemstat with topotecan and cyclophosphamide in patients with relapsed or
      refractory Ewing sarcoma.
