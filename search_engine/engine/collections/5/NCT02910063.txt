      treatment of subjects with R/R aggressive B-NHL not achieving CMR after standard
      platinum-based chemotherapy regimens administered as S1. This study incorporates multiple
      interim analyses for futility, efficacy, and unblinded sample-size re-estimation. In the
      phase 3 part of the study, blinatumomab will be compared to IC chemotherapy.The phase 2
      component of the study will consist of up to a 28-day screening period, approximately 70 to
      112 days of study treatment, a 30-day (+/- 3days) safety follow up, and long-term follow up
      that will conclude with the final analysis of the phase 3 component, estimated at 30 months
      after initiation of the phase 3 component. For the phase 3 component, the study will consist
      of up to a 28-day screening period, a treatment period of up to approximately 168 days, a
      30-day safety follow-up visit, and long-term follow up. Long-term follow up will conclude
      with the final analysis.In the phase 2 component, enrolled subjects will receive blinatumomab
      monotherapy. In the phase 3 component, enrolled subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      blinatumomab or IC chemotherapy.

      In March 2019, decision made to not proceed with phase 3.
