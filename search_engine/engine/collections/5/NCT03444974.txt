      research on youth drug abuse and dependency has taken a new and vital role within the public
      healthcare system. For this reason, it is crucial to find new ways to effectively integrate
      adolescent patients into the health care system, as well as assign them to treatment options
      tailor made for the specific challenges and needs of this population. This study aims to
      investigate (a) sociodemographic background and psychiatric comorbidities in connection with
      adolescent substance abuse and dependence to enhance understanding of epidemiologic risk
      factors for developing drug dependency in adolescence, as well as benefit future treatment
      options.

      It further aims to investigate (b) molecular and epigenetic mechanisms of addiction disorders
      in adolescents by analyzing methylation pattern, as well as proteome analysis of peripheral
      immune markers. The investigator's aim is a better understanding of the multimodal biological
      underpinnings of risk/resilience for addiction in youth on the molecular, cellular and
      circuit levels with a special focus on the changes within the stress and immune system in
      patients with addiction disorders and their family members.

      Another research interest of this study concerns (c) adapting and evaluating new treatment
      options, tailor made for the adolescent population. For this reason the investigators aim to
      adapt, implement and evaluate a therapeutic program according to the MATRIX manual for the
      treatment of substance abuse, which consists of two group therapies for patients, as well as
      their parents (Evaluation time points: T0, T1, and T2).

      Last, this study aims to (d) evaluate parental stress levels, parental communication skills
      and knowledge in connection with adolescent substance abuse.
