        -  Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent multiple myeloma treated with
           recombinant interferon alfa and recombinant interleukin-6.

        -  Determine the safety and optimal dose of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the impact of this regimen on clonogenic growth of myeloma cells in serial in
           vitro assays.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive recombinant interferon alfa subcutaneously (SC) once daily. Beginning 1
      month later, patients also receive recombinant interleukin-6 SC once daily. Treatment
      continues for up to 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
