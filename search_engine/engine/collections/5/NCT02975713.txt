      stimulated cycle. Sample size calculations show that the study needs to recruit 10 women to
      show any significant differences in progesterone secreted in the morning at 8 am compared to
      that secreted in the evening at 8 pm. We have increased the number of participants to 12 in
      order to compensate for any possible drop outs. The hormones FSH, LH, Progesterone and
      Estradiol will be measured at days 2/3, 8, 10 and 12 of a normal and stimulated cycle so that
      each patient serves as her own control.

      This study will provide the basis to establish the optimal blood sampling time for
      progesterone measurement and to more accurately determine the cut-off level for progesterone
      for favourable pregnancy outcomes in ART.
