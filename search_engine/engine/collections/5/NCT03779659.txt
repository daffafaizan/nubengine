      sample of 100 male and female children who fit the inclusion and exclusion criteria are
      recruited. Once parents' consent at the first visit basic demographic information, dental and
      medical history information is collected. This study is conducted in total of two clinic
      visits. In the first visit participants are randomized to either the intervention group or
      the comparison group. The intervention group receives the experimental device (TENS) prior to
      local anesthetic injection whereas the comparison group receives the local anesthetic gel.
      Following this the participants receive the local anesthetic injection after which treatment
      is completed. In the second visit the participants are crossed over to the other group and
      therefore randomization is not used for visit 2. Those who received the local anesthetic gel
      in visit 1 will receive the experimental device in visit 2 and those who received the
      experimental device in visit 1 will receive the local anesthetic gel in visit 2 . Following
      this treatment procedures are completed.
