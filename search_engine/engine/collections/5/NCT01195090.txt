    
      This is a prospective, open-label, randomized, parallel, 24-week study. Inclusion criteria:
      type 2 diabetes patients who were treated with stable doses of sulfonylurea and metformin to
      their half maximally dose (sulfonylureas > half maximal dose, and metformin > 1500 mg/d) for
      > 10 weeks. > 20 years old; A1C:> 7.0 % and < 11% Exclusion criteria: insulin use within 12
      weeks of the screening visit, any contraindications for use of sitagliptin or pioglitazone,
      impaired renal function (serum creatinine > 1.4 mg/dl), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) or
      aspartate aminotransferase levels (AST) > 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN), current
      or prepare to pregnancy and lactation.

      Primary Purpose:

      compare the change in hemoglobin A1c and the proportion of patients achieving A1C < 7%
      between the 2 groups

      Secondary Purposes:

        1. Changes in fasting plasma glucose, high sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP)

        2. Homeostasis model assessment-β cell function(HOMA-β) will be calculated to assess
           changes in β-cell function and HOMA-insulin resistance(HOMA-IR)to assess changes in
           insulin resistance

        3. Body weight change, proportion of side effects
