      best treatment to reduce subsequent preterm birth remains unknown. This study is a randomized
      trial of women who have a singleton pregnancy and a short cervical length on transvaginal
      ultrasound as determined by a study-certified sonographer. It is being conducted at 12
      clinical centers across the country and the recruitment target is enrollment of 850 pregnant
      women. Participants will be randomized to 1) Arabin pessary or 2) usual care as per by local
      hospital protocol. Pessary is a promising low-cost, non-surgical intervention that appears to
      be well-tolerated. The pessary will be placed by obstetric providers trained in appropriate
      placement of the Arabin pessary. The primary outcome of the study is delivery or fetal death
      prior to 37 weeks 0 days gestational age.

      In the literature, there are two large trials that have produced conflicting results (M Goya
      et al, 2012, K Nicolaides et al, 2016). Thus, the results of an adequately powered and
      appropriately conducted trial from the United States will be important in determining whether
      pessary is a useful intervention for the prevention of subsequent preterm birth in women with
      singleton gestation.
