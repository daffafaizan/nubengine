      parallel- group study with a total of 20 participants planned to be randomized (approximately
      10 participants to the riociguat group and 10 to the placebo group). In addition, a
      standardized wound care protocol will be followed by the investigators and digital
      photography will be taken of the cardinal ulcer.

      The study will allow standard of care medications for the management of DU as background
      therapy. These may include calcium channel blockers, low dose aspirin, angiotensin enzyme
      inhibitors, etc. and will be determined by the participant's local physician.

      The study design consists of three phases:

        -  Screening phase: up to 2 weeks

        -  Double-blind Treatment phase: 16 weeks of double-blind treatment, consisting of:

        -  Dose titration period of up to 8 weeks, and

        -  Stable dosing period of up to 8 weeks

        -  Open-label Extension phase for participants with active DU at the end of the double-
           blind treatment phase or development of an active DU within a month of completing
           double-blind phase, consisting of:

        -  Dose titration phase of up to 8 weeks

        -  Stable dosing period for 8 weeks
