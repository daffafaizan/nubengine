      is aimed at reducing the impact of stress through a variety of skill building exercises. The
      exercises incorporated into the program have been shown to improve physical symptoms, mood
      and wellbeing in medical patient populations. However, very little work has focused on
      healthcare providers, and there are no studies that look at mindfulness interventions for
      resident physicians specifically.

      Participants enrolled will be invited to complete a set of questionnaire before and after
      participation in the program. The investigators will also collect continuous physiologic data
      using the Basis Peak Health Tracking device to correlate the physiologic data with
      self-report measures of stress.
