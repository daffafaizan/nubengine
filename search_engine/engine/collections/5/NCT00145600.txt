    
      This study will evaluate the following objectives:

      Primary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the efficacy of 4 cycles of VAMP chemotherapy alone in patients with
           favorable risk Hodgkin's disease who achieve a complete response after 2 cycles of VAMP
           chemotherapy.

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of 4 cycles VAMP chemotherapy plus low dose RT in patients with
           favorable risk Hodgkin's disease who achieve a partial response after 2 cycles of VAMP
           chemotherapy.

        3. To evaluate the efficacy of 2 alternating cycles of VAMP/COP chemotherapy (total 4
           cycles of chemotherapy) plus low-dose, involved-field RT in children with intermediate
           risk Hodgkin's disease.

        4. To evaluate the efficacy of 12 weeks of Stanford V chemotherapy plus low-dose,
           involved-field RT in children with unfavorable risk Hodgkin's disease.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. To evaluate patient quality of life during and after treatment from the patient and
           parent perspective.

        2. To compare patient and parental ratings of treatment-related symptoms and patient
           physical, psychological, social and cognitive functioning before the first treatment (T1
           - baseline); after Cycle 2 or after 8 weeks of Stanford V (T2 - Evaluate Response);
           after cycle 4 or after 12 weeks of Stanford V and before or on the first day of
           radiation (as applicable) (T3); at the conclusion of radiation or within a few days
           following the end of radiation (as applicable) (T4); and at 3 to 6 months after
           completion of therapy follow-up evaluation (T5).
