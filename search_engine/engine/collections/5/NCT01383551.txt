      if not properly managed, could have adverse effects on their mental health, marital
      satisfaction, and parent-child relationships. The proposed programme, "Becoming Parents",
      aims to turn the challenges of the transition into opportunities of learning and support for
      these parents. Building on our experience of instituting a pioneering programme to support
      new fathers prenatally, "Becoming Parents" has an extra component of support for new parents
      in the postnatal period using trained volunteers from the community networks. Through
      "Becoming Parents", seamless antenatal-postnatal care based on a hospital-community
      partnership will be provided to 125 expectant couples in a target community which is known
      for its high risks for postnatal depression, child abuse and intimate partner violence. In
      addition to addressing the health promotional needs of the target community, "Becoming
      Parents" will also illustrate how a community's capacity for health promotion can be
      maximized through the collaboration of healthcare providers and network of community partners
      in helping couples function more optimally during their transition to parenthood.
