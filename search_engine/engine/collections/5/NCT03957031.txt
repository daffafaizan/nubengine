      can vary widely. The reasons behind these differences are multiple and complex and may
      include genetic susceptibility, strains of the bacterium Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori),
      Epstein Barr virus infection, dietary factors and others. These factors can influence GC
      outcomes. There is little knowledge regarding how these risk factors are associated with GC
      in CELAC and EU populations.

      The primary objectives of this study are to:

        1. Identify risk factors associated with GC in the CELAC and EU populations participating
           in this study including Argentina, Spain, Mexico, Netherlands, Chile, Portugal and
           Paraguay.

        2. Identify clinical, demographic, and epidemiological differences among the populations
           participating in this study
