      a standard infusion set or an extended wear infusion set. They will wear each infusion set
      twice, and the order of infusion set wear will be randomized with the first infusion set wear
      and then alternated over 4 weeks. By performing a cross over study using both experimental
      infusion sets and standard infusion sets, the investigators hope to see whether there is a
      benefit to using an extended wear infusion set.
