      endothelial cells. This mechanism may contribute to the adverse vascular effects determined
      by chronic hyperinsulinemia. The aim of this study will be to evaluate the effect of local
      hyperinsulinemia on ET activity in the forearm circulation. To this purpose, we will assess
      the forearm blood flow response to ET receptor antagonism in control conditions and during
      intraarterial infusion of insulin. We will also measure changes in plasma ET-1 levels in
      response to the different pharmacological stimuli.
