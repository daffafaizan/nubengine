    
      Two groups will be involved;

      For the control group (CG):

      Mpro gold rotary system and ZOE sealer will be used for root canal treatment then restored
      with composite restorations.

      For the endocrown group (EG):

        -  First step: Endodontic treatment protocol will be used as the following:

             1. Biomechanical preparation using; 2.6% NaOCl for irrigation, ProTaper Next rotary
                files for instrumentation and 17% EDTA gel for lubrication.

             2. Obturation of root canal using; ProTaper gutta-percha and iRoot SP sealer.

        -  Second step: Endocrown restoration protocol will be used as the following:

             1. Occlusal Butt joint design for Endocrown preparation.

             2. Putty-wash technique for taking impression.

             3. IPS e.max CAD for Endocrown construction.

             4. G-CEM self-adhesive resin cement for Endocrown cementation.

        -  Follow up visits: The patients will be recalled every 6 months for evaluation.

        -  Evaluation methods:

             -  Endodontic treatment evaluation: The outcome will be evaluated clinically and
                radiographically.

             -  Endocrown restoration evaluation: The outcome will be evaluated clinically in terms
                of; marginal adaptation, marginal discoloration and surface alteration.
