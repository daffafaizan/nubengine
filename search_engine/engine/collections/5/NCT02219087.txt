      bupivacaine. It is designed to be injected at the time of surgery into the local soft
      tissues. Because of its unique liposomal delivery system, Liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel®)
      has been shown to provide up to 96 hours of pain relief following surgeries. This makes it an
      attractive option in total knee arthroplasty patients. Combined with the proven efficacy of
      regional anesthesia, intraoperative liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel®) may provide extended
      pain relief following total knee arthroplasty. This has the potential to avoid the need for
      opioid medications. With better pain control, medication side effects can be avoided and
      patient's length of stay in the hospital can be shortened.
