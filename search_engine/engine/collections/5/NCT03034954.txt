      (HD-tDCS; anode at center electrode) at 3 mA (for 20 minutes) on learning, memory, and
      working memory. Participants will be randomized to active or sham stimulation and will
      complete a series of cognitive tests both during and after stimulation.

      Tolerability and blinding will also be evaluated using standard side effect questionnaires.
