    
      Necrotizing soft tissue infections (NSTI) is a complex, multi-factorial disease and the
      bacteria show a diverse microbial etiology. The exentisive inflammatory response caused by
      these bacteria is thought to be a main course of death. In Denmark, most NSTI patients are
      treated with hyperic oxygen therapy (HBOT). However, the effects of HBOT have never been
      investigated in NSTI patients.

      Location: Copenhagen University Hospital, Rigshospitalet, Denmark.

      Design: Observational cohort study.

      Cohort: NSTI patients in Denmark treated with HBOT.

      Biomarkers: Cytokines, acute-phase proteins, vasoactive biomarkers and other inflammatory
      biomarkers.

      Sample size calculation: The investigators expect a mean IL-6 concentration before HBOT of
      3500 pg/ml (standard deviation 1500 pg/ml) and consider a reduction of 800 pg/ml to be
      clinically relevant. With an alpha = 0.05 and a power of 80%, 112 patients will be required.

      Data: The Danish Data Protection Agency has approved the processing of personal data for the
      NSTI patients (J. no. 30-0900).

      Ethics: The trial will adhere to the Helsinki Declaration and the Danish law. The National
      Ethics Committee and the Regional Scientific Ethics Committee of Copenhagen have approved the
      study (CVK-1211709 and H-2-2014-071).

      Analysis: Biomarker analyses will be performed once the recruitment of patients has ended.
