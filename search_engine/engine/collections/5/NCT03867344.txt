      will study how a physiological stress (low blood sugar), a stress often experienced by people
      with diabetes, affects connections in the brain. The investigators will focus on brain
      connections that are involved in autonomic control of cardiovascular function, and determine
      both how these brain connections are altered by low blood sugar and how these alterations
      associate with changes in pain perception and cardiovascular control.

      In this study, the investigators introduce a novel mechanistic, integrative approach to the
      assessment of the response to and recovery from a specific physiologic stressor -
      insulin-induced hypoglycemia. The overall hypothesis is that a hypoglycemic stress will alter
      autonomic brain networks, and will affect clinically relevant physiological outcomes
      (cardiovascular autonomic function); and that the rate and extent of recovery of these brain
      networks will provide a measure of resilience.

      In combination, this approach will allow the investigators for the first time to define the
      magnitude of the effect of stress exposure on neural circuitry and on clinically relevant
      stress-related physiological outcomes (cardiovascular autonomic function) and to define the
      recovery of brain circuitry and these related physiological outcomes.
