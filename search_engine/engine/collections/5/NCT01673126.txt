      or minimally conscious state (MCS). At present, there are no evidence-based guidelines
      regarding the treatment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC).

      Investigator aim to assess the effect of single session anodal (i.e., excitatory)
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPF) on the level of consciousness in DOC patients in a double blind randomized sham
      controlled study.

      tDCS is a form of safe non-invasive cortical stimulation, modulating cortical excitability at
      stimulation sites via weak polarizing currents, previously reported to transiently improve
      working memory and attention by stimulating the left DLPF in healthy subjects and patients
      with stroke, Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease.
