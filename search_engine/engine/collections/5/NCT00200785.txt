      antiplatelet activity. However, the compounds responsible for this antiplatelet effect have
      not been identified.

      Acute studies. In acute (one day) studies, healthy participants will consume several doses of
      "fresh garlic" (garlic powder added to ambient water; up to the equivalent of 12 grams fresh
      garlic or 52 mg allicin) as a paste in a tuna sandwich. At 0, 2, 4, and 6 hours after
      consumption, the ability of platelets to aggregate in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) or in whole
      blood (WB), in response to a drug (collagen, ADP) that stimulates platelet aggregation, will
      be measured. After establishing the optimum dose and optimum time of the antiplatelet effect
      for each person, and if the effects are sufficiently strong, the effects of cooked garlic
      (garlic powder added to boiling water, no allicin present) and seven extracted fractions
      (oil, protein, fructans, etc.) will be determined, using the fractions at the same dose as
      their abundance in the established optimum dose of crushed fresh garlic.

      Chronic studies. If only weak platelet effects are found for a high acute dose of "fresh"
      garlic, chronic studies will be conducted. In chronic studies, participants will consume 8.0
      grams of "fresh garlic" (2.7 grams garlic powder added to ambient water, allicin content = 35
      mg) as a paste in a tuna sandwich every day for four weeks and 8.0 grams of "boiled garlic"
      (2.7 grams garlic powder added to boiling water) in a sandwich every day for an additional
      four weeks, after a 1-week washout. The ability of platelets to aggregate in PRP and whole
      blood will be determined before and every week after garlic consumption begins and after the
      1-week washout.
