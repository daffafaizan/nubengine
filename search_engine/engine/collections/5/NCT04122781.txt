      reduction and internal fixation using percutaneous Kirschner wires (K-wires) are widely
      recommended for Gartland type II and III fractures. After percutaneous pinning, the K-wires
      are bent at the skin edge and cut. The cutoff point is about 1 cm outside of the skin.

      The diameters of the K-wires are between 1.5-3.0 mm. The surface of the K-wire is smooth.
      Therefore, the K-wires are easy to rotation and migration. Proximal migration or rotation of
      a K-wire could injure the skin. Distal migration of a K-wire could result in loss of
      reduction and fixation. Therefore, stabilization of the K-wires is important.

      A novel K-wire external fixation device was developed by the investigators. The K-wires can
      be connected by the device. After connection, the structure of the K-wires is transformed to
      an external skeletal fixator. Therefore, the K-wires are stabilized and unable to migrate
      independently. The stability of fracture fixation is better in patient with this K-wire
      external fixation device.

      The investigators got a one-year grant from the Ministry of Science and Technology in Taiwan
      last year. The preliminary data revealed that the torque and torsional stiffness with the
      K-wire external fixation device was greater than traditional pinning.

      The purposes of this study are to optimize the K-wire external fixation device and test its
      function in real clinical practice.
