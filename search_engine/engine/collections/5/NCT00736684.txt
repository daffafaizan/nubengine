      procedure in trauma and orthopaedic surgery. Unstable fractures treated with intramedullary
      nailing carry the risk of fracture fixation complications. The PFNA (Synthes) has evolved
      from the original PFN design, featuring a novel antirotation screw. Apart from the prevention
      of excess rotational forces, this supporting element may enhance the overall stability of the
      construct, thus potentially reducing fracture fixation complications. Empirical information
      about the fracture fixation complication rates of the PFNA device is not available. The
      primary objective of this study is to compare the 1-year fracture fixation rates between the
      PFNA and Gamma Nail 3â„¢ (Stryker). Secondary objectives of the study are to compare
      differences in functional outcomes, quality of life outcomes, safety, radiological outcomes,
      handling and perceived effectiveness between the devices.
