    
      Retrospective review of a prospectively maintained MEN1 database. The patient cohort consists
      of all patients with confirmed MEN1 with or without PNET who are included in the database.
      The database will be reviewed to obtain patient and disease characteristics, laboratory
      values, imaging results, hormone parameters (menopausal status, bioidentical hormone use,
      oral contraception use, gestational status and diagnosis of a prolactinoma) and vital status.

      For the prospective portion of this study, investigators want to see the impact of estrogen
      on the PNET forming and progression, and would like to use two equations to assess the
      estrogen exposure, so investigators should collect the information of menopause, menarche,
      breast feed, HRT, OCP use and pregnancy. To this end, investigators will contact female
      patients in the database who are still living, and obtain verbal informed consent to send an
      email questionnaire regarding their pregnancy and hormone use history.
