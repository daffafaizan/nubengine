      flow and angiogenesis to the tumor, thus increase the focal temperature, which can be
      evaluated by breast thermography (infrared imaging). We will evaluate the efficacy of
      infrared imaging for detection and diagnosis of breast cancer, and if infrared imaging can
      effectively differentiate malignant from benign breast dieases and the sensitivity,
      specificity, false-negative rate will also be estimated.
