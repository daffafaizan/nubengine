      patients with sepsis and septic shock is directly proportional to the evolution to multiorgan
      failure and inversely proportional to survival. After assessing the safety in the
      administration of ascorbic acid as well as the decrease or almost abolition of its impact at
      the renal level after the association of thiamine, and the synergy provided by the
      administration of hydrocortisone, it is decided to implement the "Metabolic Resucitation
      Protocol" and assess its impact on our septic patients
