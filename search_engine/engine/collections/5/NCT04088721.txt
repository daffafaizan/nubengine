    
      A single center, double-blind, randomized, dose-escalation study to assess the safety,
      tolerability and efficacy of 3 doses of AD17002 in comparison to placebo. Subjects will be
      randomized at 3:1 ratios in each of 3 cohorts to receive AD17002 or placebo. The following
      treatment cohorts are featured in a dose-escalating manner:

      A. Cohort 1 will comprise 16 subjects who will receive, in a double-blind manner, either 20
      μg AD17002 (n=12) or placebo (n=4) on Study Day 1, 8, and 15.

      B. Cohort 2 will comprise 16 subjects who will receive, in a double-blind manner, either 40
      μg AD17002 (n=12) or placebo (n=4) on Study Day 1, 8, and 15.

      C. Cohort 3 will comprise 16 subjects who will receive, in a double-blind manner, either 60
      μg AD17002 (n=12) or placebo (n=4) on Study Day 1, 8, and 15.

      A total of 16 subjects in cohort 1 will receive the assigned study preparation before the
      remainder of the Cohort. Study drug administration to the next subject for the first 8
      subjects in the cohort 1 will be separated for at least one day elapse (at least 24 hrs). The
      progression to the next cohort will take place after the SRT review the whole follow-up
      period safety data of previous cohort.
