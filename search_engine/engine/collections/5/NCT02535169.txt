    
      This study aims to do the following:

        1. To evaluate whether a health education and coaching strategy in overweight and obese
           adolescents (â‰¥85th percentile) with high risk for type 2 diabetes is superior to usual
           care (single nutrition consultation) for weight management, clinical health outcomes
           (measures of glucose tolerance), lifestyle behavior outcomes (diet and physical
           activity) and outcomes of importance to patients such as satisfaction with the health
           care team, treatment goals, and psychosocial functioning.

        2. To evaluate whether a health education and coaching strategy in obese adolescents with
           diabetes (type 1 or type 2) is superior to usual care (single nutrition consultation)
           for weight management, clinical health outcomes (measures of diabetes control),
           lifestyle behavior outcomes (diet and physical activity) and outcomes of importance to
           patients such as satisfaction with the health care team, treatment goals, and
           psychosocial functioning.

        3. At baseline, before the interventions described in Aims 1 and 2, to identify key diet
           and physical activity factors, patient characteristics, or biomarkers which are
           predictive of diabetes risk.

        4. At baseline, before the interventions described in Aims 1 and 2, can associations
           between glycemia, cardiometabolic risk factors, and diet and physical activity behaviors
           in overweight and obese adolescents who are at risk for type 2 diabetes be identified
           using the Bright Futures questionnaire, a survey for lifestyle behavior which is
           normally used in the clinic setting.
