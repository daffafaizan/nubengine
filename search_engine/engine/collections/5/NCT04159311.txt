      IBS-like symptoms in a short series of Crohn patients. IBS-like symptoms are frequent in
      patients with ulcerative colitis in remission (about 20 %).

      The aim of this interventional, randomized single blind study is to evaluate the impact of 3
      sessions of osteopathy on Irritable Bowel Syndrome symptoms in 50 patients (randomisation
      1:1) with ulcerative colitis in remission (defined by fecal calprotectin < 200 Âµg/g).

      The two group of patients will have 4 sessions of osteopathy (M0, M1, M2, M3). The "treated
      group" will have 3 sessions of osteopathy testing followed by osteopathy treatment (M0, M1,
      M2) and a final testing session at M3. The "untreated group" will have 4 sessions of only
      testing osteopathy (M0, M1, M2, M3).

      Primary end-points : Irritable Bowel Syndrome Severity Scoring System (IBS SSS) at 3 months
      (M3) Secondary end-points : Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire ol, Functional
      Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue at M3, evaluation of osteopathic dysfunctions
      between M0 and M3, questionnaire for use of medication for IBS between M0 and M3
