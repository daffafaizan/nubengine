      management, and treatment of chronic pain after musculoskeletal injury. Continued progress in
      this arena requires novel methods to measure central nervous system (brain) mechanism of
      action and its role in identification of the unique transition of musculoskeletal injury to
      chronic pain. The purpose of this study is to use near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to
      measure changes along cortical pain pathways in the brain related to true and sham dry
      needling treatment.

      Specific Aim #1: The investigators will compare the cortical pain pathway response during dry
      needling treatment to sham dry needling treatment using NIRS in two groups of patients with
      chronic shoulder pain.

      The investigators hypothesize that decreased cortical activity will be seen in the
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in those treated with true dry needling compared to
      those treated with sham dry needling.

      Specific Aim #2: The investigators will evaluate whether the cortical pain pathway response
      (imaged using NIRS) during dry needling predicts 1-week improvement in shoulder muscle
      response, local hypoalgesia, and self-reported pain and disability in the group of patients
      that received true dry needling treatment. The investigators hypothesize that decreased
      cortical activity in the DLPFC will be associated with improvements in shoulder muscle
      response, local hypoalgesia, and self-reported pain and disability in those treated with true
      dry needling.
