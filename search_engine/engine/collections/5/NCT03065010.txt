    
      Multicentre dose-finding open-label non-comparative phase Ia/Ib clinical trial for
      investigation of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics of BCD-115 administered p.o. with
      intrapatient dose escalation in the population of patients with ER(+) HER2(-) advanced breast
      cancer in combination with a standard dose of endocrine therapy.

      The trial will be conducted in two stages:

      Stage 1 - finding of the maximum tolerated dose, determination of the recommended dose for
      Stage 2.

      Stage 2 - study of the recommended dose from Stage 1 of BCD-115, analysis of tolerability and
      safety of selected dose/doses in additional cohorts, and determination of the estimated
      therapeutic dose/doses for further clinical studies.
