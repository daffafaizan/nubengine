      University Hospital of Liege for a scheduled heart surgery.

      The study is based on the oral administration of baclofen (or placebo) the evening Bedrooms
      (10 pm). This administration begins the day before surgery and ends 5th day after. Sleep is
      evaluated by various questionnaires at baseline, during the protocol and the end. In
      addition, a 24 polysomnography is performed the day after surgery.
