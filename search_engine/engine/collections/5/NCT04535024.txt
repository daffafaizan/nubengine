      with metastatic cancer, as proved by improved survival and durable responses in a group of
      these patients. However, the response rates to ICI when given alone are limited. In
      gastrointestinal cancer, patients with microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) or mismatch
      repair deficient (dMMR) tumors shown a response rate of approximately 40% to ICI, while
      patients with microsatellite stable (MSS) or mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) tumors respond
      poorly to ICI. Such observations have spurred efforts to expand the benefit of immunotherapy,
      especially in these immune "non-sensitive" tumors, by combining ICI with treatments that
      induce T-cell associated immune response such stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR).

      High-dose ablative radiation was showed to facilitate immunotherapy through promote the
      activation of innate and adaptive immune responses against tumors in preclinical model and
      early phase clinical trials. However, a large portion of trials which were launched to test
      the efficacy of radiotherapy and immunotherapy produced suboptimal results. One important
      reason could be that majority of these trails were designed with single lesion irradiation,
      which is insufficient to unveil enough tumor antigens and/or to break the barrier of
      immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME).

      The investigators hypothesized that irradiation to multiple or all sites of diseases is more
      likely to produce an optimized regimen with ICI by broadly stimulate anti-tumor immunity and
      reduce tumor burden. Therefore, this study plans to administrate SABR to as many metastatic
      lesions as possible, in combination with ICI (Sintilimab) in patients with MSS
      oligometastatic colorectal cancers, to assess safety and tolerability of the regimen, and
      evaluate its early efficacy as well.
