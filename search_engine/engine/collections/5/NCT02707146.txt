      in a 12-month randomized study. At each scheduled primary care visit during the trial period,
      Intervention Patients will be provided with a waiting room Tablet loaded with the "Visit
      Planner" intervention tool designed to support prioritization and discussion of top health
      care concerns. Control Patients will be given a written educational handout to review.
      Patient-centered outcomes will be obtained at baseline and after visits using validated
      survey instruments. Clinical outcomes focus on differences in quality of care. If successful,
      this approach to aligning patient and provider visit priorities can potentially be
      disseminated and adapted to a wide variety of different care settings.
