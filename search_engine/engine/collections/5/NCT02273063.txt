      stimulation (rTMS) for adults with comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major
      depressive disorder (MDD). Although standard rTMS uses stimulations delivered to the left
      prefrontal cortex at 10 pulses per second, prior work has shown that other stimulation
      frequencies may work for both PTSD and MDD. In this study, we examine the efficacy of
      left-sided 5Hz in patients with PTSD and MDD, hypothesizing that this lower frequency will
      improve PTSD and MDD symptoms.
