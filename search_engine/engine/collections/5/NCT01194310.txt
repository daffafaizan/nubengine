      resistance is the reason, while aqueous humor production is normal. Medical reduction of
      intraocular pressure (IOP) is first line therapy in most cases. The gold standard of surgical
      treatment still is trabeculectomy (TE) but TE has a lot of drawbacks. In particular when
      glaucoma and cataract coexists, the investigators therefore prefer the combined procedure
      cataract extraction plus excimer laser trabeculotomy (ELT) or plus Trabectome. Indication is
      cataract and a moderate elevated IOP without medical therapy or a moderate cataract and
      elevated IOP with medical therapy.

      The ELT is performed by an AIDA XeCl-Excimer Laser System (TUI-Laser AG, Germering, 1,2 mJ
      per burst, burst duration 16 ns, wave length 308 nm, spot diameter 200 Âµm). 10 foramina were
      made over 90 degrees of the anterior chamber angle. Trabectome procedure is performed with
      the Trabectome unit from Neomedix.
