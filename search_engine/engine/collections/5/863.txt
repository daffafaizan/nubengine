the inhibition of respiration and phosphorylation in kidneymitochondria by parathyroid hormone administered in vivo.parathyroid hormone administeredin vivo to rabbitsproduced a metabolic alterationin kidney cortexmitochondria, evidenced bydiminished respiratory rate,respiratory control, and p:oratio with a series of substratesincluding pyruvate plusfumarate, succinate,ketoglutarate, malate, citrate,and isocitrate.  the adenosinetriphosphate-inorganicphosphate exchange reactionrate was decreased andadenosine triphosphataseactivity was increased comparedto control mitochondria.these changes did not becomeapparent until about 12 hr.after injection, were undiminishedby 24 hr., and couldbe elicited with as little as 200usp units of hormone.under identical conditions livermitochondria were unaffected.diphospho- and triphosphopyridine nucleotidesin combination frequently elevatedthe respiration inparathyroid-treated mitochondriaclose to or above controllevels with citrate and isocitratebut not with theremaining substrates and hadno effect on respiratorycontrol with any of the substrates.the effects of thehormone could not be duplicatedby elevating and maintainingin otherwise normal rabbitsserum ca concentrationsat twice normal levelfor 6 hr. it is concludedthat the effects produced byparathyroid hormone on kidneyare multiple in nature andrelated to the ca++raising potency of the preparations.
