      biocollection of sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cellsNo data has been published
      concerning the incidence and prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in patients with IBD and
      treated by IV infusion of infliximab or vedolizumab. It seems that biotherapies have a
      minimal impact on the severity of the viral infection but data are scarce. The objectives of
      the cohort are to quantify the incidence and the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in this population
      of patients, to determine clinical, demographic and biological factors associated with the
      risk of infection and the severity of the disease with a Multicenter cohort of patients
      followed for 6 months during the pandemic in France with biocollection of sera and peripheral
      blood mononuclear cells.
