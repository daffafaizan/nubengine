early infantile autism and receptor processesthe syndrome of early infantile autism is examinedas a function of deviation innear-distance receptor usage.  these receptordeviations are compared with normalreceptor hierarchies developing from nearto distance receptor dominance.  theavailable information is consistent with theview that early infantile autism involvesearly sensory deprivation.  this sensorydeprivation results from an interactionbetween a constitutional deficiency inhibitingcertain reticular arousal functionsand mothering tending to understimulation.treatment of the young autistic child is suggestedincluding stimulation and communicationvia the available near receptorsystems.  in the framework of sensory development,directions for the study of earlydiagnosis and treatment are indicated.
