    
      This is a two-way crossover study consisting of 2 dosing periods assessing a test and
      reference formulation of ALXN1840. A dose-proportionality parallel group design extension
      period will be conducted following completion of the two-way crossover period of the study
      and will assess 5 different ascending doses of ALXN1840. There will be at least a 14-day
      washout following doses between Periods 1 and 2 and also at least a 14-day washout following
      the dose in Period 2 and the following dose in the Dose-Proportionality Extension Period.

      Safety will be assessed throughout the study.
