    
      This is an open label, randomized, phase 2 clinical trial of the immunogenicity of killed
      oral cholera vaccine (OCV) when the vaccine is administered to participants of three age
      cohorts (1-4 years, 5-14 years, and >14 years) and in three dose interval groups (DIGs). The
      subjects in each age cohort will be randomized to a DIG of 2 weeks (DIG-1), 6 months (DIG-2)
      or 11 months (DIG-3). A total of 180 subjects from Douala, Cameroon will be enrolled and
      these are equally divided between the different groups (20 per age/dose interval group). The
      OCV to be used in the trial is Shanchol.

      Blood samples will be collected before the first dose and at intervals following the first
      dose depending on the dosing interval group assigned. The serum (or plasma) will be tested
      for antibodies to cholera.
