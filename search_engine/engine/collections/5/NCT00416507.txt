    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with nonresectable, nonmetastatic
           adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with gemcitabine hydrochloride with vs without
           fluorouracil, cisplatin, and radiotherapy followed by gemcitabine hydrochloride.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the toxicities of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the objective response (complete, partial, or stable) in patients treated with
           these regimens.

        -  Compare the clinical benefit, in terms of general condition and weight maintenance in
           patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to WHO
      performance status (0 or 1 vs 2), initial treatment (laparotomy with or without
      bilio-digestive diversion) (yes vs no), and peritoneal cytology (positive vs negative).
      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 15 minutes on days 1-5 and 29-33 and
           fluorouracil IV continuously on days 1-40. Patients also undergo radiotherapy daily, 5
           days a week, for 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on day 1.
           Treatment repeats every 7 days for 7 weeks.

      Beginning in week 11 of arm I or week 9 of arm II, patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride
      IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 10 courses
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 190 patients will be accrued for this trial.
