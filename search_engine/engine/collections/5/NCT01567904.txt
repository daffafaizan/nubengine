        -  Screening period: up to 6 days,

        -  Treatment period: minimum 6 days and maximum 30 days,

        -  Follow-up period with an end of study visit performed 4 weeks (30 +/-2 days) post
           treatment.

      Enrollment staggered by age group starting with the older children (≥12 years). In each
      younger age group, enrolment was planned to initiate only following a review by the Data
      Monitoring Committee (DMC) of the clinical safety data and available PK and PD data from the
      first 3 out of 7 children from the previous older age group. Enrollment of infants <3 months
      was planned to initiate after recruitment of all patients ≥3 months had been completed and
      all data analyzed by the DMC.
