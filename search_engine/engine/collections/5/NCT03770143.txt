      tolerance differs between infants fed with palm olein containing or palm olein free formulas.
      Besides it is showed that palm olein containing formulas decreases the absorption of fat and
      calcium by forming insoluble calcium soaps. So it is suggested that intestinal flora might be
      affected as a reason of these specialties. This study also aimed to investigate with
      culture-independent methods whether feeding infants with palm olein free formula results in
      the modification of their intestinal microbiota in such a way that is similar to breastfed
      ones.
