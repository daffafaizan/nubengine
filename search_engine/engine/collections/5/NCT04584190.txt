      refractory to updosing four-fold antihistamine drugs and then can be improved with
      subcutaneous OMALIZUMAB. OMALIZUMAB is available for chronic urticaria since 2015. It is an
      IgG1 monoclonal antibody targeting IgE and administrated every 4 weeks which represent a cost
      of nearly 800â‚¬/month excluding nurse fees. Efficacy and good tolerance have already been
      demonstrated in real-life large cohorts of patients. A 6 months treatment duration is
      proposed before evaluating the efficacy and discontinuating the treatment in the absence of
      adequate response. Mean duration of chronic urticaria is 3 to 5 yearss with high standard
      deviations. Therefore, optimal duration of treatment with OMALIZUMAB is unknown and
      discontinuation modalities differ between physicians.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the mean duration between initiation and first
      discontinuation of OMALIZUMAB in patients treated for chronic urticaria and explore the
      different factors influencing this duration and its outcome.

      To accomplish this, the investigators will conduct a restrospective analyse of all patients
      treated with OMALIZUMAB for chronic urticaria from 2010 to 2020 in the major French hospital
      reference centers for chronic urticaria management : Paris, Lyon, Grenoble, Lille, Bordeaux,
      Nantes, Rouen, Saint-Etienne, Montpellier.
