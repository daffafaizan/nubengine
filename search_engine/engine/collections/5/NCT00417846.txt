    
      Primary Objective:

      The purpose of this study is to determine the sensitivity of the OCT in detecting conversion
      to neovascular AMD by two years in eyes at high risk for CNV, with FA serving as the gold
      standard.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value
           of the OCT in detecting conversion to neovascular AMD by two years in eyes at high risk
           for CNV, with FA serving as the gold standard.

        -  To compare the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative
           predictive value of the OCT to the PHP or the supervised Amsler Grid in subjects who had
           either negative PHP and/or negative supervised Amsler grid at baseline for detection of
           neovascular AMD by two years in eyes at high risk for CNV

        -  To describe features of false positives and false negatives with respect to baseline
           characteristics seen on PHP testing, supervised Amsler grid testing, and OCT imaging

        -  To describe the relationship between new visual symptoms experienced by participants
           prompting an interim evaluation where treatment for CNV was recommended and findings
           seen at the previous study visit (PHP testing, supervised Amsler grid testing, OCT
           imaging, other findings on exam, or fluorescein angiography) as well as findings from
           the baseline visit

        -  To determine the physician's detection of CNV development on return study visits
           including slit lamp biomicroscopy before viewing ancillary tests from that visit
           (supervised Amsler grid, PHP, OCT, fundus photographs, fluorescein angiogram)

      All participants will be examined upon enrollment and then followed every three months after
      enrollment for two years or until conversion to CNV is positive and treatment is recommended.
      Specifically, follow-up visits will occur at 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24 months from the
      date of the Initial Visit.
