      of epilepsy, however, are characterized by seizures which begin very early in childhood and
      are associated with severe intellectual and/or developmental disabilities. These conditions,
      known as progressive epileptic encephalopathies, are particularly severe and are often
      difficult to treat. These syndromes include infantile spasms, early infantile epileptic
      encephalopathy with suppression bursts (Ohtahara syndrome), malignant migrating partial
      epilepsy of infancy, early myoclonic epileptic encephalopathy, and severe myoclonic epilepsy
      of infancy (Dravet syndrome).

      The investigators' current research effort is focused on children with epileptic
      encephalopathies, in particular Ohtahara syndrome. The investigators' goal is to identify
      genetic alterations (known as "mutations") that cause Ohtahara syndrome. By doing so the
      investigators hope to improve diagnosis and treatment for this condition. It is also possible
      that understanding the genetic basis of Ohtahara syndrome may in some instances make it
      possible to prevent it from occurring in the future.
