      revascularization by thrombolysis and thrombectomy promotes neurological recovery by saving
      the area of ischemic penumbra. Progression of ischemic stroke is evaluated on multimodal
      imaging by the "mismatch ratio" between necrotized core and salvageable hypoperfused volumes.

      Migraine affects 12% of the population. Although considered as a benign condition, migraine,
      particularly with aura, is a risk factor for ischemic stroke. Based on pathophysiological
      hypothesis and the result of one study, which had several limitations, it's suggest that
      migraine might increase the sensitivity to cerebral ischemia and induce a faster infarct
      growth.

      The main objective of the study is to determine if the mismatch ratio between irreversibly
      injured and hypoperfused volumes, measured on initial imaging (MRI or CT) during acute
      ischemia due to occlusion of the middle cerebral artery or the intracranial internal carotid
      artery, varies according to the migraine status.

      A multicentric prospective cohort will be conduct, outcome study. The initial multimodal
      imaging (MRI or CT) will be acquired routinely using a harmonized protocol in any patient
      suspected of an acute stroke. All consecutive patients eligible to the study will be included
      within 7 days of their initial admission, and evaluated with a short questionnaire
      classifying them as "migrainers" whose status will undergo a detailed validation at 3 months
      by a migraine expert, and "non-migrainers" whose status will be validated by repeating the
      short questionnaire at the follow-up visit at 3 months. All radiological data will be
      analyzed centrally after the end of the recruitment, by investigators blinded to the migraine
      status.
