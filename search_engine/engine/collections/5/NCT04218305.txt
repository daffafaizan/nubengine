      divided into four groups:

      The first group: include twenty subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus The second group:
      include twenty obese subjects whose body mass index is 30 or over The third group: include
      twenty obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus The fourth group includes twenty
      apparently healthy subjects as control.

      In this study, we concluded that:

        1. Serum fetuin-A can be used as a biomarker and independent risk factor and marker for
           diagnosis of DM and DM has a detrimental effect on serum fetuin-A fetuin-A could be of
           relevance for the development of insulin resistance

        2. Higher fetuin-A concentrations were associated with type 2 diabetes and insulin
           resistance

        3. Increased serum fetuin-A levels constitute an independent marker of lipid profile.

        4. fetuin-A may play a role in the pathogenesis of T2DM.

        5. The inhibition of insulin receptor by fetuin-A may lead to increased lipolysis and
           efflux of free fatty acids from adipose tissue. This could explain associated
           dyslipidemia observed in type 2 diabetic patients in the present study.

      Finally, our finding that high plasma fetuin-A levels predict the incidence of type 2
      diabetes independently of other established risk factors supports the hypothesis that
      fetuin-A may play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes.
