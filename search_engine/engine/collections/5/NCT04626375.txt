    
      The patients will be recruited at the Hypertension research center of Federico II university
      hospital.

      The overall duration of the study will be 4 weeks for each participant. Blood pressure, heart
      rate, echocardiogram and blood sample will be collected for each patients at randomization
      and after 4 weeks of treatment.

      Patients will be randomized to receive bioarginine (2 vials per os of 1.66 g every 12 hours)
      or placebo (2 vials per os without active substance every 12 hours). Before the start of
      treatment, patients will receive a peripheral venous blood sample (10-12 ml), which will be
      identified through the use of an alphanumeric code (PRE-XXXYYY). In addition, patients will
      undergo full echocardiographic examination (the parameters will be reported in a
      password-protected database, using the same identification codes used for blood sampling).
      The duration of the treatment will be 4 weeks. At the end of the treatment, the patients will
      receive a peripheral venous blood sample (10-12 ml) which will be identified through the use
      of an alphanumeric code (POST-XXXYYY) and full echocardiographic examination. All L-arginine
      and placebo, made up of the L-arginine vehicle without the active substance, will be offered
      free of charge by the Farmaecutici DAMOR company.
