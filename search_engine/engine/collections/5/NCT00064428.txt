      study of fondaparinux vs. control in patients with STEMI randomized within 24 hours of the
      onset of symptoms. Patients with confirmed STEMI were assigned into one of the following
      strata, based on local preference:

      Stratum 1: No indication for UFH; it is generally accepted that patients receiving
      streptokinase or those not receiving a thrombolytic agent were assigned to this stratum.

      Stratum 2: Indication for UFH; it is generally accepted that patients receiving a
      fibrin-specific agent (such as alteplase, reteplase or tenecteplase) or those undergoing
      primary PCI were assigned to this stratum.

      Patients who were ineligible for fibrinolysis (e.g. because of late presentation or absolute
      contra-indication for reperfusion therapy) may fall into either stratum 1 or stratum 2 at
      investigator's discretion. Following allocation to one of the strata, patients were
      randomized to fondaparinux or control treatment. Control treatment was dependent on whether
      the patient was assigned to stratum 1 or stratum 2:

      Stratum 1: fondaparinux sc* versus fondaparinux-placebo sc for 8 days or until hospital
      discharge, whichever was earlier.

      Stratum 2: fondaparinux sc* for 8 days or until hospital discharge, whichever was earlier and
      UFH-placebo for 24 to 48 hrs (or single bolus injection immediately prior to procedure in
      case of primary PCI) versus UFH for 24 to 48 hrs (or single bolus injection immediately prior
      to procedure in case of primary PCI) and fondaparinux-placebo for 8 days or until hospital
      discharge, whichever was earlier.

      (*First dose intravenous bolus) Patients were followed up for 6 months
