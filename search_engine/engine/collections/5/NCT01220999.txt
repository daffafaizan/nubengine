    
      Eligible subjects were to be enrolled into one of 5 dose-escalation cohorts to receive
      CS-1008 administered weekly as an intravenous (IV) infusion over 30 Â± 10 minutes. Each cohort
      initially comprised 2 subjects but was expanded in up to 5 subjects if additional
      biodistribution and/or PK data were required.

      The initial infusion of CS-1008 on Day 1 was trace labeled with Indium-111 (111^In-CS-1008;
      5-7 mCi) and was investigated at escalating doses up to the standard loading dose, as
      follows: Cohort 1 (0.2 mg/kg), Cohort 2 (1 mg/kg), Cohort 3 (2 mg/kg), Cohort 4 (4 mg/kg),
      and Cohort 5 (6 mg/kg). The initial 111^In-CS-1008 dose was followed by gamma camera imaging
      with blood sampling over a 10-day period to evaluate biodistribution, tumor uptake, PK, and
      serum biomarkers. Day 8 dosing comprised non-labeled CS-1008 at doses of 6 mg/kg in Cohorts
      1-3, 4 mg/kg in Cohort 4, and 2 mg/kg in Cohort 5. Subsequent weekly infusions of standard
      dose CS-1008 (2 mg/kg) were administered on Days 15, 22, 29, 36, and 43. The Day 36 infusion
      of CS-1008 was also trace labeled with 111^In (5-7 mCi), with subsequent gamma camera imaging
      and blood sampling.

      Subjects were assessed for disease status using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version 1.1, serum tumor biomarkers (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA]), and
      human-anti-CS-1008-antibody development (HAHA). Subjects were assessed for changes in tumor
      metabolism following CS-1008 administration using computed tomography (CT) or
      fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (18^F-FDG PET) scans.

      Cycle 1 encompassed the first 7 weeks of therapy. Within 1 week (Days 44-50) after the last
      infusion of CS-1008, subjects completed an End of Study/End of Cycle 1 assessment. Subjects
      with stable disease or better (according to RECIST version 1.1) at the Day 44-50 reassessment
      were permitted to receive additional 4-week cycles of CS-1008 (2 mg/kg) until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or subject/physician decision.
