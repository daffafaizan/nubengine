      osteoarthritis (OA). OA is a chronic degenerative disease accompanied by a constant pain that
      often leads to changes in the mood of patients. Over the last few decades, numerous articles
      reported various beneficial effects of sulfur water and peloid therapeutic applications.
      Serotonin is one of the important neurotransmitters that have numerous functions such as
      regulation of body temperature, sleep, appetite, while its main function is reflected in
      controling of depression.

      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of sulfur bath and mud therapy on serotonin
      levels and other biochemical parameters in the blood of the OA patients, as well as whether
      the application of exercise in water effects the results we receive.

      Randomized controlled study included patients with hip and/or knee OA both sexes, randomized
      into two groups. The first group patients underwent sulfur balneotherapy and mud pack
      therapy. Patients in the second group had sulfur balneotherapy, mud pack therapy and exercise
      in hygienic water. The duration of spa therapy program was 12 days. Serotonin values,
      parameters of complete blood count, lipid status and inflammatory markers were analyzed
      before and after the therapy.

      This study is expected to be another contribution to existing evidence and shed light on the
      mechanisms of beneficial effects of balneotherapy and mud therapy and whether addition
      underwater exercise would have extra therapeutic effects.
