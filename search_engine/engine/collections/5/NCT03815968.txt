      amount of amniotic fluid.

      Some articles have shown an increase in amniotic fluid volume as a result of maternal
      hydration during pregnancy through intravenous fluid infusions and oral fluid intake, the
      increase was evident in women with amniotic fluid and women with normal amniotic fluid
      volume. In a mechanism similar to that of liquid hydration, a low-salt diet may lead to an
      increase in the volume of amniotic fluid.

      The investigators would like to examine whether a low-salt diet in women with amniotic fluid
      is able to significantly increase the amount of amniotic fluid compared with a regular diet.
