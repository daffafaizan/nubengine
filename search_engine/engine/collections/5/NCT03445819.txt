    
      Patients with a displaced patellar fracture who meet the inclusion criteria and provide
      consent will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms. One group (Group A) will receive
      standardized non-operative treatment with immediate weight-bearing as tolerated in a knee
      immobilizer and early ROM exercises begun at 2 weeks post injury. The other group (Group B)
      will receive ORIF of their displaced patellar fracture with a standardized post-operative
      protocol.

      Post-operative rehabilitation will be standardized across both groups. Patients will be
      weight bearing as tolerated immediately in a removable knee immobilizer, with progressive
      range-of-motion exercises begun at two weeks following surgery or randomization. The knee
      immobilizer will be used full-time (with the exception of removal for physiotherapy and
      bathing) for 6 weeks after surgery or randomization. At six weeks post-treatment, patients
      will be allowed to perform active extension and will initiate progressive strengthening
      exercises of the extensor mechanism.
