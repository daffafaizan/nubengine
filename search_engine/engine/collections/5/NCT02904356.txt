      psychiatric disorders in the US. The first line of treatment for OCD comprises
      pharmacotherapy with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT). Although adherence to these therapies has been shown to improve symptoms in at least
      half of patients, some have residual symptoms and a small percentage are refractory to
      standard therapies. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may offer an alternate,
      less-invasive therapy.
