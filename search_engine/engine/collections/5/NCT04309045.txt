      empirically-based treatments for BPD: dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) and dynamic
      deconstructive psychotherapy (DDP). Sixty-eight participants with BPD will be randomized to
      each of two treatment groups. Participants and therapists will be recruited from the Shalvata
      MHC, a 139-bed psychiatric institution with outpatient units serving a population of more
      than 600,000 people in Israel. A blinded research assistant will administer primary and
      secondary outcome measures every 3 months during the 12 months of treatment and at the end of
      the 6-month naturalistic follow-up period after ending treatment with DDP or DBT. Therapist
      adherence will be systematically assessed in both treatments for 10% of sessions. Primary
      outcome measure will be comprised of the Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), as
      assessed by estimating the healthcare utilization costs per incremental improvement in
      suicide severity. Secondary outcome measures will include BPD and depression symptom severity
      and quality of life. This study was submitted to the institutional review board of the
      Shalvata MHC in November 2019, and is expected to be approved by late Janury 2020.
