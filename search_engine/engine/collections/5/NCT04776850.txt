    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate event-free survival (EFS) at 2-years post HCT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess event-free survival (EFS) at 100 days and 1 year post HCT. II. Assess overall
      survival (OS) at 100 days and 1 year post HCT. III. 30-day transplant-related mortality
      (TRM). IV. Time to platelet and neutrophil engraftment. V. Rate of graft failure (primary and
      secondary) through day 100. VI. Incidence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) by day
      100. VII. Incidence of chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) by 1 year and 2 years.

      VIII. Rate of grade II or greater organ toxicity through day 100. IX. Incidence of hepatic
      sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (SOS) by day 100. X. Incidence of central nervous system
      (CNS) toxicities including posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) by day 100.

      XI. Incidence of infectious complications through day 100.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Effect of HCT on clinical and laboratory manifestations of hemoglobinopathies by 1 and 2
      years after HCT.

      II. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of busulfan and thymoglobulin to better understand
      post-transplant outcomes.

      III. Assess immune reconstitution kinetics post HCT.

      OUTLINE:

      DONOR-SPECIFIC ANTI-HLA DESENSITIZATION: Patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibody
      titers >= 1:3,000 at the start of PTIS receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on days -69, -41,
      -28, and -13 and bortezomib IV over less than 1 minute on days -68, -65, -40, and -37 in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibody titers >
      1:15,000 at the start of PTIS receive receive rituximab IV on days -69, -41, -28, and -13 and
      bortezomib IV over less than 1 minute on days -68, -65, -62, -58, -40, -37, -34, and -31 in
      the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients with donor-specific anti-HLA antibody titers >
      1:5,000 at the start of conditioning may also undergo plasmapheresis on day -12.

      PTIS: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate (fludarabine) IV over 1 hour and dexamethasone
      IV over less than 1 minute on days -68 to -64 and days -40 to -36 in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      CONDITIONING: Patients receive lapine T-lymphocyte immune globulin (rATG) IV over 4-6 hours
      on days -12 to -10, fludarabine phosphate IV over 1 hour on days -8 to -4, and busulfan IV
      over 2 hours on days -7 to -4 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo HCT on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2-3 hours on days 3 and 4 in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity. Beginning on day 5, patients also receive tacrolimus IV
      continuously daily and then orally (PO) twice daily (BID) at the discretion of the treating
      physician for up to 12 months, and mycophenolate mofetil IV or PO BID up to day 60 in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of HCT, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 years.
