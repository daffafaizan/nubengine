      novel immunotherapy for the treatment of advanced melanoma. This study will explore the
      combination of encorafenib plus binimetinib with the PD-1 antibody pembrolizumab in patients
      with BRAF mutant melanoma. Combination of two clinically effective approaches, targeting the
      mutant BRAF pathway by BRAF/MEK inhibition and modulating immunological checkpoint control by
      administration of a PD-1 antibody, should prolong PFS and OS even further. This study will
      investigate the influence of maintenance therapy on PFS and OS after triple therapy. Patients
      with disease control after 6 months of triple therapy will be randomized to receive 2
      different maintenance therapies further on to investigate if administration of pembrolizumab
      only is sufficient for maintenance of disease control. For reasons of safety a phase I study
      is performed to determine the optimal dosing and schedule of the combination therapy
      (encorafenib, binimetinib, pembrolizumab).

      In the phase II-part, patient will receive triple therapy with the doses defined in phase I
      for a 6 months induction period. Patients with complete or partial response or stable disease
      after the 6 months period will be randomized for maintenance therapy:

      Arm A: Therapy as in induction period. Arm B: Therapy with pembrolizumab only with a dose of
      200 mg every 3 weeks.
