      January 2017 and who received at least 2 LOTs. The data will be collected retrospectively
      from the date of diagnosis of unresectable or mBC (index date) to the end of follow-up (ie,
      until death, the last medical record entry, or date of data extraction, whichever is
      earlier). The study will not have any study-specific patient visits or a longitudinal
      follow-up. All available data will be extracted from patients' medical records after
      obtaining an informed consent at one time. The informed consent may be obtained at the time
      of patients routine clinical care visit to the oncology centre. The data on different types
      of treatment received by the patients, socio-demographics, and clinico-pathological
      characteristics will be extracted from patients medical records.

      The study will be implemented at approximately 80 to 100 oncology centres spanning across 7
      countries in the AstraZeneca (AZ) International Region (ie, non-US, non-European countries).

      Two cohorts are planned to account for different study timelines. Cohort 1 will include all
      patients recruited outside China, including Australia, Brazil, Singapore, Taiwan, Korea, and
      Hong Kong special administrative region (SAR) (approximately 780 patients), and Cohort 2 will
      include patients from all countries including China (approximately 1280 patients).
