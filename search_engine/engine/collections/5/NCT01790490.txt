      three counter-balanced infusions (two doses of ketamine and a dose of lorazepam) on three
      separate days in a within-subject, double-blind, controlled design. Of the various glutamate
      antagonists available for human use, ketamine will be utilized because its safety profile,
      pharmacokinetics, and range of tolerable sub-anesthetic dosings have been very well studied.
      Also, ketamine has shown promise in managing opiate and alcohol use disorders in certain
      studies, and may therefore be the most likely glutamate antagonist to dampen cue reactivity
      and increase motivation in cocaine users. If ketamine significantly improves these deficits,
      this would suggest that the drug should be investigated further for potential utility as a
      treatment for cocaine dependence.
