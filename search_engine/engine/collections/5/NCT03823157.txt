      immune system. Emerging studies have shown endocannabinoid plays a role in appetite, pain
      sensation, control of chronic pain, macronutrient metabolism, mood/mood disorder, and
      regulation of immune cell functions. Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise has shown to
      increase circulatory endocannabinoids. Moderate-intensity exercise improves cognition,
      memory, and wellbeing in adults. Exercisers experience decreased tension, depression, and
      anger. Therefore, these findings in humans suggest a likely relationship for exercise
      effecting well-being via ECS. In this study, we will study Tai Chi, a mind-body
      moderate-intensity exercise, intervention for its effects on ECS in women. A pre-post design
      trial will be conducted on 15 qualified subjects. All subjects will be assigned to Tai Chi
      group for one week including 3 sessions, 60 minutes per session, on 3 non-consecutive days.
      We will measure plasma eCB levels at baseline, before and after 4th session of Tai Chi. All
      data will be analyzed statistically at p<0.05.
