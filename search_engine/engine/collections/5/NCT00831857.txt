    
      -  To explore if 89Zr-bevacizumab PET imaging can differentiate RCC patients with
           progressive disease from patients with non-progressive disease during treatment with
           sunitinib or bevacizumab plus interferon.

        -  To explore relationships between VEGF pathway related biomarkers and 89Zr-bevacizumab
           PET response.

        -  To explore effect of 2 weeks off treatment in the sunitinib arm on pharmacodynamic
           biomarkers and 89Zr-bevacizumab PET response.
