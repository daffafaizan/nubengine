      postoperative pain levels following an ACL reconstruction. There is a lack of consensus in
      the area of postoperative knee bracing/immobilization. A survey of Canadian surgeons
      indicates that the primary reason for postoperative knee immobilization is to reduce pain. To
      the investigators' knowledge, there are no studies comparing the use of immediate (0-48
      hours) postoperative knee immobilization versus no immobilization and pain control in this
      patient population.
