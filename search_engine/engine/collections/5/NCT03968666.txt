    
      After approval by the Institutional Review Board, the investigators plan to retrospectively
      study gynecological patients who underwent ERAS protocol at Augusta University Medical Center
      between January 2017 and February 2019.

      This is a retrospective observational study to evaluate the outcomes of patients who had ERAS
      protocol during their surgery.

      Demographic and outcome variables will be obtained from the institutional health
      documentation system. The investigators will collect demographic variables (age, ASA status),
      morphometric measurements (body mass index), time from enrollment to ERAS protocol,
      hospitalization length of stay, and readmission rate. The investigators will also record the
      documentation of the ERAS protocol interventions against the ERAS protocol approved by the
      institution. The investigators will assess the effect of the degree of compliance on outcome
      variables.
