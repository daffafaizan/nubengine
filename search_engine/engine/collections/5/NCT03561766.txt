      disease in a person's life. Many adult chronic diseases, such as diabetes, cardiovascular and
      cerebrovascular diseases, all come from the exposure of negative environmental and behavioral
      factors during this period. By collecting the lifestyle data and clinical data of pregnant
      women at different periods, the appropriate indicators are anticipated to be selected to
      predict and evaluate the outcome of pregnancy and the health of the mothers and children in
      the long term. The status of overweight and obesity of children in Shenyang and its
      surrounding areas are anticipated to be analyzed by descriptive and etiological analysis
      through collecting the lifestyle data and clinical data of different periods of pregnant
      women and the lifestyle data of different developmental stages of children.
