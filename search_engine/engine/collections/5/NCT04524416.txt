      5 years post-implantation. Patients who received implant and were followed for 2 years in a
      previous study, will be invited to continue long-term follow-up from 2 to 5 years
      post-implantation at annual intervals. Standard ophthalmologic assessments including
      measurement of intraocular pressure, fundus examination, ocular imaging, assessment of any
      untoward ocular events etc. will be performed.
