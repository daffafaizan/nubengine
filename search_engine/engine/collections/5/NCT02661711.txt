    
      This is a 17 month phase II therapeutic exploratory trial in Cystoid Macular Oedema (CMO)
      with underlying Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). The study design is a prospective, open-label,
      interventional non-randomised trial. All patients enrolled in the study will receive
      intravitreal injections of Aflibercept (Eylea).

      There will be a 9 month recruitment window and patient participation will be for 12 months;
      30 patients aged 16 years or older presenting in the Medical Retina and Genetics clinics at
      Moorfields Eye Hospital with Cystoid Macula Oedema (CMO) with underlying Retinitis Pigmentosa
      (RP) will be approached by the study team to discuss participation in the AMOUR study and be
      given a patient information leaflet. If patients decide to participate in the study they will
      be invited to the NIHR Moorfields Clinical Research Facility for a baseline screening where
      written informed consent will be given by the patient and various assessments will be
      performed to confirm eligibility.

      Patients enrolled in the study will receive intravitreal injections of 2mg of 40mg/ml of
      Aflibercept (Eylea) solution in the study eye. In the first three months, patients will
      receive a loading dose of Aflibercept (Eylea) with one injection every four weeks. After the
      first three months, treatment frequency will follow a treat and extend protocol for up to 12
      months from date of study enrolment. Extension from 4 weekly to 6,8,10 and 12 week follow up
      will occur when there is no further reduction in macula fluid compared to the previous visit.
      Patients will receive a minimum of 5 injections before being deemed as non-responders to
      treatment.

      Imaging and assessments such as optical coherence tomography imaging, microperimetry and
      visual acuity will be used to assess response to treatment.
