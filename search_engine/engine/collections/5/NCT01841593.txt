      informed consent, in a phase I, open-label, cross-over, PK study (approved by Westminster
      Research Ethics Committee and UK Regulatory Authorities; Eudra number 2012-005400-18).

      Subjects are randomized to receive either raltegravir 400mg twice-daily (seven days),
      followed by raltegravir 400mg twice-daily plus amlodipine 5mg once-daily (seven days),
      followed by amlodipine 5mg once-daily alone (seven days), or the same treatments in the
      opposite order, in the fasted state (at least eight hours) with 240mL of water.

      Intensive PK sampling and safety laboratory analysis are performed at the end of each phase
      (Days 7, 14 and 21). Raltegravir and amlodipine plasma concentrations will be analysed by a
      validated liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method.

      PK parameters are determined by non-compartmental methods [WinNonlin Phoenix (version 6.1;
      Pharsight Corp, Mountain View, CA, USA]. These are the concentrations measured 12 and 24
      hours post-dose (C12h, C24h) for raltegravir and amlodipine, respectively; the maximum
      concentration (Cmax); and the area under the curve over 12 and 24 hours (AUC12h, AUC24h) for
      raltegravir and amlodipine, respectively.
