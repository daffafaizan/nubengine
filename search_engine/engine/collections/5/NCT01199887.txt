      tolerance. With the identification of the specific antigen involved in the autoimmune disease
      process in IPF, IW001 induced oral tolerance may be an effective treatment. IW001 is taken
      orally, introduced into the mucosal immune system at the Peyer's Patches in the distal small
      intestine, where antigen-presenting cells present the antigen to regulatory T cells (Tregs).
      These antigen-specific Tregs enter the blood stream and traffic to areas where the specific
      antigen has generated an autoimmune response. Thus, IW001 may produce selective suppression
      of immune responses against Col (V).
