      patients to reduce anxiety by the FDA. This study involves the use of CES Alpha-Stim device
      applied to the patient 30 minutes before and through-out cataract surgery procedure and then
      to measure the level of anxiety and discomfort by using a visual analog scale (VAS). We
      propose that by applying the device the patients will be able to have markedly less level of
      anxiety and discomfort before and during the surgery and will ultimately avoid the
      traditional use of sedative or analgesic drugs being used for these kinds of surgery.
