    
      Subjects aged 18-70 years, who attended the Department of Endocrinology and Nutrition of the
      Clínica Universidad de Navarra from 2009-2014 for a check-up were offered to participate in
      the DICAMANO study. 853 subjects agreed to take part. Only those individuals with a normal
      fasting glucose level (≤5.5 mmol l-1) were analysed. Subjects with T2DM or severe renal,
      liver or thyroid dysfunction were excluded. Participants were instructed to temporarily
      discontinue for 48 hours any medication known to affect glucose or lipid metabolism. On the
      day of the study visit, each subject had a complete routine clinical assessment to evaluate
      the presence of cardiovascular, respiratory, renal or endocrine disorders. All patients
      underwent a 75-g OGTT with a concomitant anthropometric study, blood pressure monitoring and
      lipid profile analyses. They were classified by glucose tolerance on the basis of blood
      glucose levels according to ADA diagnostic criteria for T2DM (2017). Carbohydrate intolerance
      was defined as a 2-hOGTT glucose level ≥7.8 mmol l-1 (mg dl-1). Body composition, visceral
      adipose tissue, anthropometry study, OGTT-based parameters and cardiovascular risk factors
      are measured.
