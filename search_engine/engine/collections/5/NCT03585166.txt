      This study was divided into laparoscopic hepatectomy (observation group) and laparoscopic
      hepatectomy (control group).Compared two groups of age, sex, body mass index (BMI), tumor
      diameter, number of tumors (single/multiple), pathologic characteristics, HBsAg
      (positive/negative), liver function, AFP, Child - Pugh, grading, nursing method and
      comparison of two groups of patients after surgery (surgical incision length, intraoperative
      blood, intraoperative blood transfusion and transfusion volume, operation time) the number of
      cases of and postoperative rehabilitation (death cases, for the first time the meal time,
      anus exhaust time, analgesic bed, first time, the abdominal cavity drainage tube time, length
      of hospital stay, postoperative days and liver function index.Follow-up: the survival rates
      of the two groups were compared in six months, one year, two years, three years and five
      years.In this study, the initial selection of the minimum sample size of 30 cases, plus 20%
      inefficiencies, the final initial selection of 36 cases, and the later expansion of the
      sample size of 100 cases.

      Statistical methods: by means of SPSS 23.0 to analyze the data, all data after the normal
      test to choose the appropriate statistical methods, the normal distribution of measurement
      data in the two groups use surgery and postoperative recovery using two sets of samples t
      test, liver function index using analysis of variance, non-normal distribution using
      nonparametric test, count data chi-square test, P < 0.05 for the difference was statistically
      significant.Survival analysis was performed on two groups of patients.The research date
      starts on October 1, 2017.
