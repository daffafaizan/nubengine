      acquired including epigastric, umbilical and incisional hernia. Incisional ventral hernia is
      a frequent complication of laparotomy that occurs in up to 11 % of surgical abdominal wounds

      Umbilical hernia represent a common surgical problem in cirrhotic patient with ascites with
      20% incidence.Factors that play role in occurance of umbilical hernia in cirrhotic patient
      with ascites patients is chronic increased intra-abdominal pressure, recanalization of the
      left umbilical vein, muscle wasting and fascial weakening from nutritional deficiencies
      (3,4).

      Most of interventions for umbilical herniorrhaphy in cirrhotic patients with ascites done in
      emergency setting due to the concept of high perioperative morbidity and mortality rates in
      those patients. However, this strategy leads to a high risk of life-threatening complications
      such as incarceration and skin rupture.
