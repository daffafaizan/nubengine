      competences through an application that can be used in mobile devices and tablets.The program
      is based on a space adventure, and provides reinforcement through score points and more time
      for the additional games. The duration of the program is 8 weeks.

      The emoTIC 8 version is designed so that teachers can easily carry it out in their
      classrooms. The application consists of application-guided activities that are put into
      practice in class, and includes other exercises that are meant to be carried out at home. The
      activities that are designed to be carried out during school hours are named "missions", and
      the exercises the students will do at home are called "trainings". Both are essential to
      adequately conduct the intervention.

      The emoTIC SPACE version is designed so that it is carried out autonomously at home, through
      application-guided activities. This version includes 8 activities for each of the 4 areas.
