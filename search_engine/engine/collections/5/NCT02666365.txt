      for this study. Once identified, the surgical team will approach the participant for consent
      and inclusion in the study. On the day of surgery, the subjects will be assigned to either
      the Bolus Group (CB) or Continuous Infusion Group (CI) according to a randomly generated
      assignment procedure. During the procedure, the dose of prophylactic Cefazolin will be given
      an hour before surgery and will be administered in accordance to group assignment. Subjects
      in the CB will receive bolus infusions of Cefazolin every 4 hours till the end of surgery.
      Subjects in the CI group will receive an initial bolus injection of Cefazolin followed by a
      continuous infusion till the closure of skin incision. Blood samples will be taken during
      surgery at t=0, 15, 30 and 60 minutes and every hour following till the end of surgery or 6
      hours (whichever comes sooner)
