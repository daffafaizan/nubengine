      Idarubicin and Cytarabine combination therapy is a standard treatment for patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML). Lenalidomide is FDA approved to retreat patients with Multiple
      Myeloma or Myelodysplastic syndrome with a specific change in their DNA. Loss of a specific
      part of DNA is also seen in some patients with AML.

      This is a phase 1/2, dose-escalation trial of Lenalidomide given in combination with
      idarubicin + cytarabine. During phase 1, we will enroll patients with AML involving del 5q31;
      2) patients with MDS RAEB-2 associated with monosomy 5 or segmental deletion involving 5q31,
      either alone or with additional cytogenetic abnormalities, and 3) older patients with any
      type of karyotypic profile in whom an effective and reliable standard of care remains to be
      developed. All 3 groups of patients define a population of patients with very poor prognoses.
      Dose escalation of lenalidomide will use a standard 3x3 design. Dose escalation of
      Lenalidomide only will take place, while the doses of idarubicin and cytarabine will be
      constant. This trial will have an induction component, consolidation component, and
      maintenance component. Overall safety and MTD will be determined from the induction phase
      only.

      During phase 2, we will enroll only patients with AML age â‰¥ 60 years. During phase 2, the
      efficacy of this combination of Lenalidomide + idarubicin + cytarabine, at the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) for Lenalidomide (determined during phase 1), will be tested.
