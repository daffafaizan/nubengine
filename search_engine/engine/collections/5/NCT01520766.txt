      abutment teeth is higher. Endodontically treated teeth are more prone to fracture due to the
      higher amount of calcified tooth structure loss. To level the biological short coming the
      choice of the mechanically appropriate post material is still a major concern. There a two
      major approaches. One is to use a rigid material to stiffen the post-endodontic complex and
      the other is to use a material which shows dentin-like material properties to allow the
      post-endodontic complex to flex under load. It was aim of the presented randomised controlled
      trial to compare the survival rates of abutment teeth self-adhesively restored with either
      prefabricated glass-fiber reinforced composite posts or titanium posts.

      The null-hypothesis was that there is no difference regarding survival rate between
      glass-fiber and titanium post restored endodontically treated abutment teeth with two or less
      remaining cavity walls.
