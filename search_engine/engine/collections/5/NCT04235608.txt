    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To assess the efficacy of a sedation with inhaled sevoflurane in improving in reducing
      mortality and morbidity in patients with moderate-severe ARDS in comparison to a control
      group receiving intravenous sedation with propofol.

      PRIMAY HYPOTHESIS:

      Inhaled sedation with sevoflurane will improve a composite outcome of mortality and time off
      the ventilator at 28 days, in patients with moderate-severe ARDS.

      The trial will accrue a maximum of 700 patients. Patients will be recruited from
      participating intensive care units and randomized to the active (inhaled sevoflurane) or
      control (intravenous propofol).

      The overall strategy is to screen and enroll early, every newly intubated, acutely ill or
      postoperative, patient at each site, using clinically obtained pulse oximetry and blood
      gases.

      By providing superior awakening and extubation times, as well as lung-protective effects from
      anti-inflammatory and protective effects from epithelial injury, inhaled sevoflurane may
      hasten recovery from lung injury and improve outcomes.
