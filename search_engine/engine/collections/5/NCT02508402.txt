    
      METHODS:

      This retrospective clinical trial was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics and
      Gynecology, Faculty of Medicine, Cairo University, during the period from August 2014 to May
      2015. The study protocol was approved by the Scientific Research Committee, and informed
      consent was obtained from all participants.

      Each participant will randomly be assigned by computer list into Group I (Dexamethasone
      group(n=43)and group II(control group(N=43).

      No cervical ripening agent will be used for induction of labour in the trial.

      Methodology in details:

      I. The participant of Dexamethasone Group will receive a prefilled syringe with two
      milliliters (8 mg) of Dexamethasone intramuscular, and the participants of placebo Group will
      not receive Dexamethasone or any other cervical ripening agent.

      All the participants in both groups will randomly be assigned by computer list. (Haijavandi
      et., al 2013)

      II. After six hours of the initial dose, the labour induction will start via Oxytocin using
      the following protocol:

        1. Initial dose of oxytocin.................................. 1 to 2 milliliter
           international unit/min.

        2. Increase interval......................................................30 minutes.

        3. Dosage increment....................................................1 to 2 milliliter
           international unit/min.

        4. Usual dose for good labour.........................8 to12 milliliter international
           unit/min.

        5. Maximum dose…………………...................30 milliliter international unit/min. (Anne
           Biringer et., al 2013).

      III. The interval between the initiation of induction and the beginning of the active phase
      of labour is recorded (a cervical dilatation of 4 cm plus 3 forceful contractions over a
      10-minute span each last from 40-60 Sec).

      IV. Partographic representation for progression of active phase labour:

        1. Frequency and duration of uterine contraction.

        2. Cervical dilatation will record every two hours by per vaginal examination.

        3. Station and position of fetal head was noted at the same time.

      V. After delivery:-

        1. The duration of the first stage of labor will be recorded. (Partographic representation
           will do for each participant).

        2. The duration of the second stage of labor will be recorded.

        3. The duration of the placental separation will be recorded.

        4. The neonatal outcome will be recorded by APGAR score.

        5. Any postpartum maternal adverse effect was noted (e.g. vital sign abnormality, any
           maternal postpartum hemorrhage).

      Primary outcome:

      the duration between induction and beginning of active phase.

      Secondary outcome:

      -Duration of first stage.
