      Sensitivity Treatment (CAST) program in an online RCT through Amazon's Mechanical Turk with
      Veterans and military personnel. The primary outcome variables will be traumatic stress,
      anxiety, and depressive symptoms. The study is being conducted at Florida State University.

      Specific Aims: (1) Evaluate the efficacy of the CAST program delivered over the Internet
      among Veterans and military personnel; (2) Assess acceptability and usability of the CAST
      program delivered over the Internet without in person appointments; (3) Determine the
      feasibility of using Amazon's Mechanical Turk to recruit and conduct a fully online
      randomized controlled trial of a computerized treatment.

      Veterans or active duty personnel (N = 100) who are at increased risk for mental health
      problems, as indicated by elevated anxiety sensitivity, will be recruited through Amazon's
      Mechanical Turk. Mechanical Turk is an online marketplace for individuals interested in
      completing computerized tasks, such as research surveys, for compensation. Participants will
      complete self-report symptom measures before and after the intervention as well as at a
      4-month follow-up appointment. The intervention is a single session and lasts approximately
      45 minutes. The intervention contains educational material to dispel commonly held false
      beliefs about the dangerousness of experiencing anxiety symptoms, for example elevated heart
      rate or a difficulty concentrating. Then participants are guided through an exercise designed
      to bring on these uncomfortable bodily sensations to help participants reduce the amount of
      distress these symptoms cause. Participants will also be asked to provide feedback related to
      acceptability and usability of the intervention.
