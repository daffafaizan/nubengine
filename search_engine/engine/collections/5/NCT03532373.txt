      CTS with the tool compared to 150 patients being evaluated for CTS with standard care. Those
      patients randomized to receiving the tool will use it to identify their preferences for
      certain attributes of care. Patients will then be presented with their preference data and
      the surgeon will have a discussion with the patient regarding CTS. Surgeons will have their
      standard discussion with the patients randomized to the standard care group (no tool). The
      tool will be operationalized on a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act
      compliant data platform, such as Qualtrics, and no identifiable data will be collected.
      De-identified data will be shared from study cites with our team at Stanford. This data will
      be backed up on a computer encrypted by Stanford.
