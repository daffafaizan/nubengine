      malignant brain gliomas randomized to radiotherapy alone vs. radiotherapy plus
      radiosensitization with mitolactol (DBD) followed by DBD and carmustine.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Group I: Radiotherapy. External-beam cranial irradiation with
      megavoltage equipment. Group II: Radiotherapy with Radiosensitization followed by Maintenance
      Chemotherapy. Radiotherapy as in Group I; with Mitolactol, DBD, NSC-104800; followed by DBD;
      Carmustine, BCNU, NSC-409962.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 212 patients will be entered over more than 3 years.
