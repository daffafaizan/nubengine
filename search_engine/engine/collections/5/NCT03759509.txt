      biological clock and the environment, i.e., circadian rhythms, is disrupted, resulting in
      insufficient sleep and insomnia. Shift work in nursing has been found to result in sleep
      disruption and sleep deprivation, and in sleepiness or fatigue at work. Slow reaction,
      insufficient attention and poor judgement often come with increased fatigue, which
      contributes to a high risk of accident and patient safety. Studies have shown that aerobic
      exercise is helpful in promoting high sleep quality, whereas few researchers have argued over
      how aerobic exercise training improves sleep quality in nurses. The study is conducted in two
      stages. Previous stage, we conducted with a cross-sectional study design with convenience
      sampled 200 participants to fill out the Chinese Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (CPSQI)
      questionnaire for screen the low sleep quality (CPSQI > 5) participants. A total of 200
      nurses were recruited, and 199 valid samples were collected, 108 participants were found to
      have low sleep quality (CPSQI > 5). The study will adopt a prospective, longitudinal,
      parallel-group comparative study, randomly sample from previously screen low sleep quality
      participants, then random assign to experimental (aerobic exercise) and control (routine
      activity) groups, and actigraphy sleep recording, saliva samples and attention data will be
      collected.

      The study aims to investigate the effects of aerobic exercise training on nurses' sleep
      quality, fatigue, attention and cortisol profile. The findings of the study could provide
      guidelines on improving nurses' fitness and sleep quality.
