    
      The investigators hypothesize that participants receiving the Heart Failure and Diabetes
      (HF-DM) self-care intervention will report greater Health Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) on
      the Minnesota Living with HF Questionnaire (MLHFQ), the Audit of Diabetes-dependent Quality
      of Life (ADDQoL), and the EuroQol (EQ5D) than the Usual Care (UC-AC) group at 6 months when
      controlling for age, gender, and NYHA Class.

      Secondly, that participants receiving the Heart Failure and Diabetes (HF-DM) self-care
      intervention will demonstrate improved physical function indicators (BNP levels, HgA1c, and
      6MWT) at 6 months over the UC-AC group when controlling for age, gender, BMI, and NYHA Class
      and comorbid conditions.

      Thirdly, that participants receiving the Heart Failure and Diabetes (HF-DM) self-care
      intervention will exhibit greater improvement in: HF knowledge and DM knowledge than UC-AC at
      6 months. Participants receiving the integrated HF-DM self-care intervention will report
      greater improvements in HF self-efficacy and DM self-efficacy over UC-AC at 6 months. HF-DM
      patients randomized to the integrated self-care intervention will exhibit greater
      improvements in overall HF and DM self-care behaviors and HF-DM diet and physical activity
      over UC-AC at 6 months.

      Lastly, that HF-DM patients who receive the integrated self-care intervention will exhibit
      less health resource use and associated costs(direct health care costs of provider visits,
      hospitalizations, ED visits, length of stay, and direct non-health care costs associated with
      the HRU and intervention) over the 6 months than those who receive UC-AC controlling for
      comorbidity and insurance status.
