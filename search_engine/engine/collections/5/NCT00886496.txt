      Primary

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of recombinant human mannose-binding lectin (MBL)
           in pediatric patients with MBL deficiency and fever and neutropenia who are undergoing
           cytotoxic chemotherapy for hematological/oncological disease.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the pharmacodynamic effect of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine nonspecific activation of complement by in vivo determination of C3d
           complement activation in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the ex-vivo activity of recombinant MBL in opsonization capacity of patients'
           sera to yeast and bacteria.

        -  Determine immunogenicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence and duration of fever and breakthrough infections in patients
           treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter, open-label, prospective, cohort study.
      Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups.

        -  Group I: Patients receive low-dose recombinant human mannose-binding lectin (MBL) IV
           over 1 hour within 72 hours of onset of fever and neutropenia.

        -  Group II: Patients receive high-dose recombinant human MBL IV over 1 hour within 72
           hours of onset of fever and neutropenia.

      Patients undergo blood collection periodically during study for pharmacokinetic,
      pharmacodynamic, MBL immunogenicity, and opsonization/phagocytosis studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study.
