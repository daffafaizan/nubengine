      of rThrombin in subjects of age 2 to 75 years who are receiving a partial- or full-thickness
      autologous sheet or mesh grafts following burn or traumatic skin injury. After establishing
      eligibility, study participants will be treated with topical spray rThrombin at the skin
      graft recipient site during autologous skin graft surgery. There will be a 1-month follow-up
      period after the surgery.
