    
      Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) represents the fist cause of end-stage kidney disease in Mexico
      and the world, and it is characterized by the presence of hyperfiltration, glomerular
      hypertrophy, tubular albuminuria and mesangial matrix expansion, mainly by the oxidative
      stress and the pro-inflammatory state.

      Current treatments are limited on controlling proteinuria and delay progression of the
      disease, but even with an optimal management, a significant number of patient progress to
      end-stage renal disease.

      Curcumin, found in the extracts of the rhizome of the plant Curcuma longa L., has a wide
      spectrum of biological and pharmacological activities, such as anti-oxidant,
      anti-inflammatory, anti-carcinogenic and anti-diabetic effects. It has the capacity to act
      directly with highly reactive oxygen species, induce the expression of various cytoprotective
      proteins through Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway and reducing inflammatory transcription factors such
      as NF-κB and TNF-α.

      Curcumin could be an adjuvant treatment in the management of DKC due to his pleiotropic
      nature, low cost and few side effects.
