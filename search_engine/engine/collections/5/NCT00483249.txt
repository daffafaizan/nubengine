      abdomen. The standard operation for TAAA of PVAAA is performed through a long incision
      extending down the side of the chest and the front of the abdomen. In the standard operation,
      the weak area of the aorta is replaced with a fabric sleeve (graft). The investigational
      operation is done making small incisions in both groins and the right arm and placing a graft
      in the aorta through tubes that are inserted through the femoral and brachial arteries, than
      fastening it in position with metal springs(stents). The combination of a stent and a graft
      is known as a stent-graft. Compared with standard operation, the potential advantages of
      endovascular TAAA/PVAAA repair include less pain, less disturbance of intestinal function, a
      lower risk of pulmonary or cardiac complications and shorter hospital stay. The main
      disadvantage of endovascular TAAA/PVAAA is an unknown success rate.
