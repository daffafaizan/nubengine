    
      Patients co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) who
      have advanced liver disease (decompensated cirrhosis by Child-Pugh score and no known cause
      of hepatitis other than HBV), a HBV viral load of at least 1 million copies/mL blood, and at
      least one year of therapy with lamivudine will be treated with open-label adefovir dipivoxil
      10 mg daily and lamivudine 150 mg bid to evaluate the safety and efficacy of this regimen in
      this patient group and to obtain specimens for studies of immune responses to HBV in
      HIV-infected patients. Additionally the kinetics of viral load response to adefovir will be
      assessed. Specimens will be stored for possible use in evaluating HBV and HIV resistance to
      adefovir. L-carnitine supplementation will be used only if low serum carnitine levels are
      documented. Patients will be followed for HBV viral load response to adefovir for 48 weeks
      with possible extension. The primary study endpoints will be HBV viral load at week 24
      (per-protocol patients) and DAVG at week 24 (intent-to-treat patients). Adefovir will be
      discontinued for toxicity; there will be no dose reduction. Up to 30 subjects will be
      enrolled.
