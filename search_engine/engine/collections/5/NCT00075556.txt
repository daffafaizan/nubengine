      Primary

        -  Determine the objective tumor response rate in patients with stage III or IV colorectal
           adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy and capecitabine.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the tolerance profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the rate of preservation of functional integrity of the anal sphincter in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Compare the conversion rate from the effects of mutilating surgery vs surgery with
           sphincter preservation in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily and undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a
      week on weeks 1-5. Patients undergo surgery on week 6.

      Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months.
