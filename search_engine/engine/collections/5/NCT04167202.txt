        -  Randomized controlled parallel-group trial

        -  Acute (24 h) post-injury intervention:

             -  Hydrogen-rich water hydrotherapy

             -  RICE protocol

        -  First sessions given immediately after an initial examination (~ 60 min after the
           injury).

        -  Source of hydrogen-rich water = HRW Natural Health Products Inc. (New Westminster, BC,
           Canada)

           o Formulation (7g/ tablets, 800mg Magnesium) dissolved into a 3-L stationary whirlpool
           with water (20°C)

        -  No other interventions during the period of evaluation

      Outcomes assessed at baseline (pre-intervention) and at 24-h follow up:

        -  Figure-of-eight method of measuring ankle joint swelling

        -  Visual analogue score (VAS) score for pain at rest and during movement

        -  Weight-bearing lunge test (WBLT)

        -  Single leg balance test (SLBT) with eyes open and closed

        -  Serum inflammatory biomarkers (IL-1ß, TNF-α, CRP) • Early termination criteria: serious
           subjective side effects (e.g. tingling, discoloration of skin, burning, itching, rash)
