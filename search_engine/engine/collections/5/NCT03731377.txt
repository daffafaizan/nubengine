      indicated that adequate fluid management optimizes the cardiac out put, improves tissue
      perfusion, thus decrease the risk of postoperative morbidity. Muller et al developed a
      "Mini-fluid challenge method " to predict fluid responsiveness and the efficacy. Fluid status
      and proper perfusion condition in patients undergo thoracic surgery are especially crucial
      for the vulnerability of lung toward fluid overload. To the best of our knowledge, the
      efficacy of the test was not discussed in the perioperative care in video assisted thoracic
      surgery. The investigators design the study to investigate the effectiveness of mini-fluid
      challenge test in video assisted thoracic surgery.
