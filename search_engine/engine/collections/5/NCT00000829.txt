      particularly bacteremia. A large proportion of pneumococcal disease is caused by a limited
      number of serotypes. The maximum number of pneumococcal serotypes that can be included in a
      new conjugate vaccine is felt to be limited by the amount of carrier protein. A heptavalent
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine has been developed that consists of pneumococcal capsular
      saccharides from serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F bound to a diphtheria toxin
      mutant carrier protein.

      Infants are randomized to receive either heptavalent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine or
      placebo by intramuscular injection at study months 0, 2, and 4, and then at 15 months of age.
      Additionally, patients receive PNU-IMUNE 23 ( pneumococcal polyvalent vaccine ) at 24 months
      of age.
