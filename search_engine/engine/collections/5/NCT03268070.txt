      middle cerebral artery supplies blood to the motor cortices, middle cerebral artery stroke
      often impacts the integrity of the motor cortex and its associated corticospinal projections.
      Less than half of all individuals post-stroke regain complete motor function. Because motor
      deficits, especially of the upper extremities, can dampen the quality of life, there is an
      urgent need to improve current rehabilitation programs to allow more stroke survivors to
      achieve higher functional gains.

      Motor training is an important part of recovery after stroke. During motor training, patients
      practice performing a movement and become better at performing the trained movement over
      time. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), which uses magnetism to excite
      neurons near the surface of the brain, may further improve performance. There is evidence
      that the premotor cortex may be a more effective target than the primary motor cortex for
      rTMS for some stroke survivors. In the current study, the investigator will determine the
      effect of rTMS over the premotor cortex on training-related improvements in motor performance
      in adults who experienced a stroke more than 6 months ago.
