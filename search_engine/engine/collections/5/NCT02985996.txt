      be disproportionately affected by HIV. Over 60% of new HIV infections in the US occur among
      MSM. The majority of HIV infections among MSM and TGW occur through exposure to the rectal
      mucosa during receptive anal intercourse (RAI). Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a new HIV
      prevention method that is recommended by CDC and WHO for MSM at risk of HIV infection. PrEP
      entails taking an anti-HIV medication (TruvadaÂ®; tenofovir/emtricitabine) on a daily basis to
      prevent HIV infection. However, current tenofovir- based regimens have shown to have side
      effects that researchers are hoping to reduce in newly developed anti-HIV agents. This study
      is designed to examine the ability of these new agents to penetrate mucosal tissues and
      potentially prevent HIV infection during RAI exposure for MSM and TGW.
