      measured: total body weight (TBW), height, lean body weight (LBW) and body mass index (BMI)
      through formulas known in literature and with a balance for bioelectrical impedance analysis.
      There is no administration of drugs other than those indicated in the request of the treating
      physician.

      Contrast agent dose:

      IOPAMIRO® (Iopamidol) is an x-ray contrast medium of the new generation of non-ionic
      compounds, which are watersoluble because the molecular structure incorporates hydrophilic
      groups. Recommended dosage (ml) is 0.5-2.0/kg. Single injection volume depends on the
      vascular area to be examined.

      IOMERON® (Iomeprolo) is an x-ray contrast medium of the new generation of non-ionic
      compounds, which are watersoluble because the molecular structure incorporates hydrophilic
      groups. Recommended dosage (ml) is 0.5-2.0/kg. Single injection volume depends on the
      vascular area to be examined.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to undergo one of the two contrast agent protocols.

      Control group (TBW protocol): patients will receive a contrast agent dose based on their TBW
      as a standard clinic protocol with a dose of 0.40 gI/kg of TBW. There are no differences
      compared to clinical practice.

      Experimental group (LBW protocol): patients will receive a contrast agent dose based on their
      calculated LBW to test our hypothesis with a dose of 0.65 gI/kg of LBW, derived from our
      pilot study (LBW_01 approved 10/11/2016, registration number 160/int/2016).

      If radiologists prefer a more enhanced examination, only scanning with contrast agent will be
      repeated with the standard dose as the standard clinical protocol.
