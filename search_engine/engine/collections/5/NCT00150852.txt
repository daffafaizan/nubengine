      in patients unable to swallow. Peristomal wound infection occurs in 5 - 30 % of patients.
      Systematic antibiotic prophylaxis by cephalosporins or ampicillin/clavulanic acid has been
      shown to prevent this complication efficiently.

      MRSA-positive patients have been suggested to be at higher risk of PEG-related wound
      infection due to MRSA. However, recommendations about vancomycin-prophylaxis before surgical
      procedures have not been extended to PEG insertion. This might be due to the fact that the
      exact route of contamination is unknown. It is assumed that contamination occurs when
      gastrostomy tubes are passed through the oropharynx. However, oropharyngeal carriage appears
      less frequent than nasopharyngeal or cutaneous carriage. Furthermore, patients who receive
      PEG are particularly vulnerable to vancomycin toxicity because of older age and multiple
      comorbidities.

      The aim of this study is to compare the rate of infectious complications after PEG insertion
      in patients colonized with MRSA who received either standard intravenous antibiotic
      prophylaxis associated with vancomycin or standard prophylaxis with placebo.
