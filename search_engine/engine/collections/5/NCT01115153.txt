      antibiotics during 5-7 days in order to reduce the incidence of infection of the surgical
      wound; however the benefit of such treatment has not been tested. A prospective, randomized
      controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Hospital Universitario de Santander to test
      the effectiveness of providing a single 1-dose therapy of antibiotic prophylaxis versus a
      5-day antibiotic therapy in patients with acute gangrenous appendicitis.

      Materials and Methods: From December 2007 to November 2009, 799 patients went through surgery
      after being diagnosed with acute appendicitis. Out of this set, 150 patients diagnosed with
      acute gangrenous appendicitis, were randomly assigned to one of two groups: control group
      (group A: 72 patients received a 5-day antibiotic therapy), and treatment group (group B: 78
      patients received a single 1-dose of antibiotic prophylaxis). The experimental outcomes
      included: the incidence of infection of the surgical wound, the length of the hospital stay,
      and the adverse effects derived from a prolonged use of antibiotics.
