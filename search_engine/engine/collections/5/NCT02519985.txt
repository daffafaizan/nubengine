      cornea (the window at the front of the eye) and anterior segment (the space behind the cornea
      including the iris and the lens). A commercially available instrument, called the Artemis 2,
      has been used in routine clinical practice since 2001. The Artemis 2 was CE approved as well
      as having FDA approval (the US equivalent of the CE mark).

      The ArcScan Insight 100 VHF digital ultrasound scanner is a new instrument so does not yet
      have a CE mark. However, the ArcScan Insight 100 is an upgraded version of the Artemis 2, so
      any differences are improvements to components, but the measurement method remains
      essentially the same.

      The aim of the study is to establish the repeatability (i.e. the variability in measurements
      taken by a single examiner during a single visit) and reproducibility (i.e. the variability
      in measurements taken in the same conditions between two examiners) of the ArcScan Insight
      100 device for measuring corneal and anterior segment parameters.
