      later by conventionally fractionated concurrent chemoradiation consisting of 60 Gy of
      radiation delivered to involved sites of disease and a platinum doublet.

      The investigational radiation treatment, a single fraction of LEAD radiation, is to be
      followed by conventionally fractionated radiation delivered concurrently with a standard
      chemotherapy regimen for stage III non-small cell lung cancer. The following day, patients
      will begin concurrent chemotherapy and radiation. Chemotherapy will be delivered under the
      management of the treating medical oncologist. Chemotherapy must be a platinum doublet.
      Carboplatin and cisplatin are both considered acceptable platinum agents. The use of
      cisplatin over carboplatin is strongly encouraged, unless the patient has a contraindication
      to cisplatin. The second agent will be at the discretion of the treating medical oncologist;
      in the current era, chemotherapy agents are tailored to each patient based on tumor
      histology, as well as comorbidities that dictate the tolerance of certain chemotherapeutic
      agents. Chemotherapy will be delivered concurrently throughout radiation therapy, beginning
      on day 2 of the treatment protocol and on the same day as the start of standard-dose
      radiation. Weekly regimens or regimens delivered every 3 weeks are acceptable. Additional
      cycles of consolidation chemotherapy are encouraged and will be given at the discretion of
      the treating medical oncologist.
