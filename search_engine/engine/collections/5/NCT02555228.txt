      hindrance to an optimal evaluation of the gastric mucosa, prolong the procedure time, and
      contribute to poor patient tolerance during the scope.

      Simethicone, with or without N-acetylcysteine, has been extensively evaluated to improve
      mucosal visibility. However, the volume of simethicone preparation and the timing of
      ingesting this solution before gastroscope varied significantly across different studies. In
      general, it appeared that a larger volume of simethicone solution, given earlier before the
      gastroscopy, may yield better results. However, allowing a patient to ingest a large volume
      of liquid before a gastroscopy under sedation brings forth the risk of aspiration. A recent
      Taiwanese study published in 2014 [1] showed that the subgroup with 100mg of simethicone in
      just 5ml of water, did achieve a good total mucosal visibility score, if the solution was
      ingested more than 30 minutes before the gastroscope. This may be because a longer time
      allows the simethicone to coat more of the mucosa. However, this study did not compare this
      preparation against a placebo.

      In Changi General Hospital, many gastroscopies are done daily with no premedication. Also,
      there is no protocol for premedication before gastroscopes. This study hopes to prove that a
      low volume of simethicone solution, given at an ample time (more than 30 minutes) before the
      scope, can significantly improve overall endoscopy performance compared to no premedication
      at all.
