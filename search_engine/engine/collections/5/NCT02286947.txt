    
      This is an open-label, multi-center study to explore the safety and tolerability of
      eteplirsen injection in participants with advanced stage DMD with confirmed genetic mutations
      amenable to treatment by exon 51 skipping.

      Participants will be evaluated for inclusion during a Screening/Baseline period of up to 4
      weeks. Eligible participants will receive once weekly intravenous (IV) infusions of 30 mg/kg
      eteplirsen for 96 weeks, followed by a safety extension (not to exceed 48 weeks).

      Safety will be regularly assessed throughout the study via the collection of adverse events
      (AEs), laboratory tests, electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (ECHOs), vital signs, and
      physical examinations.
