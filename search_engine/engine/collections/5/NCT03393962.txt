      the epithelium (outer lining) of the ovary. In 2015, OC was found in 1.2 million women and
      resulted in 161,100 deaths worldwide. Among women, OC is the seventh-most common cancer and
      the eighth-most common cause of cancer death. Treatment for OC consists of surgery,
      chemotherapy, immunotherapy and radiotherapy. The kind of treatment depends on many factors,
      including the type of OC, its stage and grade, as well as the general health of the patient.

      Adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) reactive with tumor antigens has
      proven to be effective against many types of cancer. OC has been shown to be highly
      immunogenic and therefore may respond well to innovative antigen-specific immunotherapy.
      Here, through cancer antigen screening and careful target antigen evaluation, the
      investigation aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of multiple infusions of OC
      antigen-specific, engineered immune effectors (EIEs) in patients with OC.
