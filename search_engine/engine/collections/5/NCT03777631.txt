      infarction. Although anticoagulant therapy can effectively reduce thromboembolic events, the
      reported annual recurrence rate in NVAF and previous stroke patients in the "real-world" is
      not low even with appropriate antithrombotic treatment; 8.6% in patients with "guideline
      adherent" antithrombotic therapy and around 5% in patients treated with anticoagulant
      therapy. NVAF and recent stroke is high-risk population for stroke recurrence even with
      anticoagulant therapy, and developing optimal secondary prevention strategy is an urgent
      task.

      Catheter ablation (CA) is now widely used to treat symptoms related to NVAF. Some
      retrospective studies showed a beneficial effect of CA for stroke prevention using
      age-/sex-matching or propensity-score matching. Moreover, CA have a potential to improve
      survival or prevent heart failure development in patients with AF. However, the effect of CA
      for secondary stroke prevention or impact of CA for NVAF patients with recent ischemic stroke
      for survival or developing heart failure has not been evaluated in a prospective randomized
      trial. Therefore, in the present study, we intend to compare two groups of patients with NVAF
      with a history of cerebral infarction: a group receiving standard medical therapy (control
      group) and a group receiving standard medical therapy plus CA (CA group).
