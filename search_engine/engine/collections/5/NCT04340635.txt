      a certain city and region. Most of the studies that represent the biological characteristics
      of the general population in China and the differences in biological parameters at home and
      abroad are in the research process, or Semi-finished products.

      ②The investigators found in clinical observation that the eyeball biological data of the
      Chinese population may not be consistent with the foreign population.

      ③ This study is the first study of human eye biological parameters based on different regions
      of large-scale populations in China, which is of great significance for understanding the
      human eye structure in different regions of China.
