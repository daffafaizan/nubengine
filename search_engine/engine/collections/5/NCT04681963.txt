      shortness of breath, chest pain, fever and sputum production, combined with X-ray of the
      lungs, relevant blood tests and microbiological analysis of sputum samples. The X-ray is an
      imprecise diagnostic tool, and results from sputum assays are first available after 2 days.
      In the elderly, pneumonia presents with clinically differing signs such as delirium,
      malnutrition, and there may be an absence of fever, cough and dyspnea. The physical
      examination is also challenged by a broad variety of atypical symptoms like headache, dry
      cough and gastrointestinal symptoms in the form of nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. Our
      hypothesis is that well-defined clinical characteristics upon arrival to the emergency
      department will contribute to the better and quicker diagnosis of pneumonia.

      The aim is to identify the information available upon arrival to the Emergency Department
      that contributes to diagnosis and prognosis of community-acquired-pneumonia.

      The objectives are:

        1. Identify the information available upon arrival that correlates to the diagnosis of
           community-acquired pneumonia

        2. Identify the information available upon arrival that correlates to severity of
           community-acquired pneumonia
