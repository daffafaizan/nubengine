      smokers. We hypothesize that low frequency rTMS over the SFG will block cue-induced craving.
      In order to test this hypothesis, subjects will undergo three conditions:

        1. active condition: low frequency rTMS was administered over the superior frontal gyrus
           (SFG) during the presentation of smoking and control cues

        2. location control condition: low frequency rTMS was administered over motor cortex (MC)
           during the presentation of smoking and control cues

        3. frequency control condition: high frequency rTMS was administered over the SFG during
           the presentation of smoking and control cues
