        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of Huang Lian (Chinese herb) in patients with
           advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the optimal pharmacologic, molecular, and biologic parameters of this
           treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the preliminary therapeutic activity of this treatment regimen in this patient
           population.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral Huang Lian (Chinese herb) 4 times daily. Treatment repeats every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of Huang Lian until the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-liming toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study.
