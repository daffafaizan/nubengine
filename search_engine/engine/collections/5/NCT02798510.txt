      cholangiocarcinoma (EHCC) is unknown. A retrospective study suggested that chemoradiotherapy
      provides greater benefit than chemotherapy alone in GBCA patients. SWOG S0809, a phase II
      study showed that adjuvant chemoradiotherapy has promising efficacy in GBCA or EHCC. The
      present phase III clinical trial is designed to compare adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy
      with chemotherapy alone.
