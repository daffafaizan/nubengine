      The main aim of this pilot study is to increase our knowledge on interventions for Selective
      Mutism (SM), a childhood condition characterized by a persistent lack of speech in specific
      situations despite the ability to comprehend and use language. A survey on the treatment
      offered this group in Norway 1997-2000 showed great variations in therapeutic approach and
      the overall outcome was poor. Correspondent with the notion of SM as a variant of social
      anxiety, several case studies have described successful treatments using behaviour techniques
      (BT's) such as stimulus fading and shaping. In addition, the author's clinical experience is
      that "defocusing in communication" (e.g. regulation of gaze contact; sitting beside instead
      of in front of the child, avoiding direct questioning, talking about interesting but
      impersonal topics) represents another important toil in getting the mute child to start
      talking. However, to date there are no randomized controlled SM treatment studies, and in
      fact we know little of what works best to help these children. Our research group has
      developed an assessment- and treatment manual for children with SM.

      In this exploring pilot study referred children with SM aged 3-5 years (n=7) will be given an
      intervention according to the treatment manual. The intervention is conducted at home and in
      the kindergarten or at school and includes stimulus fading techniques with weekly sessions.
      Therapists will be members of the research group or local therapist under supervision.
