      Aim 1: To determine whether a 12-week, computer-based mental activity program improves
      cognitive function in non-demented, inactive elders.

      We hypothesize that this mental activity program will improve cognitive function-especially
      visuospatial function-in non-demented, inactive elders.

      Aim 2: To determine whether a 12-week exercise program improves cognitive function in
      non-demented, inactive elders.

      We hypothesize that this exercise program will improve cognitive function-especially
      executive function-in non-demented, inactive elders.

      Aim 3: To determine whether the effects of mental activity and exercise are additive or are
      more or less than the sum of their parts.

      We hypothesize that the effects of these mental activity and exercise interventions will be
      additive.

      Aim 4: To determine whether mental activity and/or exercise may slow cognitive decline or
      lower risk of dementia in non-demented, inactive elders.

      We hypothesize that both mental activity and exercise will slow cognitive decline and lower
      risk of dementia, and that the effects will be greatest when mental activity and exercise are
      combined.
