      to achieve best glycemic control in early type 2 diabetes. Patients with diabetes mellitus
      type 2 with a duration of diabetes between 1 and 10 years without previous insulin therapy
      will be randomized on insulin lispro mix 25 or insulin glargine therapy. Glycemic control
      will be compared by the between treatment difference in fasting plasma glucose and 2h
      postprandial blood glucose excursions (preprandial -postprandial excursions) after breakfast.
