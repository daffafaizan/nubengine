        -  Assess polysomnographically measured sleep latency and sleep efficiency following 30
           days in home use of the device and compare these measures with those following initial
           in lab use in the CIP-003 protocol.

        -  Determine the long-term use patterns of the Cerêve Sleep System in the environment of
           intended use.

      Study Design Overview A multi-center, prospective, non-randomized, two phase study to
      determine durability of effects following 30 days of in home use (phase I) and home use
      patterns over an additional 5 months in home use of the Cerêve Sleep System (phase II).

      A total of 30 evaluable subjects will be targeted to complete phase I and a total of 24
      evaluable subjects will be targeted to complete phase II. It is anticipated that 36 subjects
      will be enrolled into the CIP-004 protocol to obtain the numbers of evaluable subjects
      described.

      During in home use in both the durability phase and the home use patterns phase, the subject
      will be asked to use the device for a minimum of three nights each week for at least 4 hours
      on each of these nights up to seven nights each week. Subjects will complete a weekly home
      use log throughout both phases of the study.
