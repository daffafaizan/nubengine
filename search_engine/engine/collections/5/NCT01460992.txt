      prerequisites and conditions are fulfilled, MR scans can now be conducted on patients with
      BIOTRONIK's EVIA/ENTOVIS pacemakers in combination with the Safio S pacemaker leads,
      scheduled to be part of this clinical study.

      The specific MRI conditions for this investigation with the EVIA/ENTOVIS pacemaker family and
      Safio S pacemaker leads are defined in the study protocol
