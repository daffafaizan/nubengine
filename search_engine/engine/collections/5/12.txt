the content of phosphatides, triglycerides and cholesterol in placentas,maternal, fetal and new-born liver of the white rat .thin-layer-chromatographic examinations in the maternal rat livershowed different rise of the triglycerides and a significant increase ofthe esterified cholesterol, however, no striking changes in the contentof free cholesterol and lipid phosphorus with the fractions examined(lecithin, colamine cephalin, sphingomyelin and lysolecithin) .as compared to the liver of adult rats, the fetal liver contains alittle less than 50 per cent lipid phosphorus . the difference isconditioned by the concentrations of lecithin, and colamine cephalin .on the 19th day the content of triglycerides is lower than in the motherrat . referred to the dry weight, there results a decrease of allphosphatide fractions, as well as of the free cholesterol and a slightrise of the triglycerides from the 19th to the 22nd day .the rise of the phosphatide concentrations to the values of adult ratsoccurs immediately after birth under the influence of milk food, which,moreover, leads to a considerable increase of the triglyceride values .phospholipid- and triglyceride concentrations of the placenta correspondto those of the fetal liver . solely the content of free cholesterol ishigher at the end of pregnancy . the content of triglyceride dropstowards the 22nd day .
