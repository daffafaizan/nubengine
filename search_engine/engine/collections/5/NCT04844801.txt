    
      All consecutive adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit with NOSVA during septic
      shock will be included in the presence of inclusion criteria and in the absence of exclusion
      criteria.

      Randomization, performed immediately after the inclusion (Day-1), in 1:1:1 ratio will be
      stratified on center. Then the patient will receive the randomized strategy: risk control,
      rate control or rhythm control.

      Before inclusion, the informed consent of the next-of-kin will be sought by study
      investigator because the patient will be unable to express his/her will. In the case the
      next-of-kin are unidentified and/or unreachable, an emergency procedure will be applied.
      Patient consent will be sought as soon as their state of health allows it.

      According to clinical guidelines, patients in all groups will receive therapeutic
      anticoagulation if NOSVA > 48 hours and in the absence of contraindication. In all groups,
      recommendations for the management of septic shock will be followed.

      After day-7 (or hospital discharge if before J7), NOSVA treatment will be left at the
      discretion of attending physicians.

      Evaluation criteria will be collected at day-2, day-3, day-7 (or at hospital discharge if
      before day-7), at the day of ICU discharge and at Day-28. If the patient has been discharged
      before Day-28, the vital status may be obtained by phone call at Day-28.
