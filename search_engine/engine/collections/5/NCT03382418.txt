      (gp145 C.6980) with aluminum hydroxide adjuvant in healthy, HIV-1-uninfected adults in the
      United States.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of three groups. Participants in Group 1 will
      receive 300 mcg of gp145 C.6980 and aluminum hydroxide adjuvant on Day 0 and Months 2 and 6.
      Participants in Group 2 will receive 100 mcg of gp145 C.6980 and aluminum hydroxide adjuvant
      on Day 0 and Months 2 and 6. Participants in Group 3 will receive placebo on Day 0 and Months
      2 and 6.

      Study visits will occur at Day 0 (study entry), Weeks 1 and 2, and Months 2, 2.5, 6, 6.25,
      6.5, 9, and 12. Visits may include physical examinations, blood and urine collection, HIV
