      I. To characterize the urinary metabolite signature of 10 stage III, favorable-histology,
      Wilms tumor patients from the Cooperative Human Tissue Network (CHTN) Databank, as distinct
      from 10 normal controls.

      II. To characterize and compare the urinary metabolite profile in 50 randomly selected, stage
      III, favorable-histology, Wilms tumor patients enriched with an additional 30 stage III Wilms
      tumor patients who have relapsed.

      III. To establish if the potential poor outcome (defined as relapse) in the
      favorable-histology group has a specific metabolite signature.

      IV. To characterize the urinary metabolite signature of Wilms tumor in patients with
      unfavorable histology (diffuse anaplasia) and compare it to those with favorable histology.

      OUTLINE:

      Archived urine samples are analyzed for specific metabolite patterns by nuclear magnetic
      resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and principal component analysis (PCA). Tumor tissue may also be
      examined by NMR and PCA.
