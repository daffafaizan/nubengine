        -  Determine the feasibility of preoperative chemoradiotherapy in patients with potentially
           resectable adenocarcinoma of the stomach.

        -  Determine the pathologic response rate, curative resection rate, and survival in
           patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on days 1-21, cisplatin IV over 1
      hour on days 1-5, and leucovorin calcium IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. A
      second course is administered beginning on day 29.

      Chemoradiotherapy begins at the end of the second course of chemotherapy and 1 week of rest
      (day 57). Patients receive fluorouracil IV over 24 hours 5 days a week concurrently with
      radiotherapy for 5 weeks and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours once weekly during these 5 weeks on
      days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29.

      Approximately 4-5 weeks after chemoradiotherapy, patients with no evidence of metastatic
      disease undergo surgical resection.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 5 years, then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-49 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
