      inhibitor combined with a Cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitor will be well
      tolerated in early stage, hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer patients treated with
      neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET). The secondary hypothesis and biomarker based endpoint is
      that patients with HR positive locally advanced breast cancer with low to intermediate
      stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) will demonstrate an increase in stromal TILs
      following NET when combined with abemaciclib and durvalumab for 4 cycles (16 weeks).
