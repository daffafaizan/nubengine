      overweight. In the proposed study, we aim to investigate the role that eating behaviors and
      genes may play in the development of overweight. Participants will be adolescent girls and
      boys from a racially/ethnically diverse sample of adolescents from the DC Metro community.
      Adolescent eating behavior will be observed during laboratory test meals. Adolescents will be
      provided with a large buffet of foods or a standard meal and instructed to eat until you are
      no longer hungry. Thirty minutes later, they will taste and rate a variety of highly
      palatable snack foods. Blood tests will be conducted to examine genes related to eating
      behavior. Assessments also will include affective states, degree of hunger, degree of
      fullness, body image satisfaction, disordered eating attitudes and behaviors, and measures of
      interpersonal interactions.
