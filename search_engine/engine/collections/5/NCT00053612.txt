      vagina, and is correlated with immune dysfunction in both HIV-1 infected and uninfected
      individuals. Recent studies of genital tract shedding of HIV-1 DNA in infected women have
      found that lower serum concentrations of vitamin A were strongly associated with detection of
      HIV-1 in vaginal secretions. In addition, maternal vitamin A deficiency has been associated
      with significantly increased risk of vertical HIV-1 transmission. This study will assess the
      effect of vitamin A supplementation on the prevalence and quantity of HIV-1 DNA and RNA in
      cervical and vaginal secretions.

      Participants in this study will be HIV infected nonpregnant women in Mombasa, Kenya.
      Participants will be randomized to receive 6 weeks of daily dosage of either 10,000 IU
      vitamin A or placebo. Cervical and vaginal swabs will be obtained at enrollment and at Week 6
      for detection and quantification of HIV-1 DNA and RNA. In addition, venous blood will be
      obtained at the two time points for quantification of plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4 lymphocyte count,
      and serum vitamin A levels.
