      who undergo aortic valve replacement with pericardial bioprosthesis. Patients were randomized
      by use of a randomization table. Bioprosthesis was chosen between Avalus or Carpentier
      Edwards Perimount Magna Ease according to the randomization result. The primary end point is
      postoperative 1-year transvalvular mean pressure gradient. The secondary end points are
      postoperative 1-year effective orifice area, operative mortality, operative morbidities,
      1-year overall survival, 1-year freedom from cardiac death and 1-year freedom from
      valve-related events.
