      antenatal clinics of the Aga Khan University Hospital (AKUH) Karachi. Pregnant women in their
      first trimester, registered or planning to register at AKUH with access to smartphones with
      internet connection will be considered eligible for the study. For pregnant women in the
      intervention arm, mobile health application will be provided in their smartphones that will
      screen on their socio-demographic characteristics, diet and supplement use and lifestyle
      habits. Based on the data gathered, recommendations and a dietary risk score will be
      generated upon completion of the screening questionnaire. The similar process will be
      repeated on 4 follow-ups, each 6 weeks apart after enrollment in the study. Also, push
      notifications will be sent to women maximum 3 times a week on dietary and lifestyle advice.
      The women in the control arm will be provided with standard counseling using the educational
      pamphlet of the Aga Khan University Hospital "Diet during Pregnancy". The primary outcome of
      the study is improvement in the dietary and supplement use that will be assessed through
      Dietary Risk Score. The secondary outcomes include assessing the compliance and usability of
      m-Health application among the pregnant women enrolled in the intervention arm. Other
      secondary outcomes include evaluating the effect of m-Health coaching on maternal, fetal and
      infant outcomes among pregnant women and infant born to women in the intervention arm
      compared to women and infants born to women who received standard counseling respectively.
