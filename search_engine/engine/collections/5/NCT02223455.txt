    
      The two specific aims and associated hypotheses of CREATE Project 2 include:

        1. Identify combinations of hand-hygiene intervention strategies that optimize hand-hygiene
           compliance and that could form an evidence-based hand-hygiene bundle for Veterans Health
           Administration (VHA) implementation.

           Hypothesis 1: Combinations of interventions will increase compliance rates more than
           single interventions.

           Aim 1 will entail a 30-month cluster-randomized controlled trial that will sequentially
           test three individual hand-hygiene interventions - hand-hygiene point-of-use reminder
           signs to serve as an environmental cue to action, individual hand sanitizers, and health
           care worker hand cultures - to identify an optimal combination of interventions to
           increase hand-hygiene compliance. The trial will be conducted in 59 hospital units in 10
           VA hospitals in order to test the efficacy of individual and then sequentially added
           interventions to determine their incremental impact on hand-hygiene compliance.

           The focus for this clinical trial will be on Aim 1--Single Hand Hygiene Sign changes.

        2. Identify institutional, organizational, ward/ICU, and individual level facilitators and
           barriers to implementing hand-hygiene interventions.

      Hypothesis 2: Facilitators and barriers will pattern around contextual factors such as level
      of leadership support and organization of infection control programs.

      Aim 2 will entail a qualitative process evaluation that includes site visits to purposefully
      selected sites, semi-structured interviews, and observations to examine barriers and
      facilitators to the interventions and develop contextual insight for implementing and
      scaling-up the intervention at additional sites as a national initiative.
