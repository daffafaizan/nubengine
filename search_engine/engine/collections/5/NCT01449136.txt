      divided into two groups. In group A (GA; n=22), the cavities were lined with conventional
      glass ionomer cement (Vidrion F®) and in group B (GB; n=23), with antibacterial cement
      (Vidrion F® containing 1% each of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and cefaclor). Both groups
      were restored with Ketac Molar Easymix®. Molars with carious lesions on the inner half of
      dentin without clinical or radiographic pulp damage were selected. Patients were evaluated
      clinically (for pain, fistulas, or mobility) and radiographically (area of caries, periapical
      region, and furcation of teeth) after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
