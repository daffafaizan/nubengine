    
      The main purpose of the studies presented in this protocol is to investigate the physiology
      of motor control in health as well as the pathophysiological modifications taking place
      during disease. Patients and normal volunteers will be scanned at rest and during different
      tasks, either while making repetitive movements or undergoing sensory stimulation. These
      studies should provide new insight concerning the processes that control human movement and
      sensory processing. The studies described in this protocol will be conducted by systems
      operating on 1.5 Tesla up to 4 Tesla, including a system at 3 Tesla which is going to be
      installed in near future.
