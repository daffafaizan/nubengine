      mutations in any one of hundreds of different genes. Approximately 20 genes have now been
      identified in which mutations can cause nonsyndromic sensorineural hearing loss. The
      identification and analysis of these genes and their mutations are providing critical
      insights into the development, structure, and function of the auditory system, as well as the
      molecular mechanisms associated with disruption of these processes. In contrast, the
      molecular mechanisms underlying familial disorders affecting peripheral vestibular function
      appear to be more rare, have not been well described, and are less well understood. The
      peripheral auditory and vestibular systems share many common features in both health and
      disease, and many hereditary hearing loss disorders also affect vestibular function. The
      purpose of this study is to identify genes and mutations causing hereditary disorders of
      hearing, balance, or both. Members of families segregating hereditary disorders of hearing or
      balance will be enrolled in the proposed study in order to: (1) define and characterize the
      phenotypes and natural histories; (2) identify the underlying causative mutations and genes
      by linkage, positional cloning, and/or candidate gene mutation analyses; (3) and correlate
      observed phenotypes with the corresponding mutations and functions of the underlying genes.
