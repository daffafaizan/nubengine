      undergoes an hallux valgus chevron osteotomy of the first metatarsal associated with a
      percutaneous Akin osteotomy of the first phalange. The investigators study the impact of the
      fixation of percutaneous Akin osteotomy ( osteotomy of the first phalange of hallux) with two
      arms: one with fixation of the percutaneous Akin osteotomy, and one with a non-fixed
      percutaneous Akin osteotomy This study as been approved by Institutional review board;
      written informed consent is required for all patients before inclusion.

      The clinic follow-up of each patients included in the study will be the same of the normal
      follow-up for this type of surgery in our practice. This includes clinical exam, radiologic
      exam, and functional score AOFAS before surgery, at 6 weeks after the surgery, four months
      after surgery and finally one year after the surgery.

      The primary outcome measure which is the first metatarso-phalangeal global mobility will be
      blindly measure by an observator.
