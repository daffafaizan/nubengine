      is not adequately lifted from the ground when walking. Functional Electrical Stimulation
      (FES) is applied to the shin muscles to aid lifting the foot of the ground and reduces the
      risk of trips and falls. PwMS that are users of functional electrical stimulation (FES)
      report that one of the benefits is that it reduces the mental effort of walking and that as a
      result less concentration is needed when they walk. Motor fatigability, which is the reduced
      ability of the muscles to produce force or power, also negatively affects the walking
      performance of pwMS. There have been several studies showing the benefits of FES to the
      walking of pwMS, but not while performing two tasks at the same time and experiencing
      fatigability resembling more daily life conditions. The proposed study aims to investigate
      the direct orthotic effect of FES (FES on vs off) in three different conditions, which
      include just walking, walking while performing an attention-demanding task and walking with
      an attention-demanding task after having completed a fatiguing task. The study design of this
      research allows the quantification of benefits of the use of FES which have until now only be
      reported subjectively.
