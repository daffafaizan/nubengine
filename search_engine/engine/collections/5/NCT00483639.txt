        -  Determine the relationship between treatment-provoked social anxiety and avoidance in
           patients previously treated for head and neck cancer.

        -  Determine the relationship between pre-cancer psychiatric diagnosis and post-treatment
           social anxiety and avoidance in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of social anxiety and/or avoidance on the quality of life of these
           patients.

        -  Investigate the specificity of these relationships in patients with head and neck cancer
           by comparing patients with head and neck cancer to patients with lung cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a cross-sectional study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      treatment type (significantly impairing [surgery] vs less impairing
      [chemotherapy/radiotherapy]).

      Patients undergo a face-to-face interview with a mental health clinician over 2 hours.
      Patients complete multiple psychiatric/psychological assessments during the interview,
      including the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID); the Liebowitz Social Anxiety
      Scale (SAS); the Performance Status Scale for Head and Neck Cancer Patients (PSS-HN); the
      Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory (SPAI); the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI);
      Response to Stress Questionnaire, Cancer Version (RSQ-CV); the Functional Assessment of
      Cancer Therapy (FACT-HNC (head neck cancer) or LC); the Voice Handicap Index (VHI); and the
      Body Image Scale (BIS).

      Cancer treatment and medical history information are gathered from patients' medical records.
