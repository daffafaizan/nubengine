      techniques are being developed. The adoption of the TME technique has resulted in better
      oncological outcome in the last decades. The addition of neoadjuvant therapy has further
      improved oncological outcome. The minimal invasive laparoscopic resection of rectal cancer
      has shown to be safe and to result in improved short-term outcomes and reduced morbidity.

      Nevertheless, the laparoscopic resection of mid and low rectal cancer remains challenging due
      to the anatomy of the narrow pelvis and is associated with a relative high risk of resections
      with an involved CRM resulting in increased risk of a local recurrence.

      In attempt to improve the quality of the TME procedure in low rectal cancer and further
      improve oncological results the TaTME has been developed, in which the rectum is dissected
      transanally according to TME principles. First series have been described since 2010 and
      although randomised evidence is still lacking this new technique has shown to be feasible and
      safe. The rectum including the total mesorectum is mobilised transanally in a reversed way
      with minimally invasive surgery including high quality imaging techniques.

      The TaTME technique for mid and low rectal cancer has shown to have potential benefits:
      better specimen quality with less R1 resections, less morbidity, less conversion to
      laparotomy and more sphincter saving rectal resections without compromising oncological
      outcomes.

      The investigators propose to evaluate the TaTME technique compared with conventional
      laparoscopic rectal resection for patients with mid and low rectal cancer in an international
      randomised trial: the COLOR III trial.
