      enoxaparin dosing, degree of surgical injury, and blood clots after major reconstructive
      surgery. Ultimately, this research will expand medicine's understanding of why post-operative
      VTE occurs, will allow the investigators to individualize a patient's VTE prophylaxis
      strategy based on their unique characteristics, and will further improve patient safety after
      reconstructive surgery.
