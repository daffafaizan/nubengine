      than 1.5 x 10 (9) per liter without an increase in infections. This condition has been
      described in individuals of African descent. Although these individuals have normal myeloid
      maturation on bone marrow examinations, they appear to release fewer neutrophils into the
      circulation when stimulated by hydrocortisone, compared to normal controls. This suggests
      that there may be differences in the regulation of neutrophil release or trafficking. In the
      past decade, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) has been widely used in a variety
      of clinical settings, from patients with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia to normal
      volunteers for peripheral blood stem cell collection. G-CSF, however, has not been used in
      individuals with BEN. Furthermore, gene expression in neutrophil proliferation and
      trafficking has not been studied in these individuals. The purpose of this study are to (1)
      identify individuals with BEN; (2) follow the natural history of BEN; (3) determine if there
      is a familial inheritance pattern; (4) characterize and compare neutrophil response to
      dexamethasone and G-CSF; (5) compare the pattern of neutrophil gene expression by microarray
      analyses; and (6) determine if mutations are present at the DNA level to account for gene
      expression pattern differences in individuals of African descent with and without BEN at
      baseline, post dexamethasone, and post G-CSF stimulation.
