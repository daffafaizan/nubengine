      medication (excluding Tekturna) in addition to either an ACE inhibitor or an ARB (angiotensin
      receptor blocker) and still have a blood pressure greater than 130/80 mm Hg. The purpose of
      the study is to compare the effects of two different blood pressure treatment regimens, each
      containing three medications, on heart function in diabetics with uncontrolled hypertension.
      The two treatments are 1) lisinopril (an ACE inhibitor that works by reducing blood pressure)
      plus amlodipine (a calcium channel blocker that reduces blood pressure) plus aliskiren (a
      renin inhibitor, which also reduces blood pressure), or 2) lisinopril plus amlodipine plus
      hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic, or "water pill"). Participants will have their coronary flow
      reserve - which is a measure of coronary vessel function, a predictor of future
      cardiovascular events - and a number of cardiovascular biomarkers in blood and urine at
      baseline and after 6 months of treatment. In this manner hydrochlorothiazide will be compared
      with aliskiren, which researchers think will have a better effect on heart artery blood flow.
