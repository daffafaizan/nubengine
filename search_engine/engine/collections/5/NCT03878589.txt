      aged 65 and older, a rapidly growing segment of our population. The knee is the most commonly
      affected joint with pain being the primary symptom, negatively impacting physical, cognitive,
      and emotional functioning. Symptomatic knee OA has been traditionally attributed to
      peripheral mechanisms, but measures of joint damage only modestly account for the presence or
      severity of OA-related pain. The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has been recognized as a mediator
      of endogenous analgesia in animal and human studies. However, little is known about the
      neurobiological mechanisms underlying OT's pain-relieving properties.

      This study will test the efficacy and safety of self-administered intranasal OT over 4-weeks
      in older individuals with knee osteoarthritis. Relative to placebo (P), daily administration
      of intranasal OT diminished self-reported pain, physical and emotional functioning and
      changes in brain metabolite concentrations. With strong support from the University of
      Florida and the McKnight Brain Institute, this interdisciplinary project, using a
      comprehensive multi-methods approach, will be the first to determine the potential benefit of
      OT as a novel analgesic therapy for knee OA pain in aging.
