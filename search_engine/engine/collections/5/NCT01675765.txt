      vaccinations of CRS-207 (1Ã—10^9 colony-forming units [CFU] given intravenously [i.v.] over 2
      hours) (with or without cyclophosphamide) 2 weeks apart followed 2 weeks later by up to 6
      cycles of pemetrexed and cisplatin 21 days apart. Three weeks after completion of
      chemotherapy, subjects will receive an additional 2 infusions (boost vaccinations) of CRS-207
      3 weeks apart. Subjects will be followed every 8 weeks until disease progression by
      immune-related response criteria. Subjects who continue to meet dosing eligibility may
      receive additional CRS-207 (with or without cyclophosphamide) infusions (maintenance
      vaccinations) at each follow-up visit.

      Study assessments include blood draws for safety and immune response monitoring and CT scans
      [with optional fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET)] or magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) to monitor disease status. In addition, optional tumor biopsies may
      be performed before, during and after treatment.
