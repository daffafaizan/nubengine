      level in the blood, but it cannot eliminate latent viral reservoirs, and need lifelong
      adherence to expensive regimens that have potential side effects. Increasing evidence
      indicates that early antiretroviral therapy for recently HIV-infected patients results in
      slower progression of HIV disease and represent a unique opportunity to interfere with either
      the quantities or qualities of persistent reservoirs of replication-competent virus. However,
      the time course before the interruption of cART is unclear. This study will compare the
      virological and immunological outcomes and HIV latency of recently infected adults who
      receive cART or cART in combination with autologous HIV-1 CTL infusion for different periods.

      The study will last 120 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the cART or
      the cART plus autologous HIV-1 CTL infusion arm of one of three cohorts. The three cohorts
      will differ in the period of cART given. Cohort 1, Cohort 2 or Cohort 3 will receive cART
      (Zidovudine (AZT)/Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) +Lamivudine (3TC） + Lopinavir /
      Ritonavir （LPV/r)） for 48, 72 or 96 weeks, respectively. After 48, 72 or 96 weeks, cART will
      be interrupted respectively. Study visits will occur at study entry, Week 4 and 12, and every
      12 weeks thereafter through treatment interruption, then every 4 weeks through 12 weeks
      later, then every 12 weeks through Week 120. At each study visit, a physical exam, blood
      collection, and completion of an adherence questionnaire will occur. Clinical, virological,
      and immunological evaluations and HIV latency examination will be performed at most study
      visit.
