      meta-analyses suggest that statins also confer increased risk of development of diabetes. In
      order to elucidate whether statins increase risk of diabetes, investigators conducted this
      study to evaluate the effects of rosuvastatin (maybe the highest diabetogenic) and
      pravastatin (seems to be protective) on the glucose homeostasis and other biomarkers in
      subjects with impaired fasting glucose.
