           address this void in international literature impacting the management of acute
           agitation.

        2. The multi-centre Randomised Clinical Trial will determine the safety and efficacy of
           oral olanzapine, in comparison with conventional medicines (haloperidol or diazepam) in
           a three-arm comparison for the sedation of acutely agitated patients in AEDs.
           Specifically, we aim to determine if administration of oral olanzapine (a)is more
           effective than sedation with oral haloperidol or oral diazepam alone; (b)is safer than
           sedation with comparison arms; (c)decreases the amount of subsequent redosing or
           alternative drugs required; (d)is more favourable than the haloperidol and diazepam arms
           with respect to safety, efficacy and adverse events.

      Investigate potential variables leading to AED attendance and/or admission requiring oral
      sedation. These may include patient demographic and regular medications and adherence.
