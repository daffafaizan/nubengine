      NSCLC survivors undergoing surveillance. Cox proportional hazards regression and competing
      risk analyses will compare the effectiveness of the three most common surveillance
      intensities (3 months vs. 6 months vs. annually) on survival.

      There is also a plan to engage cancer survivors to guide the development of our study
      comparators, outcomes and demonstration of results.
