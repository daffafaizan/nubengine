      effects of 2, 4, and 8 min long duration of static-stretching (SS) on isometric maximum
      voluntary contraction (MVC) force of hamstring muscles.

      METHODS: Pretest-posttest experimental design. Total of 14 subjects with mean age 25 years
      participated in three experimental trials on three different days. On day-I for
      static-stretching for 2 minutes (SS2), day-II for 4 minutes (SS4), and day-III for 8 minutes
      (SS8). Testing was conducted before (pre), immediately after (post), and at 10 and 20 min
      post stretching. MVCF was measured using strain gauze as the main outcome measure.
