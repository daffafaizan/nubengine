      study and for 32 h post initiation. In particular, the following foods and beverages were
      excluded from volunteer diets: cocoa containing products, coffee, tea and wine. The study was
      designed as a single blind, randomized, crossover intervention trial, where volunteers were
      asked to consume either 375 ml of Champagne wine or a placebo matched for alcohol content,
      sugars and fruit-derived acids. Subjects were assessed for anthropometric measurements and
      provided a urine sample prior baseline Laser Doppler Imaging with iontophoresis (LDI)
      measurements. Subjects were then cannulated and a baseline blood sample was collected.
      Subjects were then randomly assigned to either the Champagne wine or placebo group and asked
      to consume the beverage within a 10 min period. Following a standardised breakfast blood
      samples were collected at: 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240, 300, 360 and 480 minutes post
      consumption and pooled urine samples were collected over 3 x 8 h periods. A standardised
      breakfast and lunch were also consumed at 15 and 200 minutes post beverage. LDI measurements
      were carried out at 120, 240, 360 and 480 minutes. Subjects also provided 24 h and 32 h blood
      and urine samples. Following a washout period of 28 days, volunteers returned to the unit to
      complete the second arm of the study where the procedure above was repeated.
