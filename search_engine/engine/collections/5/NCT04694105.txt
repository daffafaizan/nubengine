      arteriovenous fistula surgery. Ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus block was
      initiated after placement of full monitoring . Supraclavicular brachial plexus block was
      achieved with the use of total volume 32 ml of anesthetic drugs in all patients. Bupivacaine
      30 ml 0.25% was combined with 2 ml normal saline (control group A, n=14), Bupivacaine 30 ml
      0.25% was combined with 50 microgram (0.5 ml) peri-neural dexmedetomidine plus 1.5 ml normal
      saline ( dexmedetomidine group B ,n=14), or Bupivacaine 30 ml 0.25% was combined with 4 mg
      peri neural dexamethasone (2 ml) ( dexamethasone group C, n=14).The onset and duration of
      sensory and motor blocks, the time to first request to postoperative rescue analgesic,
      Richmond Agitation-Sedation Score, hemodynamic data, visual analogue pain scores, were
      reported at predetermined time assessment points. Postoperative rescue intravenous fentanyl
      consumption over 24 hours and complications occurred were recorded.
