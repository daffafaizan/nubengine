      patients the dose and concentration of TAC are difficult to adjust because of its narrow
      therapeutic index and variable pharmacokinetics.

      Many factors affect the pharmacokinetics of TAC. Literature suggests that ABCB1, CYP3A4,
      CYP3A5, POR gene polymorphisms may affect the pharmacokinetics of TAC. In addition, the
      distribution of TAC is affected by hematocrit and albumin concentrations. The
      pharmacokinetics of TAC may also be affected by total protein, total bilirubin, creatinine,
      AST, ALT, gender, age, drug interactions, and so on.

      This study intends to analyze the influence of various factors, including drugs, on the
      pharmacokinetics of TAC.
