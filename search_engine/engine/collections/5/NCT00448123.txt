    
      This is a prospective randomized placebo controlled study of tamsulosin alone, vs placebo, to
      determine its effect on the rates of stone passage and resolution of pain in patients with
      acute renal colic pain that present to the emergency department. The study will be conducted
      in the Emergency Department (ED)and Emergency Department Observation Unit (EDOU) of William
      Beaumont Hospital, a high volume, university affiliated 952 bed suburban teaching hospital.

      Patients will be given a seven-day supply of tamsulosin (0.4mg daily) or placebo. They will
      also be given a prescription for Vicodin (30 pills) and Ibuprofen (600mg, 30 pills). They
      will be called on days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 10 following the index visit regarding passage of
      stone or 48 hours without pain. Patients will be asked to call in if they pass their stone or
      are without pain for 48 hours. Related return visits to Royal Oak or Troy Beaumont within 30
      days of their index visit will be followed by chart review.

      The study will be limited to patients presenting to the emergency department with acutely
      symptomatic renal colic pain. Confirmation of a symptomatic stone will be made by imaging
      (helical CT scan or intravenous pyelogram).
