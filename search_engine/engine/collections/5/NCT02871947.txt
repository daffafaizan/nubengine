      severe asthma patients, it may improve characterization of the disease and contribute to
      improved selection of appropriate treatment. It could also help link genotypes with their
      phenotypic manifestations and their natural history and prognosis. A greater understanding of
      the phenotypes of severe asthma could enable identification of biomarkers for each phenotype,
      and identify the association between biokarkers and clinical outcomes in severe asthma
      patients.
