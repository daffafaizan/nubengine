      Primary: To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD), Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) and
      recommended Phase 2 dose of radiation therapy administered in combination with ipilimumab.

      Secondary:

      Adverse event profiles Preliminary anti-tumor activity following escalating doses of
      radiation combined to ipilimumab using the immune related response criteria irRC overall
      survival in patients treated with this combination systemic immunologic anti tumor response
      intratumoral immune response pharmacodynamic effects of ipilimumab and radiotherapy in
      combination on Absolute Lymphocyte Count (ALC) associations between ALC and anti-tumor
      activity of ipilimumab and radiotherapy in combination
