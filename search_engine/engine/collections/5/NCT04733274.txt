      will collect and analyze both quantitative and qualitative data form healthcare professionals
      as well as patients. Findings will be used to inform more person-centered approaches to
      genetic testing that will support high-quality decisions that are informed and aligned with
      patient values and preferences. To achieve this, the study has three specific aims.

      Aim 1. Evaluate the understandability and acceptability of education materials (including
      information on genetic testing) co-created with patients.

      Patient education materials will be created drawing on healthcare professionals expertise
      (i.e. content experts) and patients (i.e. lived experience). Quality of materials will be
      quantitatively measured using the gold standard Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool
      (PEMAT).

      Aim 2. Identify the central elements for a patient decision aid using expert clinician
      opinion.

      Healthcare professionals who are content experts in the field will be surveyed to determine
      key information for a proposed genetic testing decision aid. Quantitative findings will guide
      the content of a patient decision aid for genetic testing.

      Aim 3. Explore patient needs for information and support related to genetic testing.

      Qualitative focus groups with patients will be conducted and analyzed using thematic
      analysis. Findings will inform the development of a patient decision aid for genetic testing
      that is responsive to the aspects which matter most to patients.
