      tolerability. Patients will receive escalated doses of tirapazamine until maximally tolerated
      dose. Embolization is performed per standard practice using Lipiodol and Gelfoam under X-ray
      guidance. Once a suitable dose is determined, an expansion cohort of 15 patients will be
      treated with the recommended phase 2 dose to determine preliminary efficacy. Expansion
      cohorts include (1) hepatocellular carcinoma, (2) metastatic solid tumors with liver
      metastasis, and (3) neuroendocrine tumor. Adverse events are evaluated by CTCAE vs. 4.0 and
      efficacy is evaluated by MRI using modified RECIST criteria and RECIST criteria.
