    
      At the primary endpoint of the study - 6 month post-operative - the vertical bone gain will
      be measured for changes.

      The changes will be evaluated by measuring the distance between the implant shoulder and the
      first visible bone contact on the implant. The measurement will be taken on the medial and
      distal aspect on the implant at site of interest. Measurements will take into account
      distortion based on changes on the radiograph from the true dimension of the implant.

      Intra-oral photographs will be taken at each study visit to document the initial appearance
      of the soft tissue and the subsequent healing of the soft tissue post-implant placement. The
      photographs will be taken buccal and occlusial at study site of interest.

      The physical appearance of soft tissue (form, colour, tissue biotype, surface aspect) will be
      clinically assessed by visual inspection.

      In addition changes in the high of the keratinized gingiva will be assessed in mm. This will
      be measured mid-crestal in buccal direction to the mucogingival border by a periodontal
      probe.

      Changes in gingival recession will be measured at the implant leading visit and the yearly
      follow-up visit 18, 30 and 42 month post surgery. The distance between the margin of the
      gingiva and the edge of the crown will be assessed at accessible buccal, palatal, distal and
      medial sites.

      A measurement of vertical defect height will be performed evaluating the distance of the
      implant shoulder to the first bone to implant contact at surgery visit and 6-month later.
