      (BBT-I) in the treatment of insomnia in humans.

      Insomnia is an extraordinarily common problem for cancer patients that is often associated
      with diminished social and vocational functioning and QOL. It is also likely that insomnia
      exacerbates other cancer-related symptoms (eg, fatigue, nausea, depressive mood, pain and/or
      reduced pain tolerance) and thus gives rise to the possibility of additive or multiplicative
      interactions. It is possible that untreated insomnia in the context of cancer therapy may
      lead to chronic forms of insomnia in cancer survivors which, in turn, independently confers
      risk for increased psychiatric and medical morbidity.

      Thus, insomnia, by itself, is a significant problem that requires better understanding in
      order that its high prevalence can be reduced.

      Developing interventions that might prevent onset of insomnia in breast cancer patients is
      vital.
