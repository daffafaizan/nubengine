      better understanding of factors contributing to malaria may be necessary for malaria vaccine
      planning. These factors include interactions between age, where malaria is passed from
      mosquitoes to people, immune system (how the body fights infection) responses and other
      factors that contribute to malaria in epidemic-prone areas. About 6400 people from the
      villages of Kapsisiywa and Kipsamoite will participate. Study procedures will include in home
      surveys, which will involve a census and an interview by researchers. Blood samples and
      smears will be collected from some volunteers in both communities to understand how the body
      protects itself from malaria and to check for malaria parasites. Twice each month, random
      houses will be selected from 3 places in the village to measure the number of mosquitoes in
      the home. Participants may be involved in the study for up to 4 years.
