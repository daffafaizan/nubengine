      be a metabolome, polyunsaturated fatty acids in particular, disrupted in its oscillations
      throughout the course of day and night. Blood and stool samples will be repeatedly taken
      during a 3-night/2-day protocol from NES patients and healthy controls with lights dimmed to
      20 lux and time cues removed. Body core temperature and physical activity during the study
      will be monitored continuously.
