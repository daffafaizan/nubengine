      indicated in the repair of all size umbilical hernias as to reduce the rate of recurrence.
      This method is regularly used in umbilical hernia reconstruction although most surgeons
      repair small hernias using suture repair (fascia adaptation). Especially risk factors for
      hernia recurrence such as hernia size and BMI > 30 kg/m2 need to be evaluated and correlated
      to the method of hernia repair.

      Study design Randomised controlled, double blinded, multi-centre trial. 300 consecutive
      patients with an umbilical hernia will be included in the study. Patients will be randomised
      in one of two groups of 150 patients each. Group 1 will include patients that will undergo
      primary (suture) repair; group 2 umbilical hernias will be repaired using a pre-peritoneal,
      flat polypropylene mesh in a tension free fashion.

      Stratification will be utilized for the size of the hernia (1-2 cm or â‰¥2-4 cm) and the
      participating centre. Patients will visit the outpatient clinic after 2-3 weeks and after 3,
      12 and 24 months.

      The cumulative hernia recurrence rate during the 2-years follow-up period will be the primary
      outcome of the study. Complications, pain and QOL are secondary endpoints.

      Statistical analysis All analyses will be performed according to the intention to treat
      principle and as specified in the protocol.

      Financial support None.
