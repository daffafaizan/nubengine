      body size (weight, height) and body mass index (BMI = kg / m ^ 2). Girls will also be given
      the time of appearance of menstruation, a factor that needs to be evaluated because the
      growth of the skeleton continues three years after its appearance. Patients will be subjected
      to Adam's Test, x-ray's and as well as lateral bending radiographs.In the first contact with
      each patient, will be evaluated bone density measured by DEXA as well as haematological
      testing including PTH, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), calcium (Ca), phosphorus( P ), Calcitonin
      and, of course, vitamin D (total and metabolite 25 (OH) D).

      Each patient's follow-up will be completed in two years by a clinical examination every six
      months and a clinical, laboratory and radiological examination per year. Patients will be
      divided into two groups. In a group with patients with normal 25 (OH) D and in a second group
      with patients with low levels of 25 (OH) D. Members of the second group will receive
      substitution treatment with an appropriate formulation. The results will be collected and
      evaluated using statistical programme.
