      to non-Asians; however, dose modification occurs more frequently in Koreans.

      -When we evaluated the rates of peginterferon α-2a and ribavirin dose modifications and their
      effect on the virologic response in Koreans, we suggested that using at least 80% of the
      peginterferon α-2a dose in Koreans not only maintains SVR but also reduces drug side effects
      during the entire treatment period and a lower dose of ribavirin may be as efficacious as a
      standard dose(Korean J Intern Med 2009;24:203-211).

      So we investigate whether the group of 80% use dosage of peginterferon alfa-2a did not show
      inferior response rather than that of 100 % use dosage group and minimize the adverse events.

      There are recently reports that Koreans have favorable IL28B SNP for CHC treatment.

      -We investigate the IL28B polymorphism in Koreans with CHC and this result can effect on the
      SVR depending on the dosage of peginterferon alfa 2a
