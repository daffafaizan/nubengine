      UltheraÂ® system to improve the appearance of scar tissue on the neck, abdomen or back.
      Changes from baseline of the Patient Observer Scar Assessment Scale score will be assessed at
      study follow-up visits. Images will be obtained prior to treatment and at each follow up
      visit. Patient satisfaction questionnaires will also be obtained.
