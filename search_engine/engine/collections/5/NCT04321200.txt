      improves long-term outcomes. However, the investigators are currently held back by
      inadequacies of available clinical tests to measure and predict impairment. Existing tests
      are hard to administer, require specialized training, and have limited long-term predictive
      value. There is a critical need to develop an objective, accurate, easy-to-use tool for the
      early prediction of long-term physical disability. The field of pediatrics and infant
      development would greatly benefit from a quantitative score that would correlate with
      existing clinical measures used today to detect movement impairments in very young infants.
      To realize a new generation of tests that will be easy to administer, the investigators will
      obtain large datasets of infants playing in an instrumented gym or simply being recorded
      while moving in a supine posture. Video and sensor data analyses will convert movement into
      feature vectors based on our knowledge of the problem domain. Our approach will use machine
      learning to relate these feature vectors to currently recommended clinical tests or other
      ground truth information. The power of this design is that algorithms can utilize many
      aspects of movement to produce the relevant scores.
