      CHOICES preconception intervention (CHOICES-TEEN) in reducing the risk of HIV,
      nicotine-exposed pregnancy (NEP), and alcohol-exposed pregnancy (AEP) in adolescent females
      on intensive community probation. The current study posits that a two-session CHOICES
      intervention adapted to target multiple bundled health risks-AEP, NEP, and HIV-will be
      feasible, acceptable, and promising in reducing these risks among females on community-based
      juvenile probation. This study will: Aim 1: Modify the efficacious CHOICES preconception
      intervention to target the prevention of HIV, AEP, and NEP. The result will be a two session
      individual intervention (CHOICES-TEEN) and accompanying therapy manual based on the
      Transtheoretical Model (TTM) and Motivational Interviewing. Aim 2: Conduct a one-arm
      feasibility trial with females in the juvenile justice system to assess the promise of
      CHOICES-TEEN. This pilot study will: 1) demonstrate the feasibility of delivering
      CHOICES-TEEN with master's level mental health professionals within a juvenile justice
      setting; 2) determine acceptance of CHOICES-TEEN as measured by client adherence, retention,
      and treatment satisfaction; and 3) assess client improvement at 3-month follow-up (e.g.,
      reduction of risk of HIV, NEP, and AEP). This study will inform subsequent Stage II/III
      behavioral intervention studies and contribute to a missing, fundamental element in the
      knowledge base - further understanding of the feasibility of targeting bundled health risks
      in high-risk adolescents, and the potential promise of a gender-specific intervention for
      this population.
