      These characteristics include appropriate bone quality and a healthy adherent keratinized
      gingiva that surrounds the implant neck. The most common complications are peri-implant
      diseases and marginal bone loss for dental implants. Marginal bone loss around the implant
      may be observed as a long-term complication due to microbial dental plaque-induced
      peri-implant inflammatory disease or may be observed in the absence of such a disease.

      The immune system and genetic factors are known to have important effects on implant success,
      and ABO blood types are also included in the genetic factors. In the studies evaluating the
      association of ABO blood types with increased susceptibility to infection and various
      systemic diseases, it was reported that the percentages of blood types differed
      significantly, especially in skeletal-muscle system injuries, fractures and cardiovascular
      disease susceptibility. Also some researchers reported that blood types may be effective on
      the bacteria colonization which is the main reason of the periodontal diseases. ABO blood
      types may have an impact on dental implant success and survival.
