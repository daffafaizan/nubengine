      band ligation or sclerotherapy along with vasoactive drugs like Terlipressin or Octreotide.
      The risk of re-bleeding is highest during the initial 5 days from first presentation.
      Terlipressin is usually given for 3 days (72 hours). In this study we are trying to prove
      that among low to moderate risk patients, a short course of 1 day (24 hours) of Terlipressin
      is as effective as 3 days (72 hours) in preventing re-bleed once bleeding has been controlled
      with endoscopic therapy. This intervention will save 2 days cost incurred on the Terlipressin
      and may also help in decreasing the length of hospital stay in future.
