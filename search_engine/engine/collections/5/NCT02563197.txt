    
      The aim of the study is to measure inspiratory profiles of patients with non-Cystic fibrosis
      bronchiectasis using the breath activated T-326 Inhaler.

      The following parameters will be derived from the inspiratory profiles:

        -  Peak Inspiratory Flow (PIF, in L/min)

        -  Inspiratory Volume (V, in L)

        -  Inspiratory Time (t, in s).
