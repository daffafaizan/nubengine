      HIV centers scattered throughout France. The Dataids cohort is an ongoing collaboration and
      patients have been enrolled into the study since 2010; the data are collected from the
      clinics as part of routine care. Included patients should be patients who had a scheduled
      visit in the outpatient clinic regardless of CD4 cell count, HIV viral load or ART status.
      For all HIV patients enrolled and under follow up, demographic data, immunological and
      virological data, serological evidence for infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis
      C virus (HCV), or syphilis, laboratory, therapeutic and clinical data are collected annually.
