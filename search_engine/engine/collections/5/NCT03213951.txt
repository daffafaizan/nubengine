    
      Primary Objective To assess beta ray detection of prostate cancer ex-vivo using experimental
      beta probe immediately after prostate cancer removal as determined by pathologist.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Compare preoperative standard of care staging via CT or MRI to 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (CT or
           MRI) findings.

        -  Compare preoperative 68Ga-PSMA-11 PET (CT or MRI) lesion measurements with postoperative
           high-resolution PET of ex-vivo tissue.

        -  To compare the findings of each of the 68Ga-PSMA-11 detection methods to the surgical
           observations and the clinical tissue histopathology findings.

      Exploratory Objective Correlation of beta probe measurements with preoperative 68Ga-PSMA-11
      PET (CT or MRI) lesion measurements, postoperative PET/CT ex-vivo images, surgical
      observations, and pathology findings.
