    
      40 biological fathers of children age 2 months or younger who are currently cohabitating with
      the child's mother will be scanned on two separate occasions. The optional second visit will
      occur after 2 months have passed since the first scan. In the first visit, fathers will
      receive two MRI scans, one before and one after completing one of the two interventions.
      Prior to the MRI scan, a blood sample will be collected for measurement of hormone levels.
      Fathers will be positioned in the MRI scanner where they will receive structural and
      functional MRI scans of their brain while they listen to auditory stimuli: unknown cries, own
      cries, and tone controls. Blood sample collection and intervention will not be conducted
      during the second visit.
