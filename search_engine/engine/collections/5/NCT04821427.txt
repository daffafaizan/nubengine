    
      This study seeks to develop and provide an initial test of a brief intervention to reduce
      alcohol use and sex risk behavior among Black and Latino men who have sex with men [BLMSM].
      The study seeks to recruit BLMSM who are non-monogamous, not currently on pre-exposure
      prophylaxis [PrEP], have engaged in condomless anal intercourse over the past 6 months, who
      have engaged in heavy drinking defined as >14 drinks per week or at least 1 heavy drinking
      episode (5+ drinks on a single occasion) in the past month. All participants will complete
      baseline measures about past month behavior and if eligible will be assigned to the
      intervention condition or an assessment only condition. The intervention consists of a single
      brief video-conferencing intervention coupled with 4 weeks of mobile-messaging related to
      individualized goals about alcohol use and sexual behavior. Follow-up assessments are
      scheduled for 4 weeks after baseline (upon completion of the mobile-messaging component of
      the intervention) and 2 months after baseline. Primary outcomes are feasibility and
      acceptability of the intervention and mobile-messaging components. Secondary outcomes are
      changes in frequency of condomless anal intercourse and heavy drinking episodes.
