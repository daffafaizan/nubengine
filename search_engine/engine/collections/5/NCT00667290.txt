      improved peripheral circulation following infrainguinal revascularization. Despite this
      hemodynamic benefit, little change in functional status occurs, and many patients have
      residual ambulatory dysfunction. The lack of functional improvement in revascularized
      patients may be due to extreme physical deconditioning secondary to their pre-existing
      critical limb-threatening ischemia. Therefore, we hypothesize that a program of aerobic
      exercise training is necessary to optimize ambulation, free-living daily physical activity,
      and health-related quality of life through the mechanisms of improved walking economy,
      peripheral circulation, and cardiopulmonary function.

      This is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial comparing an exercise group
      undergoing a program of graded treadmill walking, and a non-exercise control group. Eighty
      PAD patients will be randomized into either the exercise group (N = 40) or the non-exercise
      control group (N = 40) following successful lower extremity arterial bypass or angioplasty.
      The 3-month exercise program will consist of graded treadmill walking 3 times per week with
      progressive increments in exercise duration from 15 to 40 minutes, and progressive increments
      in exercise intensity from 50 to 80% of exercise capacity.
