      cost of health service for preterm baby without necrotizing enterocolitis and with
      necrotizing enterocolitis 74,004 $-198,040 $ respectively.Babies surviving from necrotizing
      enterocolitis are at risk of long term complication such as short bowel syndrome and
      intestinal stricture.Furthermore, impairment of neurodevelopment and growth are usually
      observed in these babies.In spite of decades of researches on the disease, pathogenesis of
      necrotizing enterocolitis still unclear. We still don't know how to prevent and treat the
      disease. However, advancement of researches in the field of microbiology and cellular biology
      of the intestine of preterm infants could lead to more understanding for early diagnosis,
      prevention and proper treatment. Enteral feeding in preterm pigs lead to upregulation of
      inflammatory and pattern recognition receptor genes including interleukin8 and Toll like
      receptor-4 with corresponding condensation of chromatin configuration that lead to initiation
      of inflammatory process and development of necrotizing enterocolitis. It is not known if
      these changes are present in human preterm bowel.T cell effector function in preterm infant
      immune response is characterised by preponderance of interleukin-8 producing T-cells and has
      the potential to activate neutrophils and γδ T cells.γδ T cells are predominant
      intra-epithelial lymphocyte in immature preterm gut and has a role in maintaining intestinal
      integrity.
