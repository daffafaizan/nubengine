      I. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity, maximum feasible dose, and recommended phase II dose
      of cilengitide (EMD 121974) in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma.

      II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. II. Determine the
      antineoplastic activity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive cilengitide (EMD 121974) IV continuously on weeks 1-4. Courses repeat every
      4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6
      patients receive escalating doses of EMD 121974 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.
