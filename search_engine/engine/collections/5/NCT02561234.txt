      Sequential cohorts of patients will receive AEB1102 IV weekly at one of a series of
      increasing dose levels. Dose escalation will be dependent on the frequency of specific
      dose-limiting toxicities in the prior cohort of patients. The study will determine the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of AEB1102, evaluate the safety profile of the compound, assess
      the pharmacokinetic profile of AEB1102, determine the effect of AEB1102 on blood arginine
      levels and evaluate the anti-tumor activity of AEB1102.

      Following the determination of the MTD, additional cohorts of patients with uveal, cutaneous
      melanoma and small cell lung cancer will be enrolled and treated with AEB1102 at the MTD.
