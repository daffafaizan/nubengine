      Population: ED patients with altered mental status (AMS) Intervention: Micro-EEG Comparison:
      Standard EEG Outcomes: 1. Sensitivity, specificity, positive/negative likelihood ratios of
      micro-EEG in identifying non-convulsive seizures and abnormal brain activities 2. The
      concordance of EEG interpretations between micro-EEG and standard EEGs recordings Design
      Prospective cross-sectional

      Definitions:

      Altered Mental Status: Any acute change in level of arousability or responsiveness (e.g.
      confusion, lethargy, delirium, coma, aphasia, disinhibition, labile/blunted affect or
      unexpected psychosis).

      Types of AMS (for the purpose of the study):

        1. AMS alone

        2. AMS with non-specific motor activity (subtle motor movement such as eye blinking,
           nystagmus, focal motor movements, or myoclonus)

        3. Prolonged AMS following one or more tonic-clonic seizures suggesting status epilepticus
           Non-convulsive seizure (NCZ):A seizure without clonic or tonic activity or other
           convulsive motor activity.

      Status Epilepticus (SE):SE is defined as 1. More than 30 minutes of continuous seizure
      activity or 2. Two or more sequential seizures without recovery of consciousness between
      seizures.
