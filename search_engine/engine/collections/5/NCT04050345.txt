      tumour. In colorectal cancer, primary tumours & metastases exhibit high genomic concordance.
      Therefore the TRACC study is investigating whether in patients with stage II and III
      colorectal cancer that have undergone potentially curative surgery, blood samples to detect &
      quantify ctDNA may identify minimal residual disease and relapse earlier than existing
      methods. CtDNA may ultimately help identify a subset of patients that are or are unlikely to
      benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy and could therefore safely spare some patients from
      receiving unnecessary chemotherapy & its associated side-effects.
