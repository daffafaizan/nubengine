    
      This non-interventional observational study included 80 patients aged 3 to 11 years who were
      hospitalized with influenza and acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) symptoms at any
      time from the onset of the disease (up to 15 days) and who were prescribed the interferon
      inducer Kagocel as an antiviral medicine.

      The diagnosis of influenza and ARVI was confirmed in accordance with the world health
      organization (who) guidelines for the pharmacological treatment of pandemic influenza A
      (H1N1) 2009 and other influenza viruses.

      All patient examinations are conducted in accordance with local routine clinical practice and
      local and international standards of care.

      After the end of treatment, the following data were collected and analyzed:

        -  demography

        -  disease severity

        -  anamnesis data (data of influenza vaccination in the current season; pre-school
           facilities visits; previous contacts with a patient with influenza / ARVI; previous
           antiviral therapy for the current episode of the disease; concomitant diseases)

        -  body temperature (morning/evening)

        -  chills and fever (cumulative score based on all symptoms: 0-no symptoms, 1-mild,
           2-moderate, 3-severe)

        -  intoxication symptom (cumulative score based on all symptoms: 0-no symptoms, 1-mild,
           2-moderate, 3-severe)

        -  catarrhal symptoms (cumulative score based on all symptoms: 0 - no symptoms, 1-mild,
           2-moderate, 3-severe)

        -  timelines: the beginning of the disease, the first visit to the doctor, the beginning of
           treatment, the duration of the disease

        -  determination the causative agent by PCR (on presentation of patients and their
           discharge on 5-6 days from start of therapy)

        -  antiviral therapy (Kagocel dose depending on age)

        -  symptomatic treatment of the current episode of influenza or ARVI before and during the
           patient's hospitalization

        -  bacterial exacerbations (Yes/no)

        -  treatment of bacterial exacerbations (drug name)

        -  adverse events
