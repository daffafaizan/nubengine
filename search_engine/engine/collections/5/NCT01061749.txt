    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of the combination of AZD6244 and IMC-A12 in advanced
      solid tumors that have progressed on standard therapy.

      II. Finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended phase II dose of the combination.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore preliminary evidence of efficacy of the combination of AZD6244 and IMC-A12 in
      advanced solid tumors using RECIST criteria for tumor response.

      II. Define pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of the combination of IMC-A12 and AZD6244.

      III. Correlate pharmacokinetics (PK) of the combination of IMC-A12 and AZD6244 to
      pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints.

      IV. Assess the PK/PD (phospho-S6) link with AZD6244 when administered in combination with
      IMC-A12.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of selumetinib and cixutumumab.

      Patients receive selumetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and cixutumumab
      intravenously (IV) on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
