      obstetrical complications, from bleeding to recurrent miscarriages or thrombosis. Data on
      fibrinogen levels variations throughout the pregnancy and on the delivery management are
      lacking. In this observational study will be include adult women with pas obstetrical
      history. A general questionnaire on demographics and clinical data will be filled out by the
      patient's physician. A detailed questionnaire on obstetrical data will also be completed
      contacting the patient in case of lacking data.
