      children outgrow their milk allergies; however, the exact mechanisms by which food tolerance
      is achieved are unknown. Strict avoidance of the offending food is currently the only known
      therapy. However, some have been known to tolerate milk products cooked at high heat such as
      when baked in foods.

      This clinical trial involves a diet containing extensively baked milk protein to investigate
      the effects of ingestion of heat-denatured milk on development of oral tolerance to non-baked
      milk.
