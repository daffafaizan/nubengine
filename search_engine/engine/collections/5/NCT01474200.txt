      removal by AQ reduces HF rehospitalizations at 90 days as well as the length of these HF
      rehospitalizations. In the "Ultrafiltration Versus Intravenous Diuretics for Patients
      Hospitalized for Acute Decompensated Heart Failure" (UNLOAD) study, the 90 day HF
      re-hospitalizations were pre-specified secondary end-points. AVOID-HF is designed with a
      primary end-point to determine if AQ reduces the number of HF events (Rehospitalization or
      unscheduled outpatient or emergency room treatment for HF) after discharge from index
      hospitalization compared to IV loop diuretics. AVOID will also explore days alive and out of
      the hospital as a secondary end-point, which was not done in UNLOAD. In other words, the
      AVOID-HF study is going beyond studying only the amount of fluid removal and will explore
      whether the modality of fluid removal influences HF outcomes.
