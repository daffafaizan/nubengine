    
      This is a multicenter, two-part study in pediatric (ages 6 to 18 years) patients diagnosed
      with autism.

      Patients participating in Part One will receive a single open-label dose of memantine. Blood
      samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected.

      Part Two is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled 12-week efficacy and safety study
      evaluating change in all core domains (social interactions, communication, and restricted
      interests and repetitive behaviors) of autism.

      In the Forest autism trials conducted in children ages 6-12, dosing with an extended release
      formulation of memantine was weight-based. These weight based dose limits were selected to
      ensure exposure in terms of area under the curve (AUC) was less than the predefined limit of
      2100 ng∙h/mL that represented a 10-fold lower exposure than observed at the NOAEL (No
      observed adverse effect level) of 15 mg/kg/day in juvenile rats.

      The weight-based dose limits in these studies were as follows:

        -  Group A: ≥ 60 kg; max 15 mg/day

        -  Group B: 40-59 kg; max 9 mg/day

        -  Group C: 20-39 kg; max 6 mg/day

        -  Group D: < 20 kg; max 3 mg/day
