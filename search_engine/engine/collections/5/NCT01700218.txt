      and impaired prognosis for survival. Neither a sole mobile nurse support nor a sole
      telemonitoring system has been able to provide consistent data on a beneficial influence on
      prognosis. Furthermore, the influence of frequent measurements of NT-pro-BNP in a home
      setting of heart failure patients has not been investigated so far.

      This study will test a new medical device (software) for optimizing treatment of heart
      failure patients and evaluate its impact on outcome of these patients.
