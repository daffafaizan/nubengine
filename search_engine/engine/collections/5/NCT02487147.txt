      dissemination mechanisms for pathogens. Public health strategies to prevent and control the
      often explosive outbreaks associated with such pathogens are: 1) vaccination and treatment,
      if available, 2) decontamination of the exposed areas and surfaces, and 3) isolation and
      barrier precautions such as face masks. Unfortunately, evidence of the efficacy of currently
      recommended barrier precautions is currently lacking.

      Attempts to validate the effectiveness of personal protective equipment are limited to in
      vitro experiments with mannequin heads. This human exposure study will provide a much more
      accurate life-like exposure scenario. The use of live attenuated influenza virus vaccine has
      been proven to be safe.

      Objectives: Evaluate the Free Air Portable Air Powered Respirator (PAPR) versus an N95 face
      mask for preventing the airborne cross-transmission of aerosolized influenza in human
      participants.

      Methods: Participants will be randomized to one of two arms: a) N95 respirator, or b) Free
      Air PAPR System. The primary outcome will be the rate of the transmission for the 2 study
      groups, so a nasal and nasopharyngeal swab will be performed immediately following the
      exposure.
