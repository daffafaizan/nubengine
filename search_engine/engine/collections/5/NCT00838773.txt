    
      For over 4 years, our international collaborative research team has carried out a social
      network HIV prevention intervention trial with community populations of young men who have
      sex with men (YMSM), disadvantaged ethnic minority Roma (Gypsies), and high-risk heterosexual
      adult (YHA) women and men in Hungary, Bulgaria and Russia. Eastern Europe has seen a sharp
      increase in HIV incidence, and social network interventions are high in cultural relevance
      because post-communist populations have a long history of trusting and relying upon their
      personal networks more than their governments. Across the three countries represented in our
      research during the past funding period, we enrolled social networks of YMSM, Roma, and YHAs.
      This study will renew our international collaboration to extend this network intervention
      approach. Our study, to date, has worked with very small independent friendship groups
      (usually composed of 5-6 people) as "egocentric" social networks.
