      I. To estimate the proportion of patients who achieve a clinically significant improvement in
      erectile dysfunction (ED) when treated with a combination of atorvastatin or patient's
      currently prescribed statin, vitamin E, and pentoxifylline (PAVE).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To report the safety profile of PAVE. II. To report the rate of choosing other ED
      treatments after PAVE.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive atorvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD) for up to 6 weeks in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Beginning week 7, patients receive atorvastatin
      PO QD, vitamin E PO QD, and pentoxifylline PO thrice daily (TID) for up to 12 months in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
