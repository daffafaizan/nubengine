      pneumonia. These complications increase the length of stay and the immobility time. The
      investigators aim was to assess the impact of early mobilization of fluids drainage of chest
      tubes and the incidence of pulmonary complications. A prospective, randomized study included
      101 patients divided in three groups. In the Control Group (CG:n=33) the patients were seated
      in armchair in the first 48 hours postoperative time. The Group (TRCL n=34) a Continuous
      Rotational Bed Therapy was instituted six hours post extubation in the first 24 hours and it
      comprised with by consecutive cycles of lateral rotation to the left and right side, and
      supine position with 30 seconds for pauses (using a Hill Rom Rotational Bed Device) witch
      stopped when need to perform routine measurements the hemodynamics measurements and clinical
      controls by nursing crew.The group ( ORT n=33) following the sequential steps T1: sitting in
      the bed for 2 hours, T2: sitting on the bed with their feet on the floor for 2 minutes and
      T3: the patients stoos up and walked on the spot for 2 minutes. Hemodynamics and oxygenation
      measurement before and after each intervention.
