    
      This is a Phase 1 clinical trial that constitutes two time points cohorts with participants
      who will receive intravenous autologous umbilical cord blood and 0.9% sodium chloride
      respectively. The timing of treatment is any time after the diagnosis of autism spectrum
      disorder. The investigator will proceed the groups during the same period.

        1. Demographic Data and Baseline Characteristics of the Studied Group were collected:

             -  Basic patient's information survey

             -  Medical history

             -  Physical examination

             -  Basic blood test result

             -  Autism Behavior Checklist,CARS before the treatment

             -  Brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging-Diffusion Tensor Imaging (MRIDTI) before the
                treatment

             -  Neurocognitive function test before the treatment

        2. Assessment of clinical condition in the course by measurement of blood pressure, heart
           and respiratory rates, temperature and adverse events was recorded.

        3. Autologous cord blood doses is 20-30ml (total Mononuclear cells# 1*10^7/kg)#the infusion
           speed is 1ml/min, and with same volume of 0.9% sodium chloride as placebo.

        4. The follow-up: clinical test until 24th month in 3 month gaps.
