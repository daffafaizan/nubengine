    
      This open-label Phase I study aims to define the recommended dose for further clinical
      development the NKR-2 treatment administered concurrently with AZA in treatment-na√Øve AML/MDS
      patients not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy. The treatment consists in six
      consecutive cycles of AZA, administered at days

        1. to 7 of a 28-day cycle. Patients will be treated with 8 injections of NKR-2 at day 9 and
           23 of AZA cycles 2-3-4 and 5.

           This Phase I study is divided into three sequential cohorts evaluating three different
           dose-levels of NKR-2 (1x108, 3x108 and 1x109 NKR-2 per injection) using a 3+3 design.
           Further patients will be enrolled at the RecD to reach 9 evaluable patients in total at
           the RecD. The study consists of a screening phase, a treatment administration phase and
           a follow-up phase divided into treatment follow-up (TFU) and long-term safety follow-up
           (LTSFU). For each patient who received at least one NKR-

        2. administration, the overall study duration will be 15 years after first NKR-

      2 administration. Patients will be asked to complete a total of 54 visits during the
      treatment administration phase, and 5 visits during the treatment follow-up phase. During the
      LTSFU, yearly visits will be scheduled (up to Visit Y15).
