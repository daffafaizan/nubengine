      in polypharmacy and inappropriate prescriptions. According to different evaluations, between
      25 and 75% of patients aged 75 or older are exposed to 5 or more drugs. There is increasing
      evidence that polypharmacy can cause more harm than good, especially in elderly people, due
      to factors such as drug-drug and drug-disease interactions.

      Many strategies were proposed to reduce polypharmacy and inappropriate prescribing, but there
      is little evidence to show benefit. There is an urgent need to implement effective
      strategies. The application methodology must be simple so that it does not fail in daily
      practice.

      For the current plan, an electronic medical record, named "DrApp", will be used, which will
      include a drug interaction program, (Interax-AI), which will automatically indicate the
      medication prescriptions that involve a risk for the patient.

      All outpatient indications followed by physicians using the DrApp electronic history will be
      registered. The indications will be compared in the 4 months prior to the incorporation of
      the Interax-AI program with the 4 months after the incorporation of the program. Between both
      stages a period of 2 weeks will be established in which the data will not be recorded. The
      minimum & maximum number of patients that will be included in each stage are 100 & 200.

      The primary end point is to compare the total number of indications per inpatient, before the
      availability of the Interax-AI program and after the application of this program.

      The objective is to evaluate if the computer program of detection of drug interactions allows
      to limit the polypharmacy in outpatients.
