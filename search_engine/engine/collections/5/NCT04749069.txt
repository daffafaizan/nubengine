      moderate level of sedation and monitored anesthesia care to prevent pain and anxiety of
      patients during the procedure. According to the American Society of Anesthesiologist Physical
      Status Score, monitored anesthesia care is a planned procedure where a patient undergoes
      local anesthetic infiltration together with sedation and analgesia. Remifentanil is a potent
      synthetic opioid with novel pharmacokinetic properties, including very rapid onset and an
      ultra short duration of action, making it effective for pain relief in short procedures.
      Remifentanil can be administered as either one of the techniques of intravenous continuous
      infusion (CI) or intravenous bolus patient-controlled sedation analgesia (PCSA).In previous
      studies, the insertion or removal of venous access procedures required either local
      anesthesia or low doses of orally administered anxiolytic medication. The infusion of
      remifentanil may cause respiratory depression and analgesic efficacy and safety of
      administration of remifentanil infusion and/or bolus doses of remifentanil during the
      administration of one of the techniques of either CI or PCSA in short term procedures has not
      been well studied. The prospective trials that compare analgesic efficacy and adverse events
      related to intravenous remifentanil consumption in sedation and analgesia of short procedures
      are very limited.

      This study aims to compare level of pain and sedation, total amount of remifentanil
      consumption, bolus doses of remifentanil, patient and surgeon satisfaction, hemodynamic data
      and adverse events of two different techniques of intravenous remifentanil use such as;
      intravenous continuous infusion (CI) or intravenous bolus patient-controlled sedation
      analgesia (PCSA) in patients under moderate level of sedation for vascular access procedures.
