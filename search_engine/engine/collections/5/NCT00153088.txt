    
      A prospective, randomised, double-blind, multicentric and comparative study to investigate,
      on a long-term basis, the preventive effect on the transition to overt nephropathy and the
      safety of Telmisartan (Micardis) against placebo in patients with diabetic nephropathy,
      manifesting microalbuminuria associated with type II diabetes.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The hypothesis is that Telmisartan (Micardis) at 40 mg or 80 mg versus placebo control in
      patients with concurrent type II diabetic mellitus or diabetic nephropathy demonstrating
      microalbuminuria, has the preventive effect on transition from incipient to overt
      nephropathy.

      Comparison(s):

      The primary endpoint is defined as the transition from incipient to overt nephropathy, and
      the non-transition curve will be demonstrated based on the Kaplan-Meier method. The
      evaluation criteria for the point to transition to overt nephropathy is defined as urinary
      albumin to creatinine ratios at consecutive 2 measuring points increasing over 300
      mg/g-Creatinine and excess 30% increase comparing with the baseline value. The curve of
      non-transition will be compared with Logrank test. Those in BIBR277 groups are sequentially
      compared with that in the placebo group by the closed testing procedure.
