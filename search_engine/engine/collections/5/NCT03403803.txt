    
      The objective of this proposed study is to determine the expression levels of a panel of
      markers including CD133, CD44, ABCC3, TNFRSF1A, AKT1, IDH2, and MGMT in GBM tissues and the
      CSF, blood, and saliva from patients with GBM receiving different types of treatment (Optune
      only or Optune with TMZ) and the non-brain tumor patients (controls). Our aims are: 1) To
      compare the differences of CD44 between the control group and the combined cancer groups at
      baseline; and 2) To compare the levels of CD44 and other markers among the 3 different groups
      such as control vs. GBM patients and Optune vs. Optune + TMZ after 8 weeks of treatment.
      Exploratory analysis of all other markers will be performed.
