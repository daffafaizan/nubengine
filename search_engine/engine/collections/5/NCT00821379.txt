      PCOS is a heterogeneous condition in which metabolic disturbances such as insulin resistance
      are common. Pregnancies in women with PCOS are reported to have an increased chance of being
      complicated by gestational diabetes, pregnancy induced hypertension and pre-eclampsia.
      Subsequently their offspring are reported to have a lower birth weight and higher risk of
      admission to a neonatal intensive care unit. However, the cause of increased complication
      rate is not yet identified.

      There is evidence that intra-uterine conditions as well as pre- and periconception factors
      influence not only neonatal outcome, but also long-term health of the child. Therefore early
      detection and treatment of pregnancy complications is important for both mother and child.

      In order to identify high risk PCOS pregnancies, the specific effects of PCOS on pregnancy in
      comparison to the background effects need further investigation.

      Preconceptional risk assessment of PCOS women is needed to improve antenatal health care and
      pregnancy outcome of PCOS pregnancies in the future.

      Objective of the study:

      To design a multivariate prediction model of pregnancy outcome in women with PCOS with the
      intention to define intervention strategies for the future.

      Study design:

      Prospective multi-centre follow-up cohort study.

      Method:

      Women with PCOS will be screened and included in the study pre-conceptionally.
      Endocrinological values, glucose tolerance and ultrasound scan etc will be recorded. During
      pregnancy, blood samples will be stored regularly and glucose measurement will be done.
      Post-partum the pregnancy outcome will be recorded.
