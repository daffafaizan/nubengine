      investigational drug KAF156 and a Solid Dispersion Formulation of lumefantrine (LUM-SDF) when
      administered in combination once daily for two days in pediatric patients 6 months to < 18
      years of age with uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria. In addition, pharmacokinetics
      (PK) of the drug combination will also be evaluated.

      There will be three age-descending cohorts: Run-in Cohort, Cohort 1 and Cohort 2.

      It is important to understand the impact of food on exposure. In adult healthy volunteers,
      LUM-SDF alone has shown a food effect whereas KAF156 does not have a food effect. This new
      study will first explore the effect of food on lumefantrine and KAF156 PK in malaria patients
      12 to < 18 years old with malaria caused by P. falciparum before younger patients are
      assessed.

      Then, efficacy, safety and tolerability of the combination of KAF156 and LUM-SDF will be
      evaluated in younger patients with and without food, first in Cohort 1 of patients 2 to < 12
      years old and then in Cohort 2 of patients 6 months to < 2 years old.
