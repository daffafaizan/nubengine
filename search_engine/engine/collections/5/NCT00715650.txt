      participants assigned to Benefits Counseling and to those assigned to the control condition,
      VA Orientation. Benefits Counseling is an adaptation of two counseling approaches to foster
      veterans' involvement in work and work-related activity compared to the control condition, VA
      Orientation. The first approach helped recipients of Social Security disability benefits for
      psychiatric illness return to work in part by alleviating beneficiaries' concerns that they
      would lose their benefits if they worked. The second approach is a Motivational Interviewing
      approach that showed great promise in engaging veterans with psychiatric disabilities in
      compensated work therapy.
