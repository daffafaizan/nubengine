      associated tamponade, either acutely after Transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI)
      completion, or delayed, in association with the electrode removal.

      The tamponade rate in patients with a temporary pacemaker(PMK) was 14/150 (9.3%). Not all
      tamponade cases were related to the temporary PMK, 2 occurred in the setting of catastrophic
      annular rupture and one of the first cases was related to the Left Ventricle stiff wire.

      The investigators also noted a significant prolongation of bed rest and hospital stay in
      patients with temporary PMK.

      Using a flexible permanent pacing electrode which is actively fixed to the Right Ventricle
      and is placed through the jugular vein will reduce pacing-related complication rates (due to
      the flexibility of the electrode), time to ambulation (due to the fixation of the electrode),
      hospital stay and also unnecessary PMK. Cost will also be reduced due to prevention of
      complications and reduction in Intensive Cardiac Care Unit time.

      Procedure time might be slightly prolonged since the placement of the standard electrode is
      more timely, however this prolongation is negligible, and the benefits of the flexible
      permanent pacing electrode are worth this prolongation
