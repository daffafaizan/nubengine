      estimate body fat percentage with equivalent accuracy to a whole body dual energy x-ray
      absorptiometry scan. The dual energy x-ray absorptiometry scan involves lying on a machine
      for about 6-10 minutes. It is an open design. The study will also examine whether waist
      circumference measurement improves the accuracy of the body fat percentage estimate by the
      computer vision-based application.A total of approximately 492 subjects are planned to take
      part in this study at one study center.
