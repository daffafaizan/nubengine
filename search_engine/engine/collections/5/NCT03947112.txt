      participation in physical activity plays a key role in the management. Paradoxically,
      patients with severe neuromuscular disease like DMD, have considerable limitations to
      participate in such activities. Limitation may be muscle weakness, pain, fatigue, reduced
      mobility and overall function, and also limited knowledge of physical activity benefits among
      health care personnel. Limited participation leads to a sedentary lifestyle, and gradual
      under-use of still functioning muscles may cause secondary deterioration in DMD.

      The current physical activity level amongst Norwegian DMD's are unknown, and physical
      activity registration and self-reported questionnaire will be examined in this study.
