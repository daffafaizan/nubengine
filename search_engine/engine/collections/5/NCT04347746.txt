    
      Using clinical criteria and ENMG, individuals will be divided into a clinical group when they
      have a mild and / or moderate degree of involvement in the hands and a surgical group when
      the impairment intensity is severe in at least one hand.

      The individuals in the clinical group will be randomized into two groups, with one group
      starting with stretching and a second group starting with hook-assisted myofascial
      manipulation. After four weeks of initial therapy and one week of wash-out the assessment
      tests described above will be applied. The groups will be inverted, maintaining the duration
      and frequency of the previous stage of the proposed therapies. After four weeks with a week
      of wash-out the tests will be reapplied in order to evaluate the therapeutic response.

      Individuals with severe idiopathic CTS will undergo surgery using a standard open technique
      with local anesthesia and after four weeks, randomization will be made for postoperative
      treatment on both hands by stretching or myofascial manipulation in the same manner described
      for the clinical group.

      Questionnaires will be applied in order to understand the patient's symptoms, functions, pain
      and quality of life. In addition, tests will be used to assess hand strength, sensitivity and
      hand ability.
