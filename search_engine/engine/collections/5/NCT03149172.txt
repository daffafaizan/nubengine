    
      This is a pilot prospective clinical trial in which histological and micro CT analysis will
      be utilized to compare between Endobon®, Equimatrix®, and Bio-Oss®.

      Primary aim: Compare the percentage of newly formed bone between Equimatrix®, Bio-Oss® and
      Endobon®.

      The investigators hypothesize that the mean percentage of newly formed bone from Equimatrix®
      will be higher than Bio-Oss® and/or Endobon®.

      Secondary aim: Compare the bone density between Equimatrix®, Bio-Oss® and Endobon®.

      The investigators hypothesize that the bone density from Equimatrix® will be higher than
      Bio-Oss® and/or Endobon®.
