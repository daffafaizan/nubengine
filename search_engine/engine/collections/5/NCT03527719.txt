    
      China Rural Hypertension Control (CRHC) Project is a cluster randomized trial to test the
      effectiveness of a standard treatment protocol on hypertension control and cardiovascular
      events.The investigators will select a total of 326 villages in China: 282 in the
      northeastern, 25 in central, and 19 in western China.The investigators will recruit 33,995
      participants with hypertension who are aged 40-years and older. The study villages will be
      randomly assigned to the standard protocol treatment group (163 villages) or the usual
      management group (163 villages). The village doctors in the intervention group will be
      trained to manage hypertension using a standard protocol based on the new hypertension
      treatment guideline and those in the control group will not receive training on the standard
      treatment protocol. The standard treatment protocol is based on the 2017 ACC(American College
      of Cardiology)/AHA(American Heart Association) hypertension treatment guideline and our
      previous experience in hypertension management and treatment strategies in rural China. Blood
      pressure and other clinical outcomes will be followed up every six months. The project has
      two phases. The first one will last for 18 months and blood pressure control is the primary
      outcome. The phase 2 will last for 36 months and cardiovascular event rate is the primary
      outcome.
