      for HCV negative patients. Following lung transplantation patients will undergo HCV antibody,
      virus PCR, and liver function testing. Recipients whom test positive for HCV viremia for 2
      consecutive tests at any point will complete 12 weeks of Sofosbuvir/velpatasvir therapy.

      This initial study would enroll 20 patients and utilize donors that are young, otherwise
      healthy whom are Hepatitis C antibody positive but Nucleic Acid Amplification Testing (NAT)
      negative (HCV Ab+/NAT-). The recipients would be limited to those patients who have
      previously consented to receive a high risk lung transplant, consented to participant in this
      study, and who are physiologically optimized for transplantation (e.g., low risk for lung
      transplantation).
