      improving blood counts in patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) and atypical
      chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).

      Although a number of agents have been used to treat these diseases, most patients do not
      respond to treatment. Imatinib has been shown in clinical trials to induce high rates of
      responses in patients with chronic phase CML. Imatinib has also been shown to be effective in
      inducing responses in a subset of patients with CMML and atypical CML and is also effective
      in a subset of patients with idiopathic hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES), another
      myeloproliferative disorder. Because patients with several different myeloproliferative
      diseases have been shown to experience dramatic responses to imatinib, we would like to
      determine what proportion of patients with atypical myeloproliferative diseases (CMML and
      atypical CML) will respond to this agent.

      Prior to enrollment, a thorough clinical evaluation will be performed. A baseline bone marrow
      will be obtained to exclude acute leukemia or lymphoma and to assess the degree and nature of
      the myeloproliferation. In order to minimize bone marrow suppression, other myelosuppressive
      drugs will be tapered and discontinued during the first week of therapy with imatinib.
      Complete blood counts will be performed weekly for the first month and every other week
      thereafter. Clinical assessments will be performed every three months to assess for continued
      response.
