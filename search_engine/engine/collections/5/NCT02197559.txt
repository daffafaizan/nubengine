      China. In the mean time ,more and more people accept revascularization. There are no
      prospective studies for comparison of prevention of restenosis after Drug -eluting stents and
      Bare-metal stents until now.

      The main aim of this study is to observe the following details:

        1. Late loss in lumen diameter in follow-up â‰¥50%

        2. Death, non -fatal stroke 30 days after stent implantation associated with antiplatelet
           drugs

        3. Death, non -fatal stroke 12 months after stent implantation associated with antiplatelet
           drugs

      Secondary endpoint:

      brain, gastrointestinal and urinary system bleeding in 12 months follow-up
