      the lead site in Columbus, Ohio, USA and an international site in Girona, Spain for a total
      of 354 patients. The objective of this study is to determine the incidence of complications
      that occur after patients undergo a surgery called Carotid Endarterectomy (CEA), which is a
      surgery that aims to decrease the risk of strokes in patients with a condition called carotid
      stenosis. Patients who undergo CEA are at increased risk of cardiovascular complications
      because of the high incidence of coexisting heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes.
      Common complications that occur after CEA are wound hematoma (collection of blood at the
      wound) and intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding in the brain). Medical records will be accessed
      to find any information pertaining to postoperative complications. Another objective of this
      study is to determine the cognitive dysfunction of patients undergoing CEA. This will be
      measured by a Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE) which will occur in person before the
      surgery and 30 days after the surgery over the phone. This study may provide data that will
      help identify how to optimize recovery for future CEA patients.
