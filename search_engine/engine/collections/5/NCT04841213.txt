    
      A purpose is to increase the efficiency of rehabilitation of patients with loss of teeth and
      mineral metabolism disorders due to vitamin D3 imbalance using an interdisciplinary approach
      to dental implantation.

      Retrospective prospective RCT in parallel groups includes 384 patients with loss of teeth and
      vitamin D3 imbalance who will undergo or underwent the dental implantation on the base of
      Oral Surgery Department of Borovskiy Institute of Dentistry of I.M.Sechenov First Moscow
      State Medical University (Sechenov University) and private dental clinic 'Society with
      limited responsibility (SLR) Topaz 2000' from 2010 till the 2021 year: prospective part will
      include 100 patients, the retrospective part will include 284 patients.

      The counted sample size according to loss of teeth prevalence in Russia on the base of
      Sechenov University and private dental clinic Topaz 2000 is equal to 384 patients.

      Randomization will be assured by surgeons blinded to endocrinologic status of patients who
      underwent or will undergo the dental implantation.

      All patients will be included in 2 groups: 1 group will include patients (n=192),
      25-50-years-old, with loss of teeth and mineral metabolism disorders due to vitamin D3
      imbalance (<30 ng/ml, or <75 nmol/l) who will undergo dental implant placement after
      stabilization of vitamin D3 levels (>30-60 ng/ml, or 75-150 nmol/l for the process of
      treatment and monitoring); 2 group will include patients, 25-50-years-old, with the loss of
      teeth and mineral metabolism disorders due to vitamin D3 imbalance (n=192) who will undergo
      the dental implantation during treatment by an endocrinologist before the stabilization of
      vitamin D3 level in the blood.

      Group 1

      Patients will be directed for lab tests to detect mineral imbalance (vitamin D, ng/ml;
      parathyroid hormone (PH), thyroperoxidase antibodies (anti-TPO), Thyrotoxin 3 free (TT),
      Thyrotropic hormone (TH) pg/l) before dental implantation, and according to results, we will
      discuss further plan treatment with the endocrinologist. If it is needed due to the
      indications (adults with osteoporotic fractures; adults with a disease or condition
      accompanied by reduced bone mass or bone loss; all persons in the appointment of drug
      therapy, iatrogenic in relation to loss of bone mass; all patients receiving anti-osteopathic
      treatment to monitor its effectiveness; all persons who are not yet receiving treatment, but
      who may need it in case of bone loss.), Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) of skeleton
      mineral bone density will be done. After appropriate systemic treatment with vitamin D3 in 2
      months after stabilization (>30 ng/ml, or >75 nmol/l) ) of vitamin D3 level (Aquadetrim

      number P N014088/01 from 21st June 2017; first 2 months taking orally 2-5 drops with a spoon
      of water depending on the severity of diseases, after 2 months and reaching the reference
      level of vitamin D its dose will be 1 drop per a day whole period of monitoring) the dental
      implantation was and will be performed with the further control of bone density and
      peri-implant tissues in 3 months after the operation. In the case of low bone density (type 3
      or 4) the additional bone plasty was and will be performed. we assess the stability of dental
      implant on the stages of prosthetic rehabilitation according to the force of osteointegration
      during the inserting of the healing abutment (in Newtons on square centimeter), and each 1
      year after treatment in the condition of periodical monitoring of patients with the
      endocrinologist (after the beginning of treatment after 2 months, then 1 time per 6 months).

      Traditional 2-stage dental implantation will be performed according to surgical protocols of
      dental implant systems (Straumann (Institut Straumann AG, Switzerland, registration in Russia
