      increasing. Since advances in screening and treatment over last decades, disease-free
      survival in HER2 positive breast cancer improved and relapse rates decrease as well. While
      health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and productivity benefit is not currently formally
      assessed by Taiwan Health Technology Agency (HTA) in Taiwan, the value of therapy in terms of
      a wider societal benefit is a critical factor which is increasingly being considered as part
      of the overall assessment of the value of a new medicine.

      Sort of productivity study in cancer is lack of in Taiwan. Referenced Roche UK team published
      comprehensive productivity studies1 Taiwan Epidemiology Association wants to initiate study
      to understand holistic value in each stage of breast cancer and quantify the value of new
      drug to support HTA assessment.

      The data will be collected through study, and adapt to cost-effectiveness model for future
      reimbursement submission.
