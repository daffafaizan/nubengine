      Behavioral Treatment for Insomnia (CBT-I), little is known about the pathophysiology of
      insomnia or whether treatment alters the factors that are thought to maintain chronic
      insomnia. Three main factors have been explored as contributing to chronic insomnia:
      hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. Most of the empirical
      work has been related to the role of hyperarousal along three dimensions: somatic, cognitive,
      and cortical.

      The present study is focused on homeostatic abnormalities and secondarily on hyperarousal as
      exhibited in subjects with Primary Insomnia (PIs) compared to Good Sleeper controls (GSs).
      Homeostatic abnormalities will be assessed by evaluating how patients with insomnia respond
      to sleep deprivation.

      This study will use a Modified Sleep Deprivation and Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSD/MSLT)
      procedure. Response to the procedure will be assessed in terms of sleep continuity, sleep
      architecture and electroencephalographic (EEG) power spectral changes during recovery sleep.
      Hyperarousal will be evaluated using serial measures of somatic (cortisol) and cortical (EEG
      Beta/Gamma activity) arousal across the sleep deprivation protocol.

      These parameters will be evaluated both prior to and following CBT-I in PIs and following an
      equivalent time interval in GSs.
