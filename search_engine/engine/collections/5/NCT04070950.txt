      and yet combine in the experience of cancer. The latter has an impact on sexuality in terms
      of satisfaction or sexual activity and on the relationship in terms of support.

      In addition, various studies show the psychological impact of treatments on the couple's
      relationship or the body image of women with cancer. Their abilities to seduce are affected
      and explain the decrease of their sexual activity during the treatments: a communication,
      valuing the femininity, would it then facilitate the relations of couple? There is no work
      that considers sexuality in a systematic way (sexual act and verbal and non-verbal
      communication) and apprehends its link with the evolution of the relationship, from the
      diagnosis of cancer to the end of treatments.

      This study aims to study in patients with cancer of the cervix or the body of the uterus, or
      the ovary between the time of diagnosis and 3 months after the end of the last treatment: the
      evolution of the relationship of couple, and more particularly of communication (verbal and
      non-verbal) concerning sexuality, before and during cancer.
