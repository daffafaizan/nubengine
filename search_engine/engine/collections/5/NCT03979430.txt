      Grosshansdorf, München, and Hannover, all in Germany. Each site recuits ten patients for a
      total of 50 patients.

      All patients will receive a tablet and a spirometer for daily home spirometry. Each patient
      is supposed to do the home spirometry at the same time every morning. The spirometer and the
      tablet are connected via Bluetooth and data will be transferred to a webpage after the
      measurement, that team members have access to the data and can see the progress daily. Alerts
      will be automatically send to team members, if the FVC-value decreases about 5% or more
      within three consecutive days or if the patient does not do the measurement on three
      consecutive days. Study period is one year.

      In addition to the home spirometry, patients will conduct a survey to measure health related
      quality of life (K-BILD). This questionnaire will be conducted at baseline and then every 12
      weeks. Every 4 weeks the patients are participating in a phone interview to record changes in
      medication and condition. At baseline and after 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, patients will conduct
      a 6 minutes walking test, lung function test, blood will be drawn for biomarker analysis, and
      sputum, nasal swab, and a urine sample will be collected and analyzed.

      Aim is to detect and treat an acute exacerbation early.
