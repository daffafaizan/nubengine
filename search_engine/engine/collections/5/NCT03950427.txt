      respond to a smoking cessation program combining a Videogame-based Physical activity,
      counseling for smoking cessation, and a medication (bupropion) for smoking cessation.

      Study participants will receive counseling to quit smoking and a medication to help decrease
      cravings and withdrawal. Additionally, participants will be randomly selected to participate
      in either a videogame-based physical activity group or a videogame group where the
      participants sit to play the games.

      Participants will be in this study for 12 weeks total. There are 3 assessment visits (2 hours
      each) at the beginning of the study, 6 weeks after starting, and at the end of the 12 weeks.
      There will be 8 30- minute counseling sessions during the 12 weeks. The hour-long videogame
      groups will be held 3 times a week for 12 weeks (36 sessions). Upon completion of the 12-week
      program, there will be a 1-2 hour group interview. The total time commitment is 48 hours over
      the course of the 12-week study.
