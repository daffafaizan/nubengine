      solid tumors. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. III.
      Determine the objective response of patients treated with this drug. IV. Determine the toxic
      effects of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive oral SU006668 twice daily.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 6 to 12 patients receive escalating doses of SU006668 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at
      least 2 of 6 or 4 of 12 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at
      30 days and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
