      healthy term subjects on growth, body composition, tolerance and safety including immune
      status, gut microbiota, and early indicators (markers) of disease. These markers will be
      explored if they could predict the risk of eczema and other allergic disease, and to evaluate
      if these markers are influenced by early nutrition.
