      organ prolapse(POP)and/or stress urinary incontinence(SUI) between June 2018 and June 2023
      from 27 tertiary hospitals are prospectively collected.Our study aims to follow-up and report
      the incidences of postoperative complications according to the International Urogynecological
      Association-International Continence Society(IUGA-ICS) Complication Classification
      Coding(Category-Time-Site coding system).The aimed pelvic floor reconstructive surgeries
      involve anterior,apical, posterior or total pelvic reconstruction with trans-vaginal
      mesh,open/laparoscopic sacrocolpopexy(Y-tape/self-cut synthesized mesh),repair using native
      tissue(sacrospinous ligament fixation, high uterosacral ligament suspension,ischial spinous
      fascia fixation, the Lefort operation and so on)and as well as anti-urinary incontinence
      surgeries(tension-free vaginal tape).

      Our follow-up process start after patients have completed the operation,thus our study do not
      affect patients' choice of surgical method.
