      I. To investigate the antibody response to influenza vaccination in patients with acute
      myeloid leukemia (AML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) receiving hypomethylating agents
      (decitabine or azacytidine) compared to normal healthy controls and those patients with
      similar disorders receiving cytarabine containing intensive chemotherapy or best supportive
      care.

      II. To collect and store blood samples at different time points (prior to and after
      vaccination) for assessment of influenza specific T-cell subsets using tetramers by flow
      cytometry.

      OUTLINE:

      Within 14 days of baseline influenza titer, patients receive trivalent influenza vaccine
      intramuscularly (IM) on day 0 (patients in cohorts 1 and 5 receive the vaccine at any time,
      patients in cohorts 2 and 3 receive the vaccine between days 14-25 of hypomethylating agent
      therapy course, and patients in cohort 4 receive the vaccine between days 21-365 from onset
      of cytotoxic chemotherapy). Patients then undergo titer assessment at days 25-90 and days
      115-185.
