        1. To determine the effect of oral paricalcitol on protein excretion in patients with
           proteinuric renal diseases

        2. To determine the effect of oral paricalcitol on renal disease progression in patients
           with proteinuric renal diseases Hypothesis: Oral paricalcitol will reduce protein
           excretion in proteinuric kidney disease Study Design: Prospective, randomized, placebo
           controlled, double blind, trial of paricalcitol compared to placebo.

      Sample Size: 60 patients, 30 in each group Summary of Patient Eligibility Criteria: Subjects
      with proteinuric renal disease (>400 mg/24 hours)

      Randomization and Dosage: Patients will be randomized to treatment with oral paricalcitol
      (initial dose 1 mcg orally per day) compared to placebo Duration : 6 Months
