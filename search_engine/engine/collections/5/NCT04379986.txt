      photoplethysmography. PPG utilizes an infrared or visible light to measure peripheral
      volumetric variations of blood circulation and its waveform has been proven to have a good
      correlation with BP waveform.Nonetheless, the accuracy of these instruments is of fundamental
      importance.

      Several validation procedures for assessing the precision of BP monitoring devices have been
      developed, including protocols by the Association for the Advancement of Medical
      Instrumentation, International Organization for Standardization and European Society of
      Hypertension. Adherence to these guidelines are essential to ensure the effectiveness of BP
      measurement of the wearable devices.

      Therefore, the investigators propose to test wearable low-noise, low-power SENBIOSYS
      photoplethysmography signals for estimation of BP.
