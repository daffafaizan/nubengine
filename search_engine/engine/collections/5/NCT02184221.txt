    
      The study is designed as randomized, double-blinded, active-controlled trial in major
      depressive disorder.

      Patients will be male or female, 18 to 60 years of age, right-handed, outpatient or inpatient
      status, with diagnosis of major depressive episode (single or recurrent) by DSM-IV. The
      HAMD-17 total score is no less than 18 at enrollment. The patients should be drug free at
      least 30 days before entering the trial. The eligible patients are randomized to one of the
      two treatment groups using a 1:1 ratio for the alpha frequency (high frequency) and 0.5Hz
      (low frequency) groups.

      Throughout the course of the study, DMS sessions are administered by trained physicians for
      20 minutes at a time, with 5 sessions per week, during 6 consecutive weeks. Raters who are
      blinded to the treatment arm perform evaluations. The effective outcome is assessed by the
      HAMD-17 and HAMA every two weeks including randomization. Serum BDNF level are also tested at
      each visits (Week 0, 2, 4 and 6). The safety in this study will be assessed by adverse event
      reporting, clinical laboratory measurements and physical examinations.

      Primary efficacy measure will be assessed based on the decrease of HAMD-17 from randomization
      to endpoint (Week 6).
