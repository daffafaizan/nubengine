      medical centers within the United States and includes a multicenter registry for patients
      with cardiogenic shock. De-identified clinical variables are collected from medical records
      and follow-up phone calls. There is currently no central database for cardiogenic shock,
      therefore analysis of cardiogenic shock on a larger scale is limited. A goal of the
      Cardiogenic Shock Working Group is to create a centralized registry, compiled of data from
      multiple institutions, to analyze clinical outcomes. The Cardiogenic Shock Working Group
      Registry will include a retrospective arm, where data is collected during the course of the
      hospital stay, and a prospective arm, where long-term outcomes will be assessed.
