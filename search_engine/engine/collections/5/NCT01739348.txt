    
      Two substudies are included in Part I of the study: 1) a medical imaging substudy to evaluate
      changes in brain amyloid protein load using positron emission tomography (PET) and an amyloid
      tracer ([18F]flutemetamol); and 2) a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarker substudy to evaluate
      changes in CSF concentrations of amyloid-Î² related peptides, total tau, and phosphorylated
      tau (p-tau). The substudies will be conducted only at designated investigational sites.
      Participants are not required to take part in a substudy in order to take part in the larger
      trial.
