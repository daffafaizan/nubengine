      neuromuscular blockade of rocuronium in patients undergoing supratentorial tumors resection.
      Comparison will include hemodynamics, respiratory effort and degree of sedation.

      Indicators of global cerebral oxygenation and haemodynamics will be calculated using jugular
      bulb and peripheral arterial blood sampling.
