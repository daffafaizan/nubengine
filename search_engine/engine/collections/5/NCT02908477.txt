      the HPV virus are much more sensitive to radiation and chemotherapy. Standard treatment for
      HPV associated oropharynx tumor after surgery involves six weeks of radiation therapy and has
      many long term side effects and complications.

      Mayo Clinic recently piloted a study investigating whether patients with HPV-associated
      oropharynx tumors can receive less radiation and chemotherapy after surgery when compared
      with the standard treatment. The investigators current study will compare the new, shorter
      treatment course (2 weeks of treatment) with the standard course of treatment (six weeks).
      Patients will be randomized to either the less intense or standard treatment arm. Patients
      will be twice as likely to receive the less intense treatment during randomization.
