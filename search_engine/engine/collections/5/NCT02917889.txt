      minimum interval of 48 hours between them, in order to allow adequate recovery of the
      participants. Before the start of the first stage of the experimental protocol or control
      anthropometric measurements will be carried out, body weight by a digital scale (Plenna, TIN
      00139 MAXIMA, Brazil)) and then, using a stadiometer (Plenna, TIN 00139 MAXIMA, Brazil)). The
      protocols are:

      I) Maximum stress test protocol: assessment of the maximum oxygen consumption (VO2max) on a
      treadmill (Inbrasport / Millennium), using the Bruce protocol.

      II) Control Protocol (PC): at this stage the volunteer will ingest compressed form of placebo
      similar to Protocol III and remained at rest after 15 minutes in the supine position,
      followed by 30 minutes of aerobic exercise on a treadmill, 5 minutes with speed 6.0 km / h
      followed by 25 minutes with 60% of VO2max and the final 60 minutes lying recovery.

      III) Experimental protocol (PE): In this stage, the volunteer had performed activities
      similar to the PC, but will make the tablet intake consists of 300mg of caffeine, a value
      that is within the maximum daily amount allowed under the FDA.
