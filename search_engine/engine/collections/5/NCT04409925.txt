      outcomes and severity in patients with COVID-19 infections. Acute inflammation results in
      formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) by PMNs and NK cells. Pre-clinical studies
      showed that NETs are critically involved in the pathophysiology of ARDS and increased
      capacity of PMNs to form NETs was shown to correlated with increased severity and mortality
      in patients with ARDS after community-acquired pneumonia. In early reports, patients with
      severe COVID-19 infections were also found to have radiological and clinical findings of
      Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). NETs can be degraded by DNase1 for which there is
      a human recombinant equivalent rhDNase1.

      This study proposes:

        1. to evaluate the safety and feasibility of inhaled rhDNase1 in severely ill COVID-19
           patients requiring admission;

        2. to evaluate the impact of rhDNase1 in limiting progression of disease and COVID-19
           related complications in these patients;

        3. and to investigate NETs as possible therapeutic targets in severe COVID-19 patients by
           quantifying levels of circulating NETs in the blood and sputum and correlating these
           with oxygen requirements, need for mechanical ventilation, duration of mechanical
           ventilation, radiological progression of ARDS, secondary bacterial infections
           (pneumonia, bacteremia and other), renal dysfunction, duration of ICU admission, and
           time to discharge or mortality.
