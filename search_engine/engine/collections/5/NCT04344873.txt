      demonstrated that there is a pronounced age-associated increase in T cell infiltration into
      the perivascular space around large elastic arteries and small resistance arteries. The
      objective of this study is to determine if and how T cells contribute to age-related arterial
      inflammation and dysfunction.

      Although there is evidence from rodent studies that T cells play a critical role in arterial
      dysfunction, it is unknown whether this occurs in humans. Abatacept, a T cell co-stimulation
      inhibitor, is FDA approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Importantly, Abatacept
      decreases the inflammatory phenotype of circulating T cells. Abatacept will be used in older
      adults to be the first to determine if T cell inflammation contributes to arterial
      dysfunction in older adults. The investigators hypothesize that older adults treated with
      Abatacept will exhibit greater flow-mediated dilation, decreased pulse wave velocity,
      decreased or unchanged blood pressure, decreased inflammatory and oxidative stress markers in
      endothelial cells, decreased plasma free radicals, decreased proportion of memory T cells,
      and experience a shift away from a pro-inflammatory T cell phenotype compared to placebo.
      These results will be interpreted to mean that T cells play a role in mediating age-related
      arterial dysfunction in humans.
