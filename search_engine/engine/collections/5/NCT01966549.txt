    
      This is a multi-center, randomized (study medication is assigned by chance),
      placebo-controlled (effect of the study medication will be compared with the effect of
      placebo [inactive substance]), double-blind (neither physician nor participant knows the
      treatment that the participant receives), parallel-group study (each group of participants
      will be treated at the same time). This study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase (within
      3 weeks prior to the start of study medication), a treatment phase (12 weeks), and a
      follow-up phase (12 weeks after the last administration of study medication). Approximately
      170 participants will be enrolled in this study to receive CNTO6785 or placebo in 1:1 ratio.
      Safety will be evaluated by the assessment of adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead
      electrocardiogram, physical examination, early detection of active tuberculosis, and clinical
      laboratory tests which will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of study
      participation for a participant will be 30 weeks.
