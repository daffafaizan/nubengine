      PWS genetically confirmed and its effect on suckling, milk intake and weight gain. The three
      first patients will have single nasal administration of 2 IU of Oxytocin and, if no adverse
      event has been observed, the 3 following patients will have single nasal administration of 4
      IU of Oxytocin. We will monitor cardiac pulse, blood pressure, urine emission and measure
      biological safety parameters (glycemia, natremia and kaliemia). Video will be performed
      during 1 day before the drug administration and the 3 days after in order to qualify the
      suckling. Quantitative evaluation of the milk intake during each feeding and per day will be
      also evaluated. Biological parameters will be measured OT, ghrelin, others neuroendocrine
      hormones involved in appetite regulation (leptin, cortisol, insulin, GLP-1, PYY, pancreatic
      polypeptide, orexin A, aMSH) taking advantage of blood samples for safety biological
      measurements. These infants will stay 8 days (which is less than the mean duration of
      hospitalization of these infants) with data records by phone at 1 month and then have a final
      visit after 3 months.
