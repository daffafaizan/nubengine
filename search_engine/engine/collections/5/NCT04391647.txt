    
      In total 50 women will be included in this trial whereof 25 fully vaccinated with a
      prophylactic HPV vaccine and 25 not vaccinated with a prophylactic HPV vaccine. These women
      will be asked to collect a first-void urine sample with the Colli-PeeTM device (Novosanis).
      Hereafter, a blood sample of 5-10 cc will be collected. HPV DNA positive women who gave their
      consent to be contacted with the results, will later be contacted again and asked to provide
      additional FV urine samples every day during 2 weeks. For this, urine collection devices
      (Colli-PeeTM, Novosanis) will be provided by postal mail. The collected urine samples (and
      blood sample as control for HPV antibodies) will be used for the development of protocols
      within this project.
