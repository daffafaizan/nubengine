      and development of thrombocytopenia in the medical ICU population. We expect the null
      hypothesis to be proven true. One hundred subjects will be enrolled in this prospective,
      randomized, double-blind (concealed allocation) pilot study of consecutive medical ICU
      patients to one of two pharmacologic VTE prophylaxix treatment arms. (1) Primary endpoints
      include hemoglobin, hematocrit, & platelet counts. blood product utilization, bleeding
      complications (any), Steady State Functional Factor Xa activity (for post hoc analysis),
      non-study pharmacologic VTE prophylaxis (when estimated CLcr < 30ml/min), and days not
      treated with study drug or treated with alternative agent Secondary/ Additional Data to be
      collected include patient demographics, primary & secondary diagnoses, central venous access,
      and sequential compression device utilization.
