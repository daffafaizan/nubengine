      is observed in Eastern Asia.

      D2 gastrectomy has been established as a standard surgical procedure. While recurrence rate
      after resection is still high.

      The CLASSIC study showed that Xelox regimen after D2 gastrectomy improves 3-year disease-free
      survival compared with surgery only. But patients with late stage still have poor prognosis
      according to subgroup analysis and our retrospective study.

      HER2 is an important biomarker and key driver of tumorigenesis in 7-34% gastric cancers. The
      ToGA study showed that trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets HER2, plus
      chemotherapy improved overall survival(16.0m vs 11.8m) in patients with HER2-positive
      advanced gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction cancer.

      Based on previous experiences of trastuzumab in adjunctive therapy of breast cancer and
      ACTS/CLASSIC/ToGA studies, we suppose that trastuzumab plus XELOX as adjunctive treatment may
      benefit patients with HER2-positive Stage III gastric cancer after D2 Gastrectomy.

      According to the above, we do this single-arm research to assess the clinical efficacy and
      safety of trastuzumab plus XELOX for treatment of HER2-positive Stage III Gastric Cancer
      After D2 Gastrectomy.
