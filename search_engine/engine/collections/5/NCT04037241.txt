    
      The study consists of 5 periods: Screening/Leukapheresis Period, Bridging Therapy Period,
      Randomization Period, Treatment Period, and Observation Period (which will be the long-term
      follow-up period to monitor for overall survival and long-term safety).

      Patients in this trial with CEA-expressing pancreatic adenocarcinoma with liver metastases
      must have developed disease progression after first-line treatment with FOLFIRINOX
      (irinotecan, 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin) or gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.
      Patients will be randomized to either the "anti-CEA CAR-T Cells + systemic chemotherapy
      treatment arms", or the "chemotherapy alone treatment arms."

      If the patients achieve at least stable disease during the Bridging Therapy Period, they will
      be in the Second-Line Group of Treatment Arms. Patients who develop disease progression
      during the Bridging Period will be in the Third-Line Group of Treatment Arms.

      Patients in the Second-Line or Third-Line treatment arms who are randomized to the treatment
      arms of "Anti-CEA CAR-T cells plus systemic chemotherapy" will receive hepatic infusions of
      Anti-CEA CAR-T cells in Cycles 1 and 3 (ie, each 42-day cycle is 3 weekly doses of Anti-CEA
      CAR-T cells administered as hepatic arterial infusions using a PEDD device with low dose
      systemic IL-2 support), alternating with the systemic chemotherapy regimen they received
      during the Bridging Therapy Period in Cycle 2 and Cycles >= 4. Systemic chemotherapy will be
      administered in 28-day cycles until the development of disease progression.

      Patients in the Second-Line or Third-Line treatment arms who are randomized to the treatment
      arms "chemotherapy alone" arms will continue to receive the same systemic chemotherapy that
      they received during the Bridging Therapy Period. Systemic chemotherapy will be administered
      in 28-day or 21-day cycles (depending on the type of systemic chemotherapy regimen the
      patient will receive) until the development of disease progression.
