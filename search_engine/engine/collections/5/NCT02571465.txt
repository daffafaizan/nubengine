      in the postoperative period upon arrival in the ICU using a PiCCO2 system (Pulsion Medical
      Systems, Munich, Germany).

      Controlled fluid challenges (500 ml) are done at 3 time-points:

      A) during controlled mechanical ventilation B) during pressure support ventilation with
      spontaneous breathing and C) after extubation.

      Stroke volume (SV), SVV and PPV as well as standard hemodynamic parameters (MAP = mean
      arterial pressure, HR = heart rate) are assessed.

      A PLR is performed before fluid administration at all 3 time points. A positive response is
      defined as an increase in SV>15 %.

      Prediction of fluid responsiveness will be tested by AUC (area under the receiver operating
      characteristic - ROC - curve).
