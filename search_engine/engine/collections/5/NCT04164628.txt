      quality of life such as diseases, working conditions and psychological factors of women have
      been investigated in different diseases. However, there was no study investigating the
      factors affecting quality of life for a sample of adult female individuals. Therefore, the
      aim of our study is to investigate the effect of social, psychological and physical variables
      that we think may affect the quality of life in women.
