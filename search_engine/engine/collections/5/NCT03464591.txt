      that leads to the loss of right heart function. Right heart failure is the cause of death in
      most patients with end-stage pulmonary hypertension, and right heart function is also an
      important factor in determining the prognosis of patients.

      Echocardiography speckle tracking technology is a noninvasive technique for evaluating global
      and local cardiac function by tracking myocardial ultrasonic spots through computer image
      analysis technology and quantifying myocardial deformation.

      The investigators intend to evaluate the function of left heart and right heart and the
      motion balance between four chambers of the heart by speckle tracking technique during the
      follow-up of patients with pulmonary hypertension, and explore the relationship between the
      balance and prognosis of patients.
