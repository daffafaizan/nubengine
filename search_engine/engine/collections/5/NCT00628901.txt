    
      The purpose of this prospective randomized single-center study is to demonstrate
      comparability using Contour SE™ Microspheres (700-900µ and 900-1200µ) using a near stasis
      endpoint and Embosphere® Microspheres (500-700µ) using a "prune tree" endpoint for achieving
      post UFE fibroid devascularization in women with symptomatic uterine fibroids. The study will
      demonstrate (with the use of contrast enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at baseline
      and 24-hours post embolization) that uterine fibroids can successfully be devascularized
      using the embolization protocols. Contrast enhanced MRI will be performed at baseline,
      24-hours, and 3-months post UFE. The subjects will be followed through 12-months post UFE and
      change from baseline in symptom severity (Quality of Life (QoL) Questionnaire) will be
      assessed at 3 months and 12 months.
