      rociletinib for patients with advanced or metastatic, EGFR-mutant T790M+ NSCLC who were
      previously treated with at least one prior EGFR TKI therapy (â‰¥2nd line). Patients will
      receive oral rociletinib twice daily on study as long as they have clinical benefit and until
      they have access to FDA-approved rociletinib.
