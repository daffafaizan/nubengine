      exercise capacity in heart transplant recipients with elevated resting heart rate (HR).

      Exercise capacity will be assessed by the determination of the peak oxygen consumption (pVO2)
      during standard cardiopulmonary exercise test before and after the treatment period with
      ivabradine. The secondary goal is to determine HR reduction with ivabradine in the patient
      population.
