      cluster (unit of randomization) is at the level of each local community senior's group, from
      whence participants will be recruited. Incontinent community-dwelling older women aged 60
      years and older who have not sought care for their urinary symptoms in the last two years,
      but who experience incontinence at least twice weekly will be recruited through local
      community organizations. Eligible participants from each local community centre will be
      randomly assigned as a group to one of four interventions. The first intervention is
      participation in an interactive constructivist continence workshop. The second intervention
      involves receipt of an evidence-based self-management tool for incontinence. The third group
      will receive both interventions. The fourth group will act as the control group: they will
      simply be asked about their urinary symptoms and given a general talk on women's health. At
      the end of the study, the control group will be offered the self-management tool.
