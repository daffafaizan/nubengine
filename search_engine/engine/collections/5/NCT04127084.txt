      SGLT2 Inhibition on Different levels of Albuminuria in Patients With type 2 diabetes and to
      seek the relationship of this influences to relevant risk markers in the pathology of
      diabetic renal disease.

      Design: prospective ，intervention， case-controlled , single center study. Treatment period:

      albuminuria, kidney function and eGFR .

      Secondary endpoints To assess the effect of SGLT2 inhibition on markers for podocyte damage ,
      renal fibrosis, inflammation，oxidative stress and renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system。
      Timeframe: Recruiting planned from October 2019, inclusion over the following 12 months. Last
