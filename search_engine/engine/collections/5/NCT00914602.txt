    
      This is a Phase 1/Phase 2 multiple-dose, multi-center, open-label, two period
      sequential-treatment study in subjects with Parkinson's disease to assess the
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and safety of XP21279 sustained release formulation
      [administered with Lodosyn速 (carbidopa)] and Sinemet速 tablets in subjects with Parkinson's
      disease and to explore dose correspondence between XP21279 and Sinemet速 to guide dose
      selection for future studies in the target population (subjects with Parkinson's disease with
      motor fluctuations on Sinemet速).
