      acidosis and liver failure. In addition, some investigators believe NRTI-related
      mitochondrial toxicity to be the culprit in the development of peripheral neuropathy and
      lipodystrophy in HIV-infected patients. There is a need for a sensitive, reproducible, and
      noninvasive marker of mitochondrial dysfunction. To date, the only available noninvasive
      marker is lactate, but lactate testing is insensitive and the significance and
      reproducibility of lactate levels in the HIV-infected population are questionable.
      Spectroscopy promises to be a very useful alternative for the evaluation of the in vivo
      effect of NRTIs on mitochondrial function.

      Prior to the screening visit, HIV-infected participants must fast for at least 12 hours and
      refrain from exercise for at least 24 hours. At the screening visit, all participants have
      blood drawn for lactate measurements and tests for hepatitis B and C. HIV-uninfected
      participants have an HIV test. Women who are able to become pregnant have a pregnancy test.

      Prior to the entry visit, HIV-infected participants must fast for 12 hours and refrain from
      exercise for 3 days. At the entry visit, all participants have blood drawn for lactate
      measurements and women have repeat pregnancy tests. Participants have an MRS scan, which
      takes approximately 60-80 minutes.
