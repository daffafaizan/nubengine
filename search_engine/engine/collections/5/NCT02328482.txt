    
      This will be a multi-center, randomized withdrawal, open-label, non-treatment concurrent
      control, parallel group study. Patients completing protocol BBCO-001 will be offered the
      opportunity to enter into this 12-month randomized withdrawal protocol.

      Eligible patients will be randomized to one of the following treatment arms:

        -  Treatment Arm 1: active treatment; continuation of 30 g IV Cabaletta once a week over an
           additional 52 weeks.

        -  Treatment Arm 2: no-treatment concurrent control; discontinuation of IV Cabaletta and
           follow-up over 52 weeks.

      IV Cabaletta will be administered once a week to patients in Treatment Arm 1. All patients,
      regardless of treatment arm allocation, will undergo the same safety and efficacy assessments
      during the monthly site visits.
