      a 1:1 ratio using a computer-generated randomization number sequence. The group assignment
      was sealed in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. No stratiﬁcation or block randomization
      was made. The envelopes were opened on the morning of surgery, and the trial drug was
      prepared by a senior anaesthetist not otherwise involved in data collection. The MP group
      received a single-dose of MP, 1 mg/Kg i.v. (Solu-Medrolw; Pﬁzer, Ballerup, Denmark) and the
      Control group a single-dose of isotonic saline ( equal capacity with MP) i.v. The test
      solution was administered just 30 mins before the operation. The patients, attending
      anesthesiologists, surgeons, and data collectors were all blinded to patient group
      assignment.The primary outcomes of the levels of T lymphocyte subsets of CD3+, CD4+, and
      CD8+, and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio were measured at T0, T1, and T2. Postoperative pain scores were
      evaluated by the visual analog scale (VAS) score16, where 0 indicates painlessness, and 10
      indicates severe pain. The patients were asked to evaluate their pain at rest and during
      coughing at 2, 4, 6, and 24 hours postoperatively. Total pump press numbers of PCA and
      adverse effects during 24 hours after surgery such as hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and
      vomiting, and dizzy were recorded and treated accordingly.
