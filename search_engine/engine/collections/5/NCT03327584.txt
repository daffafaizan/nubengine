    
      Patients presenting to the Emergency Department who are 18 years old or older, who do not
      belong to a vulnerable group, requiring small or medium joint arthrocentesis will be included
      in this trial. The investigators will randomize each patient into LM vs US. Data collected
      will include number of attempts to tap the joint, success rate, and time for procedure to be
      completed. The arthrocentesis will be performed by PGY-3 residents only. A 21 gauge needle
      will be used for the arthrocentesis.
