      with high dose limited lesions size with a local control surrounding of 80-98% and with a low
      level of toxicity.

      We propose to realize a classic concomitant RT-CT for mediastinal irradiation and combine
      this treatment with stereotactic RT for peripheral primary tumor.

      The estimated inclusion period is approximately 3 years.

      Follow-up duration for each patient is 2 years. The duration of the research is 5 years.
