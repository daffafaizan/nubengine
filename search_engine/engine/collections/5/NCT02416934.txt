    
      This investigation is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial testing
      peri-operative steroids versus saline and the effect on swallowing after anterior cervical
      spine surgery. Swallowing symptoms will be measured using the patient reported Bazaz (Bazaz)
      scale and the Dysphagia Short Questionnaire (DSQ). Swallowing data will be obtained
      pre-operatively, one day and two days post-operatively and then one week, two weeks, four
      weeks, three months, six months, and one year post-operatively. Patient clinical outcomes
      will be captured using web-based progress reports. Patients will complete the Quality of Life
      (QoL-12), Neck Disability Index (NDI), and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) questionnaires
      electronically pre-operatively and at one year post-operatively. This outcome data will help
      us analyze the swallowing function or symptoms with the overall clinical course of the
      patients enrolled in this study.
