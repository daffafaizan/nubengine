      Group A and Group B. Both groups will be video recorded during the performance of the two
      skills on simulators (i.s. Donati suture and intraosseous venous access) (timepoint: T0).
      Then group A will watch a standardised video about the skills, and group B will do
      self-study. Then, both groups will be again video recorded during the performance of the two
      skills on simulators (timepoint: T1). After 1 week group B will watch the same standardised
      video about the skills, and group A will do self-study. Then both groups will be again video
      recorded during the performance of the two skills on simulators (timepoint: T2).
