      and reproducibility of rest two - and three-dimensional echocardiography for the left atrium
      anatomy and function and to assess their correlation with clinical variables.

      The second part of the study aims to evaluate the accuracy and reproducibility of the left
      atrium anatomy and function using echocardiography and to validate it with cardiac CT.
      Moreover, the study aims to evaluate which parameters can predict the recurrence of atrial
      fibrillation in patients who have undergone atrial fibrillation ablation.

      The third part of the study aims to assess the accuracy and variability of echocardiographic
      measurements compared to cardiac magnetic resonance and to find predictors of recurrence
      after cryoballoon ablation for atrial fibrillation.
