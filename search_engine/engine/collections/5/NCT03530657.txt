      alternative to evaluate the severity of chronic liver fibrosis, but also as a mean to
      stratify patients with advanced fibrosis according to risks of occurrence of clinical
      complications of end-stage liver diseases.

      Sound touch elastography (STEï¼‰and sound touch quantify (STQ) developed by Mindray Resona 7
      imaging system provide both two-dimensional and point shear-wave elastography of tissue
      elasticity with stronger penetration and easy operation.

      This analysis will study the diagnositic performance of STE/STQ elastography for lver
      fibrosis and the prognostic value of STE/STQ elastography for the prediction of clinical
      complications of chronic liver diseases.
