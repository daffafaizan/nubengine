      study duration included a 30-day Screening Period, an initial 12-week DB treatment
      pre-surgery period (Period A), a 2-week peri-operative period with continuation of weekly DB
      study drug administration (Period B), and a subsequent 10-week DB treatment post-operative
      period (Period C). Randomization (in a 1:1 ratio) in Period A was stratified by baseline
      Hurley Stage (II versus III) and anatomical location of the planned surgical site (i.e.,
      axilla versus inguinal region). The projected size of the surgical excision established by
      the designated surgeon during the Screening Period (calculated from a tracing of the outer
      perimeter onto an acetate sheet or equivalent) was recorded. In Period B, the designated
      surgeon measured and recorded the surface area of the actual surgery, with surgery occurring
      during Week 13. Surgery and post-operative management (e.g., hospitalization, surgical wound
      care) was per local practice. No study drug was administered at Week 24, the final study
      visit. Participants were able to begin commercial product (as prescribed by the
      participants's physician) after all Week 24 procedures were completed.
