      potentially life threatening complication of portal hypertension. Various methods have been
      described to treat gastric varices, including endoscopic and interventional radiology
      techniques. Endoscopic variceal obliteration (EVO) is currently considered as standard of
      care for the treatment of gastric varices in most centers. However, this technique is
      associated with significant rebleeding rates and incomplete obliteration is observed in about
      50% of patients. Alternatively, few centers also use an interventional radiology technique,
      called balloon-occluded retrograde transvenous obliteration (B-RTO) to treat gastric varices,
      which has been shown to be associated with less recurrence of gastric varices and high rates
      of eradication of about 90%. Both techniques have their inherent weaknesses, such as frequent
      incomplete eradication of varices and thromboembolic events for EVO, while data suggest that
      B-RTO may aggravate esophageal varices.

      The aim of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of combined and
      simultaneous endoscopic variceal obliteration together with (modified) B-RTO. Stopping the
      outflow of gastric varices by endovascular balloon occlusion may allow better endoscopic
      visualization, blood stagnation and thus eradication of varices, while preventing
      thromboembolic events. Furthermore, during study follow-up, the eradication rates and
      recurrence of varices, short-term and long term complications, effects of the procedure on
      portal pressures/hemodynamics and liver function will be evaluated.
