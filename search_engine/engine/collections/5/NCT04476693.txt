      physical activity), reduced adiposity and favourable cardiometabolic health profiles in
      children, adolescents and adults. Experimental research in adults has shown that breakfast
      consumption reduces the glycaemic and insulinemic response to lunch when compared with
      breakfast omission; this has been termed 'the second meal effect'. Further, breakfast
      consumption may improve exercise performance and increase free-living physical activity
      energy expenditure in adults. Understanding the postprandial metabolic responses to BC and
      breakfast omission (BO) in adolescent girls is particularly important, as this population
      frequently skips breakfast and have low physical activity levels. Yet, adolescent girls may
      respond differently to adults due to their distinct metabolic profiles, and past research has
      not targeted this population. The primary aim of this research is to examine whether BC
      versus BO affects postprandial glycaemic and insulinemic responses to lunch in adolescent
      girls. Secondly, it aims to examine the lipaemic and substrate oxidation responses during
      rest, substrate oxidation during an exercise bout performed later in the day, and physical
      activity enjoyment during the exercise bout.
