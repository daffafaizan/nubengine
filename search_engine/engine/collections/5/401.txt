133. demonstration, purification, and partial characterization of ab-normal (hsl) antigens in stable human cell linesthe existence of abnormal human stableline (hsl) antigens common to anumber of stable human cell lines, butabsent from normal human tissues andnormal human diploid cell strains in tissueculture, was demonstrated by agar gelmicroimmunodiffusion.  hsl was detectedin hela-sj, hela-mba, hela-s3,chang conjunctiva, syverton's embryoesophagus, chang liver, and j-iii.  itwas not detected in henle's human intestineor detroit-6.  it was absent from twonormal diploid strains, wi-38 and sj-dhl,and was not found in a variety ofconcentrated extracts of fresh humanorgans.  hsl was not associated withcontamination by pleuropneumonia-likeorganisms (pplo) of cell lines.  thepurest hsl preparations obtained from hela-sjby ammonium sulfate fractiona-tion yielded absorption spectra characteristic ofprotein and were inactivated bytrypsin.  sephadex chromatography indicated aparticle weight of approximately150,000; hsl was not sedimented at 125,000 x g.in 0.02 m po4 buffer, activitywas virtually completely eliminated after 2 minutesat 50 c., 8 minutes at 45 c.,or 80 minutes at 40 c.  preliminary studies withfluorescent anti-hsl globulinindicated that hsl was not a surface antigen;rabbit antisera to purified hslfractions were not cytotoxic to hela cells.the best preparations of hsl stillcontained a trace of common human antigenand appeared to consist of multiplecomponents active in immunoprecipitation.electrophoresis indicated the in-homogeneity of this material.
