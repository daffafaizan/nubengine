      cyst/tumor and referring them to tertiary centers for surgery in the western region of
      Sweden. The diagnostic accuracy is unsatisfying why the investigators are evaluating HE4 and
      ROMA as a complement, in combination or separately to improve diagnostic accuracy.

      The trial is based on a normal population cohort of patients included at all the hospitals in
      the region. The patients were included before surgery and the biomarkers analysed on serum
      samples withdrawn preoperatively.

      If the investigators observe a clear improvement in the early diagnosis of EOC, the
      investigators aim to implement the best strategy for all patients with suspected pelvic tumor
      mass in the western region of Sweden.
