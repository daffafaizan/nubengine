      characterized by episodic nocturnal collapse of the upper airway and reduction/cessation of
      breathing leading to significant nocturnal hypoxia, is associated with an increased risk of
      cognitive impairment. OSA is effectively treated with continuous positive airway pressure
      (CPAP), a pressurized nasal/face mask worn during sleep, but health care providers do not
      often prescribe it for Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) because there are no large,
      prospective research studies in this population confirming efficacy.

      This multi-site study will have a sample size of n=460 divided into three groups followed for
      one year: 1) a CPAP adherent group (approximately n=200); 2) two control groups consisting of
      2a) a CPAP non-adherent control group (approximately n=160) and 2b) a no apnea control group
      (n=100). This will allow us to confirm whether CPAP treatment, controlling for risk factors
      such as neuroimaging findings and OSA severity at baseline, predicts the primary outcome of
      cognitive function at 1-year follow-up. Study participants will also undergo an Amyloid PET
      scan, use wearable activity monitors and functional/structural MRI brain scans.

      This research study will thus examine the one year effects of CPAP on cognitive function and
      elucidate physiological mechanisms for cognitive decline in aMCI and OSA.
