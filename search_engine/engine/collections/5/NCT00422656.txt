      and progression of malignancies, specifically in lymphomas. In laboratory experiments of WM
      and lymphoma cell lines, perifosine has shown to have cytotoxic and anti-proliferative
      activity as a single agent. This drug has been used in clinical research studies of other
      types of cancers including soft tissue sarcomas, head and neck cancers and prostate cancer.
      This study uses a two-stage design to evaluate efficacy of perifosine based on overall
      response (OR). The null and alternative OR rates are 20% and 40%. If 4 or more patients
      enrolled in the stage one cohort (n=17 patients) achieve OR than accrual will proceed to
      stage two (n=20 patients). If fewer than 10 ORs are observed then the regimen will be
      considered ineffective.
