      source of discomfort to the patient. Patient intolerance of the echocardiography probe limits
      the duration of the procedure and therefore its diagnostic success. Current strategies to
      reduce patient discomfort involve global anesthesia, which carries its own side effects and
      risks of adverse events. Hypnosis may reduce patient discomfort without impairing alertness.
      The main goal of this study is to determine the additive value of hypnosis to improve patient
      comfort during TEE.
