      10-week (Â± 2 weeks) nutritional intervention period at home starting the first day of the
      chemotherapy treatment, and one test day after this intervention. Chemotherapy in general
      lasts at least a few months. Recent studies indicate that a 10-week nutritional
      supplementation period should be long enough to reach significant improvements in nutritional
      and clinical outcome parameters during chemotherapy. Throughout these 10 weeks the cancer
      subjects will take the supplements at home. Cancer subjects will be randomly assigned to
      receive either fish oil or a placebo and protein or a placebo and will take these supplements
      daily throughout 10 weeks during chemotherapy.

      For the healthy subjects, the study will involve one test day (approx. 8 hours).

      On the test days, the response to a protein meal will be examined and subjects will receive a
      mixture of amino acids which are a little bit heavier than normal, called stable isotopes.
      Subjects will also ingest a sugar drink to assess gut permeability. In total, approximate 120
      ml of blood will be drawn on each test day to assess outcome measures. The investigators'
      will also collect urine over these 8 hours, and cancer subjects are asked to collect a fecal
      sample the day before the test day.

      After completing the nutritional intervention study, cancer subjects will be monitored for up
      to 6 months via 2 phone calls and through their physician as part of clinical care. Between 6
      months and 2 years after completion of the study, information about disease progression
      (survival) will be obtained from the physician.
