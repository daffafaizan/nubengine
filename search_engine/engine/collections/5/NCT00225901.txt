    
      Fulminant and late-onset hepatic failure (LOHF) is intractable disease with high degree of
      fatality (70-80%). Only liver transplantation is established as a therapeutic modality to
      rescue patients with fulminant hepatic failure or LOHF. However, approximately 75% of the
      patients are not able to receive liver transplantation in Japan, and effective non-surgical
      treatment has not been established yet. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is one of major agents
      stimulating liver regeneration and ameliorating hepatic injury.

      In this study, recombinant human HGF is administered to patients with fulminant hepatic
      failure or LOHF, who can not receive liver transplantation.
