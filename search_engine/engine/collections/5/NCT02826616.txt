      General Hospital between Januay 2017 and August 2017. STEMI was defined as typical chest pain
      lasting 30 min within the previous 12 h, a clear ST-segment elevation of N0.1 mV in â‰¥2
      contiguous electrocardiographic leads, and elevated blood levels of troponin T. We randomly
      assign eligible patients in a 1:1 ratio to either 60mg of trimetazidine or oral placebo befor
      PCI. Trimetazidine group will accept 20mg of trimetazidine for 12 months after PCI and active
      Comparator will be given placebo for 12 months after PCI.

      Primary end point of the study was the area of viable myocardium coming from MR delayed
      enhancement scan and main cardiovascular events concluding recurrent myocardial infarction,
      cardiac death, recurrent angina, acute heart failure. Secondary end point of the study was
      the change of LVEF. All adverse clinical events as well as study end points were monitored
      and adjudicated by the independent event committee. Each patient was contacted in every week
      after administration of the contrast, investigated main cardiovascular events (myocardial
      infarction,acute heart failure and death), and record any adverse events.
