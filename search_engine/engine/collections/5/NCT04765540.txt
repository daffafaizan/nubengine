      Bangladesh, has built 1000 public handwashing stations in several hundred villages in Dhaka,
      Khulna and Mymensingh divisions. The investigators investigate the effects of two sets of
      behavioural interventions on use of the handwashing stations, compared to no additional
      interventions.

      The first set of interventions, which do not require ongoing labour (hence termed 'low
      intensity'), involve the installation of various 'nudges' (e.g. mirrors and signposts) on the
      station and in the surrounding area; these interventions are designed to attract attention
      and guide people to the stations. The second set of interventions, which do require ongoing
      labour ('high intensity'), involve 'promoters' visiting the stations a few times a week for
      three weeks to hand out free bars of soap to station users, update a community board next to
      the station with cumulative usage numbers, and to encourage users to place comments or marks
      on the board as a form of social proof. Stations will be assigned to receive either the low
      intensity nudges, the high intensity intervention, or no additional intervention beyond
      BRAC's standard programming using a covariate adaptive randomisation process (with
      randomisation occurring at the village level to reduce spillover risk).

      The Investigators will measure use of the stations for one week prior to the implementation
      of the behavioural interventions, and then for a further six weeks. Station usage will be
      measured by a combination of structured observations and tally counters attached to the foot
      pedals that operate the station.
