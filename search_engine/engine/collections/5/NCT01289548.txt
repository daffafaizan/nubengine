      common clinical problem associated with a high morbidity and mortality. To reduce the adverse
      effects of IRI after organ transplantation various strategies aimed at the different
      pathophysiological processes of IRI have been investigated. Remote ischemic preconditioning
      (RIPC) is one such strategy where brief IRI of one organ protects other organs from sustained
      IRI. Many studies have shown that RIPC protects heart, muscle flaps, stomach, liver, lungs,
      and kidneys from IRI. RIPC of the limb with a tourniquet is a safe and convenient method of
      preconditioning organs against IRI. However, the efficacy of RIPC in patients undergoing
      living donor kidney transplantation need to be established and mechanism of early and late
      RIPC, such as whether the donor should undergo remote preconditioning or the recipient, need
      to be investigated.
