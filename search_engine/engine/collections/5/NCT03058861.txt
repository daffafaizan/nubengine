      Experiences (ACEs) screening and intervention in pediatric primary care. First, the
      investigators will develop and test a new ACEs screening tool that is brief, has a pediatric
      perspective, builds on parents' strengths, and measures parenting-related ACEs that can be
      treated. The new ACEs screening tool will measure parenting-related ACEs (e.g. corporal
      punishment, threatening, humiliation) and family stressors (e.g. divorce, incarceration,
      mental illness). A research assistant will invite approximately 1000 parents to complete the
      survey in the Vanderbilt Pediatric Primary Care Clinic. Measures will include child behavior
      problems that the investigators hypothesize will be associated with elevated parenting
      scores. The second part of the project will be to recruit English and Spanish-speaking
      parents for a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to determine if educational interventions can
      help educate parents about ACEs and decrease parenting-related ACE scores two months
      post-intervention. In the RCT, the investigators will recruit 300 to 400 parents to
      participate in the study. Parents in the intervention group will receive 1) a copy of the
      Play Nicely Healthy Discipline Handbook, 2) information about how to view the Play Nicely
      multimedia program online and 3) the TN ACEs Handout. Parents in the Control Group will
      receive routine primary care. Follow up data will be obtained 2 months after enrollment.
