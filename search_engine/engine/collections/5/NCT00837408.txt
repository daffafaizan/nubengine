      Chinese. This project taking place at Suizhou Central Hospital complements several years of
      similar research activities conducted by Dr. Rotimi s lab in populations of the African
      Diaspora with study sites in Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and the US. Suizhou Hospital was selected
      because of the existence of an excellent team of research investigators, infrastructure and
      more importantly, the availability of a large population from which to enroll and examine
      persons with diabetes and normal controls. Previous funding from Dr. Rotimi s lab at Howard
      University made it possible for Dr. Jiang and staff to enroll 1000 cases and controls.
      Therefore, the goal of the current project is to enroll additional 1500 cases of T2D and 1500
      ethnically matched Han controls from Suizhou to facilitate the conduct of genome-wide
      association study (GWAS) and candidate gene/loci studies in Han, Chinese. The current project
      will increase the number of subjects for future GWAS, linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping and
      functional studies to over 4,000 ethnically balanced cases (greater than 2,000) and controls
      (greater than 2,000). Identified candidate genes/loci will be investigated by re-sequencing
      and functional studies will be conducted to identify susceptibility variants for diabetes and
      associated complications including obesity, hypertension, nephropathy, neuropathy and
      retinopathy. Given past activities, it is also anticipated that this resource will form the
      basis of multiple collaborations between Dr. Rotimi s lab, several NIH intramural researchers
      and non-NIH scientists.
