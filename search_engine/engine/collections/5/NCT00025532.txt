      monoclonal antibody CC49-delta CH2 in patients with gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma. II.
      Determine the human anti-human monoclonal antibody response in patients treated with this
      drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive iodine I 131-labeled monoclonal antibody CC49-delta CH2 (131I MOAB
      CC49-delta CH2) IV over 5-10 minutes on day 0. Patients also receive unlabeled monoclonal
      antibody CC49-delta CH2 IV over 5 minutes followed by 131I MOAB CC49-delta CH2 IV over 5-10
      minutes on day 28. Patients are followed weekly for 4 months and then every 3 months for 1
      year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
