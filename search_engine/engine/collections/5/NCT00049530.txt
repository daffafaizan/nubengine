        -  Determine the ability of low-dose PEG-interferon alfa-2b to suppress plasma basic
           fibroblast growth factor (b-FGF) levels to normal in patients with metastatic melanoma
           over-expressing b-FGF.

        -  Determine the antitumor effect of this drug, in terms of progression-free and overall
           survival and tumor response, in these patients.

        -  Correlate tumor activity of this drug with b-FGF and vascular endothelial growth factor
           levels in the plasma and urine of these patients.

        -  Determine the safety profile of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) once weekly. Treatment continues
      until basic fibroblast growth factor level is suppressed to normal or until a maximum weekly
      dose is reached. If there is disease progression, patients then discontinue treatment. If
      there is no disease progression, patients receive PEG-interferon alfa-2b SC weekly for up to
      1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
