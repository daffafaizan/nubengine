      of this study is to establish the safety and efficacy of treating patients with early
      colorectal cancer with intratumoral influenza vaccine as a down staging and immune response
      enhancing treatment prior to intended curative surgery.

      The first part of the study will be conducted as a pilot study. Six patients with
      histologically verified or clinically suspicious sigmoid colon cancer who are planned to
      undergo curative surgery will be included. Patients will be recruited from the Department of
      Surgery, Zealand University Hospital after their case has been reviewed by the
      multidisciplinary team (MDT). Standard treatment involves intended curative surgery within
      two weeks after the diagnosis. The treatment will be performed within a few days and it will
      be ensured that the experimental treatment will not lead to a significant delay of intended
      curative surgery.

      If the pilot study finishes without violating any stop rules and without any serious adverse
      events the second part of the study will be initiated. This will be conducted as a phase 2
      study where 24 patients with histologically verified or clinically suspicious sigmoid colon
      cancer and rectal cancer will be included. Patients will be recruited from the Department of
      Surgery, Zealand University Hospital after their case has been reviewed by the
      multidisciplinary team (MDT). Standard treatment involves intended curative surgery within
      two weeks after the diagnosis. The treatment will be performed within a few days and it will
      be ensured that the experimental treatment will not lead to a significant delay of intended
      curative surgery.
