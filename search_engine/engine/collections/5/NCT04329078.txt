    
      Allergy to legumes is more and more frequent, especially in children allergic to peanut, with
      some severe reactions but little is known about cross-reactivity and clinical meanings of
      legumes sensitization in children allergic to peanut.

      All children with a confirmed peanut allergy and followed at the University Hospital of Nancy
      between January 1st 2017 and February 29th 2020 will be included in order to evaluate the
      prevalence of sensitization and allergy to other legumes in this population.

      In children allergic to peanut and to at least one other legume, we will evaluate the
      severity of the allergy and the sIgE profiles for peanut.
