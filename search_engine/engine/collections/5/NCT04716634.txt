    
      This is an open label, multicenter, Phase 2 study designed to assess the efficacy and safety
      of tislelizumab in combination with fruquintinib in patients with advanced or metastatic,
      unresectable GC and CRC. The study will be conducted in 2 parts.

      Part 1 of the study will be the safety run-in stage which assesses dose-limiting toxicities
      (DLTs) and RP2D. Part 2 will begin at RP2D. Patients enrolled in Part 1 at RP2D will be
      counted towards Part 2; up to approximately 30 patients per cohort will be enrolled at RP2D.

      The primary outcome measure of the study is ORR as assessed by the investigator per RECIST
      v1.1. Tislelizumab and fruquintinib will be administered until disease progression,
      intolerable toxicity, death, withdrawal of consent or until the study terminates.
