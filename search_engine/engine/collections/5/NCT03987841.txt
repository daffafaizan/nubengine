      setting with 12 weekly sessions followed by monthly spaced reminders for 3 months for a total
      duration of 6 months. We anticipate enrollment of 30 participants, who will be adults with
      poorly controlled type 2 diabetes and elevated diabetes distress recruited from Cooper Green
      Mercy Health Systems, a safety-net health system serving residents of Jefferson County,
      Alabama. A trained masters-level interventionist will deliver the integrated intervention.
      The aim of the intervention is to reduce diabetes distress and improve glycemic control.

      Participants will be assessed at baseline and 6-months. We will assess the preliminary
      efficacy of the intervention through pre/post evaluation of diabetes distress, diabetes
      self-management behaviors, and glycemic control as measured by hemoglobin A1c. Additionally,
      we will assess acceptability of the intervention through follow-up qualitative,
      semi-structured interviews of intervention participants; the feasibility of intervention
      delivery will be assessed using process measures.
