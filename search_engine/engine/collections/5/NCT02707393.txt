      all paediatric leukaemias. Since the introduction of tyrosinkinase inhibitors (TKI) stem cell
      transplantation (SCT) is no longer the first choice treatment for patients with early phase
      CML.

      However life-long treatment with TKI may not be feasable in several cases due to side effects
      such as growth retardation, non-compliance and resistance. This protocol evaluates the
      feasibility of SCT following a reduced intensity conditioning regimen (RIC) consisting of
      fludarabine, melphalan, thiotepa and thymoglobuline (ATG). Matched siblings and matched
      unrelated donors are permitted for stem cell donation. In case of unrelated donors tissue
      typing has to be done by high resolution molecular typing. Donors with 10/10 or 9/10
      identical allels in the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system are accepted. Preferred stem
      cell source is bone marrow but peripheral blood stem cells and umbilical cord blood are also
      allowed. Graft-versus-Host-Disease (GvHD)-prophylaxis is achieved with cyclosporine A and
      mycophenolate mofetil.

      Monitoring of the breakpoint cluster region - Abelson (BCR/ABL) rearrangement is performed
      monthly in the first year after SCT. In case of BCR/ABL positivity TKI are given in the first
      year after SCT. Followed by donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) later on if BCR/ABL positivity
      persists.
