      drepanocytic patient. A sample of urine will be also asked. Tubes, after pre-treatment, will
      be sent to Erasme hospital.

      A series ob biological but also genetic parameters, both at asymptomatic patients and those
      in aigüe phase of the disease, can be measured either immediately or a little time after the
      prelevement.

      In this way, we can study numerous domains linked to the physiopathology of the drepanocytose
      (hémolyse, vaso-occlusion, rheology, factors modulators of the clinical expression). The
      surplus of the collection could be used for other researchs. It's in this context that we
      also wish to constitute a biobank of serum, plasma and urine for these drepanocytic patients
      by surplus of taken material.

      The study is realized within the framework of an academic collaboration between institutions.
      The bank of takings will be located in the reference center of the pathologies of the Red
      Blood Cell (laboratory of medical chemistry of the erasme hospital).
