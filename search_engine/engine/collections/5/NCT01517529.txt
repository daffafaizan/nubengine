      NS3 resistance mutation during protease inhibitor therapy

      Hypothesis 1 (HT 1): Low HLA binding to peptides containing protease inhibitor resistance
      mutations is associated with the emergence of protease inhibitor mutants during therapy and
      failure of the treatment.

      Hypothesis 2 (HT 2): A hole in T cell repertoire may allow emergence of protease inhibitor
      mutants during protease inhibitor therapy which leads to loss of the immune responses to
      these mutants and failure of treatment.
