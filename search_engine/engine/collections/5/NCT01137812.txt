      diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This is a randomized (study drug assigned by
      chance), double-blind (neither the patient or the study doctor will know the name of the
      assigned treatment), multicenter study to determine the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      canagliflozin 300 mg compared to sitagliptin 100 mg (an antihyperglycemic drug) in patients
      with T2DM who are not achieving an adequate response from current antihyperglycemic therapy
      with metformin and sulphonylurea to control their diabetes. Approximately 720 patients with
      T2DM who are receiving combination therapy with metformin and sulphonylurea will receive the
      addition of once-daily treatment with canagliflozin 300 mg or sitagliptin 100 mg capsules for
      52 weeks. Patients will participate in the study for approximately 59 to 72 weeks. During
      treatment, patients will be monitored for safety by review of adverse events, results from
      laboratory tests, 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs measurements, body weight,
      physical examinations, and self monitored blood glucose (SMBG) measurements. The primary
      outcome measure in the study is the effect of canagliflozin compared to sitagliptin on
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) after 52 weeks of treatment. Study drug will be taken orally (by
      mouth) once daily before the first meal each day unless otherwise specified. Patients will
      take single-blind placebo for 2 weeks before randomization. After randomization, patients in
      the study will take double-blind canagliflozin 300 mg or matching sitagliptin 100 mg for 52
      weeks.
