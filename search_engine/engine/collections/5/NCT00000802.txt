    
      Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX), which is effective for secondary PCP prophylaxis, is
      associated with allergic manifestations and side effects that limit its use. Patients who are
      intolerant of TMP/SMX require an effective alternative. Dapsone and atovaquone have both
      shown promise as PCP prophylactic agents.

      Patients are randomized to receive either dapsone or atovaquone daily, with follow-up at the
      clinic every 4 months.
