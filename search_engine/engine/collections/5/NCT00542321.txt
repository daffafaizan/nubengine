      procedures for a multi-site randomized clinical trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of
      horizontal positioning interventions to reduce pulmonary complications in mechanically
      ventilated critically ill adult patients. The hypothesis of the randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) is no difference in pulmonary complications between manual, 2-hourly lateral rotation
      to > 45 degrees (control), and continuous automated turning to 45 degrees (experimental)
      groups.
