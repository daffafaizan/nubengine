    
      Patients at the intensive care unit who suffered acute renal failure with the need of
      continuous veno-venous hemodialysis will be investigated with continuous veno-venous
      hemodialysis and in a time window without continuous veno-venous hemodialysis to investigate
      the influence of continuous veno-venous hemodialysis on the cerebrovascular autoregulation.
