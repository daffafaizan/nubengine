    
      Introduction : Reversible Cerebral Vasoconstriction Syndrome (RCVS) combines headaches and
      segmental constriction of cerebral arteries that resolves within 3 months.

      It is the most recurrent reason of cerebral arteriopathy in people under 70 and of
      thunderclap headache in absence of aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.

      Objectives :

        -  Principal: identify RCVS's precipitating factors

        -  Secondary:

             1. Determine if migraine, anxiety, depression are risk factors of RCVS.

             2. Determine the role of precipitating factors and risk factors on the RCVS's
                prognosis in short, medium and long term.

             3. Start a formation of a large clinicoradiological database and a biobank (plasma,
                cerebro-spinal fluid, DNA).

      Methodology :

      Monocentric analytic observational 'Case - Control' study with prospective inclusion of cases
      in a follow-up cohort.

      This type of study is nevertheless considered interventional because we are collecting
      additional blood and CSF samples to constitute a biobank.
