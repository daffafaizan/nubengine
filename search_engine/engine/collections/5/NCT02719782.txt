      related HCC after liver transplantation. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria will receive
      escalating doses of HBV specific T cell receptor (TCR-T) on Day 1, Day 8, Day 15 and Day 22
      of the first 28-day treatment cycle, followed by every 2-week dosing on Day 1, Day 15, Day 29
      and Day 43 of repeated cycle. A 21-day treatment break will be given between each cycle.
      Treatment will be continued until disease progression unless otherwise specified per
      investigator's discretion. Subjects will be followed up post treatment for safety monitoring,
      including monthly follow up for the first three month and every 2-monthly follow up up to 24
      months post treatment.
