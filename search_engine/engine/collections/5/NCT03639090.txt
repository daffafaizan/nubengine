      instrument to measure the intracellular concentration of chemotherapeutic drug within an
      active tumor cell. If successful, this technique could be applied to dosage streamlining in
      patients and customization of dosage based on individual tumor characteristics. It also opens
      the door to research on novel chemotherapy agents or agents not typically used in a specific
      malignancy to determine if therapeutic levels can be obtained in tumor cells.

      Personalized chemotherapy is an evolving field with the underlying goal being minimization of
      side effects of treatment while maximizing net patient benefit for therapy. A key difficulty
      in personalized chemotherapy is that the determination of therapeutic benefit comes well
      after the administration of treatment has been completed. For most forms of chemotherapy
      there does not exist a laboratory study that can determine the concentration of therapeutic
      agent within the tumor itself and as such, real time dose adjustments are based only on
      toxicity, not on tumor penetrance.
