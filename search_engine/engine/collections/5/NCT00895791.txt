      bifurcation stenting techniques. Critical considerations are the rate of restenosis at the
      side branch ostium, and completeness of healing at sites of overlap of stent struts, which
      may affect the risk of stent thrombosis.

      Methods: Patients with complex bifurcation lesions with involvement of a significant side
      branch requiring a stent are randomized into two treatment arms. The first group of 20
      patients (group I) is treated with the AXXESS Biolimus A9 Bifurcation Stent System (Devax,
      Inc, Lake Forest CA), where additional everolimus-eluting Xience V stents (Abbott Vascular,
      Santa Clara, CA) are implanted into the distal main branch and the side branch as required.
      The second group of 20 patients (group II) is treated with the culotte technique using
      everolimus-eluting Xience V stents. Kissing balloon dilatation using non-compliant balloons
      will complete the index procedure in all cases. At 9 months, control angiography (with QCA
      using dedicated software) and OCT (of both main vessel and side branch) is performed.

      Assessment of Results:

        1. EP: stent strut coverage and stent strut apposition, assessed with OCT at 9 months.

        2. EP: restenosis, restenosis at SB ostium, MACE, stent thrombosis.
