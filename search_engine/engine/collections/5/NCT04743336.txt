      periodontitis who applied to Baskent University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of
      Periodontology between January 2019 and January 2021 were reviewed. Fifty three patients were
      excluded due to unclear or missing data, and five subjects were not included as they were
      under the age of 18. The final study population therefore consisted of 142 patients (82
      males/60 females).

      As well as age, gender, smoking status, and frequency of tooth brushing, medical data of the
      patients including hypertension, hyperlipidemia, BMI, and diabetes mellitus were obtained
      from the patient's hospital records.

      Periodontal records of the patients were obtained for six different sites (mesio-buccal,
      mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual, and disto-lingual) per tooth.

      Mean Â± standard deviation (SD) and median (minimum-maximum) were utilized for quantitative
      variables, and number of patients (percentage) were utilized for qualitative variables as
      descriptors. For quantitative variables, Kruskal-Wallis H test was performed to see whether
      there was a statistically significant difference between categories of the qualitative
      variable with more than two categories. Chi-square test was used for investigating the
      relationship between two qualitative variables. For determining the risk factors considered
      to have an effect on the dependent quantitative variable, univariate and multivariate
      logistic regression analyses were performed. Statistical significance level was defined to be
      0.05.
