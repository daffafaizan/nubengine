      The phase Ib portion of this study is to ensure the safety and tolerability of high dose
      ascorbate in combination with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) as assessed by incidence
      of dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). EBRT will be given at the standard dose for resectable
      soft tissue sarcomas according to the NCCN sarcoma guidelines.2 Patients will receive 50 Gy
      over 5 weeks, during which time they will be receiving three times a week IV high dose
      ascorbate. IV ascorbate infusions will be continued until the end of radiation therapy.
      Surgery will be performed 4-6 weeks from the end of radiation to allow for adequate tissue
      healing and resolution of acute toxicities.

      Phase 2:

      The phase 2 part of the study will provide an estimate of the relative treatment effect of
      pharmacological ascorbate in combination with preoperative EBRT in subjects with locally
      advanced, resectable, extremity, trunk or retroperitoneal high grade sarcomas, as measured by
      pathological response rates.

      As above, patients will receive the first dose of pharmacological ascorbate intravenously on
      day 1 of week 1 provided no reactions are seen to the test dose. This will be followed by 3
      times a week dosing at Dose 0 until completion of EBRT. Standard doses of radiation for
      resectable soft tissue sarcomas according to the NCCN sarcoma guidelines will be
      administered.2 Patients will receive preoperative radiation at a dose of 50 Gy over 5 weeks
      starting on week 1 day 1. Subjects will be followed either by clinic visit or phone contact
      every 12 weeks for approximately 24 months after the end of the treatment phase, at which
      time the initial survival data and disease recurrence will be assessed.
