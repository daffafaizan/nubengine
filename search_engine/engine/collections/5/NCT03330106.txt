      standard of care will be used to treat participants who have advanced solid tumors. This
      study will assess the effects of pevonedistat on the QTc interval in participants with
      advanced solid tumors.

      The study will enroll approximately 45 participants. The study will be conducted in two
      Parts: Part A and Part B. Part A will have a 2-way crossover design and will involve the
      collection of triplicate ECGs. In Part A, participants will be randomly assigned to one of
      the two treatment groups as follow:

        -  Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2 + Pevonedistat 50 mg/m^2

        -  Pevonedistat 50 mg/m^2 + Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2

      Eligible participants from Part A will continue treatment in optional Part B with
      pevonedistat in combination with SoC, docetaxel or carboplatin plus paclitaxel. The
      investigator will decide which pevonedistat combination a participant will receive.

        -  Pevonedistat 25 mg/m^2 + Docetaxel

        -  Pevonedistat 20 mg/m^2 + Carboplatin + Paclitaxel

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 9.6 months. Participants will make a final visit to the clinic
      30 days after receiving their last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
