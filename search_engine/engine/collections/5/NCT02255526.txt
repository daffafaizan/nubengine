      monitoring of cardiac patients. BodyGuardian (BG) is a novel remote care platform. It
      incorporates an adhesive strip sensor with in-built electrodes attached to a rechargeable
      module that can determine an ECG signal and bio impedance. The module also has a 3-way
      accelerometer. ECG, physical activity and respiration can be assessed using these sensors.
      Although ECG data is reliable, there are doubts regarding the clinical meaning and validity
      of the activity and respiration data.

      The BG reports respiration rate and activity level (on a scale of 0 to 100). This data is
      being used as input into other clinical algorithms including onboard ECG arrhythmia detection
      as well as clinical care algorithms for heart failure decompensation prediction.

      Respiration data is not uniformly reported and there is still doubt regarding its validity.
      BG breathing measurements will be compared to gold standard measurement techniques of gas
      exchange using a mouthpiece connected to flow and gas analyzer. Activity data is reported but
      the investigators do not know how the value translates into clinically used objective
      parameters of activity e.g. METS. BG activity measurements will be compared to the gold
      standard activity measurements using metabolic rate (indirect calorimetry)
