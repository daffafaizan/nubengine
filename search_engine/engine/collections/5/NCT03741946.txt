      prior conducting the study. 34 subjects were enrolled by using consecutive sampling method.
      Sample size was calculated by using numeric analytic comparative paired formula with repeated
      measurement. Inclusion criteria were patients with ASA score 1 and 2, aged between 18-60
      years old, no anatomical abnormality in neck. Exclusion criteria were patients who were
      either obese, has history of previous central venous catheter cannulation, and limitation on
      contralateral head movement. Drop out criteria was abnormalities of anatomical IJV and CA.
      Basic demographic data, such as sex, age, body weight and height, body mass index were
      recorded. Patients were positioned in Trendelenburg (15°) position. Identification triangle
      of Sedillot at cricoid level in right neck with palpation at angle 0°. USG probe was placed
      upright at the top of triangle of Sedillot at cricoid level. Identification of IJV and CA was
      shown in transversal view then the IJV to CA distance and overlap ratio was calculated.
      Contralateral head rotation was done with protractor at angle 30°, 45°, and 60°. The distance
      and overlap ratio of IJV and CA was calculated in each angle.
