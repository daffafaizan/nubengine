        1. To determine if tendon surgery for the forearm, wrist and thumb deformities of UECP is
           more effective than Botulinum toxin injections or regular ongoing treatment at improving
           function and quality of life for children with UECP. Children who are candidates for
           tendon surgery will be prospectively randomized to one of three treatment groups:
           standard tendon surgery, a series of three Botulinum toxin injections over a period of
           12 months, and regular ongoing treatment. Validated tests of cognition, function and
           quality of life with tests of stereognosis and range of motion will be administered
           before, during and after treatment in order to compare outcomes of the three treatment
           groups.

        2. To determine if serial Botulinum toxin injections have long-term beneficial effects on
           upper extremity function which outlast their paralytic effects.

      Botulinum toxin has been shown to have beneficial effects on UE function while the muscles
      injected remain weakened by the toxin. Clinicians have theorized that improvements in UE
      function are maintained after the toxin wears off, but this has not been proven. Children
      randomized to the Botulinum toxin injection group will receive 3 injections. Their function
      will be tested before the first injection, while the paralytic results of the second
      injection are still in effect, and after the paralytic effects of the third injection have
      worn off, and the results compared in order to determine if functional improvements outlast
      the medicinal effects.
