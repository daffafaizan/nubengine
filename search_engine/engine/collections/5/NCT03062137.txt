    
      The study group will include 100 patients undergoing flexible fiberoptic bronchoscopy (FFB).

      The patients will receive sedation with Midazolam, Fentanyl and Propofol. All patients will
      receive supplemental oxygen via nasal cannula (2-4 L/min) before the beginning of the
      procedure.

      In all cases, patients will be monitored using continuous electrocardiography, pulse oximetry
      (on patients finger), and transcutaneous carbon dioxide and saturation (on patients earlobe),
      and automated noninvasive blood pressure recordings every 5 minutes. All parameters will be
      recorded from accepting patient to bed of procedure until 10 minutes after removal of FFB
      from nasopharynx.

      The saturation will be measured in 3 different locations (one pulse is added in other
      earlobe). additionally, A blood gas sample will be taken during discrepancy between different
      measurements.

      Immediately after the end of procedure, the measurements from 3 different monitors will be
      printed, and the blood sample be taken to a gas sample machine by the investigator.

      Desaturation value and time will be compared between the different locations. The blood
      arterial saturation will be compared to other measurements taken at the same time.
