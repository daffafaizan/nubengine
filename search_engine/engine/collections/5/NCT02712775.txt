      adults. However, use of this life-saving technique is limited due to a severe shortage of
      donor livers and, consequently, over 1500 patients/year on waiting lists die prior to
      transplantation due to organ shortages. Also, poor immediate graft function remains a
      persistent problem especially in recipients of marginal livers, and biliary strictures
      evolving from reperfusion injury cause prolonged hospital stay, increased health care costs,
      and increased mortality. Furthermore, hepatic cold storage and reperfusion in transplantation
      settings cause mitochondrial dysfunction in liver cells, which constitutes a great risk for
      primary nonfunction and initial poor function after liver transplantation. The tetracycline
      derivative minocycline is a safe and widely used antibiotic that possesses cytoprotective
      effects through prevention of mitochondrial dysfunction in a variety of disease models.
      Recently, we showed that minocycline also protects against graft dysfunction and failure
      after orthotopic rat liver transplantation and against cell death after ischemia-reperfusion
      to cultured rat hepatocytes. Minocycline treatment specifically prevented mitochondrial
      dysfunction and increased graft and animal survival by blocking necrotic and apoptotic death
      pathways. Clinical studies indicating severe deterioration of mitochondrial function in
      livers during preservation provide a strong impetus to investigate minocycline as an
      effective agent to decrease injury and improve graft function after human clinical
      transplantation.
