      physicians and nurses experimented in tracheal intubation. It is an invasive act allowing a
      protection of airways and an optimal oxygenation of the patients in distress. The reference
      technique is the direct laryngoscopy by Macintosh . Corresponding data shows that a video
      laryngoscope - GLIDESCOPE laryngoscope - improve the conditions of intubation in the surgical
      unit thanks to a better display(visualization) of the opening. A derived device for pre
      hospital emergency units (GLIDESCOPE RangerÂ®) deserves to be compared with the classic
      laryngoscopy in emergency conditions.

      Objectives: compare the emergency intubation in Pre hospital meadow by Glide Scope Ranger
      with regard to the classic method

      Progress of the study: the patients will be included by emergency physicians working in out
      of hospital teams of 3 major hospitals of Paris. The patients will be randomized in 2 groups:
      1 group classic laryngoscopy (group 1) and a group Glide scope Ranger (group 2). The score
      IDS will be compared for every group as well as the arisen of a complication during the
      procedure. The consent will be collected on the place or during the hospitalization.
