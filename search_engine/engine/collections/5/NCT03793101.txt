      development for 15 years gives possibility to implant the intraocular lens by 1.4mm incision.
      This is not only a change in surgery technique, but it is a significant progress in safety
      and quality post-operative results. Bimanual cataract MICS technique gives the opportunity to
      reduce width of the corneal incision more than 40% comparing to the standard coaxial cataract
      surgery by use dedicated MICS IOL's. This allows to perform less traumatic surgery and
      provides the opportunity for fast visual rehabilitation from the first week after cataract
      surgery. The possibility of using multifocal and toric intraocular lenses in MICS technique
      fully meet the requirements of modern refractive intraocular surgery.
