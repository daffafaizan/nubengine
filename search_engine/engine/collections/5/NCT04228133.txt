      (ACT) for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).

      Three randomized controlled trials have shown that attention bias modification (ABM)
      protocols applying attention control training (ACT) aimed to balance attention between
      threat-related and neutral stimuli are efficient in reducing PTSD symptoms. However, contrary
      to in-clinic administration, such as applied in the above mentioned studies, home-delivered
      ABM was not effective in reducing symptoms among treatment-seeking patients.

      It is crucial to continue examining the efficacy of home-delivered ACT as PTSD entails
      functional impairments that might impede treatment-seeking patients from reaching to clinics
      to receive treatment. This could also inform other ABM protocols designated to treat other
      disorders.

      To overcome some critical differences between home and lab environments, the investigators
      developed a home-delivered ACT protocol that resembles as much as possible the typical-in-lab
      protocol. Specifically, participants will be accompanied during their training sessions using
      internet-based video conference, permitting a better control for the physical environment
      before and during the session and a direct interaction with the experimenters.

      To test its efficacy, the investigators will recruit participants that are diagnosed with
      PTSD and will be randomly assigned to one of two home-delivered conditions: ACT and a control
      ABM condition. It is hypothesized that home-delivered ACT will produce greater reduction in
      PTSD symptoms relative to a control ABM protocol. It is also expected that ACT will reduce
      attention bias variability to a greater extent compared to the control condition.
