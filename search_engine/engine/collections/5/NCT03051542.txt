      SUVmax as reference to interpret 18F-FDG PET/CT. Positive lesions in PET were indicated as
      SUVmax of residues higher than the threshold or new 18F-FDG avid lesions. Investigators
      compare the prognostic accuracy of the liver SUVmax-based criteria with the 5-PS criteria and
      Î”SUVmax interpretation with respect to predicting disease progression during chemotherapy or
      survival in NK/T-cell lymphoma. Furthermore,investigators improve the prognostic ability of
      interim PET/CT by comparing the results to the clinical prognostic factors.
