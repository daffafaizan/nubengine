      or refractory solid tumors. II. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of L-778,123 including
      qualitative, quantitative, and dose limiting toxicity in these patients. III. Assess the
      pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients. IV. Evaluate the radiologic or
      tumor marker responses to treatment in these patients. V. Evaluate the relationship between
      ras mutations and response to treatment in these patients. VI. Determine the relationship
      between plasma drug levels and farnesylation assay results.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive continuous infusions of L-778,123
      over 7 days every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxic effects. All patients are observed for at least 1 week after the 7 day
      infusion of L-778,123 prior to subsequent dose escalation. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of L-778,123 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. MTD is
      defined as the dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting
      toxicities. Patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
