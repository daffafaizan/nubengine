    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/1b study of RMC-5552 monotherapy in participants
      with advanced relapsed or refractory solid tumors. The study will include 2 components: 1) a
      Dose-Escalation Component for participants with relapsed or refractory solid tumors and 2) a
      Dose-Expansion Component for participants with relapsed or refractory solid tumors harboring
      certain specific mutations/rearrangements that result in hyperactivation of the mTOR pathway.
      Participants will be treated until disease progression per RECIST v1.1, unacceptable
      toxicity, or other criteria for withdrawal are met, whichever occurs first.
