    
      Sitravatinib is an orally-available, small molecule inhibitor of a closely related spectrum
      of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) including MET, Axl, MERTK, VEGFR family, PDGFR family,
      KIT, FLT3, Trk family, RET, DDR2 and selected Eph family members. Nivolumab is a human IgG
      monoclonal antibody that binds to the programmed cell death-1(PD-1) receptor and blocks its
      interaction with programmed cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2, releasing PD-1
      pathway-mediated inhibition of the immune response including anti-tumor immune response.
      Combining an immunotherapeutic PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor with an agent that has both immune
      modulatory and antitumor properties could enhance the antitumor efficacy observed with either
      agent alone. Sitravatinib selectively inhibits key molecular and cellular pathways strongly
      implicated in checkpoint inhibitor resistance and therefore represents a rational strategy to
      enhance or restore anti-tumor immunity when combined with nivolumab, a checkpoint inhibitor
      therapy.

      Pembrolizumab is a humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds to the PD-1 receptor and
      selectively blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2, releasing PD-1 pathway-mediated
      inhibition of the immune response, including the anti-tumor immune response. Enfortumab
      vedotin (enfortumab) is an investigational ADC that is comprised of a fully human
      anti-Nectin-4 IgG1 monoclonal antibody conjugated to MMAE via a protease-cleavable linker.
      Enfortumab binds to cells that express Nectin-4 with high affinity, triggering the
      internalization and release of MMAE in target cells, inducing cell cycle arrest and apoptotic
      cell death. Early efficacy results from enfortumab in combination with pembrolizumab in
      frontline cisplatin-ineligible urothelial carcinoma in the ongoing EV-103 study have
      demonstrated encouraging activity with a safety profile that appears manageable and
      tolerable. Addition of sitravatinib to this combination might further augment clinical
      activity by selectively inhibiting key molecular and cellular pathways strongly implicated in
      checkpoint inhibitor resistance.
