      first identified during pregnancy, excluding diabetic patients diagnosed before pregnancy.
      GDM can not only have an adverse effect on the pregnant women and the developing fetus, but
      also can have long lasting effects after birth. GDM can elevates risks of abnormal glucose
      metabolism postpartum. Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with insulin
      resistance and impaired β-cell function. Our previous research also implied that the level of
      vitamin D is much lower in the women of impaired glucose regulation after birth with history
      of GDM. This prospective randomized, control clinical trial was designed to evaluate the
      effects of vitamin D administration on insulin resistance and β-cell function among women
      with vitamin D deficiency（25OHD <50 ng/mL）and previous GDM. Participants with vitamin D
      deficiency and previous GDM were divided into normal glucose regulation group(NGR) (n=90) and
      impaired glucose regulation group(IGR)(n=90) according to the oral glucose tolerance test
      (OGTT) around 42 days postpartum. And each group was further divided into intervention group
      and control group, Participants in the intervention group took 1600 units of vitamin D daily
      for nine months and meanwhile receive lifestyle intervention. The control group only receive
      lifestyle intervention. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation
      on insulin sensitivity, pancreatic β-cell function and markers of inflammation in Chinese
      women with former GDM and vitamin D insufficiency.
