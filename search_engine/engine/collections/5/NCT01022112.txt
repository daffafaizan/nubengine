      presents patients with a significant risk of complications including heart disease,
      retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Various classes of orally administered
      antihyperglycemic agents have been developed for the treatment of T2DM and although
      individual agents may be highly effective for some patients, it is still difficult to
      maintain optimal glycemic control in most patients, resulting in high rates of morbidity and
      mortality in the diabetic population. This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group study to demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of TA-7284
      compared with placebo in patients with T2DM, who are not optimally controlled on diet and
      exercise. The primary study hypothesis is that the study drug will be superior to placebo as
      assessed by the change in HbA1c from baseline. The patients will receive tablets of TA-7284,
      or placebo, once daily for 12 weeks.
