    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess feasibility of pre-operative stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in prostate
      cancer patients at high risk for recurrence after prostatectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess safety and acute toxicity of SBRT followed by prostatectomy. This will be based
      on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0 and patient reported
      quality of life (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] and International Prostate
      Symptom Score [IPSS] questionnaires).

      II. Correlative biomarker and molecular analyses using the primary tumor specimen and serial
      blood draws before and after treatment.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 3 fractions of SBRT over 1-2 weeks, 2-4 weeks prior to radical
      prostatectomy.

      After completion of the study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year.
