      such as bones, tendons, vessels, or nerves, are common in the emergency departments. The
      exact rate of infection in such wounds is unclear. It is also not clear whether prescribing
      prophylactic antibiotics reduces the risk of infection in simple hand lacerations. The
      objective of this randomized double blind controlled study is to: 1. Identify the rate of
      infection in simple hand lacerations, 2. Identify factors or wound characteristics that
      increase the risk of infection, and 3. Assess whether prescribing prophylactic antibiotics
      decreases the risk of infections in such wounds compared to placebo.
