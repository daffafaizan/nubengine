    
      The study will be divided into three parts: A, B, C.

      Part A: Single Dose, extended release (XR) Formulation Selection. This part of the study is a
      single dose, open label, four-period crossover design in a group of 16 healthy participants.

      Part B: Multiple Ascending Dose. Part B has been designed to assess the effect of multiple
      doses of one formulation of XR CTN. This part of the study will be a double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled design.

      Part C: Food Effect. Part C has been designed to determine the effect food has on XR CTN. The
      XR formulation and dose administered will be selected after review of Part B data. This part
      will be an open-label, two-period crossover design in a group of 16 healthy participants.
