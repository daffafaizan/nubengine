      Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) may be involved in certain types of cancer, including
      squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. When EGFR is stimulated, a series of chemical reactions
      starts that results in a tumor being "told" to grow. ZD1839 tries to stop these reactions by
      blocking EGFR. This may stop tumors from growing.

      In this study, participants will take ZD1839 by mouth daily. Once the treatment has started,
      participants will return to the clinic before every treatment cycle (every 4 weeks) for the
      first 4 months then every 8 weeks thereafter. At these visits, participants will have a
      physical exam and blood tests will be performed. About 2-4 teaspoons of blood will be drawn
      at each visit. The doctor will also check on how participants are tolerating ZD1839 (side
      effects). Every 8 weeks, participants will have their tumor evaluated by radiographic scans.
      This may include either a CT or MRI and a chest X-ray.

      During treatment, participants should not take any other medication, including
      non-prescription drugs such as aspirin or herbal products without the approval of their
      doctor.

      Participants will continue taking the trial drug until the tumor grows, a severe side effect
      occurs, they withdraw consent, or the study is closed. The study will be closed 12 months
      after the last participant is enrolled.

      This is an investigational study. The FDA has approved ZD1839 for the treatment of advanced
      lung cancer, but the FDA has authorized ZD1839 for research only in the treatment of skin
      cancer. About 40 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M.D.
      Anderson.
