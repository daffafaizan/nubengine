    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-centre phase II/II study to
      assess efficacy and safety of Ustekinumab (STELARAÂ®) in patients with T1D. The investigators
      will perform a phase II/III clinical trial with a total of 66 adult (18-25 years old)
      subjects with recent-onset T1D. There will be two study cohorts, with a drug:placebo ratio of
      2:1. Patients receiving the study drug will receive a loading dose of 6mg/kg Ustekinumab IV
      given at week 0. Thereafter, 90mg Ustekinumab subcutaneously given at weeks 8, 16, 24, 32,
      40, 48 (total of 7 doses). Patients randomized to receive placebo will receive respective
      amounts of a saline-placebo. An additional non-dosing visit at the midpoint (week 28) is
      required to measure 2-hour C-peptide during a MMTT. Patients will be followed for 78 weeks
      following the first dose. There will be a total of 10 study visits over 78 weeks, three of
      which are non-dosing and follow-up visits. Recruitment and screening for the study will be
      completed within the first 24 months. The follow up period is 1 and 1.5 years from the first
      dose.
