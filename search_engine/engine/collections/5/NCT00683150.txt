      To perform an endothelial function test, your temperature will be taken using your fingertip
      on both hands using the Vendy's-DTM machine. The Vendy's-DTM machine uses small sleeves that
      fit over your fingertips to take your temperature. After your temperature is taken, your
      right arm will be placed in a standard blood pressure cuff. After the cuff is inflated for 2
      minutes, your temperature will be taken again from the same fingertip. The difference of
      temperatures before and after inflation may be able to predict endothelial complications,
      such as lung function, heart failure and heart attack.

      This test will be performed within 20 days before your scheduled surgery, when surgery begins
      (at the time of incision), every hour during surgery and then 1, 2, 3, and 5 days after your
      surgery.

      Follow-up:

      You will be called to collect information about your overall health at 30 days and 1 year
      after surgery. The phone call will last about 30 minutes.

      Length of Study:

      You will be off study after the second phone call.

      This is an investigational study. Up to 60 patients will take part in this study. All will be
      enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
