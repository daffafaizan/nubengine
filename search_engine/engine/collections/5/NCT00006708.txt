      refractory, CD20 expressing, aggressive, B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with
      ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide with or without rituximab. II. Compare the unconfirmed
      response rate of patients treated with these regimens. III. Determine the toxicity of
      ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide with rituximab in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified according to histology (large
      B-cell vs other) and risk group (low/low-intermediate vs high-intermediate/high). Patients
      are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive etoposide IV over 1 hour
      on days 1-3, carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2, ifosfamide IV continuously for 24 hours on
      day 2, and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) on days 5-12. Treatment continues every 3
      weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm II:
      Patients receive rituximab IV on day 1, etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 2-4, carboplatin IV
      over 1 hour on day 3, ifosfamide IV continuously for 24 hours on day 3, and G-CSF SC on days
      6-13. Patients also receive rituximab IV on day 8 of course 1. Treatment continues every 3
      weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually for 5
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 376 patients (188 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 3 years.
