    
      This is a 2-part, Phase 1/2, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention),
      multiple-dose and dose-escalation study of intravenous (directly into a vein) siltuximab in
      participants with malignant solid tumors. The study tests the safety and effectiveness of the
      experimental drug, siltuximab, in participants with advanced cancer (abnormal tissue that
      grows and spreads in the body). This study also tests how siltuximab is cleared from the body
      and how the body reacts to it. For this reason blood tests will be performed and some
      characteristics of the tumor will be analyzed. Siltuximab will be given by intravenous
      infusion (a fluid or a medicine delivered into a vein by way of a needle) over 1 hour. In
      Phase 1 (Cohort 1-4) doses will be administered in a range of 2.8-15 milligram per kilogram
      (mg/kg). Cohort 5 of Phase 1 will receive the recommended dose and schedule as determined
      from Cohort 1-4. Participants in Phase 1 (Cohort 1-4) will receive 4 administrations of
      siltuximab over a 10-13 week period, while participants in Cohort 5 and Phase 2 will receive
      12 administrations over a 33 week period. Follow-up visits up to 12 weeks after last dose
      will be scheduled. Participants may then be contacted for up to 1 year after the last dose
      for follow-up survival and disease status information. Efficacy will primarily be evaluated
      as per response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria. Participants' safety
      will be monitored at every visit.
