      University of Minnesota. The registry will: (1) provide core outcomes data and background
      information necessary to conduct outcomes management research in solid organ transplantation
      and advanced lung disease, and (2) support cutting edge research through existing program
      specific databases in liver, intestine, pancreas, islet, kidney, heart and lung
      transplantation.
