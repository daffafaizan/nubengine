      benefits of Quercetin Phytosome in community-based subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2
      infection (by RT-PCR). The study has two arms. In one arm the subjects will receive standard
      COVID-19 care as per the hospital/physician guidelines, whereas in the other arm the subjects
      will receive standard COVID-19 care + Quercetin Phytosome. The treatment will continue for 30
      days. It is proposed that Quercetin Phytosome will contribute to boosting the natural
      immunity of the subjects and will help in preventing the COVID-19 disease progression i.e
      preventing the need of hospitalisation.
