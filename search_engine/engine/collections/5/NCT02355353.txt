    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, single-arm imaging trial. Patients with resectable liver
      metastases from colorectal cancer (CRC) will undergo Diffusion Weighted Imaging- Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (DWI-MRI) scans at least at three separate occasions: at baseline, at 14
      days (maximum +/- 1 days deviation is acceptable) after first administration of chemotherapy
      and finally after up to 6 cycles of chemotherapy (one week prior to surgery).

      All patients registered in the study may participate to the test-retest analysis. This
      analysis required a double baseline scans (called test-retest) to be done on two separate
      occasions, separated from each other by from one hour to one week but both before start of
      therapy. The repeated scan at baseline (retest) is optional as it will be used only for the
      test-retest repeatability analysis.

      Dedicated in-house developed software will be used to quantify ADC to assess tumor
      characteristics and response to therapy.
