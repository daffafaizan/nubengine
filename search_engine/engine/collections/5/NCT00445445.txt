        -  Characterize each woman's individual mammographic density (MD) longitudinal change
           trajectory in women with breast cancer and in healthy female participants to assess
           within-individual MD longitudinal change and breast cancer risk.

        -  Examine whether these patients or healthy participants manifest different patterns of
           within-individual change in MD and evaluate predictors of across-individual differences.

        -  Determine whether the developmental profile of MD differs systematically between these
           patients and healthy participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, retrospective, controlled study. Patients and healthy
      participants are frequency-matched by age (Â± 2 years) and ethnicity.

        -  Questionnaire: Patients and healthy participants complete a self-administered
           questionnaire providing detailed information on breast cancer risk factors, including
           demographics, behavioral and lifestyle factors, reproductive history, family history of
           breast cancer, comorbidities, medication and hormone replacement therapy use, and breast
           cancer screening history. This information is then cross-validated with documented data
           abstracted from medical records to provide a longitudinal and historical framework for
           assessing individual risk.

        -  Mammographic density (MD) assessment: Patients and healthy participants are evaluated
           for patterns of longitudinal change in MD and subsequent breast cancer risk by
           retrospective review of screening mammograms performed prior to breast cancer diagnosis.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1500 patients and 1500 healthy participants will be accrued for
      this study.
