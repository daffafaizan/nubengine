      support programs are an innovative and promising model to reverse demoralization, activate
      consumers to seek more effective care, develop consumers' self-management skills, and restore
      participation in work and other social roles. Peer-led programs can address key barriers to
      dissemination of effective psychosocial treatment. This pilot effectiveness trial will
      evaluate the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a structured peer support
      program based on the Certified Peer Specialist Program of the Depression and Bipolar Support
      Alliance (DBSA). Following the philosophy of recovery, the intervention focuses on:

        -  Motivating consumers to develop an expectation of recovery

        -  Encouraging regular self-monitoring of mood symptoms

        -  Training consumers to develop self-management skills for symptom control and problem
           solving

        -  Activating consumers to be more informed partners in care and more effective
           self-advocates

        -  Motivating and assisting consumers to reclaim work and other rewarding social roles

      The investigators will use a rigorous research design to evaluate how structured peer support
      promotes core values of mental health recovery. Impact of the intervention will be judged
      across a range of outcomes:

        -  Long-term control of mood disorder symptoms

        -  Optimal participation in work and other rewarding social roles

        -  Consumers' perceptions of autonomy and full participation in the treatment process
           Findings from this pilot study will inform the development of a full-scale effectiveness
           trial to include a broader range of participants and health care settings.
