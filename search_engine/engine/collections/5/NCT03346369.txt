      countries) and highly recurrent disease. Secondary hyperoxaluria is a key risk factor for the
      development of calcium oxalate stones, the most frequent stone type. Currently used
      therapeutic options in secondary hyperoxaluria have limited efficacy. Recent findings in
      vitro and in a rat model, provided evidence that Lanthanum Carbonate is an effective oxalate
      binder. The objective of this study is to investigate whether treatment with Lanthanum
      Carbonate reduces urinary oxalate excretion in human subjects with secondary hyperoxaluria
      and nephrolithiasis. By treating the patients with two different doses of Lanthanum Carbonate
      during two 14-day treatment periods, a dose-response will be evaluated.
