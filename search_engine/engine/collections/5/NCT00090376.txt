      regrow damaged nerves in these animal studies. Participants will receive either GPI 1485 or a
      placebo (inactive pill). Participants will begin study medication 3 full days prior to their
      scheduled surgery.

      GPI 1485 will be supplied as an oral tablet formulation to men who are candidates for
      bilateral nerve-sparing prostatectomies. Participants randomly assigned to receive GPI 1485
      will be required to take four tablets four times a day by mouth.

      GPI 1485 matching placebo will also be supplied as an oral tablet formulation. Participants
      randomly assigned to placebo will be required to take 4 placebo tablets four times a day by
      mouth.

      Viagra® will be supplied as oral tablets beginning 1 month post-surgery. Patients can begin
      Viagra® 1 month post-surgery and may continue use until the end of the study, as needed.

      The duration of this study is 12 months which includes 5 office visits to your doctor in
      addition to the surgery day. During this study you will also have other clinical evaluations
      including a physical exam, blood work, ECG (tracing of your heart rhythm) and urinalysis.

      Participants enrolled in this study will also carry a handheld diary that is loaded with
      special protocol-specific software, which will be referred to as the patient experience diary
      (PED). Over the duration of this study, participants will complete their questionnaires and
      answer questions about their medication compliance in the electronic PED.
