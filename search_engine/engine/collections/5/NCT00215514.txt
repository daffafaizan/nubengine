    
      -  Patients will receive epirubicin and cisplatin intravenously on day 1 of treatment.
           5-fluorouracil will be given continuously by intravenous infusion bia a portable
           ambulatory pump (CADD pump) for 21 days. This cycle of chemotherapy will take 21 days (3
           weeks). Once it is complete there will be one week without therapy.

        -  Once the patient has recovered from any side-effects from the chemotherapy they will
           start the combination chemoradiation therapy, 5-fluorouracil and radiation. The
           radiation will be directed to the upper abdomen in the area where the stomach tumor has
           been located. The radiation therapy will be given five days a week for a total of five
           weeks. During these five weeks patients will receive 5-fluorouracil continuously by CADD
           pump.

        -  After completion of combination chemoradiation therapy there will be a three to four
           week rest period followed by 2 additional chemotherapy cycles identical to the first
           chemotherapy cycle.

        -  The following tests and procedures will be performed: physical examination every 4 weeks
           except during the chemoradiation therapy when it will be done weekly; blood tests every
           week during chemotherapy and chemoradiation; CT scans and chest x-rays done before
           therapy, at the end of therapy, and yearly for 2 years; noninvasive testing to evaluate
           kidney function before starting the study.

        -  The program of chemotherapy and radiation therapy will last approximately 30 weeks.
           After all treatment is completed, patients will return for physical examinations and
           blood tests every 3 months for 3 years; then every 6 months for 2 years.
