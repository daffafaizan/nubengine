      receive a single dose of BCG, by percutaneous administration, on Study Day 0. There will be
      two follow-up visits on Study Days 54 and 56, with telephone contact every 2 weeks in between
      these visits. Leukapheresis will be conducted on Study Days 0 and 56. The Study Day 56
      leukapheresis was selected based on results from functional biological assays that suggest
      analysis of samples at this time point may provide insight into the protective immune
      responses elicited by BCG. The study will be conducted at a single site in the US (University
      of Rochester Medical Center [URMC]).
