      separated 30 ± 10 days. If during the first visit the drug was used, in the second visit -
      placebo or vice versa. Before and after procedure, safety measures (arterial blood pressure,
      heart rate value, and cough scale) were performed. The effect of a possible inhibitor of ROS
      formation was performed using corticosteroid-naive asthmatic subjects, which are more prone
      to oxidative stress than healthy non-smoking subjects. The study protocol was approved by the
      Ethics Committee of Medical University of Lodz (no. RNN/12/08/KE) and written consent was
      obtained from every subject prior to the study.

      EBC was collected using a modification of the method described previously by Doniec et
      al.2005. The subjects breathed spontaneously through a mouthpiece for 20 min. Each subject
      wore a nose clip during this procedure. Approximately 2 ml of condensate was collected and
      immediately stored at -80°C until the procedure of H2O2, NO2- and NO3- measurement.

      6 ml of apocynin of total dose 3 mg (0.5 mg/ml) has been nebulized through the mouthpiece
      with using of a nose clip.

      The H2O2 concentration in EBC was measured according to the method applied previously by
      Nowak et al.2001. Determination of NO2- and NO3- with Griess solution was performed by
      micromethod, carried out in 96-well plates, according to Griess' method, modified the method
      described by Dziedzic et al.2003.
