    
      The study is designed to be a prospective randomized controlled trial, aiming to compare the
      impact of adjuvant chemotherapy with Paclitaxel and Cisplatin, adjuvant radiotherapy with
      IMRT of 50Gy, and surgery alone on the disease free survival (DFS) of patients with high-risk
      pN0 thoracic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma. Pathological staging is to be based on the
      7th UICC edition, after radical resection and systemic lymph node dissection,for accurate
      staging.Patients with pT1b-T4a disease, proved to be pN0 upon pathological examination, meet
      at least one of the risk factors in the inclusion criteria, and without any exclusion
      criteria are to be randomized into one of the three study arms.Definition of high-risk
      factors for recurrence include: (1)Tumor location: in the middle or upper third thoracic
      esophagus; (2) Presence of LVI or submucosal metastasis; (3) Cell differentiation: poorly
      differentiated or undifferentiated.

      Primary endpoint:

      To observe and compare Disease-Free Survivals (DFS) among the three study arms.

      Secondary endpoint:

      To observe and compare Overall Survivals (OS) among the three study arms, and to compare
      adverse events between adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant radiation groups.

      Additional instructions:

      No.
