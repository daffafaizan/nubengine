      Opioids and NSAIDs are used extensively to control pain; both of them are with side effects.
      Paracetamol is a safe and effective analgesic that is used by oral or rectal routs for pain
      control, and in therapeutic doses has less side effects than Morphine and NSAIDs, and
      approved as a safe and effective analgesic in emergency department.

      recently Iv Paracetamol has become available in European countries and also in Iran.

      efficacy and safety of IV Paracetamol has been studied in post operation conditions and
      asserted but in emergency setting it has been studied only in renal colic situation.

      Therefore, the investigators want to study the efficacy of IV Paracetamol in limb trauma and
      compare it with Iv Morphine sulfate.
