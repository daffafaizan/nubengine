    
      This is a two-group, randomized pilot study to test the feasibility, acceptability,
      usability, satisfaction and preliminary efficacy of a behavioral (psychoeducation)
      intervention, as compared to a usual care (information from healthcare providers) control
      group, on caregiver outcomes. The control and intervention groups will receive the standard
      University Hospitals Seidman Cancer Center (SCC) binder of relevant information regarding
      care of the patient undergoing HSCT or CAR T-cell therapy. This information will be given to
      the caregiver by the health care provider. In addition, the intervention group will receive 6
      individual sessions with an interventionist during all phases of HSCT or CAR T-cell therapy.
      The independent variable is group assignment.

      The primary objective of this study is to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a
      psycho-educational intervention designed for caregivers of patients receiving HSCT (allogenic
      or autologous) or CAR T-cell therapy.

      The secondary objective of this study is to explore the usability, satisfaction and
      preliminary efficacy of a psycho-educational intervention designed for caregivers of patients
      receiving HSCT (allogenic or autologous) or CAR T-cell therapy.
