      ReNaM questionnaire. Molecular characterization of ICC tissue samples will be carried out by
      RNAseq. Briefly, after surgical resection tissue samples will be immediately suspended in
      RNAlater. RNAseq analysis will be performed on the Illumina HiScanSQ platform. Any possible
      mutations identified by RNAseq will be validated by Sanger sequencing. Putative identified
      fusion transcripts will be confirmed by RT-PCR, using specific primers pairs located on the
      sequences from the exons of the two putative fusion genes. Variations in gene expression will
      be validated by the real-time PCR. The bioinformatic analysis will be made by using CentOS5
      Server. For evaluation of asbestos fibers in tumor tissues, samples embedded in paraffin will
      be incinerated and then analyzed in a scanning electron microscope and by EDS spectroscopy.
