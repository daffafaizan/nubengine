      treatment for many chronic conditions including Alzheimer's disease. Healthcare providers and
      researchers have found that when patients who have chronic conditions engage with music that
      is patients' preference or most familiar to patients, the patients display positive changes
      in mood regulation and thinking overall. The investigators are trying to understand to what
      extent these music interventions could be useful for patients with Alzheimer's disease and
      for which populations the intervention is more effective for. To do this, the investigators
      are looking to recruit participants with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease to complete a
      four (4) week personalized music intervention where patients listen to a one-hour playlist
      created from patients' described preferences and songs.
