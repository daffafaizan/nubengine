      Clinical Testing of Sensory Integration in Balance (mCTSIB) protocol: the subjects will be
      required to stand on a hard or compliant surface (a 4" tall foam cushion of known mechanical
      properties) in a comfortable posture, feet shoulder width, with eyes open or closed, head
      straight and arms to the side and free to move, gazing forward, and breathing normally.
      Subsequently, subjects will be asked to stand first on the right leg and then on the left
      leg, raising the other leg (flexing the hip about 45 degrees), bending (flexing) the knee 90
      degrees, keeping the arms extended and moving them laterally (abduct shoulders to 45 degrees
      and extend both elbows) to help maintaining balance with eyes open. Finally, subjects will be
      asked to perform 10 repetition of the squatting movement, with the operator pacing them
      (telling them when to start and when to stop the movements). The results of the mCTSIB,
      combined with an initial physical and neurological examination will be used to classify the
      subjects into the healthy and non healthy group.
