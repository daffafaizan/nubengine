      viruses are now also considered as important agents in lung function deterioration. No
      strategy has been established on the optimal sampling for respiratory viral molecular
      diagnostic in CF. Nasopharyngeal swabs (NP) are recommended for respiratory viral screening
      in non-CF patients but are invasive and sometimes painful for patients. As sputa are non
      invasive and collected for bacterial monitoring in CF patients they could represent a
      convenient alternative to NP swabs.

      This study's aim is to define whether viral screening give concordant results between sputa
      and NP swabs.
