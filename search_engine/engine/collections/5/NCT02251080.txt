    
      This is an investigator-blinded, prospective study of subjects diagnosed with ADHD.Forty-four
      subjects ages 18 years and older will be enrolled. An Internet-based survey will be piloted
      to evaluate its effect on adherence to oral ADHD medication. Subjects randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to the Internet-survey group will log their impression of the state of their disease on
      a weekly basis. Subjects in both the intervention and control groups will receive
      standard-of-care medication, stimulants. Adherence to the medication will be assessed using
      Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMSÂ®) caps, electronic monitors affixed to the
      medication containers. Investigators and subjects will be blinded to the adherence data until
      the final (Month 2) treatment visit.
