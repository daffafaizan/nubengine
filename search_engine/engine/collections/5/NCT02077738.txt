      tolerance/comfort of HFCWO in the management of surgical and non-surgical patients who had
      impaired bronchial secretion clearance, including those with neuromuscular disorders, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic fibrosis, and blunt thoracic trauma, or those
      hospitalized for critical cardiac/abdominal/thoracic surgery. However, these outcomes of
      HFCWO on PMV patients remain unknown.

      This parallel-design, randomized controlled trial aimed to test the hypothesis that HFCWO
      could produce greater clearance volume of sputum, greater improvement rates in serial changes
      in the chest X-ray (CXR), and greater weaning success rates after extubation in PMV patients
      with intra-tracheal intubation. Moreover, the safety and tolerance/comfort of HFCWO in PMV
      patients after removal of endotracheal tubes were also evaluated.
