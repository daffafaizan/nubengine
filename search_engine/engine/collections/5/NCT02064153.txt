      of intra-dialytic hypotension (IDH). During dialysis fluid is continuously removed. IDH
      occurs when plasma refilling rate is smaller than the set ultra-filtration rate. When plasma
      refiling rate is small, continuous fluid removal bring patient to the threshold state where
      patient does not have sufficient fluid in central compartment. This leads to the cascade of
      events, viz., low blood pressure, muscle cramps, dizziness, being first few manifestation. To
      minimize the occurrence of such events, clinicians often prescribe cool dialysate resulting
      in vasoconstriction, which ensures sufficient fluid volume in central body compartment so
      that continuous fluid loss does not impact patient hemodynamics severely.

      It is important to note that vasoconstriction may also inhibit the toxin movement from remote
      peripheral compartments to central blood compartment, and thus less toxin will be removed. On
      the other hand warm dialysate leading to vasodilation will mobilize the toxins in remote
      peripheral compartments and increase the toxin influx in central blood compartment. Few
      researchers have investigate the effect of dialysate temperature on urea removal, but urea is
      not a true marker of toxin milieu. In this pilot clinical research, we will compare the
      effect of dialysate temperature on removal of both small and large sized uremic toxins. Our
      objective is not to study the effect of dialysate temperature on incidence of IDH, so we will
      recruit subjects who are stable on dialysis and have no prior history of IDH episodes.
