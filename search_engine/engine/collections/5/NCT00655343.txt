    
      To assess the efficacy of ATG-FRESENIUS S in addition to standard therapy (cyclosporine A /
      methotrexate) with respect to early treatment failure defined by the occurrence of severe
      acute GvHD grade III-IV or early mortality within 100 days post transplantation compared to
      standard therapy alone.

      All patients receive myeloablative therapy. Recommended regimens: For patients with ALL:
      fractionated TBI (8-12 Gy) plus cyclophosphamide (1-2 x 60 mg/kg) [etoposide/melfalan are
      also allowed]. For all other indications: either TBI (8-12 Gy) or busulfan (per os 14-16
      mg/kg b.w. or equivalent for IV administration) plus cyclophosphamide (1-2 x 60 mg/kg) or
      thiotepa ≥ 15 mg/kg or BCNU ≥ 300 mg/m2.

      Conditioning regimens may differ from centre to centre; each centre decides for constant
      (disease specific) regimen(s) throughout the whole study period.

      Standard GvHD prophylaxis consists of cyclosporine A (target trough level ≥ 200 ng/ml
      starting from day -1 until day +100) and short course methotrexate (15 mg/m2 at day +1, 10
      mg/m2 at days +3, +6 and +11).
