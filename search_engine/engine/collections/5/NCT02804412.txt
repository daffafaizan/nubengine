      the intensity of administered therapy, the preferred therapeutic approach and its initiation
      with regard to stroke onset. CIAT is a a high intense group therapy administered over 2
      weeks. Additionally, patients have to communicate solely in spoken words or sentences
      (constraint). This study compares CIAT with an approach of the same intensity without
      constraints and a less intense house-typical therapeutic approach.
