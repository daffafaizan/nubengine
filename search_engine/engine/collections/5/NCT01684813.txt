      loading dose of prasugrel as opposed to the standard dose in type 2 diabetic patients, who
      suffer acute coronary syndrome, revascularized through an invasive percutaneous strategy with
      a stent. The aim of this study is to determine if, in type 2 diabetic patients undergoing
      treatment with PCI and a stent, who fail to respond to normal doses of clopidogrel, a loading
      dose of 60 mg of prasugrel followed by 10 mg once daily is superior to the standard dose of
      75 mg of clopidogrel in achieving greater than 50% inhibition of platelet aggregation at
      24-36 hours of treatment.
