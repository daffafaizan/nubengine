    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study to
      compare the efficacy and safety of Fluticasone Furoate Inhalation Powder 100mcg once daily
      and Fluticasone Propionate Inhalation Powder 250mcg twice daily with Placebo. Subjects will
      participate in the study for up to a maximum of 29 weeks (including screening, treatment and
      follow-up contact). The primary endpoint consists of change from baseline in clinic visit
      trough (pre-bronchodilator and pre-dose) FEV1 at the end of the 24 week treatment period. The
      nominated powered secondary endpoint is the change from baseline in the percentage of
      rescue-free 24 hour periods during the 24-week treatment period. Safety assessments include
      adverse events, oropharyngeal examinations, clinical chemistry and urine cortisol excretion.
      For subjects who have consented for pharmacogenetics, a blood sample will also be taken for
      pharmacogenetic analysis.
