      function. Next, the investigators will test voluntary and reflex cough. After this first
      round of cough testing, the investigators will ask participants to cough long and hard during
      voluntary and reflex cough testing. Finally, the investigators will view the larynx (voice
      box) with an endoscopic camera inserted through the nose. This test is done to see if there
      are any changes in the larynx that may influence cough.
