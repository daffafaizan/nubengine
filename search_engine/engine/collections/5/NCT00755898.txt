      development, survival tends to be poorer. Earlier diagnosis of cancer is expected to provide
      improved survival of patients due to earlier treatment intervention. However, implementation
      of this screening process is impaired by access and by cost. A simple and inexpensive test
      would serve as a screening tool that could be safely repeated at regular intervals to
      identify persons for whom more expensive and less accessible diagnostic investigations might
      become more appropriately directed. The specificity for an enzyme that increases markedly in
      cancer tissue, and the ease of administration of an already licensed pharmaceutical
      prescription product, amantadine hydrochloride, would appear to provide promise of such a
      desirable screening test.
