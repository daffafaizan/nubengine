      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of decitabine and cedazuridine (ASTX727) in
      combination with venetoclax in patients with refractory/relapsed acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML).

      II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) of ASTX727 in combination with venetoclax in
      elderly (> 60 year old) patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML) not
      eligible for intensive chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the duration of response, disease-free survival (DFS), and overall survival
      (OS) of patients with refractory/relapsed AML treated with this combination.

      II. To determine similar outcomes for newly diagnosed patients with AML who are not
      candidates for intensive chemotherapy.

      III. To determine the safety of venetoclax in combination with ASTX727 in patients with
      refractory/ relapsed AML, and newly diagnosed patients with AML not candidates for intensive
      chemotherapy.

      IV. To determine the number of relapsed patients able to proceed to stem cell transplantation
      upon achieving response with the combination venetoclax/ASTX727 regimen.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of ASTX727 when combined with
      venetoclax.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive decitabine and cedazuridine orally (PO) daily on days 1-5 and venetoclax PO
      daily on days 1-28 of the first cycle and on days 1-21 of subsequent cycles. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients with an objective response are followed every
      3-6 months for up to 5 years.
