      insomnia (cbt-i plus), which was randomly divided into cbt-i plus intervention group (Study
      Group) and cbt-i intervention group (control group). The study group used the unified
      cognitive behavioral therapy manual for insomnia (cbt-i plus) for one-to-one individual
      treatment intervention, once a week, 45-50 minutes each time, a total of 8 times; the control
      group used the unified cognitive behavioral therapy manual for insomnia (cbt-i) for
      one-on-one treatment intervention, once a week, 45-50 minutes each time, a total of 8 times.
      The related indexes were evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 8 weeks after
      enrollment, and were followed up at 12 weeks and 24 weeks after enrollment. Hypothesis: cbt-i
      plus is superior to cbt-i in efficacy and feasibility.
