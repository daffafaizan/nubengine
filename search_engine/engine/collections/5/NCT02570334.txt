      important concerns in children. The advent of ARV has reduced the frequency and the extent of
      HIV-related encephalopathys, but literature suggests that more limited impairments remain
      (CHER and PREDICT trials). These neuro-cognitive disorders might constitute an important
      public health problem in sub-Saharan Africa where a high percentage of children born to HIV+
      women live. Nevertheless,the knowledge on their long-term consequences on children
      development in this context remains limited. Data on the burden of cognitive, motor and
      sensorial impairment in resource-limited settings as well as on the interaction with other
      factors that could also impair children development are scarse.

      The Pediacam cohort gives the opportunity to better understand the development of children
      born to HIV-infected mothers - infected by HIV or not - followed up from birth and living in
      sub-Saharan Africa.
