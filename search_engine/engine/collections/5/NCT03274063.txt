      reduced quality of life, work absence and disability. Effective treatments are widely
      available and yet many patients never achieve control of their disease. Resolution of gout
      attacks requires sustained lowering of the levels of serum urate, which in practise is seldom
      achieved. A supported self-management approach to gout has been developed which incorporates
      self-testing of urate levels and a smartphone application that will prompt participants to
      self-test and allow clinical researchers to titrate urate lowering therapies.

      The feasibility of this approach will be evaluated in patients with gout referred to
      secondary care. Participants will be randomised 2:1 to the intervention or a control group.
      The intervention group will be offered supported self-management incorporating self-testing
      of serum urate. The control group will receive usual care from their primary care physician.
      The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients achieving levels of serum urate at or
      below 0.3mmol/l by 6 months. Participants will be followed up for a total of 12 months to
      assess the broader health and economic impact of the intervention.
