      Streptococcus pneumoniae, has resulted in a need for new and effective antibiotics that have
      activity again CABP pathogens. CEM-101 is the first fluoroketolide with excellent in vitro
      and in vivo activity against resistant S. pneumoniae and other key typical and atypical
      bacterial respiratory pathogens.
