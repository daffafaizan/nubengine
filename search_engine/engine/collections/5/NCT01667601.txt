    
      Objectives: This study is to test the effectiveness of a mindfulness-based illness management
      program for Chinese outpatients with schizophrenia over a 24-month follow-up. The program is
      an integrated, insight-inducing educational program that addresses patients' awareness and
      knowledge of schizophrenia and skills of illness management.

      Methods: A two-phase, single-blind, multi-site randomized controlled trial will be conducted
      with 449 Chinese patients with schizophrenia in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan. In the first
      phase, 107 participants will be randomly selected from the eligible patient lists of three
      outpatient clinics in Hong Kong only (i.e., 38 subjects from each clinic), and after baseline
      measurement, be assigned to either the mindfulness-based illness management program,
      conventional psycho-education group, or usual psychiatric care. For the second phase, the
      participants will be randomly selected from the eligible patient list in three study venues
      or countries (i.e., 114 subjects from each study site/ country) and after baseline
      measurement, be assigned similar to the first phase to one of the three study groups. The
      patients' mental and psychosocial functioning, insights into illness, and their
      re-hospitalization rates will be measured at recruitment and at one week, and 6, 12 and 24
      months after completing the interventions.

      Hypothesis: The patients in the mindfulness-based psycho-education program will report
      significantly greater improvements in their symptoms and re-hospitalization rates (primary
      outcomes) and other secondary outcomes (e.g., insight into illness and functioning) over the
      24-month follow-up, when compared with those in psycho-education group or usual care.

      Conclusions: The findings will provide evidence whether the mindfulness-based
      psycho-education program can better improve Chinese schizophrenia sufferers' psychosocial
      functioning and reduce their illness relapse.
