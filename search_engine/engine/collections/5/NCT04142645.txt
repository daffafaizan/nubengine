      The OptiMEDs interventions intends to support the decision of GPs regarding the
      pharmacotherapy of older adults through the combination of an electronic decision support
      tool (for the appraisal of potentially inappropriate medication use, anticholinergic use, or
      medications that can be de-prescribed in view of limited life expectancy) with focussed nurse
      observations (guided by a list of potential medication symptoms based on the individual
      medication chart of the resident), that will serve as the basis for a multidisciplinary
      medication review with the input of the GP, community pharmacist and nurse.

      The aim of the OptiMEDs intervention is to obtain a more appropriate, safer, and more
      cost-effective pharmacotherapy in nursing home residents (e.g. less medication-related
      symptoms, less potentially inappropriate prescribing, a better quality of life, less
      hospitalisations, health care usage, or mortality)

      Before investigating the effectiveness of the OptiMEDs intervention in a large pragmatic
      clinical trial comparing results of the intervention with standard of care, a pilot study
      will be undertaken. The aim of the pilot study is to test the feasibility and acceptability
      of all components of the OptiMEDs interventions in 3 nursing homes in Flanders, Belgium.
