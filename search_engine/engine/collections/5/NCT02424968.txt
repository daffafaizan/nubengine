      I. To determine the rate of conversion to full donor chimerism (FDC) following a post
      transplant infusion (day 30-60) of freshly enriched allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells in
      patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), chronic lymphocytic
      leukemia (CLL), or Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), who received non-myeloablative total lymphoid
      irradiation (TLI) anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) transplant conditioning.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the risk of disease progression, overall and event free survival, and
      non-relapse mortality.

      II. To determine the incidence of acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
      following the infusion of allogeneic CD8+ memory T-cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo TLI on days -11 to -7 and -4 to -1 and receive ATG per standard
      institutional practice on days -11 to -7. Patients also receive cyclosporine orally (PO)
      daily starting on day -3 and will continue for at least 6 months post-transplant. Patients
      undergo non-myeloablative allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) on day 0.
      Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil PO daily beginning on day 0 and continue until
      day 28. Based on the patient's status after the initial transplant, patients receive CD8+
      memory T-cells intravenously (IV) over 10-20 minutes sometime between day 30 and day 60.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
