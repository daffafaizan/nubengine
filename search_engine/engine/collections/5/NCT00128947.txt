      diphosphate glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs), among which UGT1A9 is the most important enzyme.
      Two commonly occurring single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter region of the
      UGT1A9 gene have been shown to enhance UGT1A9 protein level and activity in vitro. This study
      is to investigate the potential in vivo effects of these two SNPs on the metabolism and hence
      the pharmacokinetics of MMF metabolites. One hundred and thirty healthy volunteers will be
      screened for the presence of UGT1A9 C-2152T and T-275A polymorphisms. Seventeen subjects who
      carry the variant alleles, along with 17 others who do not have the polymorphisms, will be
      selected to participate in the pharmacokinetic study. Pharmacokinetics of the metabolites
      mycophenolic acid (active) and mycophenolate 7-O-phenolic glucuronide (inactive) will be
      determined, and parameter values will be compared between the two groups. It is hypothesized
      that the metabolism of MMF is enhanced in subjects with the two SNPs, resulting in an
      increase in clearance and a decrease in the exposure of mycophenolic acid.
