      motor functions, spasticity status, balance and functionality in children with cerebral palsy
      (CP).

      Method: A total of 26 patients who were diagnosed with CP [diplegic, with Gross Motor
      Function Classification System (GMFCS) level of 2-5] and who regularly participated in a
      rehabilitation programme were included in the study after obtaining approval from their
      parents. The patients were randomly assigned to two groups. Group 1 (n = 13) received
      conventional therapy (65 min, 2 days/week ×8) and group 2 (n = 13) received 25 minutes of
      robot-assisted gait training (RoboGait®) in addition to conventional therapy (40 min, 2
      days/week ×8).

      Outcome measures: GMFCS was used to evaluate motor functions and Modified Ashworth Scale was
      used to evaluate spasticity. Paediatric Berg Balance Scale, Paediatric Functional
      Independence Measure and timed up and go test were used to assess balance and functional
      status. The evaluations were performed at baseline and after 8 weeks of therapy.
