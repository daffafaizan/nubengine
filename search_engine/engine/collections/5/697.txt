antidiuretic effect of hydrochlorothiazidein diabetes insipidusand ch'iuan-lu12 cases of diabetes insipiduswere studied during hydrochlorothia-zide therapy under a fixed diet.  thesymptoms, blood pressure, urinaryvolume, blood and urinary electrolytes,plasma volume, electrocardiogram andhypertonic saline intravenous drip testwere compared before and after treat-ment.a daily dose of 100-150 mgbrought down the urinary volume toabout 50% of the pretreatment value.the initial antidiuretic effect was noted8 hours after medication and themaximal effect after the fourth or fifthday.  owing to the kaluretic action ofthe drug, 2-4 gm of potassium salt wasalso given each day.  satisfactory re-sults were obtained with dietary sodiumion at not more than 200 meq daily, butingestion of excessive table salt fre-quently diminished or even destroyedthe therapeutic effect.the physical signs, blood pres-sure and ecg were essentially un-changed and the plasma volumes werealtered after treatment.  the hyper-tonic saline test was improved in someof the patients.low salt syndrome was fre-quently encountered as the therapycontinued over 1 month.  but this andeven secondary failure could be pre-vented by timely use of intermittent oralternative regimen.the therapeutic mechanism,indications and side effects of the drugwere briefly discussed.  the drug mightpossibly act through the mechanism ofsalt depletion, contraction of extracel-lular fluid volume and decrease of renalglomerular filtrate, and in consequenceurinary volume decreases and thirst isalleviated.
