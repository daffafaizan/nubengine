    
      This is a Phase 2, non-randomized, sequential, open-label study to investigate the safety,
      tolerability, PK, PD, and efficacy of RVT-1401 (680 mg/weekly and 340 mg/weekly) in patients
      with Warm Autoimmune Hemolytic Anemia that is worsening or refractory in spite of therapy
      with steroids and or immunosuppressants or worsening with steroid or immunosuppressant taper.
      Two cohorts of participants will be enrolled in a non-randomized sequential approach.
      Participants will be enrolled into Cohort 1 (680 mg/weekly) first followed by Cohort 2 (340
      mg/weekly).

      Following the initial dose at the Baseline Visit (Week 1, Day 1), study visits will occur
      weekly throughout the treatment period. Following the final dose at Week 12, visits will
      occur weekly through Week 14 and then at Week 16 and Week 20. Safety, PK, PD, and clinical
      assessments will be collected throughout the study.

      Each participant will participate in the study for up to approximately 24 weeks: up to a
      4-week screening period, a 12-week treatment period, and an 8-week follow up period.
