    
      Patients admitted on this protocol will have, or be suspected of having, one of the filarial
      infections affecting humans. After routine clinical evaluation they will be studied in depth
      immunologically, and their blood cells and/or serum will be collected to provide reagents
      (eg., specific antibodies, T-cell clones, etc.) that will be used in the laboratory to
      address the broader questions of diagnosis, immunoregulation, pathology and
      immunoprophylaxis. Careful observations of the patients' clinical and immunologic responses
      to therapy will be made, as well as long-term follow-up of these changes. It is anticipated
      both that the patients will receive optimal clinical care for their infections and that the
      specimens collected from them will prove to be valuable reagents for the laboratory studies
      of the immunologic responses unique to filarial or other related helminth infections.
