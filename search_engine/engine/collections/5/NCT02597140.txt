      general anesthesia. We thought that there would be an interaction between intravenous
      lidocaine and hypnotic agent requirement. However, there is no data regarding the effect of
      systemic lidocaine during MAC. We, thus, would like to perform a randomized, double-blinded
      pilot study to evaluate the effect of intravenous lidocaine on propofol requirement during
      BIS guided MAC in facial plastic surgery.
