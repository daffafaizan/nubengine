      doses of Letrozole ISM® (Rovi), and secondly, to evaluate safety and tolerability of single
      ascending doses of Letrozole ISM, measure estrogen levels, and characterize oral letrozole
      pharmacokinetic profile to be used in subsequent comparison to Letrozole ISM.

      The study will be carried out in healthy post-menopausal women who satisfy inclusion and
      exclusion criteria. The study design includes a screening period and 2 treatment periods.
      Treatment Period 1 will comprise of 14 oral dose administrations of 2.5 mg Femara®. Treatment
