      identification of populations who require personalized medical care, and to the assessment of
      innovative prophylactic and therapeutic interventions in the future. Our purpose is to
      establish in our hospital network a prospective cohort of triads composed of premature
      newborns with a birth weight less than or equal to 1250 g and their parents, to examine the
      role of candidate susceptibility genes in the development of BPD and ROP. Our hypothesis is
      that the presence of single-nucleotide polymorphisms in candidate genes is associated with
      differential susceptibility to BPD and ROP. As an initial model, a loss-of-function
      substitution at position -617 of the NRF2 promoter region is hypothesized to be associated
      with a greater risk of severe BPD and prethreshold ROP in premature infants with a birth
      weight less than or equal to 1250 g.
