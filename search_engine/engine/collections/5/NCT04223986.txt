      by echocardiography and Troponin T in patients with suspected acute coronary syndrome,
      compared with conventional in-hospital evaluation.

      The trial will be conducted at SÃ¸rlandet Hospital, Norway. One acute care ambulance in Agder
      county will be equipped with a high-end cardiac ultrasound scanner with wireless
      communication to the cardiac centre/cardiologist, and a point-of-care troponin T quantitative
      analysis kit Paramedics will be offered a comprehensive hands-on course in cardiac ultrasound
      image acquisition by an echo-technician and a cardiologist. Similar, a short course will be
      given in point-of-care troponin analysis.

      Imaging quality Communication between paramedic and cardiologist established Image transfer
      and interpretation by cardiologist functional Technical problems addressed and solved in
      collaboration with manufacturer
