      participants under fasting and fed conditions in order to determine the effect of food on the
      PK of single oral dose of TAK-831 tablet formulation. The study will enroll approximately 16
      participants. Participants will be randomly and equally assigned (by chance, like flipping a
      coin) to 1 of the 2 treatment sequences following as:

        -  TAK-831 400 mg Fasted + TAK-831 400 mg Fed

        -  TAK-831 400 mg Fed + TAK-831 400 mg Fasted All participants will be asked to take single
           oral dose of TAK-831 tablet at the same time on Day 1 of each Intervention Period. This
           single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
           participate in this study is 23 days. Participants will visit the clinic on Day -1 and
           remained confined until Day 3 of Intervention Period 1 and 2. A washout period of
           minimum 7 days will be maintained between the doses in each Intervention Period.
           Participants will make 3 visits to the clinic on Days 4, 6 and 8 on each Intervention
           Period and will be contacted by telephone 14 days after the last dose of study drug (Day
           23) for a follow-up assessment.
