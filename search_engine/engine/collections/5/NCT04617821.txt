    
      Three hundred patients with borderline resectable and locally advanced pancreatic cancer will
      be randomized 1:1 (150 :150) to the AG and mFOLFIRINOX chemotherapy groups and to observe the
      overall survival.

      The AG regimen: albumin-bound paclitaxel and gemcitabine are given intravenous infusion,
      repeated every 4 weeks for 1, 8, and 15 days, for a total of 4 to 6 cycles.

      MFOLFIRINOX: Intravenous oxaliplatin for 2 hours, day 1;Intravenous infusion of calcium
      formyl tetrahydrofolate (LV) for 2 h, day 1;Irinotecan intravenous infusion is added 30
      minutes later for 90 minutes, day 1;Intravenous infusion of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) continued
      for 46 hours.Repeat every 2 weeks for a total of 4-6 cycles.

      After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the surgery will be evaluated according to the patient's
      tumor and systemic condition.

      The first cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy begins 4-8 weeks after radical resection, and the
      choice of adjuvant chemotherapy regimen depends on the response to neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy.If neoadjuvant chemotherapy is effective, adjuvant chemotherapy maintains the
      original regimen.Adjuvant chemotherapy has 4 cycles of treatment.

      Relevant examinations were performed before and after each cycle of medication to assess
      safety events, imaging review was performed every 2 cycles during the treatment period and
      every 3 months during the follow-up period.
