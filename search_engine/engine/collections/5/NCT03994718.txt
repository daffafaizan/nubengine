      in the study. Patients who consent will be randomly assigned to work with one of three
      creative artists (visual artist, creative writer, or therapeutic musician. The assigned
      artist will provide 1 intervention while the patient is admitted and 4 follow-up
      interventions after discharge from the hospital. Follow-up sessions will be conducted
      remotely, either by phone or over the internet.

      Subjects will be asked to complete study questionnaires before and after the first art
      intervention, and again after the last follow-up session. The study seeks to measure the
      impact of arts interventions on quality of life. Secondary objectives include the effects of
      the interventions on seizure frequency and EEG spike generation, as well as the impact of
      creative arts interventions on patients diagnosed with non-epileptic events during
      hospitalization.*
