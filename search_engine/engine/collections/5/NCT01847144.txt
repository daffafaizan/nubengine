    
      Participants will withdraw sulphonylurea therapy for up to 2 weeks (part 1) followed by an
      optional cross-over extension (part 2)where they are randomized to 4 weeks of treatment with
      Gliclazide (DPP-IV thera) or Sitagliptin (sulphonylurea), followed by 4 weeks of the second
      treatment with a 2 week wash-out period in between.

      Part 1 will allow assessment of response rates to long standing sulphonylurea treatment in
      clinical practice and potential predictors of this, as well as whether a very brief period (1
      week) of treatment withdrawal is a valid assessment of an individual's response to therapy.
      Part 2 will allow comparison of the approach in part one with response to the same treatment
      in a trial setting and will allow assessment on whether response is consistent across
      therapies with different mechanisms of action.
