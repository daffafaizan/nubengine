      histological diagnosis of gastric epithelial neoplasia before proper management.Many studies
      have shown that there exist considerable discrepancies between EFB and subsequently resected
      specimens with discrepancy rate of 27.1-44.5%. On the other hand, with low diagnostic
      efficacy of narrow band imaging (NBI) in novice endoscopists and endoscopists of community
      hospitals in China, not higher diagnostic accuracy of gastric cancerous lesions could be
      observed. Here, the investigators will conduct a study to develop and validate a diagnostic
      model based on narrow band imaging for early gastric cancerous lesions under endoscopic
      observation, trying to improve overall diagnostic efficacy for gastric cancerous lesions.
