    
      This is a Phase II study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TACE combined with sorafenib
      and tislelizumab in patients with advanced HCC.

      30 subjects with advanced HCC (Barcelona-Clinic- Liver-Cancer [BCLC] stage C, or China liver
      cancer staging [CNLC] IIIa and IIIb) will be enrolled in the study.

      Both sorafenib (400mg P.O. Bid) and tislelizumab (200mg I.V. q3w) will be started at 3-7 days
      after the first TACE. TACE will be repeated if clinically indicated based on the evaluation
      of follow-up laboratory and imaging examination. Sorafenib will last until disease
      progresses, intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death,
      or other circumstances that require termination of treatment, whichever occurs first.
      Sorafenib administration will be delayed in cases of grade ≥2 hand-foot syndrome, grade >3
      hematologic toxicities or grade ≥3 hypertension. After recovery, sorafenib will be
      reintroduced at a reduced dose according the sorafenib dose delay and reduction guidelines.
      Treatment of tislelizumab will last up to 24 months, or until disease progresses, intolerable
      toxicity, withdrawal of informed consent, loss of follow-up, death, or other circumstances
      that require termination of treatment, whichever occurs first. Patients will be allowed to
      have sorafenib or tislelizumab as a sigle agent and will be still considered on study when
      the other drug cause intolerable toxicity.
