      chemotherapy with cisplatin fluorouracil followed by conventional radiotherapy. The primary
      end point was the preservation of the larynx. The secondary end points included toxicity,
      causes of death and survival rates.

      Design: Multicenter prospective randomized phase III trial. Setting: Academic tertiary care
      center. Patients: Seventy one adult patients with biopsy-proven previously untreated
      resectable T3 with fixed cord involvement squamous cell carcinoma of the pyriform sinus.

      Main Outcomes Measures: Patients were evaluated for toxic reactions, and organ preservation
      and survival rates. Statistical analysis of overall survival and event free survival was
      performed using the Kaplan Meier method.
