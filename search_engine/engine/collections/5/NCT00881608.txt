      drug, Proellex, is able to suppress endogenous progesterone in women. It is believed that
      giving Proellex in the early/mid-luteal phase of the cycle will suppress the effects of
      endogenous progesterone triggering the end of the cycle and inducing menstruation as happens
      naturally
