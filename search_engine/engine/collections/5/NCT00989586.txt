      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Both agents are well-tolerated in early phase clinical testing with
      infusion reactions as the primary observed toxicity. Preclinical testing in vitro and in vivo
      have demonstrated single agent activity for both veltuzumab and milatuzumab. In mantle cell
      lymphoma cell lines and SCID mouse models, synergist effects were observed when milatuzumab
      was combined with rituximab. Veltuzumab has several advantages over rituximab including
      slower off-rates, shorter infusion times, higher potency, and improved therapeutic responses
      in animal models. Previous and ongoing clinical investigations support the concept of
      combining monoclonal antibodies in NHL.
