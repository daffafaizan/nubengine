      unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated that baseline pain sensitivity is related to
      postoperative pain and narcotic requirement. We hypothesize that baseline pain sensitivity is
      related to pain in labor. The study will determine baseline sensitivity to heat, cold and
      pressure as measurement of pain sensitivity. Furthermore, b2 adrenergic genotype has recently
      been identified as a potential determinant of pain sensitivity. The investigators will
      determine whether B2 receptor haplotype is an independent predictor of pain experienced in
      labor.
