      multicenter, aiming to demonstrate the superiority of Dexmedetomidine over the absence of
      Dexmedetomidine, in adjuvantation of a loco regional anesthesia (interscalenic bloc of the
      brachial plexus + intravenous injection of Dexamethasone), on the prolongation of the
      analgesia, following a surgery of the rotator cuff of the shoulder under arthroscopy.
