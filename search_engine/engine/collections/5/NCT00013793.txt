      Johnson (LBJ) and Hermann Hospitals, pregnant women between 18 and 28 weeks gestation will be
      recruited from University of Texas/Harris County Hospital District-affiliated clinics,
      including Acres Homes, Aldine, Settegast, Baytown, and Squatty Lyons, LBJ and Hermann
      Hospital outpatient clinics, private practice OB/GYN's with patients who will deliver at
      Hermann Hospital, and area WIC (Women, Infants and Children) Program sites. Participants will
      be randomized to one of three groups, including 1) best practice (BP) counseling, 2) BP plus
      ultrasound, and 3) BP plus ultrasound plus motivational enhancement (ME) counseling.
      Counseling and cotinine testing will be performed at the University Clinical Research Center
      (UCRC) initially, at 34 weeks, and at 6 weeks postpartum. The primary outcome is the rate of
      smoking cessation among the women at 34 weeks gestation. Based on previous reports, projected
      quit rates for the 3 interventions, BP, BP + ultrasound, and BP + ultrasound + ME are .06,
      .12, and .20, respectively. A sample size of 360 will be necessary in order to observe these
      differences in quit rates. The chi-square test for trend in proportions will be used to
      determine statistical significance for this primary outcome.
