      I. Determine safety and efficacy of sotatercept as therapy for persons with
      myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN)-associated myelofibrosis and anemia.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive sotatercept subcutaneously (SC) once every 3 weeks. Cycles repeat every 3
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients unable to
      achieve anemia-response after 8 cycles will be taken off study.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.
