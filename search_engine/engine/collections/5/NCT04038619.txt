      I. To assess the safety and tolerability of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT).

      II. To assess the efficacy of FMT for clinical remission/response of immune-related
      diarrhea/colitis.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the recurrence rate after achieving clinical remission/response of
      immune-related diarrhea/colitis.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the efficacy of FMT to achieve endoscopic remission of immune-related
      diarrhea/colitis.

      II. To assess the efficacy of FMT to achieve histological remission of immune-related
      diarrhea/colitis.

      III. To assess the efficacy of FMT on recurrence of immune-related diarrhea/colitis after
      resumption of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICPI).

      IV. To assess immunological, molecular and microbiome changes in tissue/blood/stool.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive loperamide orally (PO). After 4 hours, patients undergo FMT via colonoscopy
      over 15-30 minutes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and then
      at 3 months.
