      I. Best overall response of complete response/partial response (CR/PR).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Toxicity defined as any adverse event (AE) grade 3 and higher. II. Progression free
      survival.

      EXPLORATORY/CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. Gene expression profiling using Lymph5Cx test. II. Sequencing using the ion torrent
      platform (76 gene panel for known mutations in lymphoma).

      III. Sequencing of BTK to evaluate for BTK mutations. IV. Minimal residual disease testing
      (MRD by flow cytometry and targeted sequencing post treatment).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive obinutuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of
      cycle 1, and day 1 of cycles 2-6. Patients also receive ibrutinib orally (PO) once daily (QD)
      on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving partial response (PR) continue to
      receive obinutuzumab IV every 2 months and ibrutinib PO QD for up to 2 years in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for up to 5
      years.
