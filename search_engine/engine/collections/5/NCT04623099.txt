      escitalopram in adolescents (12-17 years of age) with anxiety disorders. In this study, we
      will examine these two dosing strategies in terms of efficacy (Aim 1) and tolerability (Aim
      2).

      We propose to recruit 132 adolescents (age 12-17 years, inclusive) with generalized,
      separation and/or social anxiety disorder (pediatric anxiety triad).1 This will allow us to
      evaluate whether PGx-guided escitalopram dosing improves efficacy and tolerability in
      outpatient adolescents aged 12-17 years with anxiety disorders. Eligible patients will be
      randomized to: (1) standard escitalopram dosing or (2) pharmacogenetically-guided dosing for
      12 weeks.

      The objectives of the study will be accomplished by pursuing the following specific aims:
