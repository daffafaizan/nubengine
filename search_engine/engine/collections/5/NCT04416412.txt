      tissue perfusion, as measured using indocyanine green (ICG) fluorescence imaging, and
      complications. This will be used to develop ICG fluorescence imaging as a diagnostic tool to
      objectively and quantitatively guide operative debridement. The study population includes all
      open fracture patients regardless of race, ethnicity, or sex/gender. Primary outcome measure
      is all-cause re-operation and secondary outcome measure is surgical site infection. All
      patients will be followed for a total of 12 months.
