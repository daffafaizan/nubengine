      in comparison with placebo in female IBS-D patients. Randomisation to ibodutant and placebo
      will be 1:1. Efficacy is evaluated in terms of weekly response for abdominal pain intensity
      and stool consistency over 24 weeks of treatment in at least 50% of the weeks of treatment.

      The clinical phase of the study comprises up to 2 weeks of screening for patient's
      eligibility, a 2-week run-in period (treatment-free) for IBS severity assessment, a first
      24-week double-blind treatment period, a second 28-week re-randomised double-blind treatment
      period and a 2-week safety follow-up, resulting in a maximum 58-week overall duration of the
      study for each patient.

      Patients report their IBS-related symptoms daily in a telephone-based electronic diary from
      run-in until end of treatment.
