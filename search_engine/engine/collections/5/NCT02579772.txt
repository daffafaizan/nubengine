      worldwide. Cardiovascular complications constitute the main causes of poor physical capacity
      and healthcare resources utilization in COPD. There is emerging evidence that these
      impairments have a major impact on the health of patients with mild-to-moderate disease, the
      largest sub-population of COPD. This important problem, however, is currently neglected as no
      specific pharmacological treatment is offered to these patients. Recent studies indicate that
      vascular abnormalities are mediated, at least in part, by circulating inflammatory substances
      and direct damage of the arteries by oxygen radicals (oxidative stress). The current
      investigation will test the hypothesis that N-acetylcysteine (NAC), via its anti-inflammatory
      and antioxidant properties, improves systemic vascular function and physical capacity in COPD
      patients with mild-to-moderate airflow obstruction.
