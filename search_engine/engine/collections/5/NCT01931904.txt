      image and measure optic nerve head (ONH) and retinal blood flow. Preliminary results have
      shown that visual field (VF) loss is more highly correlated with retinal blood flow as
      measured by OCT than any neural structure measured by OCT or other imaging modality.
      Accordingly, the goal of the proposed project is to improve the diagnostic and prognostic
      evaluation of glaucoma by further developing novel functional OCT measurements using
      ultrahigh-speed (70-100 kHz) OCT technology.

      Retinal blood flow, ONH circulation, optic disc rim volume, peripapillary nerve fiber layer
      volume, and macular ganglion cell complex volume are all pieces of the same glaucoma puzzle.
      This project will develop novel imaging methods that allow us to look at the whole picture
      using one tool - ultrahigh-speed OCT.
