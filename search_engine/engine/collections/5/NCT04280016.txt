      off-loading intervention on the healing time for people with diabetes mellitus and a foot
      ulcer.

      While benefits of physical activity and exercise are clear, the benefit of exercise on wound
      healing in individuals with diabetes has not been elucidated. It is critical to better
      understand how prescribed exercise effects the healing speed in patients receiving wound care
      with appropriate off-loading. If exercise does decrease healing time, the benefit to the
      patient may include lower cost, decreased risk of infection, decreased burden on a caregiver,
      and improved quality of life.
