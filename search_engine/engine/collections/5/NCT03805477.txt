      for several malignant and non-malignant disorders. An important limitation of long-term
      survival after HCT is chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD). The manifestation of cGvHD
      in the lungs, bronchiolitis obliterans (BO - if proven by lung biopsy) or bronchiolitis
      obliterans syndrome (BOS - clinical diagnosis), has a reported incidence between 5 and 20%.
      Despite different treatment approaches, prognosis of BO remains poor, with an overall 3-year
      mortality of up to 65%. Nintedanib is an orally available indolinone derivate that
      competitively binds to the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors, fibroblast
      growth factor (FGF) receptors, and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) receptors. The
      anti-fibrotic activities of Nintedanib may impact the progressive course of fibrotic lung
      diseases like BO. This study investigates the safety and tolerability of Nintedanib in
      patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome following allogeneic hematopoietic cell
      transplantation.
