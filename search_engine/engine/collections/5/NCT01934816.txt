      the vascular system. Previous animal work and initial human studies suggest that incretins
      may be cardioprotective and act as vasodilators through opening of KATP channels.

      Initial evidence suggests that beneficial vascular effects of incretin modifying agents may
      be nullified by the co-current treatment of the sulfonylurea (SU) drug glibenclamide. The
      investigators hypothesis is that the GLP-1 and SUs may have conflicting effects on the KATP
      channels and thus vascular function.

      Interestingly the vascular actions of GLP-1 were not modified by a different treatment SUs
      called glimepiride, thereby raising the possibility that SUs differentially modulating the
      vascular actions of GLP-1 though this remains controversial.
