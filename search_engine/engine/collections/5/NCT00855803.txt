      Primary

        -  To determine the efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy in reducing pain at 3 months
           in patients with localized spinal metastasis.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the duration of pain response at the treated site(s) scored as the time of
           maximal pain relief to an increase of 2 points on the Visual Analogue Scoring System.

        -  To determine the functional preservation of improvement as measured by the Brief Pain
           Inventory.

        -  To prospectively assess quality of life using the FACT-G and EQ-5D questionnaires.

        -  To determine the long-term stability of the treated vertebral bone (e.g., fracture,
           sclerotic change, vertebral body height, or malalignment) as measured by MRI, CT scan,
           and plain radiographs.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to prior radiotherapy to
      the planned treatment site(s).

        -  Group 1 (prior radiotherapy): Patients undergo 5 fractions of stereotactic body
           radiotherapy (SBRT) over 30-90 minutes each.

        -  Group 2 (no prior radiotherapy): Patients undergo 1 fraction of SBRT over 30-90 minutes.

      Within 1 month after the initiation of SBRT, patients in both groups undergo percutaneous
      vertebroplasty.

      Patients complete pain and quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and periodically during
      study. Patients also undergo MRI and CT scan at baseline, at 1, 3, and 6 months, and then
      every 6 months for 3 years to assess changes in vertebral bone strength and stability.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 2 weeks, at 1, 3, and 6 months,
      and then every 6 months for 3 years.
