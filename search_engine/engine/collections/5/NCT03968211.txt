      IgE (an IgE below the lower limit of detection) is found in about 3% of the general
      population. In the past, it has been thought that having an undetectable IgE does not have
      any health impact, other than meaning that you are at low risk for having allergies. However,
      recent studies of patients with undetectable IgE have shown higher rates of infections,
      autoimmune disease and cancer.

      Patients with an immune deficiency called common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) also have
      higher rates of infections, autoimmune disease and cancer. Recently, we have shown that most
      patients with CVID have a low/undetectable serum IgE.

      This study is trying to find out if an undetectable serum IgE is a biomarker, or early sign
      of, the development of CVID or other antibody deficiencies
