      according to Beaton et al. guidelines. The internal reliability of the FFABQ TÃ¼rkish version
      will be assessed using Cronbach's alpha, and item analyses will be conducted by examining the
      effect on Cronbach's alpha of excluding each of the six FOG-Q items individually. The
      test-retest reliability will be assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

      Convergent validity will be evaluated by means of Spearman rank correlation coefficient (rs).
      In this section will be determined the correlation between the Activities-specific Balance
      Confidence Scale and visual analog scale for fear of falling.
