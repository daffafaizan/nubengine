      international guidelines PLUS the normalisation of blood pression (BP < 140 and 90 mmHg) plus
      the normalisation of arterial stiffness (measured every 6 months) Pulse Wave Velocity group
      (PWV group) reduces CV and renal events to a significantly greater extent than the sole
      implementation of Guidelines (conventional group, with PWV measurement at baseline and every
      2 years).

      Experimental design: Prospective Randomised Open Blinded Endpoint (PROBE) multicenter, two
      parallel groups, study.

      Therapeutic strategy in the PWV group:

        1. Use maximal recommended doses of angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor (ACEIs) or
           Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) as first step treatment. And then adapt
           treatment to PWV values.

        2. In second step, use combination therapy with Calcium channel blockers (CCBs)

        3. Use diuretics in combination therapy, either as an alternative to CCBs in second step or
           as triple therapy in third step

        4. Use, as fourth step, vasodilating beta-blockers (VD-BB) or spironolactone

        5. In parallel, correct all CV risk factors according to ESH-ESC Guidelines, and reinforce
           treatment (hypolipidemic drugs, glucose lowering drugs, antiplatelets) if secondary
           prevention.

      Therapeutic strategy in the conventional group: Apply the ESH-ESC Guidelines
