      cancer biomarkers are natural polyamines. Recently, there are also other reports on the use
      of polyamines in diagnosis of other cancers. In this larger scale study, with inclusion of
      subjects with different cancer types, to further assess the correlation urine polyamines and
      other urine metabolite markers for the diagnosis of different cancer types and investigate
      their role as a potential non-invasive marker for cancer detection and monitoring.
