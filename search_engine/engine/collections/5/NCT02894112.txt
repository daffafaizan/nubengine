      treatments will be used. A total of 30 young (20-40 year old) healthy men and women will
      serve as subjects. Following 2 days of physical activity and dietary control, subjects will
      consume a standard OGTT load or high fat tolerance load on the morning of Day 3. The solution
      used in the meals will be mixed with one or two servings of non-fat milk or placebo (either
      carbohydrate matched or total calorie matched). Before and after the test meals are consumed,
      blood samples will be obtained for later analysis of glucose, triglycerides, insulin, and
      inflammatory cytokines and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation and femoral artery vascular
      conductance will be measured. The present research project should provide new and clinically
      useful insight into the role of conventional dairy products on metabolic homeostasis. If the
      working hypotheses are supported, the information could be used as an initial/preliminary
      basis for recommendations for the consumption of fluid milk in the prevention of metabolic
      diseases.
