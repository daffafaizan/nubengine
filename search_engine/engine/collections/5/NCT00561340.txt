    
      This is a pilot study evaluating the effect of caloric supplementation on maintenance of
      growth parameters during two years of open-label atomoxetine treatment in 5 and 6 year old
      children with ADHD. The study will assess the efficacy of caloric supplementation in
      maintaining baseline percentiles for height, weight, and body mass index (BMI). Patients will
      be randomly assigned to receive either PediaSure for caloric supplementation, or no
      supplementation.

      Secondary aims include assessing the tolerability and efficacy of long-term, open-label
      atomoxetine treatment in 5 and 6 year old children with ADHD, and obtaining adequate pilot
      data regarding the safety, efficacy, and potential effects of atomoxetine on growth
      parameters in order to submit a multisite R01 to more adequately assess atomoxetine treatment
      and its effects in young children with ADHD.
