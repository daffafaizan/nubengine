      Japanese participants with NSCLC. This study has two parts (Phase 1 part and Phase 2 part),
      Phase 1 part of this study will look at the safety, efficacy, tolerability and PK of TAK-788
      orally administered once daily, and will determine a RP2D. Phase 2 study will look at the
      efficacy and safety of TAK-788 in treatment naive Japanese NSCLC patients with epidermal
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) exon 20 insertion mutation. All participants will be assigned
      to Phase 1 part or Phase 2 part and will be asked to take TAK-788 capsule as following dosage
      and regimen;

      Phase 1 part; TAK-788, 40 mg as starting dose, once daily, and escalating up to 160 mg until
      a Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD). An expansion phase may be followed at any dose to further
      confirm safety observations following identification of MTD/RP2D.

      Phase 2 part; TAK-788, 160 mg, once daily

      The study will enroll approximately 58-63 participants (Phase 1 part; 28-33 and Phase 2 part;
      30).

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time to participate in this
      study of Phase 1 part is approximately 3 years and Phase 2 part is approximately 4 years.
      Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic in the treatment period, and the
      post-treatment period including follow-up assessments after the last dose of the study drug.
