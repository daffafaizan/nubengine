    
      The primary objective of this study is to estimate the effect of utilizing VR on reducing
      opioid use in study participants undergoing mastectomy with implant-based reconstruction
      compared to the control group. Investigators will follow patients throughout the course of
      their hospitalization and monitor outcomes including pain levels, medication requests, and
      satisfaction.

      Eligible participants will receive a VR headset and instructed to use the VR every time they
      feel pain and before asking for a pain medication. They can take pain medications, if they
      choose to do so. At their post-op visit, study participants will be interviewed and asked
      questions regarding their experience with VR.

      Pain level and medication use will be compared with similar individuals who undergo the same
      procedure but are not provided with a VR headset.
