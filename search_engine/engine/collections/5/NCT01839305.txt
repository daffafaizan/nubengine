      Hydrotherapy Treatment. These assessments were:

        1. Three-dimensional scapular evaluation

        2. Questionnaires (FIQ, SF-36, Beck Depression Inventory, Beck Anxiety Inventory,
           Pittsburgh Quality of Sleep Index)

        3. Pain (pressure pain threshold and trigger points) Subjects were evaluated 3 times one
           month before starting treatment, one time in the middle of treatment and after treatment
           completion.

      Treatment lasted 16 weeks and consisted of 2 weekly 45' hydrotherapy sessions.
