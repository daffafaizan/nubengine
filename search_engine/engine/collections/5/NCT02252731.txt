      warfarin dosing on Day 1, Period 1). Screening takes place from Day -22 to Day -2.

      Subjects are admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1 of Period 1. On Day 1 of the first
      period, subjects receive a single oral dose of warfarin. After completion of all assessments
      on Day 8, subjects are discharged from the clinical unit on the condition that there are no
      medical reasons for a prolonged stay. They return to the clinical unit on Day -1 of the
      second period, after the washout period.

      In Period 2, the subjects receive multiple doses of FG 4592. On Day 7 of Period 2, FG 4592 is
      given concomitantly with warfarin. After completion of all assessments on Day 16 of Period 2,
      subjects are discharged from the clinic on the condition that there are no medical reasons
      for a prolonged stay. The subjects return for an End of Study Visit (ESV) 5 to 9 days after
      the last assessment of Period 2 (or after early withdrawal).

      Safety assessments are performed throughout the study. Blood and urine samples are collected
      for PK and PD assessments.
