      Primary

        -  Determine the effect of coenzyme Q_10 on cancer treatment-related fatigue in women with
           breast cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on overall quality of life of these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of this drug on depression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to planned radiotherapy (yes vs no) and type of chemotherapy
      (anthracycline vs non-anthracycline). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning on the first day of chemotherapy treatment, patients receive oral
           coenzyme Q_10 and oral vitamin E three times daily.

        -  Arm II: Beginning on the first day of chemotherapy treatment, patients receive oral
           vitamin E and an oral placebo three times daily.

      Treatment in both arms continues for 24 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life, fatigue, and depression are assessed at baseline and at 8, 16, and 24 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 101-236 patients will be accrued for this study.
