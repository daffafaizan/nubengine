      Patients will receive platinum doublet chemotherapy per standard of care with durvalumab for
      8 weeks, concurrent with a short course of radiation to the primary lung tumor. Patients will
      then undergo repeat evaluation of the mediastinal lymph nodes. If there is no cancer in the
      lymph nodes, patients will receive 2 years of adjuvant durvalumab. If there is still cancer
      in the lymph nodes, patients will receive 6 weeks of radiation to the mediastinal lymph
      nodes, and 2 years of adjuvant durvalumab.

      After the completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 months.
