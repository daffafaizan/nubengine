    
      The ACT COVID-19 program consists of two parallel trials testing the effects of interventions
      in complementary populations in outpatients and inpatients.

      In the outpatient study, symptomatic patients in the community who are COVID-19 positive and
      at high risk of disease progression: colchicine compared with control (anti-inflammatory);
      and ASA compared with control (anti-thrombotic); using a 2 x 2 factorial design. The primary
      outcome for colchicine vs. control is the composite of hospitalization or death; and the
      co-primary outcome is disease progression by 2 points on a 7-point scale. The primary outcome
      for ASA vs. control is the composite of hospitalization or death; and the co-primary outcomes
      are the composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, ALI, VTE, death), and
      disease progression by 2 points on a 7-point scale.

      For inpatients, in symptomatic patients who are COVID-19 positive and who are hospitalized:
      interferon-β is compared with control (anti-viral); colchicine is compared with control
      (anti-inflammatory); and the combination of ASA and rivaroxaban is compared with control
      (anti-thrombotic); using a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial design. The primary outcome for interferon-β
      vs. control, and for colchicine vs. control is the composite of invasive mechanical
      ventilation or death; and the co-primary outcome is disease progression by 2 points on a
      7-point scale. The primary outcome for the combination of ASA and rivaroxaban vs. control is
      the composite of invasive mechanical ventilation or death; and the co-primary outcomes are
      the composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, ALI, VTE, death) and
      disease progression by 2 points on a 7-point scale.
