      bloodless operative field, improve cementing technique and shorten surgery time. Meanwhile,
      inadequate application may increase the risk of deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary
      thromboembolism. Previous attempts to compare the tourniquet strategies in respect to the
      perioperative blood loss did not show significant difference. The investigators use the
      volume loading test aiming to optimize the fluid status and obtain the hemoglobin
      concentration in the conditions of standardized plasma dilution. The test is deployed just
      before the surgery and after postoperative 24 hrs in ICU. Functional outcomes and possible
      length of hospital stay is also evaluated.
