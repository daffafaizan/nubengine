    
      The primary objectives are to evaluate the duration of metastatic breast cancer treatments
      (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and biological therapies) according to biological subtype
      (Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2 positive, triple-negative) and to evaluate the number of lines of
      metastatic breast cancer treatments according to biological subtype (Luminal A, Luminal B,
      HER2 positive, triple-negative).

      The secondary Objectives are to evaluate overall survival according to duration and to number
      of lines of metastatic breast cancer treatments and to identify predictive factors of number
      of lines of treatment as for example age, treatment response, biological subtype, metastatic
      sites, etc and to identify possible elements of different treatment management between
      participating sites.

      The aim of this retrospective and prospective study is to identify the duration of treatments
      (chemotherapy, hormonal therapy and biological therapies) according to biological subtype and
      line of treatment in metastatic breast cancer patients.
