      septic shock (SS/SS) by decreasing the time from first medical contact to antibiotic
      administration. This is a pilot project. This is a stepwise study that will build on
      previously published literature to demonstrate the ability of paramedics to accurately obtain
      blood cultures prior to hospital arrival, administer a broad spectrum antibiotic and initiate
      IV fluid resuscitation in patients meeting predefined criteria for SS/SS. The primary aim is
      to take processes that have been developed for use in this patient population during
      Emergency Department care and to advance these same processes "downrange" to initiate them
      prior to hospital arrival. Early antibiotic administration has been shown to decrease
      mortality in a time dependent fashion when implemented in hospitalized patients. The
      investigators hypothesize that initiating antibiotics prior to hospital arrival will improve
      morbidity and mortality while also addressing quality metrics that are publicly reported for
      this patient population.

      This pilot study will be conducted in two consecutive phases, responding to the following
      aims.

      Aim 1: Evaluate the feasibility that paramedics can obtain blood cultures from general
      patients prior to hospital arrival with a contamination rate that is statistically equivalent
      to that for blood cultures obtained in Emergency Department.

      Aim 2 (primary aim): Investigate whether prehospital paramedic initiated broad spectrum
      antibiotics, administered after blood cultures are obtained, will result in improved
      mortality rates for patients, when compared to historical controls.
