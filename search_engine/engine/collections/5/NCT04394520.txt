      one of five introduction and consent combinations and then have them complete noncommunicable
      disease risk factor survey with an additional module regarding their understanding of the
      survey and of its voluntariness. This mobile phone survey will be sent as an interactive
      voice response (IVR). In IVR surveys, participants use their touch tone key pad to answer
      pre-recorded questions. (i.e. If you are male, press 1; If you are female, press 2). This
      study will be conducted in both Colombia and Uganda.
