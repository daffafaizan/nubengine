      session subjects will be exposed to placebo patch and lidocaine patch. Prior to study drug
      administration, a baseline neurosensory test on the volar aspect of both forearms will be
      performed and baseline vital signs will be measured. A placebo patch and a lidocaine patch
      will then be applied to the volar aspect of each forearm. The arms will be randomized to
      which arm receives placebo and which one receives the lidocaine patch. After four hours of
      application the right forearm patch will be removed the neurosensory testing will be repeated
      on the right forearm. After completing the testing, capsaicin (10Âµl, 10 mg/ml) will be
      injected intradermally on the volar aspect of the right forearm. Elicited and spontaneous
      pain scores, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate will be measured at the time of
      injection and every 2.5 minutes for 10 minutes. A McGill Pain Questionnaire will be
      administered at the time of capsaicin injection only. Ten minutes after the capsaicin
      injection, the hyperalgesic area will be established to von Frey hair, stroking, and heat;
      the flare response will be outlined; and neurosensory testing will performed halfway between
      the edge of this defined area and the capsaicin injection site. At the completion of the
      testing on the right forearm, the left forearm patch will be removed and the procedures
      described for the right forearm will be repeated for the left forearm.
