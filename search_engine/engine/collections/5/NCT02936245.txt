      the age of 50 [1]. It is believed to have a generally progressive course over a period of
      years, with sudden acceleration especially following a slight head and neck injury, leading
      to significant disability [2, 3]. The treatment of CSM remains a problem, particularly in the
      mild and moderate forms without rapid progression.

      Excellent outcomes for surgery have been presented in many studies. All of the studies,
      however, are retrospective, and many lack a clear design, standard criteria, control groups,
      and sufficient follow-up, so it is difficult to compare [4, 5, 6]. Furthermore, several
      studies and critical reviews are not so optimistic. They claim that surgical treatment of
      myelopathy, especially of the mild and moderate forms, has not shown better results than
      conservative treatment in the long term, and criteria for the indication and the timing of
      the operation have not been established [7, 8, 9]. Twenty-five percent of patients with
      laminoplasty suffer from severe neck and shoulder pain for more than 3 months [10], with
      significant morbidity from the iliac crest donor site etc. Surgery to decompress and
      stabilize the spine is often advocated for severe or progressive symptoms, with mixed
      results. About two-thirds of patients improve with surgery, whereas surgery is not successful
      in 15% to 30% of cases [11].

      In order to get some more reliable data, a long-term follow up observational study will be
      started to confirm the effects of long term for conservative treatment.
