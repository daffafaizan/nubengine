      cases annually affecting mainly young children and pregnant women. The economic consequences
      of malaria are enormous in endemic regions with an estimated USD 12 billion per year lost GDP
      and a loss of 45 million years of productive life due to deaths and disability. Malaria is
      curable and preventable, with principal control strategies including rapid diagnosis,
      effective treatment and personal protection with bed nets. Currently a number of
      antimalarials are available, however two of the most widely used drugs, chloroquine and
      sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine are not effective in many parts of the world due to drug
      resistance. Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACT) are effective and today are
      considered by experts the best antimalarials in terms of efficacy and a lower propensity to
      resistance. Cost and access to appropriate quality raw materials remain major issues with the
      currently available artemisinins. In order to prevent the occurrence of drug resistance to
      artemisinins and to address the issue of its relatively short half-life, artemisins are
      recommended to be given in combination with another antimalarial agent. In this development
      programme, artemisinin, as artesunate, is being partnered with an established antimalarial
      agent pyronaridine. The objective of the development programme for the pyronaridine
      artesunate combination is to develop a three day oral therapy for use in children and adults
      to treat acute, uncomplicated malaria.
