      of de novo 3MH production in cancer patients early in the course of the disease as a way of
      assessing which patients are at high risk for future development of skeletal muscle atrophy.
      The approach is based on: 1) the known increase in de novo production of 3-methylhistidine
      (3MH) from muscle protein breakdown in said patients as a consequence of their unique
      disease-host interactions, and 2) earlier demonstration that de novo 3MH production can be
      measured in vivo using isotope dilution.

      During this Phase-II project, we propose to conduct a statistically powerful prospective
      investigation to demonstrate that measurement of the slope of the terminal decay curve (rate
      constant) with our approach in newly diagnosed cancer patients predicts future development of
      muscle wasting. We expect the outcome of the combined Phase-I and Phase-II research to lead
      to the early identification of elevated muscle catabolism in at-risk patients so that medical
      intervention can prevent future muscle atrophy.
