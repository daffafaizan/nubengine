      self-efficacy on long-term adherence to health-enhancing behaviors. The Pulmonary
      Rehabilitation Adapted Index of Self-Efficacy (PRAISE) is an adaptation of the General
      Self-Efficacy Scale. This study aimed to translate, culturally adapt and evaluate reliability
      and validity of PRAISE on Portuguese respiratory patients.Forward-backward translation and
      pilot testing were performed. Content validity was assessed by a multidisciplinary panel of
      expert judges. To evaluate reliability and validity, 150 respiratory outpatients on Pulmonary
      Rehabilitation participated on a cross-sectional study. Descriptive and reliability analyses,
      and exploratory factorial analysis using principal axis factoring, followed by oblique
      oblimin factor rotation were conducted to identify construct validity. IBM® SPSS® version 22
      was used to perform statistical analysis.
