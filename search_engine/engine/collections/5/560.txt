clinical experience withprimary hyperparathyroidism:evaluation of treatmentforty-four patients with "operatively proven" hyperparathyroidism wereevaluated to decide 1) whether or not the diagnosis could be substantiatedby some postoperative observations other than the gross anatomic diagnosisof the operative specimen and 2) what the long term value of operativetreatment would be.  it was found that an immediate and significant fallin urinary phosphorus excretion best documented the diagnosis of primaryhyperparathyroidism.  over intervals up to 10 years, follow-up of thepatients suggested a favourable response of the disease to operativetreatment.
