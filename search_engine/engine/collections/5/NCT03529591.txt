      Pre-screening criteria is carried out by the co-investigator or the research co-ordinator.
      General eligibility criteria, inclusion and exclusion criteria are applied. The Research
      Co-ordinator approaches the patient and the SLT laser study is discussed with the patient.
      The patient is provided the Information Sheet and advised to contact the Research Coordinator
      if they wish to proceed. Informed consent is obtained if the patient wishes to proceed.
      Baseline data is collected and the right eye is randomised with the fellow eye to receive non
      randomised treatment.

      SLT is performed in both eyes (180 degrees in 1 eye + 360 degrees in the fellow eye) during
      an office visit. IOP in both eyes is checked and recorded at one hour post treatment.

      The patient returns for follow up at two weeks post SLT treatment visit. A complete ocular
      examination, including IOP, is undertaken. Complications and adverse events are assessed and
      recorded. Any change to eyedrops is recorded. Patients return at one, three and six months
      for review, and the same assessment as above is undertaken at each visit.

      Enrolling is complete when 48 patients are enrolled. Patients are advised enrolling is
      complete.

      Statistical analysis is undertaken to assess the mean change in IOP between the two
      treatments. Complications and adverse events are each treatment group are recorded. The study
      is submitted for publication and written communication is provided to each enrolled patient.
