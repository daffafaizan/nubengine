      (NIRS) is that extravascular blood absorbs Near-infrared light more than intravascular blood
      since there is a greater (usually 10-fold greater) concentration of hemoglobin in the acute
      hematoma then in the brain tissue where blood is contained within vessels. Therefore, the
      absorbance of Near-infrared light is greater (and therefore the reflected light less) on the
      side of the brain containing a hematoma, than on the uninjured side.

      The NIRS sensor is placed successively in the left and right frontal, temporal, parietal, and
      occipital areas of the head and the absorbance of light at selected wavelengths is recorded.
      The difference in optical density in the different areas is calculated.
