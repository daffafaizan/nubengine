      does not appear to secrete biologically active hormone nor to have a characteristic clinical
      phenotype, are the most common type of pituitary macroadenoma at diagnosis. There is
      currently no option for medical therapy of CNFA, in general, or specifically of silent
      corticotroph tumors. Silent corticotroph tumors can range from being completely asymptomatic
      to becoming large and causing significant hypothalamic/pituitary dysfunction and visual
      symptoms, and most data support that this type of tumor has a more aggressive phenotype.
      Current therapy consists primarily of surgical removal of the tumor and for recurrent or
      residual tumors, repeated surgery and/or radiotherapy. In very aggressive tumors,
      chemotherapy has been tried with some success. Therefore, a need exists for a medical
      therapeutic option for the treatment of this tumor type. This project assesses this clinical
      need.
