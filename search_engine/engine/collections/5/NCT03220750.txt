      treatment of gestational complications in pregnant women with advanced maternal age, and
      therefore, to meet the growing clinical challenges of increasing pregnant women with advanced

      aged â‰¥35 years from 9 large obstetrical center of major University-affiliated Hospitals
      across China, between July 2016 and December 2020. All women will be enrolled prior to 14 wks
      of gestation, followed up at 24-28 wks, 32-34 wks of gestation, delivery, and 42 days
      postpartum. Data including demographics, medical history, reproductive history, prenatal
      health care, gestational complications, and pregnancy and birth outcomes will be collected
      via electronic data capture system. Venous blood of the pregnant women will be collected at
