      mortality in a Swedish cohort, hypothesizing that they indeed have a poor impact and increase
      the risk of death.

      Material and methods: Study cohort of 1080 subjects aged 31 to 40 years (528 men and 552
      women) from Stockholm area was clinically examined in 1985 and followed for mortality until
      2015. Associations between periodontal health parameters, snuff use, smoking and age of death
      were analysed by classifying all subjects into four groups: "dual-users" (current snuffers
      and current smokers); "pure snuffers" (current non-smoking snuffers); "pure smokers" (current
      non-snuffing smokers) and "non-users" (non-snuffers, non-smokers). SPSS was used for
      analyses.
