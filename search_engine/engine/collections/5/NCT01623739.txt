    
      This controlled, randomized clinical trial (RCT) is designed to compare soft and hard tissue
      dimensional changes for two commonly used approaches for replacing a recently extracted tooth
      by means of a dental implant, i.e. immediate implant placement (Type 1) or early implant
      placement (Type 2). Additionally, this study will evaluate the association between the
      osseous anatomy and implant position with soft and hard tissue changes.

      Extraction sites will include maxillary and mandibular anterior and premolar teeth having
      intact adjacent teeth. Implants placed for this study will be SLA surface, bone level design,
      Straumann BL RC (Bone Level Regular Cross-fit ) 4.1mm or BL NC (Bone Level Narrow Cross-fit )
      3.3mm diameter implants at 8, 10, 12 or 14mm in length.

      Immediate implant placement (Type 1) resulting in a horizontal defect dimension (HDD) will
      receive bone grafting, using freeze dried bone allograft (FDBA)(Straumann Allograft GC速) and
      will be covered by a resorbable membrane (BioGide速).

      For the implants randomized to type 2 implant placement, the extraction socket will be filled
      with a collagen plug and allowed to heal for 4 to 8 weeks before the implant will be placed.
      Simultaneous guided bone regeneration (GBR) will be performed using FDBA (Straumann Allograft
      GC速)and a resorbable collagen membrane (BioGide速). The type 2 implant placement procedure
      will follow the guidelines as described by Buser et al. (2008).

      All implant placement will follow standard protocols utilizing tapping and placement
      according to the manufacturer's guidelines.
