      donor wound site healing using AWBAT-D compared to current standard of care: Tegaderm. This
      will involve randomizing subjects to treatment with the AWBAT-D dressing or Tegaderm and
      monitoring outcomes. The AWBAT-D device has collagen and we hypothesize that the wounds
      treated with it will heal faster and with a decreased pain level. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate if there are differences in outcomes between AWBAT-D and Tegaderm in healing
      split thickness skin graft donor sites.
