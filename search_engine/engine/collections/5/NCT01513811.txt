      ileum disease. The diagnostic accuracy of colonoscopy is dependent on visualization of the
      colonic mucosa; hence an appropriate bowel preparation is essential for the examination.
      Despite multiple lavage were used throughout the years, the suboptimal cleaning level have
      been reported vary from 10% to more than 20% and up to one-third of incomplete or failed
      colonoscopies can be ascribed to poor bowel preparation. So it is important for us to search
      a new regimen for bowel preparation.
