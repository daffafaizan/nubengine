    
      To compare the clinical outcomes measured by composite of mortality, myocardial infarction
      and repeat revascularization by using FFR guided and angiographically guided
      revascularization to the standard strategy of ischaemia driven revascularization.

      Participants will be allocated to three arms, first conservative group of ischaemia guided
      PCI, second FFR guided PCI and third angiogram guided PCI where patients where patients with
      more than 50% lesion will undergo revascularization.
