      for 6 weeks as part of either the ezetimibe with simvastatin group or part of the simvastatin
      monotherapy group. Subjects in the ezetimibe with simvastatin group received one of three
      treatments: coadministration of ezetimibe 10 mg/day plus simvastatin 10 mg/day, 20 mg/day, or
      40 mg/day. Subjects in the simvastatin monotherapy group received one of three treatments:
      ezetimibe placebo plus simvastatin 10 mg/day, 20 mg/day, or 40 mg/day. The primary and key
      secondary efficacy analysis were based on the evaluations performed during Period 1 and were
      presented as data for subjects pooled from either the ezetimibe with simvastatin treatment
      groups compared with data for subjects pooled from the simvastatin monotherapy treatment
      groups.

      In Period 2, subjects received ezetimibe 10 mg/day plus simvastatin 40 mg/day or ezetimibe
      placebo plus simvastatin 40 mg/day for 27 additional weeks maintaining the same treatment
      assignment (coadministration vs monotherapy) as in Period 1.

      In Period 3, all subjects received ezetimibe 10 mg/day plus open-label simvastatin daily for
      20 weeks.
