      cycle lasts 4 weeks. Patients will take PCI-32765 by mouth, once a day in the morning.

      During each cycle patients will be asked to visit the clinic for scheduled tests and exams
      and to receive a supply of PCI-32765 to take at home every day. Patients will visit the
      clinic on the first day of each of the first 3 cycles, and then just once at the beginning of
      every three cycles.

      During study visits, patients will have a physical exam where they will be asked questions
      about their general health and specific questions about any problems that they might be
      having and any medications they may be taking. Patients will have blood tests to see how
      their disease is responding to the study treatment and how they are tolerating the study
      drug. Patients may also have CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis as well as a bone
      marrow aspirate and biopsy. If a patient's disease stays the same or is helped, he/she will
      continue to get study treatment. If disease worsens, he/she will be taken off study treatment
      at that time.

      After completion of the treatment and as part of standard of care, follow-up tests will
      include a physical exam, review of symptoms and medications, blood tests, bone marrow
      aspirate and biopsy, CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. The investigators would like
      to continue to monitor progress by following-up every three months for up to two years after
      completion of study treatment or until next treatment, whichever comes first.
