      weekly HD schedule will be screened from retrospective review of clinical and laboratory
      parameters from our clinical practice group. A total of 40 study participants (randomized 1:1
      study drug: usual care) will be enrolled. Duration of study medication exposure will be 4
      weeks. The total duration of study, from enrollment until the end of the washout period will
      be 7 weeks.

      This is a proof of concept study, to determine whether administration of patiromer has the
      potential to change the risk category for ESRD patients who are on conventional HD schedules.
      In addition, the study will develop and pilot study procedures that could be implemented in a
      large-scale clinical trial. By nature of the limited size of the study, the power of the
      trial will be limited. Reducing serum potassium with the use of low dialysate potassium is
      actually associated with an increased risk of sudden cardiac death. Furthermore, HD patients
      already carry a high pill burden, and it is unclear if prescription of an additional oral
      medication will reduce the frequency of episodic hyperkalemia.
