    
      The purpose of this single center, prospective study is to compare the efficacy of two
      strategies for diuresis in patients with cirrhosis, the use of furosemide (Lasix®) alone
      versus the combination of furosemide (Lasix ®) and albumin (25%). The investigators will
      perform a single-center, prospective study with data collected as result of standard of care
      at Rush University Medical Center (RUMC). Patients who are 18 years of age and older, have
      diagnosed cirrhosis, and present to RUMC with fluid retention will be identified by the
      Hepatology and/or Surgery attending and be screened for inclusion in the study. Each patient
      will be randomized into one of the two cohorts and will have 50% chance of being placed into
      either cohort. Cohort 1 will receive furosemide (Lasix) 40 to 80 mg intravenous push (IVP)
      twice a day (BID) for at least 48 hours and cohort 2 will receive combination of furosemide
      (Lasix) 40 to 80 mg IVP BID and albumin (25%) 12.5 grams BID for at least 48 hours.
