      when administered with combination chemotherapy in patients with AIDS-associated
      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the optimal phase II dose of doxorubicin HCl liposome
      to be administered with the combination chemotherapy regimen. III. Determine the effect of
      this regimen on HIV viral load in these patients. IV. Determine the clinical response to this
      regimen by these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of doxorubicin HCl liposome. Patients are stratified
      by risk group (good vs poor). Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV, vincristine IV,
      and methotrexate intrathecally on day 1, followed by oral prednisone on days 1-5.
      Sargramostim (GM-CSF) is administered subcutaneously on days 5-14 until blood counts recover.
      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of doxorubicin HCl
      liposome until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3
      months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 42-48 patients will be accrued for this study.
