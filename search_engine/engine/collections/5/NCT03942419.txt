    
      Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility during an initial Screening Visit and enrolled
      after signing the study-specific informed consent form(s). Eligible subjects must complete a
      run-in period where they use the microdose dispenser to administer study drug "vehicle"
      solution daily in both eyes. After run-in, subjects return for a Baseline Visit and
      additional study eligibility assessments. Subjects who continue to be eligible will be
      equally randomized to one of the following treatment groups:

        -  Microdose atropine 0.1% ophthalmic solution

        -  Microdose atropine 0.01% ophthalmic solution

        -  Microdose placebo ophthalmic solution

      Randomization will be stratified by iris color (e.g., dark and light) and study site. Study
      enrollment will be limited to a maximum of 50% of subjects who self-identify as East Asian
      ethnicity. Subjects will use their assigned study medication daily in both eyes and return
      for efficacy and safety assessments at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months.

      At the Month 36 Visit, subjects in the 2 atropine dose arms will be re-randomized to either
      placebo or 1 of the 2 doses of atropine ophthalmic solution, while subjects originally
      assigned to placebo will be re-randomized to one of the 2 atropine ophthalmic solution arms.
      After re-randomization, all subjects will be followed for an additional year with efficacy
      and safety examinations at Months 42 and 48.
