      nature of HIV-mediated disease progression, the impact of antiretroviral treatment, the
      nature of HIV pathogenesis, and viral and host genetic factors. This study will also assess
      the long-term patterns of therapy use and risk-taking behaviors.

      Patients will have study visits every 6 months. The visits will include interviews, specimen
      collection, and a physical examination.
