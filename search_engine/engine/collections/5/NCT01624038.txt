    
      To determine whether any of the following correlate with improved hematologic response:

      A decrease in hemolysis, as assayed by a decrease in LDH, compared to baseline
      levels,baseline Erythropoietin levels,baseline hemoglobin level and baseline reticulocyte
      counts (or % circulating nucleated erythroblasts/100 WBCs).

      To assess the possibility of steady increase of hemoglobin levels in thalassemia intermedia
      patients by at least 1g/dl above baseline levels during therapy using Hydroxyurea and
      Erythropoietin, growth evaluation , quality of life ( QoL ) and decline transfusion
      requirements during study period. Also to report and compare adverse events with other
      published data regarding.

      THE following criteria are used when including the patient in the study:

      Patients with thalassemia intermedia.Diagnosis based on genetic mutations, hemoglobin
      electrophoresis and characteristic clinical data at presentation. Patients requiring
      different transfusion requirements and not transfusion dependent.Patients having a baseline
      hemoglobin of less than or equal to 6-8g/dl.Patients with normal renal and liver function.
