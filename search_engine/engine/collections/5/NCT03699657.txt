      efficiency of the single switching monopolar RFA (SSM-RFA) in creating ablation zone; Yoon et
      al. reported that DSM-RFA allowed significantly greater RF energy delivery to target tissue
      per given time, and then, created significantly larger ablation zone than the SSM-RFA in ex
      vivo and in vivo animal experiments. A retrospective comparative study by Choi et al.
      reported that the DSM-RFA created significantly larger ablation volume than, but seemed to
      show similar LTP rate to the SSM-RFA. Still, whether the physical differences between SSM-RFA
      and DSM-RFA translate into better clinical outcomes remains an open question. Regarding that
      the choice of equipment is an essential factor to consider in planning image-guided tumor
      ablation procedure, we thought that the prospective comparison between DSM-RFA and the
      SSM-RFA would be helpful for improving results of RFA.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the efficacy, safety and
      mid-term outcomes of DSM-RFA with those of conventional SSM-RFA in the treatment of HCC.
