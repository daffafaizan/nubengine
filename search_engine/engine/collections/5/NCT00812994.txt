      informed consent. The depressed subjects began treatment with placebo for one week, followed
      by escitalopram for eight weeks (10 mg per day x 4 weeks, followed by 20 mg per day x 4
      weeks, as tolerated) in a double-blind, fixed-order, within-subject cross-over manner. The
      depressed subjects and the psychiatric rater were unaware of the study design and the
      sequence and duration of treatments. Depressed and control subjects underwent venipuncture to
      obtain blood for assays. The controls underwent venipuncture once, and the depressed subjects
      had venipuncture just prior to beginning active escitalopram treatment and again after 8
      weeks of escitalopram treatment. Blood was also collected at Weeks 4 and 8 of treatment in
      the depressed subjects for assay of citalopram and citalopram metabolites, to gauge
      medication compliance. Finally, depression severity and global clinical change were assessed
      in the depressed subjects at Baseline and at the end of Week 8 of escitalopram treatment.
