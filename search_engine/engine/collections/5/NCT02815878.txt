    
      This is a quasi-experimental project, comparing the effects of Enhance Wellness in a sample
      of adults aged 45 years or older and living with long-term physical disability, to two
      quasi-control groups: a sample of adults without long-term disability participating in
      Enhance Wellness, and a sample of adults with long-term disability not participating in
      Enhance Wellness. Outcomes are collected pre-intervention and post-intervention,
      approximately 6-months apart.
