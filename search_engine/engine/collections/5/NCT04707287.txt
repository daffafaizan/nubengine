      worldwide. It is now considered as a systemic disease even if diagnosed at an initial stage,
      as the clinical behaviour cannot be accurately predicted. Due to this reason, it is subjected
      to new dimensions of research every day. The aggressiveness of the cancer is directly
      proportional to the histopathological grade at the time of diagnosis. This is true with
      reference to the clinical stage at the time of presentation, the probability to metastasize
      and potential to recur. The idea of steroids receptor expression by the tumour is not new,
      and to evaluate their status prior to the induction of hormone therapy is a must.

      The sex steroids, which are produced intratumorally, include estrogen, progesterone, and
      androgens. They act on their specific receptors present on the cell surface, within the
      cytoplasm and at the nuclear membrane. It is a measurement of these receptors that decide the
      potential of an individual to respond to different types of hormones like estrogen receptor
      blockers and aromatase inhibitors. Do the histological grade of tumour bears some relation
      with the status of these receptors and can investigators predict and rely just on the
      cellular behaviour of tumour for the purpose of prognosis is still under investigation. This
      study is designed to see the relationship between the histopathological grade of the tumour
      with the expression of sex steroid receptors. It will also try to evaluate whether these
      receptors bear some prognostic value or not.
