the concentration of non-esterified fatty acids in maternal and fetalplasma in intact, alloxan-diabetic and x-ray-irradiated rats .determinations of the non-esterified fatty acids in the plasma ofpregnant rats showed that there do not exist any increases in theconcentrations depending on pregnancy during the period from the 20th -22nd day of pregnancy . in the fetal plasma the concentrations ofnon-esterified fatty acids only amounted to 40 - 50 per cent of thematernal values .with alloxan diabetes produced 2 days prior to the test theconcentration in the maternal plasma increased three- to fivefold, whileat the same time a significant rise was absent in fetal plasma withslightly increased average values .whole-body x-ray exposures (dose.. 400r, dose output.. 40r/min) ofnon-pregnant female and of pregnant rats beginning on the 17th day ofpregnancy did not result in any changes of the concentration ofnon-esterified fatty acids immediately after irradiation .
