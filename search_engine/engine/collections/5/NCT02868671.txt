      that are reported to be precursors of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), including
      affective (depression, anxiety) and somatic (headache, sleep difficulties) complaints.
      Evidence suggests that the increased intensity of these symptoms, particularly greater
      affective distress and injury-associated pain, increases vulnerability to PTSD. By treating
      post-TBI symptoms with acupuncture, these predisposing conditions will improve, and, as a
      result, the incidence of PTSD in this patient population will be reduced.

      Research plan: The overarching focus of this study is the use of acupuncture treatment,
      targeted to symptoms of mild TBI, to reduce the onset of PTSD. The investigators propose a
      randomized, sham procedure and usual care-controlled clinical trial of acupuncture beginning
      at acute phase following mild traumatic brain injury (TBI). Participants meeting eligibility
      requirements will be randomized to 1 of 3 groups: true acupuncture, sham acupuncture or usual
      care. Acupuncture treatments will continue for one month, at which point all participants
      will be assessed for presence of mild TBI symptoms, PTSD symptoms, and PTSD diagnosis.
      Participants will be evaluated again after one-month acupuncture treatment and follow-up
      post-hospital discharge. The investigators hypothesize that true acupuncture will be more
      effective than sham acupuncture and usual care in reducing these outcomes at after treatment
      and follow-up stage. A subgroup of patients were also randomized selected in each group and
      scanned by 3T MRI scanner at baseline, one-month (after acupuncture treatment) and follow-up.
