      giving breast cancer specific immune cells greater opportunity to function while the immune
      repertoire is being shifted by chemotherapy to anti-breast cancer response and offer the
      chance to test secondary prevention of breast cancer in high risk settings. There is a need
      to determine whether this ICAIT DC1 can activate CD4 and CD8 T cells prior to or in
      combination with chemotherapy with or without added trastuzumab.
