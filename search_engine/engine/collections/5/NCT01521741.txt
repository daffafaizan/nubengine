    
      The goal of the study is to create a large, prospectively maintained database with data from
      multiple objective measurement methods (i.e. perometry and BIS) that has detailed information
      on patient's symptoms and quality of life measures that can be used to answer research
      questions.

      The study design is prospective in nature, and a questionnaire will be utilized in
      conjunction with objective measurements before, throughout, and after a patient's treatment
      for breast cancer. This protocol is designed to mimic the current standard of care screening
      program with the addition of the quality of life questionnaire and BIS measurements.

      Data collection will include medical chart review, perometric arm volume measurements, BIS
      measurements, and a subjective questionnaire. At their preoperative multidisciplinary breast
      cancer clinic appointment, patients will undergo baseline arm volume measurements per
      standard of care. At this time, eligible patients will be offered this study. Those who
      consent will be given a baseline questionnaire to fill out and have baseline BIS measurements
      taken. Throughout their treatment and follow-up, patients will periodically have BCRL
      screening every 2-12 months depending on their risk (i.e. patients who are high risk for BCRL
      because of extensive lymph node surgery will be measured more often than patients who did not
      have lymph nodes removed). These screening visits will coincide with naturally occurring
      oncology follow-up visits; although, patients are also screened when patient or provider
      requests and questionnaires/BIS measurements will be offered at these time points as well.
