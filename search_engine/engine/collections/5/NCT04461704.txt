    
      This is a prospective, observational study to measure and collect and physical parameters
      from females at least 20 years of age in the labor room. Collection of measurements and
      physical parameters will begin when the subject enrolls in the study. Besides, ECG and SpO2
      will be recorded continuously until the end of the study period. In addition, uterus
      contraction cycle and fetal heart beat will be recorded during the study period based on
      standard of care in the labor room. Pain will be recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS) at
      baseline and when the caregiver perceives that there is a change in the subject's pain status
      until the end of the study period. The time of each assessment of pain on VAS should be
      recorded. Subjects will be withdrawn from the study if they have a cesarean section or any
      complication during labor in the opinion of the investigator. Subject participation in the
      study will end when eight hours have elapsed since baseline, the subject leaves the labor
      room or the subject delivers the baby.
