    
      This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, non-controlled ongoing clinical case series in
      two participating centers in Indian and Iranian hospitals, to evaluate the safety and
      feasibility of minimally-invasive surgery of advanced keratoconus using a bioengineered
      corneal stromal substitute on a compassionate basis to alleviate blindness and low vision,
      due to the severely limited availability of human corneal donor tissue at these centers
      relative to the medical need. Patients fulfilling inclusion criteria are recruited
      consecutively and implanted intra-stromally with the bioengineered substitute, as a less
      invasive surgery than full-thickness or anterior lamellar corneal transplantation. In the
      first phase of the study, a total of 20 patients were recruited and safety and efficacy
      outcomes were evaluated in those having a minimum of 6 months of postoperative follow-up. In
      the second phase of the study (currently ongoing), up to 40 patients are being recruited,
      with one-year postoperative outcomes of all included patients to be evaluated as the final
      study endpoint. Primary safety and efficacy outcomes will be evaluated.
