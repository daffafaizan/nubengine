    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To evaluate the safety of IDH-1 inhibitor FT-2102 (FT-2102) in combination with CDA
           inhibitor E7727/decitabine combination agent ASTX727 (ASTX727) in myelodysplastic
           syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients with IDH1 R132 mutations.
           (Phase Ib)

        -  To evaluate the response rate (overall response rate [ORR], complete response [CR],
           complete remission with partial hematologic recovery (CRh), complete remission with
           incomplete blood count recovery [CRi], morphologic leukemia-free state [MLFS], partial
           response [PR]) of the combination of ASTX727 and the IDH1-inhibitor, FT-2102 in subjects
           with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) with IDH1 R132
           mutations. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To confirm the phase II recommended dosing level of FT-2102 and ASTX727 in combination.
           (Phase Ib)

        -  To determine the pharmacokinetics of FT-2102 and ASTX727 in combination. (Phase Ib)

        -  To determine the reduction of bone marrow blasts. (Phase II)

        -  To determine the overall survival and event-free survival. (Phase II)

        -  To determine the levels of 2-HG in the blood and blood cells after treatment. (Phase II)

        -  To determine the relationship of 2-HG reduction to clinical response. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation of IDH-1 inhibitor FT-2102 followed by a phase
      II study.

      Patients receive CDA inhibitor E7727/decitabine combination agent ASTX727 orally (PO) once
      daily (QD) on days 1-5 and IDH-1 inhibitor FT-2102 PO QD or twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      12 months, and then periodically for up to 5 years.
