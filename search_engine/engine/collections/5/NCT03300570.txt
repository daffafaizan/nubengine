      I. To identify the ability of dolcanatide (SP333), when administered as a single daily dose
      of 27 mg x 7 days, to induce a direct pharmacological effect on cGMP levels, based on biopsy
      samples from the rectum obtained pre- and post-intervention, as compared to placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) response rate between arms (dolcanatide versus
      placebo).

      II. To confirm the safety and tolerability of dolcanatide, as compared to placebo.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Participants receive dolcanatide orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7 days.

      ARM B: Participants receive placebo PO QD for 7 days.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 21 and 51 days.
