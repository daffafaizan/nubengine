      treatment group model for abused women in enhancing their self-esteem and reducing the level
      of depression, in three shelters for abused women of Po Leung Kuk (a social service
      organization in Hong Kong). 50-60 abused women are recruited as treatment group from two
      randomized shelters of Po Leung Kuk (Shelters A and B), where subjects receive self-esteem
      enhancement group intervention for abused women. Another 50-60 abused women are recruited as
      the control group from a randomized shelter of Po Leung Kuk (Shelter C), where subject
      receive standard shelter services for abused women. It is hypothesized that subjects in the
      Treatment Group would report significant improvement in self-esteem, social support, quality
      of life; reduction in the level of depression, symptoms of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder at 3
      months after service delivery, are compared to those in the control group.
