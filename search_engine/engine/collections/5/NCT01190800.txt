      especially for the consent to treatment and the ability to vote. No tools are available to
      assess the capacity to design a proxy. The purpose of this research is to assess
      simultaneously four decision-making abilities in persons with Alzheimer's disease: the
      capacity to consent to treatment, the capacity to vote and the capacity to design a proxy
      either to consent to treatment or to vote.

      This study will recruit 320 patients with Alzheimer's disease and 80 non-demented control
      subjects. Four decision-making questionnaires will be administered to participants to explore
      participant capacity to understand, reason, appreciate and make a choice about the capacity
      to consent to treatment, to vote and to design a proxy either to consent to treatment or to
      vote. Once validated in the first part of this research, the questionnaires will be used to
      study decision-making abilities and their determinants in patients with Alzheimer's disease
      and control subjects.
