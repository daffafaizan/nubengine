      I. To optimize a decellularized prostate tissue model for the maintenance of prostate cancer
      stem cells.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the self-renewal and differentiation ability of human prostate cancer stem
      cells (CSCs) (tumor-associated calcium signal transducer 2 [TROP2]+ cells) in the above
      mentioned decellularized prostate tissue model.

      II. To compare the number of CSCs according to key patient characteristics, including race,
      age, Gleason, metastasis status, and previous cancer treatment(s).

      OUTLINE:

      Tissue samples are collected from patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia for
      decellularization and preparation as human extracellular matrix for growing human prostate
      CSCs. Tissue samples are also collected from patients with prostate cancer for the analysis
      of TROP2+ cells by flow cytometry.
