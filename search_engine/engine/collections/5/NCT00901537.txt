      three patients will be treated with low dose of azacitidine. If that dose does not cause bad
      side effects, then the dose will slowly be made higher for new patients who take part in the
      study.

      Patients will receive azacitidine as a once-a-day subcutaneous (under the skin) injection
      every day from day 1 to day 5 of 28 days in this study. Cisplatin is given intravenously on
      day 8. This 28-day or 4-week period of time is called a cycle. Cycles are repeated every four
      weeks for as long as the physician recommends.

      During this study, patients will need the following tests and procedures.

        -  Physical exam - This will be done weekly during first 2 weeks of every 4-week treatment
           cycle.

        -  Blood tests for blood counts - These will be done every week.

        -  Blood tests for kidney function, liver function, and to measure electrolytes - These
           will be done every week

        -  Blood samples for research study - This will be done weekly during first cycle, then
           weekly during the first 2 weeks on the subsequent treatment cycles

        -  X-rays or scans - These will be done once every 8 weeks.
