      achievement of maternal locoregional anesthesia peri-rachianesthesia, skin disinfection and
      sterile field. The gesture will be performed by an experienced obstetrician under ultrasound
      guidance. Anesthetist-resuscitator is present in the obstetric block. Peri-rachianesthesia is
      performed by the initial injection of 2.5mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine associated with 5 gamma
      of Sufentanil and 0.5ml of physiological saline.

      Inclusion in one of two arms is defined after randomization in single blind:

      Arm 1 (Sufentanil + Lidocaïne) or Arm 2 (Ultiva® + Lidocaïne) For patients randomized in the
      arm 1, we will realize the reference protocol, as in the current practice, by injecting
      Sufentanil intra-cordally at the posology of 1,5 μg / kg of estimated fetal weight, then
      Lidocaïne 1% in bolus of 10 ml (10 mg / ml).

      If 2 minutes after the start of the injection of Lidocaïne, there is no obtaining of fetal
      asystole, we will inject 100 mg of Lidocaïne 1% into a 10 ml bolus. In case of failure of the
      procedure, we will inject 10ml of KCL 10% intra-cordial if the cord is still accessible, if
      not intra-cardiac.

      For patients randomized to arm 2, we will intracenally inject Ultiva® 30 μg and Lidocaïne 1%
      into 10 ml bolus (10 mg / ml).

      If 2 minutes after the start of the injection of Lidocaïne, there is no obtaining of
      asystole, we will inject 100 mg of Lidocaïne 1% in 10 ml bolus. In case of failure of the
      procedure, we will inject 10 ml of KCL 10% intra-cordally if the cord is still accessible, if
      not intra-cardiac.
