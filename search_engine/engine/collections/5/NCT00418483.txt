      (aPAO). The current assortment of plasminogen activators are slow to dissolve clots in the
      leg, and may lead to bleeding complications. Plasmin is a direct thrombolytic that may act
      more quickly when infused directly into the clot and thus assist in restoring blood flow to
      the leg. There is a large reserve in blood alpha-2 antiplasmin in the blood to rapidly
      inactivate Plasmin outside of the clot. Plasmin has the potential for an improved bleeding
      risk profile in aPAO.
