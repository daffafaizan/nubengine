      effect in clinical practice. It develops over years and results in severe symptoms related to
      the hypomagnesemia. Due to the widespread use of PPIs, the real number of PPIH may be high.
      Currently, there is a lack of intervention strategies and no general treatment protocols for
      patients exist. It is generally anticipated that PPI-withdrawal and antacid replacement
      therapy is the only working method to recover patients from the hypomagnesemia. However, this
      frequently resulted in rebound of gastric acid related complaints.

      The molecular mechanism of PPIH involves a reduction of Mg2+ absorption by the large
      intestine. Inulin fibers have been shown to have prebiotic properties. The intestinal
      microbiome ferments inulin and releases butyrate into the luminal compartment of the
      intestine. This results in acidification which enhances the uptake of Mg2+ and Ca2+ mediated
      by pH-sensitive ionchannels.Thus inulin may counteract PPI induced reduction of luminal
      protons and therefore reestablish normal Mg2+ absorption.

      To this end cases with PPIH and controls underwent two 14 day trials of orally administered
      inulin under separated by wash-out periods of 14 days. During the experimental phase blood
      measures of electrolytes were monitored.
