      will be randomized by the block randomization, into intervention group (Multi-domain
      Attention Training, MAT), or active control group (Passive information activities, PIA).
      Training sessions of the MAT group are 45 minutes/day, 3 days/week, for 12 weeks (36 sessions
      each). The training of PIA group is the same as MAT group. The investigators constructed a
      rigorous MAT program adhering to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT)
      reporting guidelines. The investigators expect to determine the improvement in attention
      function of older adults with mild cognitive impairment after using the MAT program.
