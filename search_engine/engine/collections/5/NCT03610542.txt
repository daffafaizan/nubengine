      suicide, and of developing clinical anxiety and poor mental health. Externally resourced
      school-based cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) interventions have been shown to be
      effective in treating test anxiety. Intervening in test anxiety, a sub-clinical anxiety, may
      prevent anxieties from developing into a clinical disorder. The primary outcomes are test
      anxiety, clinical anxiety, and wellbeing, measured at baseline, post-intervention, and 6 and
      12-month follow-up. In addition, to identify treatment mechanisms additional measures are
      taken of uncertain control, metacognition, and emotional regulation.
