      water-based exercises and land-based exercises. Both of them will receive a strengthening
      exercise protocol for lower limb muscles. A blind investigator will assess the patients
      before and immediately after, 3 months and 6 months following the interventions. The main
      outcomes will be pain, function, physical performance and strength.
