      transferred at one time. These extra embryos are often cryopreserved for future use. In the
      event that a couple decides that they do not want to proceed with using cryopreserved
      embryos, these embryos can be discarded, donated to another couple, or donated to research.

      Embryos that are donated to research are used to identify a group of parameters that have
      significant predictive value for assisted reproductive technology outcomes. We hope to
      develop future laboratory techniques as we gain a better knowledge of gamete development,
      fertilization and implantation. We will test, standardize and implement better methods for
      freezing embryos prior to employing these techniques in a clinical setting. We hope to
      develop new methods to optimize the determination of genes and chromosomes in embryos. We
      will test the proficiency of laboratory staff on techniques and/or procedures done in the IVF
      laboratory. This study WILL NOT:create embryos for research, transfer embryos to an
      individual, develop cell lines or clones.
