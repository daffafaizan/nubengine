      bronchiectasis by means of a prospective randomized placebo-controlled double blind study
      with a follow-up of at least one year. To explore whether correction of Vitamin D deficiency
      by the oral supplementation of Vitamin D triggers the vitamin D receptors-mediated
      cathelicidin pathway and increases local or systemic concentrations of the natural
      antimicrobial polypeptide cathelicidin with enhanced eradication of bacteria.
