      Center in Milan (ITALY) have shown that TAMs in CLM are heterogeneous and that their
      diversity can be distinguished based on their morphology and functionality. Therefore, TAMs
      may represent an additional tool in the definition of the biology and prognosis of CLM
      patients. This preliminary finding provides us with the rationale to undertake a prospective
      study on a large series of CLM patients surgically resected by our unit aimed at validating
      the promisingcorrelation between different TAMs phenotypes and patients prognosis. The
      characterization of the diversity of TAMs in CLM will be refined using state of the art
      technology, including multi-parametric flow cytometry, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq)
      transcriptional profiling, metabolomic, and proteomic analyses. The expected findings will
      allow us to develop a new diagnostic tool based on TAMs features, which will open the way to
      new criteria for patient stratification and for the design of new targeted therapies in a
      personalized medicine perspective.
