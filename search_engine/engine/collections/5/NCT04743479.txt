      MD, Director of Department of general surgery of Shanghai Changhai Hospital. The trial will
      include individuals with new-onset diabetes (diagnosed within the past 3 year), familial
      pancreatic cancer, inherited syndromes associated with pancreatic cancer (including
      hereditary pancreatitis, familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma syndrome, hereditary
      nonpolyposis colon cancer, Peutz-Jeghers syndrome, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer
      syndromes, etc), pancreatic cystic neoplasm (including IPMN, MCN) as well as chronic
      pancreatitis. Participants will undergo annual laboratory tests and high-resolution MRI/CT
      examinations of the pancreas. Any suspicious lesions will be further examined by endoscopic
      ultrasound (EUS). If pancreatic cancer or a pre-cancerous lesion is identified, the
      individual will be referred for surgery. We will also be collecting a blood sample from all
      participants for DNA isolation. Clinical data and biological specimens contained in this
      study may be used for a wide variety of future related studies to the cause, diagnosis,
      outcome and treatment of pancreatic cancer.
