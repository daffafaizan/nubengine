      therapeutic agents to help people reduce weight. ATL-962 is a lipase inhibitor which could
      reduce the amount of fat absorbed from a person's diet, leading to weight reduction.

      In this study patients with Type II diabetes who are clinically obese will receive ATL-962 at
      one of three dose levels, or placebo, or orlistat (another lipase inhibitor). The study will
      investigate the amount of weight lost after 12 weeks' treatment and will compare the safety
      and tolerability profile of ATL-962 and orlistat.
