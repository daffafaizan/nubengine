      communication dysfunction, stereotypic movement disorder, and growth failure. The diagnosis
      of Rett syndrome is based on consensus clinical criteria. Rett syndrome is caused by
      mutations in the Methyl CpG-Binding Protein-2 (MECP2) gene and has no treatment.

      Only a few improved cases have been reported concerning buspirone (Andaku, 2005, 1 patient),
      topiramate (Goyal, 2004, 8 patients), diazepam (Kurihara, 2001, 1 patient) and carnitin
      (Plochl, 2004, 1 patient).

      Only one randomized study versus placebo has been published about a treatment by naltrexone
      including 25 patients. A light improvement of respiratory parameters was then observed with a
      deterioration of the cognitive function (Percy, 2004).

      A mouse experimental model of Rett syndrome created by genetic invalidation of the MECP2 gene
      is available. It had been then observed that adult MECP2-deficient mice show respiratory
      alterations and found that endogenous noradrenaline helps to maintain a normal respiratory
      rhythm. Desipramine, a selective inhibitor of norepinephrine reuptake, seems to be efficient
      to reduce the respiratory alteration occuring in MECP2-deficient mice (Insem patent 2005,
      Villard and Roux 2006).

      The aim of the study is to evaluate these obtained results in MECP2-deficient mice on
      patients with Rett syndrome.
