      limited success rate in terms of long-term recurrence-free survival in non-paroxysmal atrial
      fibrillation (NPAF) and additional ablations isolating extra-PV triggers seem to improve the
      outcome (1). The extra-PV triggers include triggers from other sites such as left atrial
      posterior wall, superior vena cava, interatrial septum, crista terminalis, left atrial
      appendage and coronary sinus (1, 2). These are known to be independent predictors of late AF
      recurrence following catheter ablation (3, 4, and 5). Earlier studies have demonstrated
      better ablation outcome in NPAF when non-PV triggers sites were isolated along with PVAI (5,
      6). Moreover, Verma et al had reported high (57%) recurrence rate post-index procedure in AF
      patients with pre-existent scar (7). However, published data are conflicting regarding the
      benefits of additional substrate guided ablation (scar homogenization) compared to
      conventional PVAI alone strategy (8). Also, limited data is available showing a comparison of
      the lasting efficacy of the above three procedures when used in different combinations.

      Hypothesis: The combined ablation strategy including PVAI, scar homogenization and ablation
      of extra-PV triggers has the highest likelihood of maintaining long-term sinus rhythm in
      patients with NPAF.
