    
      Safety: The primary safety endpoint assesses the incidence of procedure or device related
      SAEs from procedure to 7 (±1) days post-procedure or hospital discharge, whichever is longer,
      for patients with right-sided SVT or 3 months (±2 weeks) post-procedure for patients with
      atrial fibrillation. Secondary safety objectives were to demonstrate safety (operative and
      post-operative complications) over the 12 months post-procedure.

      Performance: The primary performance endpoint is to demonstrate successful catheter
      deployment, irrigation and ablation at the target area during supra-ventricular cardiac
      ablation. The secondary performance endpoint is to demonstrate successful and effective
      contact force reading between catheter tip and heart wall during mapping and ablation at all
      locations and all angulations.

      Efficacy: Secondary effectiveness objectives will consider acute and chronic elimination of
      the target arrhythmia, the cost-effectiveness of the system and procedure-related parameters
