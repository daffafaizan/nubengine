      poor-prognosis non-Hodgkin's lymphomas treated with high-dose etoposide and total-body
      irradiation followed by rescue with peripheral blood stem cells. II. Determine the toxicity
      of this regimen. III. Evaluate the short-term and long-term engraftment characteristics of
      patients treated on this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients who respond on Regimen A and who have no bulk disease greater than 5 cm are
      treated on Regimen B. Regimen A: Single-Agent Chemotherapy/Stem Cell Mobilization with
      Urothelial Protection and Growth Factor Therapy. Cyclophosphamide, CTX, NSC-26271; with
      Mesna, NSC-113891; and Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (Amgen), G-CSF, NSC-614629.
      Regimen B: Sequential Radiotherapy, Single-Agent Chemotherapy, and Stem Cell Rescue.
      Total-body irradiation, TBI (equipment not specified); Etoposide, VP-16, NSC-141540; and
      Peripheral Blood Stem Cells, PBSC.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20 patients will be studied.
