      patients will be divided either in the pectoral block group or the control group (sham
      block). Both groups will receive the same perioperative and postoperative anesthetic
      protocol. The investigator in charge of the patient will leave the operative room right
      before the completion of the pectoral block (or the sham block) to preserve randomisation and
      the block will be performed by another investigator. The pectoral block is performed under
      ultrasound guidance with 10 cc of lidocaine 1% with epinephrine 1/400000 between the
      pectoralis major muscle and the pectoralis minor muscle and 20 cc of the same solution
      between the pectoralis minor muscle and the serratus anterior muscle at the third rib.
      Anesthesia will be maintained with sevoflurane for a bispectral (BIS) index between 45 and
      60. Analgesia will be provided with a perfusion of remifentanil adjusted to maintain a mean
      arterial blood pressure (MAP) in the range of Â± 10% of the basal MAP (mean of the last three
      MAPs obtained before surgical incision, under sevoflurane-only anesthesia). The total
      remifentanil consumption will be assessed and compared between the groups. The investigators
      believe that the pectoral nerve block will significantly reduce the intraoperative
      remifentanil consumption.
