      characterized by anterior knee pain that is aggravated by deep knee flexion, prolonged
      sitting, and repetitive flexion/extension. The most widely accepted theory in regards to the
      source of this pain is that a force imbalance around the knee leads to static patellofemoral
      malalignment and dynamic patellofemoral maltracking. In turn, this malalignment and
      maltracking lead to elevated joint contact stresses, which ultimately leads to patellofemoral
      pain. Current understanding of patellofemroal maltracking is typically focused on static 2D
      alignment (lateral tilt and displacement). Yet, patellofemoreal pain is most often
      exacerbated during dynamic events and the patella has complete six degrees of freedom in its
      movement. More recent studies have been able to quantify patellofemoral kinematics during
      volitional dynamic tasks and demonstrate that the maltracking problem is more complex than
      originally postulated. Specifically, in patients with patellofemoral pain, altered kinematics
      are not limited to excessive patellar lateral translation and tilt, but include excessive
      patellar superior translation along with excessive flexion and varus rotation. Although these
      results are useful in demonstrating how specific maltracking patterns could lead to
      patellofemoral pain, they do not present any associations between a potentially altered force
      balance around the knee and the observed maltracking patterns. Therefore, the overall goal of
      this work is to determine the specific sources of maltracking patterns in patellofemoral
      pain. As part of this overall goal, the purpose of this study is to determine how the loss of
      force in the vasti medialis muscle alters the dynamic control of patellar kinematics.
