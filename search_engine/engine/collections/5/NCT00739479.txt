      Obesity, especially located in the waist area, elevated blood fats (lipids), high blood
      pressure and insulin resistance. The METS affects one third of the adult population in the
      USA and increases the risks for both diabetes and hardening of the arteries, leading to heart
      attacks and strokes.

      The best treatment for improving the symptoms of METS is weight loss. In previous studies, it
      has been demonstrated that whey protein (WP) supplementation increased weight loss and
      especially fat-mass loss in obese, insulin resistant women when compared to carbohydrates. We
      now propose to compare WP to another protein source in patients with the METS during weight
      loss. In addition, we will use a special preparation called partially hydrolyzed whey
      protein, which may have specific properties that increase fat mass loss.
