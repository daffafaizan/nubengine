      mineral and enzyme levels, and soil condition data. The number of research subjects to be
      taken was 180 subjects with 90 research subjects coming from mothers who had healthy children
      and 90 research subjects came from mothers who had stunted children or other nutritional
      disorders. The research stage will run after going through the inclusion of research
      subjects, namely mothers who have healthy children and mothers who have nutritionally
      deficient children, aged 20-40 years. The research stage consisted of two stages. The
      statistical analysis used is to use the ANOVA test, which will then compile a manuscript.

      This research is a case control study, with primary data collection, is a laboratory clinical
      trial study on the subject of mothers who have children aged 2-3 years, aged 20-40 years. The
      number of research subjects to be taken was 180 subjects with 90 research subjects coming
      from mothers who had healthy children and 90 research subjects came from mothers who had
      stunted children or other nutritional disorders.

      The research stage consisted of two stages, the first stage was the initial screening of the
      primary data of the research subjects, namely by analyzing food intake including mineral
      intake data, the diet of the research subjects, mineral and enzyme levels, and data on soil
      conditions in the area. The second stage was to analyze the relationship between the existing
      variables so that the most significant relationship was seen between the differences in diet,
      mineral content, enzyme levels, and soil content between the two groups. The statistical
      analysis used was to use the ANOVA test.
