    
      Specific aim 1: Demonstrate that anterior temporal lobe (ATL)-septal/subgenual cingulate
      (SCSR) coupling for guilt can be increased through one session of neurofeedback in the group
      seeing visual feedback based on increasing correlations during the guilt condition compared
      with the group seeing visual feedback based on keeping correlations at the same level during
      the guilt condition.

      Specific aim 2: Demonstrate that this increase in coupling is selective for guilt relative to
      indignation.

      Specific aim 3: Demonstrate that mood is not negatively affected by neurofeedback.

      Specific aim 4: Explore whether this short intervention decreases self-hate on the
      Interpersonal Guilt Questionnaire (Portuguese translation) and increases self-esteem on the
      Rosenberg scale (both show significant correlations with SCSR-ATL coupling across major
      depressive disorder and control groups in our Manchester study), or if these measures are not
      available, decreases negative affect on the Positive and Negative Affect Scale.
