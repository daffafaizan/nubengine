      recorded for that network and the investigators site will be reviewing that data every 3
      months from infants who have completed the Vermont Oxford Network collection. This project
      will specifically look at the incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing
      entercolitis, periventricular leukomalacia, sepsis and death following the implementation of
      the ACOG recommendations.
