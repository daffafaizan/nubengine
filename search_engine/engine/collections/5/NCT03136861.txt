    
      The study consisted of 2 treatment periods: a double-blind, placebo-controlled period from
      Baseline to Week 8 (Treatment Period 1) and a double-blind secukinumab treatment period from
      Week 8 to Week 24 (Treatment Period 2).

      At Baseline (Treatment Period 1), patients were randomized in a 3:1 ratio to either
      secukinumab 150 mg (Group A) or placebo (Group B). At Week 8 (Treatment Period 2), patients
      were re-randomized and re-assigned respectively to 1 of 5 treatment arms to receive either
      secukinumab 150 mg or secukinumab 300 mg.

      Patients assigned to secukinumab 150 mg (Group A) at Baseline who were responders (i.e.
      spinal pain score < 4) at Week 8 continued on the same dose until Week 24 under 1 treatment
      arm (Arm A1). Patients assigned to secukinumab 150 mg at Baseline who were non-responders at
      Week 8 were re-randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: secukinumab 150 mg (Arm A2) or
      secukinumab 300 mg (Arm A3) from Week 8 to Week 24.

      Similarly, patients assigned to placebo (Group B) at Baseline were re-randomized to 1 of 2
      treatment arms: secukinumab 150 mg (Arm B1) or secukinumab 300 mg (Arm B2) from Week 8 until
      Week 24.
