      for diagnosis. Increasingly, endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) has been used as a means of
      diagnosing chronic pancreatitis. However, there are questions about whether intra-rater
      reliability and/or validity are high enough to warrant using EUS to make the diagnosis of
      chronic pancreatitis.

      The purpose of this observational study is to determine the degree of correlation between two
      expert endosonographers in evaluating minimal standard criteria (MST) in the same patient
      during the same EUS exam. Patients both with and without chronic pancreatitis will be
      included in the study to try and determine the validity and reliability of back-to-back EUS
      examinations.
