      has a long course of treatment. Because of T cell deficiency, patients are prone to recurrent
      infection, hemorrhage, sepsis, colitis or complications of diabetes mellitus, which lead to
      early death.

      New clinical treatment schemes have been explored and introduced around the world. Sequential
      transplantation of umbilical cord blood stem cells and islet cells is the latest treatment
      method for these children. Early treatment of monogenic immunodeficiency T1DM children can
      avoid disease-related organ toxicity, infection risk associated with chronic
      immunosuppression, and possible prevention of autoimmune endocrine organ damage. Thus,
      sequential transplantation of umbilical cord blood stem cells and islet cells is the only
      possible cure for those patients currently.
