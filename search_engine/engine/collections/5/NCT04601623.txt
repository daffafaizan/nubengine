      prognosis and postoperative risk of re-tear depended on the quality of rotator cuff muscles.
      Preoperative evaluations were usually done by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI was used
      in recent studies to predict the surgical outcome of large-to-massive RCTs and postoperative
      re-tear, but the clinical availability was not as good as ultrasound. The investigators
      hypothesize that ultrasound elastography can predict the prognosis of large-to-massive RCTs
      and risk of re-tear.
