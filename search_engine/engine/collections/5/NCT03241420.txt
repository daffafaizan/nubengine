      Occupational Medicine and Interstitial Lung/Rheumatology Clinics at National Jewish Health
      who have been referred for evaluation of chronic lung conditions. The healthy control group
      will comprise 300 volunteers who are at least 18 years of age, have no history of
      pre-existing lung disease, and report no respiratory illness in the four weeks preceding
      enrollment. Inclusion criteria for the group with chronic lung disease will include physician
      diagnosis of a chronic lung condition (e.g. bronchiolitis, pulmonary fibrosis, asthma, coal
      mine dust lung disease, asbestosis), and age â‰¥18 years. Exclusion criteria will include
      recent myocardial infarction, stroke, eye surgery, chest/abdominal surgery (within past
      month), known thoracic, aortic, or cerebral aneurysm, or uncontrolled hypertension. Study
      participation will consist of one visit that will last between 90-120 minutes. The chronic
      lung disease group will fill out the informed consent and complete both LCI testing and
      spirometry. The healthy control group will complete informed consent, a brief questionnaire,
      LCI testing, and spirometry.
