      serum betatrophin. 70 healthy subjects and 20 healthy young volunteers were enrolled for
      investigating the role of betatrophin in energy homeostasis and the circadian rhythm. 50
      patients with type 2 diabetes were classified into three groups by the stage of diabetic
      retinopathy. Rank test was used to analyze the correlation between the progression of
      diabetic retinopathy and circulating betatrophin. Betatrophin were measured by a commercially
      available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and confirmed via Western Blot.
