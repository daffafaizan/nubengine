      spouse or partner caring for an individual with TBI experiences significant emotional
      distress, and psychological and physical morbidity. Clinical experience indicates that
      patients with strong family support progress further than those without family involvement.
      There is strong evidence that support provided to caregivers improves their well being, as
      well as that of the care recipient. The trial was designed to lessen her morbidity, improve
      her support for the TBI partner, and improve recovery of the TBI person.

      The effectiveness of a newly developed Trauma Recovery Support System (TRSS) was evaluated
      using a randomized controlled experimental design. Sixty-four patient/caregiver pairs were
      recruited, and those (randomly) assigned to the experimental group received access to the
      centralized TRSS via a personal computer in their homes including access via Internet to
      special modules and communication services to help them cope with their new roles as
      caregivers and with accompanying social isolation. Modules consist of an on-line discussion
      group, an "ask an expert questions" function, a database of previously asked questions with
      answers, a database of community resources, and a reference library. Controls received
      standard care. All participants (experimental and control) were interviewed at 0, 3, and 6
      months from time of patient discharge, initially in person and later by phone to evaluate the
      status of the caregiver (quality of life and health status) and TBI patient recovery.
      Sociodemographic and other background data was collected.
