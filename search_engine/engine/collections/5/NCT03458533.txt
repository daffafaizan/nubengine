      characterize new morphological and quantitative MRI parameters of pituitary gland and sellar
      region assessed by texture analysis with a specific software (ImageJÂ©). These parameters will
      be correlated them to hypothalamic-pituitary-peripheral axis function, metabolism and body
      composition.

      Data will be detected at baseline and at 3 years follow-up to quantitatively identify the
      different pituitary MRI patterns in 3 groups:

        1. patients without weight modifies

        2. patients with weight loss obtain through diet and lifestyle changes

        3. patients with weight loss obtained through bariatric surgery
