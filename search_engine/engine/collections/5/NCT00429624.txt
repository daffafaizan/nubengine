      modalities are used to treat neck pain, but no therapy has been found to be clearly superior.
      We conducted a randomized controlled study of chiropractic manipulation versus medical
      therapy for chronic neck pain.

      Subjects (n=70) with neck pain for more than 3 months but with no evidence of radiculopathy
      or myelopathy were randomized. Both groups were instructed to do neck exercises and use heat
      daily. The chiropractic group received 12 standardized manipulations over 6 weeks. Nurses saw
      the medical group on the same visit schedule and received acetaminophen 1,000 milligrams four
      times a day as needed. Blinded observer performed all measurements. The primary outcome
      measure was the Neck Disability Index (NDI). Secondary measures were pain via a visual
      analogue scale, global via Medical Outcome Study Short Form and range of motion via Cybex
      electronic inclinometer.
