      masked, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to compare local gentamicin injection to saline
      injection in open tibial shaft fractures. The study will enroll patients within 1 week of
      injury. The active or placebo agent will be administered during the initial surgical
      debridement based on a web-based randomization tool. Patients will be followed for 1 year
      after surgery to assess for the occurrence of fracture-related infection (FRI), a consensus
      definition of infection after open fracture or insertion of internal fixation to treat
      fracture. Additional clinical and economic endpoints will also be measured.

      Depending on the outcome of the feasibility study, we may undertake a definitive trial to
      test the effectiveness of local gentamicin to prevent FRI. If proven effective, local
      gentamicin would impact the clinical care of open fracture patients both in Tanzania and
      likely in high-income settings as well. These data will also deepen the understanding of the
      clinical and economic impact of FRI in open fracture populations.
