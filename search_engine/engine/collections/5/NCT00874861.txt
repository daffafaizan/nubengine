    
      This is a pilot study of a vaccination regime that is designed to efficiently induce
      anti-tumor T-cell responses in patients with recurrent WHO grade II glioma. The proposed
      regime combines subcutaneous injections of glioma-associated antigen (GAA)-derived cytotoxic
      T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitope-peptides with simultaneous intramuscular (i.m.) administration of
      poly-ICLC.

      The overall objective of this pilot study is to collect immunological and safety data that
      will be used to decide whether a larger study of clinical efficacy is warranted in these
      patients. All patients on the study will be followed for a minimum of 2 years, so that the
      actual 2-year overall survival (OS), 6-month and 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) rates
      can be determined in an exploratory manner.
