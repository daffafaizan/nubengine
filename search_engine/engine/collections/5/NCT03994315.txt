    
      This study is a single-center, prospective, randomized, open-label study of an infant
      probiotic (B. infantis EVC001) and a prebiotic supplement (LNT) in exclusively formula-fed
      infants. Nine subjects will be enrolled into three treatment arms:

        -  Group 1: 8 x 10^9 CFU B. infantis + LNT (3 g/L then 8 g/L)

        -  Group 2: 8 x 10^9 CFU B. infantis + LNT (6 g/L then 12 g/L)

        -  Group 3: 8 x 10^9 CFU B. infantis alone Study staff will be unblinded to the treatment
           assignments. Infants in all groups will receive a once-daily oral feeding of B. infantis
           EVC001 (8.0 x 10^9 CFU) mixed with infant formula for 28 consecutive days. Two of the
           treatment groups (Group 1 & Group 2) will also receive two dose-escalated concentrations
           of the prebiotic supplement (LNT) mixed with their daily infant formula: Group 1 will
           receive a concentration of 3 g/L for 2 weeks followed by 8 g/L for the next 2 weeks.
           Group 2 will receive a concentration of 6 g/L for 2 weeks followed by 12 g/L for the
           next 2 weeks. Infants consuming the LNT will cross over to the higher dose without a
           washout period in between. All infants will be evaluated for an additional 2 weeks after
           cessation of the supplement(s). The total duration of the study will be approximately 7
           weeks.
