      will be asked to sign an informed consent form (ICF), prior to performing any study related
      procedures.

      The point of enrollment is the time at which a patient signs and dates the ICF. Following
      enrollment, the patient will undergo screening evaluation (including Neurological assessment)
      to determine eligibility. Screening failures will be identified on a screening log. Patients
      who are found to meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will compose
      the evaluable cohort of the study. Screening failure subjects will not be counted as part of
      the target patient sample size nor will they be included in the analysis.

      Patients in the randomized phase will have surgery with the CardioGard Cannula or comparator
      cannulae and will remain blinded to their group assignment through the 30 days follow-up
      evaluation.
