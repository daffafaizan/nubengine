      have previously been treated with Lenalidomide and Bortezomib containing regimens that is
      both active and tolerable, as these patients have a poor prognosis. Hands-on experience with
      Pomalidomide is very limited in Austria and a non-interventional study enhances the attention
      paid to safe use and handling of the product as well as increase knowledge about optimal
      adverse event (AE) management substantially.

      A detailed record of the medical history including. co-morbidities and pre-treatment regimens
      will allow analysis of the impact there of on tolerability, dosage and efficacy.

      Beside the collection of data on efficacy and tolerability this observational drug
      utilization study could give insight into the clinical practice and the routine use of
      Pomalidomide.
