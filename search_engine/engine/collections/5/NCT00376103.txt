      undergoing initial surgical resection will be candidates for this study. Eligible patients
      will undergo surgical resection within 30 days of diagnosis.

      Newly diagnosed patients with presumed diagnosis of GBM will undergo surgery for maximal
      resection. After frozen section diagnosis of GBM is confirmed, the GliaSite® will be placed
      into the tumor cavity.

      After the patient recovers from surgery, radiation therapy (60 Gy to 1 cm) is delivered via
      the GliaSite®. Radiation therapy with the GliaSite® will be initiated within 21 days after
      surgery. Concomitant temozolomide (75 mg/m2/d) is started 2 days prior to radiation therapy
      with the GliaSite® and continued for a total of 7 days.

      Within 21 days following radiation therapy with the GliaSite®, external beam radiation
      therapy (60 Gy in 30 fractions) will be initiated. Concomitant temozolomide (75 mg/m2/d) will
      start on day 1 of external beam radiation therapy and continue through the external beam
      radiation therapy interval, ending with the last day of radiation.

      Four weeks (+/- 2 days) after completion of external beam radiation therapy, temozolomide
      (150 mg/m2/d) for 5 days every 28 days will be initiated for one cycle.

      At the start of cycle 2, the dose will be escalated to 200 mg/m2/d, if the CTC
      non-hematological toxicity for cycle 1 is Grade < 2 (except for alopecia, nausea and
      vomiting).

      This will continue for up to a total of 12 cycles, unless disease progression or severe
      myelosuppression is noted.
