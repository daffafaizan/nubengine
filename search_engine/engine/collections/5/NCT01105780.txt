    
      This is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither physician nor
      participant knows the name of the assigned drug), placebo-controlled, parallel group, single
      dose study in male and female Caucasian and male Japanese participants. The purpose of this
      study is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD)
      study in healthy male and female caucasian and male Japanese participants. For each
      participant, the study will consist of a screening examination (within 28 days of first dose
      on Day 1), a single period of open label treatment (all people involved know the identity of
      the intervention) upon entry in the study and discharge on Day 3), and a final, follow-up
      examination between 7-10 days after discharge from the study. Safety assessments include
      monitoring of adverse events, and evaluation of lab results, cardiac parameters, vital signs,
      and physical exams. Participants receive study medication (JNJ-41443532 or placebo) by mouth
      on Day 1 after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours; planned dose is 250 mg.
