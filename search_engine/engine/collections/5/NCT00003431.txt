      with hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer prior to surgical resection.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive flt3 ligand subcutaneously for 14 days followed by 14 days of rest.
      This course of therapy may be repeated for a total of 3 courses. Leukapheresis is performed
      on day 15 of the last course of Flt3 ligand. Patients undergo restaging and metastasis
      resection. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for the
      second year, and yearly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 12 patients in 1 year.
