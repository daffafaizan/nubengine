      participants daily suggestions for 14 days on how to improve relational and mental well-being
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. A sample of 1765 adults residing in the United States
      participated in the study and were assigned to control or intervention conditions. To measure
      outcomes, all participants received a daily text message to their smartphones every evening
      for 28 days linking to a survey on relational and mental well-being. Participants also
      received a survey link on Days 56 and 72. Intervention participants received additional text
      messages in the mornings of Days 7 - 22 presenting the intervention suggestions.
