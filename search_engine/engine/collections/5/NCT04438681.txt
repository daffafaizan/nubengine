      plasma proteins in order to assess their ability to predict metastatic relapse of triple
      negative breast cancer. A plasma protein profile could be an interesting biomarker since it
      is easily accessible and quantifiable.

      The investigators also propose to search relation between metastatic relapse in TNBC and
      other biomarkers or potential biomarkers such as Tumor-infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs),
      figurative blood components and circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA).

      Finally, they also want to validate a TNBC RNA signature, established at Jean PERRIN Center,
      by analyzing the RNA expression of 8 genes.

      Before treatment begins, the patient will take an initial blood sample. A second blood sample
      will be taken on the day of the first surgery or the day of the surgery post chemotherapy. A
      third blood sample will be done on the day of the beginning of the radiotherapy. A 4th and a
      5th blood sample will be done at 6 months and 1 year respectively after the end of the
      radiotherapy. A part of these blood samples will be used for the quantification of
      circulating proteins, for the determination of the blood's figurative elements and for the
      quantification of circulating tumour DNA.
