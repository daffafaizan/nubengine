           effect) after chemoradiotherapy of a metastatic site in metastatic small cell lung
           cancer patients.

        2. To induce the efficacy (effectiveness) of a new combination of therapy,
           chemoradiotherapy and thymalfasin for heavily pretreated, metastatic small cell lung
           cancer patients;

        3. To explore the role of PET/CT scanning to assess tumor response/abscopal effect.

      Eligible are patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer who have achieved stable disease
      or have disease progression after systemic therapy (surgery or definitive chemoradiotherapy)
      and have at least three separate measurable sites of metastatic lesions. Extent of metastatic
      disease is recorded both at CT and PET/CT scanning. Radiation is given during combined
      therapy to one of the lesions, 35Gy in 10 fractions over a two week interval, conformally to
      maximally spare normal tissue or organ. Thymalfasin treatment is given twice a week with an
      interval of 3-4 days each week. At day 22 radiation is re-started and the same radiation dose
      is delivered to a second metastatic site, again with thymalfasin. Abscopal response is
      evaluated by assessing clinical and PET/CT response in the non-irradiated measurable
      metastatic sites. A Phase II clinical trial based on an optimum two-stage Phase II Simon
      design is used to conduct this pilot study. Ten patients will be treated in Stage one; if
      there are no abscopal responses, the trial will be terminated. If there are one or more
      abscopal responses in Stage One, the trial will proceed to enroll an additional 19 patients.
