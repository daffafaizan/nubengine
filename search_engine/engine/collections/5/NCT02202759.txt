      tumors in people who have metastatic or recurrent gastric or gastroesophageal junction
      malignancies expressing guanylyl cyclase C (GCC). Participants will be analyzed in cohorts
      based on GCC expression: low=combined H-score 10-109, intermediate=combined H-score 110-249,
      high=combined IHC H-score >250. This study will assess tumor size reduction in patients who
      are administered MLN0264.

      The study enrolled 38 patients. All participants will be administered MLN0264 at 1.8 mg/kg as
      a single, 30-minute, intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 of each 3-week treatment cycle,
      followed by a rest period of 20 days. Participants will continue to receive MLN0264 for up to
      1 year or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 19 months. Participants will make 3 to 6 visits to the clinic per
      treatment cycle, an end-of-treatment visit 30 days after the last dose of study medication,
      and follow-up assessments every 12 weeks until death or 6 months after the last patient
      completes treatment - whichever occurs first.
