      with myocardial depression (MD) as noted on Transthoracic ECHO (TTE) by evidence of wall
      motion abnormalities (WMA) with or without drop in ejection fraction or symptomatic heart
      failure (HF). Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is commonly diagnosed after the onset of HF once
      patients become symptomatic. The investigators intend to study whether early MD can be
      detected by identifying certain levels of plasma catecholamines and whether the level
      correlates with severity of myocardial depression. Identification of early MD changes can
      lead to alteration of management strategies and may help prevent worsening of HF. Highly
      selected patients with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage (SAH) or Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) requiring
      induced hypertension with the use of norepinephrine infusion will be recruited to enroll in
      this pilot study. This group of patients are expected to have high circulating catecholamines
      and are more likely to develop MD. Given the prevalence of TTS in females and elderly, 10
      female patients >50 years admitted to the neuro ICU with diagnosis of either AIS or SAH will
      be enrolled. Patients with history of coronary artery disease, smoking, poorly controlled
      diabetes with HbA1c >8 and uncontrolled hypertension will be excluded. Patients with poor
      ECHO windows will also be excluded. Baseline plasma catecholamine levels, transthoracic
      ECHO(TTE), Troponin T, EKG and BNP will be obtained and will be followed daily through the
      study duration.
