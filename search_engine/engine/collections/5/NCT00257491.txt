    
      This study is designed as an open label study. After a 2-week placebo run-in phase, qualified
      patients will be administered with telmisartan 80mg for 2 weeks, then forcefully titrated to
      telmisartan 80 mg and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg fixed dose combination for 6 weeks. 24 hour
      ABPM will be performed at the end of placebo run-in period (baseline) and after 8 weeks of
      active treatment.

      Study Hypothesis:

      The primary analyses will be the calculation of trough to peak ratios (T/P ratios) for DBP
      and SBP. The T/P ratio will be calculated on the basis of changes in hourly means (related to
      dosing time) from baseline (DeltaHM). Trough is defined as the mean of the last three hours
      of the 24-hour dosing interval. Peak is the greatest reduction in hourly means in hours 2 to
      8 after dosing. Thus, T/P is calculated as T/P = mean(DeltaHM22 - DeltaHM24)/min (DeltaHM2 -
      DeltaHM8).

      Comparison(s):

      To assess trough/peak ratio of once daily Micardis plus by 24 ABPM in patients with mild to
      moderate essential hypertension.
