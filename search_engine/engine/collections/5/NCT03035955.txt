    
      This is a split face, randomized, single blind, single center study. Male and female
      (non-pregnant, non-nursing) subjects, age 18 or greater, with mild to moderate papulopustular
      facial rosacea, with bilateral facial involvement, and no more than two nodules will be
      enrolled. Subjects will be randomized 1:1 by the study coordinator using a standard
      randomization table to receive azelaic acid twice daily on either the left side or the right
      side of the face and no treatment on the other side of the face. Subjects must have a
      positive Demodex folliculorum standardized skin surface biopsy, defined at >5 mites cm at
      Screening/Baseline on at least one of two different SSSB specimens on bilateral sides of the
      face. The SSSB test location will ideally be on the cheek, but may be done in the most
      disease involved area. Subjects will be seen at Screening/Baseline, Week 1 and Week 4.
      Standard topical washout periods will be observed. At each visit, rosacea will be evaluated
      by lesion count, IGA and two Demodex SSSB tests done on each side of the face. Safety will be
      monitored at each visit using the Investigator Skin Irritation Assessment.
