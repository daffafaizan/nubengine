      radiotherapy generates a suffering that, when directed to the spiritual dimension, results in
      spiritual distress. In addition, combined with the presence of this phenomenon can flourish
      during this phase psychological morbidity such as anxiety and depression. In order to face
      this situation, each person uses cognitive and behavioral strategy according to their beliefs
      and their meaning of life (religious / spiritual coping). The use of intercessory prayer,
      where an individual asks a higher being for the benefit of someone seen as receiver, is a
      strategy that can help people cope with the situation of illness and restore your health.
      Prayer is one of these activities in the nursing intervention "spiritual support" (5420)
      proposed by the Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC). a complementary alternative
      therapy is considered and can be used as an adjuvant in radiotherapy. Therefore, the aim of
      this study is to verify that the intercession of prayer cause positive effects on levels of
      spiritual distress, religious coping / spiritual and psychological morbidity (anxiety and
      depression) present in patients with breast cancer radiotherapy. Thus, a clinical trial will
      be used randomized controlled and mascaraed. Intervention group will receive the prayer of
      intercession and control groups (positive and negative) usual care. The data will be analyzed
      using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 20.0 and will be adopted as the
      reference value p <0.05.
