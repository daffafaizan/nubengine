      tightening; a Pilot Study Primary outcome : pore size Secondary outcome : side effect,
      patient satisfaction, global evaluation the patient recieved laser treament once a month for
      3 months and then follow up after last treatment at 1, 3 ,6 month

      Enlarged facial pores is one of the skin signs in photoaging. There are 3 major clinical
      causes of enlarged facial pores: highs sebum excretion, decreased elasticity around pores and
      increased hair follicle volume. Possible causative factors of enlarged facial pores include
      many exogenous and endogenous factors include genetic predisposition, seborrhea and chronic
      ultraviolet light exposure. Picosecond laser are new device which has been used in skin
      rejuvenation. The main mechanism of action is laser induced optical breakdown (LIOB).
