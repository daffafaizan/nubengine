      upper tract TCC (transitional cell carcinoma, comparing the pathological response of tumors
      treated with Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy (gemcitabine and cisplatin) before surgery. There have
      been reported studies of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in the treatment of upper tract TCC, there
      have been no studies to date that include the chemotherapy agents gemcitabine and cisplatin
      that are currently indicated in treating TCC of the bladder in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant
      setting. These agents have been proven to have a better overall safety profile and
      tolerability allowing more patients to complete their regimens. Secondarily, study will
      compare disease free overall survival among patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      and surgery versus surgery alone. This study may elucidate the potential benefit of these
      agents when treating TCC of the upper tracts and may provide a survival advantage in this
      specific patient population as compared to a historical cohort.
