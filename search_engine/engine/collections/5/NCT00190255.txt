      use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). The enzyme CYP2C9 is responsible for
      the elimination of most NSAIDs. Several polymorphisms have been observed in CYP2C9. Of these,
      the CYP2C9*3 allele, found in 12% of caucasian subjects, leads to reduced function of the
      enzyme.

      We hypothesized that individuals carrying this mutation should be at higher risk of
      gastrointestinal bleeding since they display decreased elimination of some NSAIDs.

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the frequency for CYP2C9*3 variant allele
      is increased in subjects using NSAIDs metabolized by CYP2C9 in comparison with subjects under
      NSAIDs not metabolized by this enzyme.

      The study groups consist of 200 patients suffering from gastrointestinal bleeding after
      NSAIDs use, divided in 100 patients using NSAIDs metabolized by CYP2C9 and 100 patients using
      other NSAIDs.
