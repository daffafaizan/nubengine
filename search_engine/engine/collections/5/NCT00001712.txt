      implemented a Universal Precautions policy in November 1987 in an attempt to reduce
      healthcare workers' risks for occupational exposures to bloodborne pathogens. All hospital
      personnel whose jobs entailed potential exposure to patients' blood and body substances were
      required to attend a training session and complete a written examination. Based on data from
      surveys conducted before and twelve months after training in Universal Precautions, the
      frequency of cutaneous exposure to blood decreased by 50% in temporal association with
      implementation of Universal Precautions. Staff at the Clinical Center are required to take a
      refresher course in Universal Precautions annually.

      The prevalence of bloodborne infections is high in Japan; however, Universal Precautions are
      not widely practiced in Japan. This study is designed: 1) to evaluate and compare nurses'
      knowledge of the epidemiology, pathogenesis, occupational risks, and appropriate prevention
      strategies for managing patients infected with bloodborne pathogens in the healthcare setting
      in seven university hospitals in Japan and at the Clinical Center of the National Institutes
      of Health in the US; 2) to compare self-reported levels of compliance with existing infection
      control recommendations designed to limit risk for exposure to bloodborne pathogens in all
      four institutions; 3) to compare self-reported frequencies of cutaneous exposures to blood at
      the four hospitals in the study; and 4) to evaluate the effect of educational intervention on
      nurses perceived compliance with recommendations and on the frequency of self-reported
      exposures to blood.
