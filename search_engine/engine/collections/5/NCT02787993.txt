      (e.g., distress, pain, fatigue), yet these symptoms are not adequately addressed. Cognitive
      behavioral therapy (CBT) protocols designed to teach patients strategies to improve their
      symptom management may be helpful in alleviating multiple symptoms. The efficacy of CBT
      protocols for reducing distinct symptoms in early-stage breast cancer has been shown in
      Western countries; however, the role of CBT protocols for multiple symptoms in late-stage
      cancer is less clear. This study aims to investigate the feasibility and acceptability and
      obtain estimates of efficacy of a novel, cross-cultural multi-symptom (i.e., anxiety and
      depression, pain, fatigue) CBT protocol in advanced breast cancer patients. A randomized
      controlled design will compare patients receiving the CBT protocol to a waitlist control
      condition in both Singapore and United States patients. The goal of this collaborative effort
      is to determine the scalability of the cross- cultural intervention. This IRB protocol only
      represents the Duke US portion of the project; Duke-NUS will obtain their own IRB approvals.
