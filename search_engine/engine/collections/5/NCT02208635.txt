      of either the control, fortified or biofortified study maize for 1 day.

      On day 1, mothers brought their child to the health center before breakfast. All meals were
      extrinsically labeled with a zinc stable isotope (70Zn). Meals on this day were consumed in
      the presence of the research staff. The quantities of nshima or porridge prepared and eaten
      were accurately weighed and duplicate meals were collected for subsequent mineral analyses.

      Between lunch and dinner on day 1 at the Health Center, a blood sample was collected for Hb
      and plasma Zn analyses and, immediately after and through the same needle, a stable isotope
      of zinc was intravenously administered into a forearm vein over 1-2 minutes. The family then
      returned home.

      Morning spot urine samples were collected twice daily starting on day 5 and continuing
      through day 8. Once these collections were finished, the study for this child was complete.

      Dietary Zn was measured from laboratory assays of the duplicate test meals. Fractional
      absorption of Zn (FAZ) was measured by dual isotope tracer ratio methods in urine. Absorbed
      Zn was calculated by multiplying dietary Zn by FAZ.
