      recognition of lung cancer, but also in the evaluation and monitoring of microstructures in
      the lower respiratory tract that are affected by other inflammatory or invasive disease
      processes. Initially, OCT could be used to guide the location of biopsies which would likely
      provide increased specificity to traditional bronchoscopy. However, if the sensitivity and
      specificity of OCT images are comparable to histologic specimens, this technology may in the
      future provide a non-invasive "optical biopsy", which could potentially obviate the need for
      conventional biopsies in patients with high risks for complications, such as bleeding.
