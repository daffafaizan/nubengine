      parents would persuade them to enforce smoking bans inside the home and in other locations. A
      total of 130 parents with children aged 12 months or younger will be recruited. Each group
      (n=65) will complete a baseline and follow up questionnaire. Urine samples from the infants
      will be collected to measure the amount of cotinine, a metabolite of nicotine. The
      parent-report and infant's urinary cotinine measures will be obtained at baseline and at a
      3-month follow up. In the intervention group, parents will be given three counselling
      sessions. For mothers, one being face to face and two telephone counselling and for fathers
      we will conduct three telephone counselling. The control group receives no intervention. Both
      groups will also complete a Fagerstrom test for nicotine dependence.
