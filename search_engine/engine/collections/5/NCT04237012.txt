      intracanalicular dexamethasone insert and patient administered artificial tears prn compared
      to patient administered artificial tears prn (control) in patients with bilateral ocular
      surface dry eye disease. The study is a self-controlled design and includes multiple
      objective, measureable, and quantifiable endpoints to best determine an objective response to
      treatment in patient eyes randomized to either the insert plus prn artificial tears or
      artificial tears prn control. To aid in ensuring best possible masking, DEXTENZA is best
      visualized with blue light and yellow filter and therefore visualization will not be assessed
      until final visit following all measures.
