      infant. Giving an antiviral agent (such as AZT) to the mother and to the newborn could in
      theory decrease the risk of infection to the newborn by reducing the exposure of the fetus to
      maternal virus, or by preventive treatment of the fetus before exposure.

      Patients are enrolled during their pregnancy, between 14 and 34 weeks of gestation. They are
      chosen by random selection to receive AZT or placebo. Treatment continues until labor at
      which time they begin to receive continuous intravenous study drug. Study drug treatment is
      discontinued after the umbilical cord is clamped. AZT is then offered all women as per
      labeled indications for 6 weeks postpartum, while appropriate medical followup is being
      arranged. Mothers who develop an AIDS defining illness or whose CD4+ cell counts decrease to
      less than 200 cells/mm3 during pregnancy are offered open-label drug at that time. The mother
      is followed by her primary obstetrician at an AIDS Clinical Trials Unit (ACTU) or subunit
      facility. The mother may deliver at the ACTU or a non-ACTU site. Treatment of the infant is
      started in the newborn nursery and continues on an outpatient basis. Infants receive the same
      study treatment as the mother for 6 weeks, and are monitored to week 78.
