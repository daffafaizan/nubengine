      I. To evaluate if there is sufficient evidence to continue to the Phase III component by
      evaluating the objective response rate (ORR) with AZD4547 in FGFR-positive patients. (Phase
      II) II. If the study meets the criteria specified in S1400, the study will be amended to
      include a follow-on randomized Phase III trial. (Phase III)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate investigator-assessed progression free survival (IA-PFS) and overall survival
      (OS) in FGFR-positive patients treated with AZD4547. (Phase II) II. To evaluate the duration
      of response (DoR) among FGFR positive patients treated with AZD4547 who achieve a complete
      response (CR) or partial response (PR) (confirmed and unconfirmed) by Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1. (Phase II) III. To evaluate the frequency and severity
      of toxicities associated with AZD4547 in FGFR positive patients. (Phase II)

      TRANSLATIONAL MEDICINE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify additional predictive tumor/blood biomarkers that may modify response or
      define resistance to the AZD4547 beyond the chosen biomarker for biomarker-driven
      sub-studies.

      II. To identify potential resistance biomarkers at disease progression. III. To establish a
      tissue/ blood repository from patients with refractory squamous cell carcinoma (SCCA) of the
      lung.

      OUTLINE: As of 12/18/2015, patients are assigned to Arm I.

      ARM I: Patients receive FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21.
      Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II (CLOSED TO ACCRUAL 12/18/2015): Patients receive docetaxel intravenously (IV) on day
      1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Upon progression, patients may be eligible to re-register to Arm III.

      ARM III: Patients in Arm II eligible for re-registration receive FGFR inhibitor AZD4547 PO
      BID on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, all patients are followed up every 6 months for the
      first 2 years and then at the end of the year 3 from date of sub-study/re-registration.
