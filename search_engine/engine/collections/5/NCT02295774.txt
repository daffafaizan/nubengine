    
      Primary Objective: To evaluate the effect of oral 200 mg Methylene Blue MMX® tablets,
      (administered as 8 x 25 mg), prior to endoscopy, on double-stranded DNA breaks in colonic
      biopsy samples assessed by histone γH2AX analysis, compared to control biopsies collected
      during standard white light colonoscopy without the prior use of Methylene Blue MMX®.

      Secondary Objectives : To evaluate the safety and tolerability of oral Methylene Blue MMX®
      tablets.. To evaluate the staining score for colonoscopy obtained with oral Methylene Blue
      MMX® tablets . Time to reach the caecum during colonoscopy and withdrawal time from caecum to
      exit.
