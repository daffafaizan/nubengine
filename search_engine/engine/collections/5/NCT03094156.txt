      four sequential groups of healthy male and female subjects. Eligible subjects were admitted
      to the Human Pharmacology Unit (UFHBIAL - Portela & Cª, SA) on the day prior to receiving the
      first study medication. Starting in the morning of Day 1 (first dose), subjects received BIA
      6-512/Placebo thrice-daily until the morning of Day 5 (last dose). Concomitantly with the
      morning dose of BIA 6-512/Placebo, on Day 4 a levodopa/benserazide 200/50 mg (Madopar® 250)
      single-dose was administered. On Day 5, a Madopar® 250 single-dose and a entacapone 200 mg
      (Comtan®) single-dose were administered concomitantly with the morning dose of BIA
      6-512/Placebo. In the morning of Day 4 and Day 5, products were administered in fasting of at
      least 8 hours and subjects remained fasted until 2 h post-dose. Subjects were resident in the
      UFH from admission (Day 0) until at least 24 h post last dose (Day 6); then, they were
      discharged and returned for the follow-up visit.
