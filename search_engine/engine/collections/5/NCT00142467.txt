           all 3 study drugs.

        -  During cycle 2 and every cycle thereafter patients will receive; bevacizumab
           intravenously on day one and day 15; gemcitabine intravenously on day 2 and day 16;

        -  The following evaluations will be conducted on day 1 and day 15 of each cycle (once
           every 2 weeks): physical examination, vital signs, medical history, blood tests and
           urine tests.

        -  Tumor measurements done by CT and/or MRI will be repeated at the end of cycle 3 and
           every 2 cycles thereafter.

        -  Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE-MRI) of the liver and
           Perfusions CT scans will also be done on days 10-12 following bevacizumab treatment

        -  Once study treatment is stopped the following evaluations will be performed: physical
           exam, vital signs, blood work, urine tests, CT scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis, and
           tumor measurements by CT or MRI scans.

        -  Follow-up will consist of physical examinations and blood tests every 6 months.
