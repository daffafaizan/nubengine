      videonasoendoscopy and had their vocal emissions recorded before and after the four weeks of
      speech therapy. These individuals were submitted to multidimensional evaluation comprised of
      analysis of images generated by specialized videonasoendoscopy software, analysis of speech
      emissions by perceptual-auditory evaluation and acoustic analysis, and vocal self-assessment.
