    
      AMD11070 is a new chemical entity that inhibits HIV-1 entry by binding specifically and
      reversibly to CXCR4, a coreceptor required by T-tropic virus for membrane fusion and entry
      into cells. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and relative antiretroviral
      activity of AMD11070 in HIV-infected individuals who have demonstrated X4 -tropic virus in
      their plasma. With the ongoing development of other fusion and entry inhibitors and the need
      for alternative treatment options in patients (especially those with multidrug resistant
      virus), the demonstration of activity and safety of AMD11070 represents a potentially
      important advance in antiretroviral therapeutics. This will be the first study that
      determines the therapeutic potential of anti-CXCR4 compounds in HIV-infected patients.

      Note: Study was previously suspended due to non-clinical reports of hepatotoxicity and
      histologic findings. Study has been completed.
