      formulation of GEN-003 for treatment of HSV-2 genital infection.

      Eligible subjects will enter a baseline period to collect anogenital swabs for 28 consecutive
      days prior to randomization. Each subject will receive up to 3 doses at 21 day intervals then
      complete a second set of anogenital swabs for 28 consecutive days after the third dose. Each
      subject will be followed for one year after the third dose.
