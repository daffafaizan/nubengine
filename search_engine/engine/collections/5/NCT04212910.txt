      staging of endometrial cancer. FDG-PET has demonstrated higher sensitivity than MRI in
      detecting nodal involvement and metastatic disease and is currently used in adjunction to
      MRI. Distinct MRI and FDG-PET parameters correlate well with tumor aggressiveness and can and
      have been used as prognostic factors. The Investigators believe that the combination of data
      from these two imaging techniques, from which different derived tumor features can be
      extrapolated, can stratify patients in high-risk and low-risk groups already preoperatively.
      The aim of combined techniques is to collect large amounts of data leveraging advantages of
      both modalities (MR's strengths in local staging and PET's strengths in nodal staging) in a
      single scan from which to extrapolate a preoperative, non-invasive, prognostic model.
