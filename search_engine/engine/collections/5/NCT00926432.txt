      When dealing with specific pathologies, in particular spine disorders, a better understanding
      of the balance could help better treat and prevent late complications. This prospective study
      aims at describing the pathologies of the musculoskeletal system using 3D reconstruction of
      the spine, the pelvis and the inferior limbs with regard to gravity line by patients
      suffering from postural trouble and defining new parameters to assess postural balance
