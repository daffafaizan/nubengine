      [TAU] comparison) improves knowledge of (1) risks associated with opioid self-administration
      (development of tolerance, dangers of concomitant sedative use, taking as prescribed for
      safety), (2) expected pain following ACL reconstruction, (3) accurate pain assessment, (4)
      and weaning from opioid to non-narcotic analgesics.

      There will be one control arm (TAU) and two intervention arms, both of which are
      experimental. Both will receive the ACL-OERP before surgery, and the second arm will also
      receive a "booster" intervention session of the intervention 3 days after surgery.

      In addition, investigators wish to compare the amount of opioid self-administered in the
      intervention groups (vs. TAU comparison) to assess whether this knowledge reduces
      self-administration of opioid. The project will also examine whether the implementation of
      the booster intervention session in the third arm improves these outcomes compared to the
      other intervention arm.
