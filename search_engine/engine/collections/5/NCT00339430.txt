      (KIR) in the natural history of HPV, HCV, and HBV in HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. The
      immune response to viral infection mediated by T lymphocytes is HLA restricted, suggesting
      that HLA class I, and class II might be associated with risk of viral infection, persistence
      and disease progression. Natural killer (NK) cells are a unique group of lymphocytes involved
      in surveillance and killing of foreign or infected cells through a mechanism involving
      recognition of HLA molecules by an extremely diverse set of receptors on the NK cell surface.
      A major group of these receptors are the KIRs. Thus, a relationship between KIR genotype and
      HIV infection is biologically plausible, and requires further investigation in observational
      studies.

      The WIHS study is a prospective study, which may allow us to answer questions relating to the
      role of host HLA and KIR genotype on duration of infection, and the development of
      virus-associated diseases such as cervical cancer (related to HPV infection), and liver
      cancer (HBV and HCV). WIHS is a large, racially and geographically diverse cohort of HIV
      positive (n = 2761), and risk-matched HIV-negative women (n = 942). The large size of the
      cohort will provide substantial statistical power, which is of major importance in any HLA
      association study.
