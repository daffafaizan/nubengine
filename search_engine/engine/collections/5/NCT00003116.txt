        -  Determine the safety and feasibility of using allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor
           cell infusions obtained from normal histocompatible sibling donors for reconstituting
           bone marrow and immunologic function when given after high-dose
           busulfan/cyclophosphamide in patients with a hematologic malignancy.

        -  Determine the efficacy of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Determine the ability to mobilize hematopoietic progenitor cells from normal donors
           given filgrastim (G-CSF) by determining the hematopoietic progenitor cell content of
           allogeneic peripheral blood progenitor cell collections.

        -  Determine the incidence of engraftment failures in these patients.

        -  Determine the incidence of severe acute graft-versus-host disease in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive high-dose oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -8 to -5,
      cyclophosphamide IV twice a day on days -4 and -3, and cyclosporine IV over 6 hours on day -1
      and then 10 hours on day 0 for 2 doses (allogeneic only). Allogeneic peripheral blood
      progenitor cells IV are administered on day 0.

      Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously twice a day beginning 3 hours after
      completion of cell infusion and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed every month for 2 months, every 3 months for 6 months, and then every 6
      months until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued over a 15 month period.
