      sequences.

      Subjects receive 2 singles doses of tamsulosin, once in the absence of mirabegron and once in
      the presence of mirabegron.

      24-hour Cardiovascular (CV) profiles are taken at both baseline days and after the single
      dose of tamsulosin /combination dose in each sequence. Regular blood samples are also taken
      to check for a potential Pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction.
