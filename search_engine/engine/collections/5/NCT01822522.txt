      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib (XL184) (cabozantinib s-malate)
      as a single agent in solid tumor participants with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
      infection and to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions between cabozantinib and
      antiretroviral therapy in persons with HIV infection.

      II. To investigate the effects of therapy on participant immune status and HIV viral load.

      III. To preliminarily assess objective response rates associated with treatment for commonly
      represented tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive cabozantinib s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
