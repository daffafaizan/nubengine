      ganglia function, such as bradykinesia and tremor. Beyond the visibly recognisable motor
      symptoms of Parkinson's disease, the ability to learn a sequence of movements is also
      compromised and poses a significant barrier to effective rehabilitation. In healthy
      individuals, transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex
      during motor task practice has been shown to significantly improve motor learning compared to
      placebo conditions. The present study sought to examine the effect of a single session of
      transcranial direct current stimulation applied over the primary motor cortex in people with
      Parkinson's disease on sequential motor learning performance. Participants learnt two finger
      tapping sequences, with task difficulty indexed by sequence length, and task consolidation
      further examined using a dual-task paradigm. Task related cortical haemodynamic activity was
      recorded using functional near-infrared spectroscopy.
