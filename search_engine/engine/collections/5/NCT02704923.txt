      preventing Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia was conducted in Passo Fundo - RS, south Brazil.
      40 adult patients were included (exploratory stage 2 trial). Interventions were initiated
      until 48 hours of patients were submitted to orotracheal intubation: 2 drops of atropine (eye
      drop) by sublingual way, compared to placebo on the same regimen. Efficacy outcomes were
      pneumonia and death, but safety was also assessed. No difference was observed between the
      placebo and atropine groups in terms of efficacy and safety outcomes. The small sample and a
      significance difference in terms of initiating the interventions (medians: 48h for atropine;
      24h for placebo) may be a conservative bias. This can not exclude a possible benefit of
      atropine that should be better evaluated in a stage 3 trial.
