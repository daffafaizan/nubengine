      I. To determine the efficacy/clinical activity of nivolumab in patients with myelofibrosis
      (MF).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of nivolumab in patients with MF.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore time to response and duration of response. II. To assess changes in symptom
      burden. III. To explore changes in bone marrow fibrosis. IV. To explore changes in Janus
      kinase 2 valine at amino acid position 617 (JAK2V617F) (or other molecular marker) allele
      burden or changes in cytogenetic abnormalities.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive nivolumab intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes once every 2 weeks for 8 doses
      and then once every 12 weeks thereafter. Treatment may continue for up to 4 years in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30, 60, and 100 days.
