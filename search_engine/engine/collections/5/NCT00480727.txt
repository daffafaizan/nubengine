      grips the skull via 4 pins. Pin loosening is a major complication of halo wear. Pin loosening
      is painful and can result in loss of control of the fractures. Treatment is required urgently
      and involves re-siting the pin.

      Comparisons: This study will compare two pin management practises with the aim to determine
      which is optimal to reduce the incidence of complications including pin loosening. Patients
      will be randomly allocated into 2 groups. The control group will receive treatment in
      accordance with current practise at The Alfred, the pins will not be re-tensioned throughout
      the treatment period. The alternative treatment group will have their pins re-tensioned
      fortnightly.
