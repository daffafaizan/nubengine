      Commercial aircrafts have their altitude compensation adjusted to 2500 meter above sea level
      which corresponds to a pressure difference of about 270 hPa. This causes a reduction of the
      partial pressure of oxygen during the flight. Patients with lung disease are especially
      challenged by large walking distances within airports and during their journey. The objective
      of our study is to evaluate the impact of a simulated flight under hyperbaric conditions on
      walking endurance in healthy individuals as well as in COPD Patients with and without
      hypercapnia.

      Method:

      Healthy individuals as well as COPD patients were assessed pre-flight with the following
      measurements:

        1. Arterial blood gas analysis

        2. Lung function test

        3. Lung diffusion test

        4. Hemoglobin level

        5. Six minute walking distance

      During the flight measurements included (measured every 30 minutes until landing):

        1. Heartrate

        2. Oxygen saturation

        3. Borg scale

      Post flight measurements included:

        1. Arterial blood gas analysis

        2. Six minute walking distance

      Intended analysis:

        -  Description of endurance response as a function of COPD disease severity.

        -  Description of endurance response in normocapnic and hypercapnic COPD patients.

        -  Detection of pre-flight predictors that determine flight tolerability and hypoxic
           response.
