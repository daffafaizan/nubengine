    
      The aim of the present double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, randomized, phase
      III clinical trial is to assess the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of Sinupret extract (3
      x 160 mg = 480 mg daily) taken for up to 16-weeks compared with placebo in the treatment of
      chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) in adults. In addition, in an exploratory approach to identify
      potential pharmacological modes of action underlying the expected treatment benefit, the
      anti-inflammatory activity of Sinupret extract will be assessed in a subset of CRS patients.
