      starting at the day of the surgery will decrease the postoperative pain and improve the
      recovery after surgery. It will be given as an supplement to the regular pain treatment with
      acetaminophen and oxycodone that are used in our hospital and compared to a placebo. The
      choice of treatment will be blinded for the patient, the care providers and for the research
      team doing the evaluation.

      The pain level will be collected Before surgery, postoperatively and at 14 Days after surgery
      and by a self reporting form during the first 7 Days. The patients will also report their
      recovery with a modified QoR-15 form. QoR-15 is validated in a Swedish version.

      Magnesium is shown to reduce postoperative pain in some studies that used iv magnesium
      sulphate. For long lasting pain conditions oral magnesium is shown to improve the patients
      well being and decrease their pain in some conditions. Magnesium acts as a mild antagonist at
      the NMDA-receptor. Thus low levels of magnesium is thought to increase the risk of long
      lasting postoperative pain. Therefore there are reason to expect a higher dose of magnesium
      supplement decreases the long lasting post operative pain.
