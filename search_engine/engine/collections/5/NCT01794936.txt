      tactile sensation during laparoscopic procedures by helping the surgeon to identify vascular
      anatomy before it is visible to the eye. The system's sterile doppler probes fit through
      standard 5mm ports. It is simple to use and no special training is required. This study is
      designed to evaluate the use of the VTI (Nashua, NH) 20 megahertz (MHz) Microvascular Doppler
      probe in laparoscopic urological surgery.

      Patients will take a preoperative sexual health inventory for men (SHIM) questionnaire. The
      investigators will then assess presence or absence of arterial and venous blood flow, in
      real-time during surgery. Additionally, the investigators will evaluate the safety of Doppler
      probe use, the surgical margin status on final pathology, and the post-operative erectile
      function of the patients with a followup SHIM questionnaire (to be performed 3 months after
      surgery). Finally, the robotic surgeon will document whether or not our original surgical
      plan was changed or remained the same after the Doppler use.
