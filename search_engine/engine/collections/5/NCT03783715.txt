    
      Patients presenting to the Investigator's Clinic for evaluation and treatment of (upper or
      lower extremity) lymphedema, will be assessed for their suitability (of low risk) for medical
      treatment with ketoprofen. If there are no contra-indications to taking ketoprofen, after
      discussion of FDA warnings, including provision of a written copy of the FDA language to the
      patient, and with the recommendation to discuss with the primary physician-of-record,
      patients will be provided with a prescription for ketoprofen 200 mg daily (one capsule taken
      orally, once daily) or if obtained from a compound pharmacy, ketoprofen 210 mg daily (one
      capsule taken orally, once daily).

      Participation in this study will be offered. Two study visits, at baseline and month 6 are
      required. Measurements (circumferential and skin thickness) and a blood sample will be taken
      at each study visit.

      The investigators will try to determine how ketoprofen affects the body tissue by obtaining
      blood samples and measurements, before starting treatment and at month 6.
