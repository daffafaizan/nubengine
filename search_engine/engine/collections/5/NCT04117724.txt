      non-adherence and analyze the risk factors of non-adherence for patients presenting to
      dermatologic surgery. Patients prescribed antibiotics will be invited to participate in the
      study and appropriate follow up to inquire about antibiotic usage will be conducted.
      Inclusion criteria are 1) Patients with age greater than or equal to 18 who are capable of
      providing informed consent and 2) Patients who have been prescribed antibiotics following
      their visit with a dermatologic surgery department. We plan to examine patients who have
      presented to a dermatologic surgery clinic and were prescribed antibiotics from June 1, 2019
      to June 1, 2021 at the University of Pennsylvania Health System and other Institutional
      Review Board (IRB) approved sites. After obtaining informed consent at their visit to enroll
      in the study, variables of interest will be collected from patients including name, date of
      birth (DOB), gender, visit date, contact information, antibiotic regimen, and 4 question
      survey assessing adherence. Follow up via patient's preferred method of contact will be
      conducted after the patient's intended antibiotic completion date and covariates for
      antibiotic regimens will be recorded including antibiotic type, number of doses, antibiotic
      duration, reason for non-adherence, pills remaining, and number of other medications. All
      data will be collected and stored in a secured REDCap database managed by the Penn
      Dermatologic Surgery Clinical Research Team.
