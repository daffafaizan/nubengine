      achieving hemostasis at the puncture site. the secondary safety endpoints is the incidence of
      minor complications related to method for achieving hemostasis at the puncture site. the
      primary efficacy endpoints are time to hemostasis, time to ambulation and time to discharge.
      the secondary efficacy endpoints are device and procedure success
