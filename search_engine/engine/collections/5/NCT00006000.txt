      and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the quantitative and
      qualitative toxicity of this treatment regimen in terms of organ specificity, time course,
      predictability, and reversibility in this patient population. III. Determine the therapeutic
      response of this treatment regimen in these patients. IV. Evaluate the clinical
      pharmacokinetics and the relationship of kinetics to toxicity and response in this patient
      population treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of SU5416. Patients receive cisplatin IV over 90
      minutes immediately followed by irinotecan IV over 90 minutes and SU5416 IV over 2 hours on
      day 1. Patients receive SU5416 alone on day 4. Patients receive combination chemotherapy
      weekly for 4 weeks and SU5416 twice weekly for 6 weeks. Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive
      escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
