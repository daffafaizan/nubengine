      occurrence of sensitivity associated with office bleaching. For this, 31 patients had their
      anterior superior teeth divided into right and left, according to the sonic activation (AS)
      or not (SS) of the desensitizer. Prior to bleaching, a desensitizing gel containing 5%
      potassium nitrate and 2% sodium fluoride (Desensibilize KF2%, FGM Dental Products,SC, Brazil)
      was applied. Sonic activation was performed with a sonic device (Smart, FGM Dental Products,
      SC, Brazil) at the 170 MHz frequency. A hydrogen peroxide gel (Whiteness HP Maxx, FGM Dental
      Products, SC, Brazil) was used in two whitening sessions. It was also performed, evaluation
      of the presence of cracks in enamel, through transillumination. The color change was verified
      using two color scales and a spectrophotometer. The dental sensitivity was recorded through a
      sensitivity diary answered by the patient, in the period up to 48 hours after each bleaching
      session. The absolute risk of tooth sensitivity was compared using the McNemar test (= 5%).
      The color change was analyzed from the variation of units of scale vita (SGU) and through the
      value of ΔE, which were compared through Student t test (α = 5%).
