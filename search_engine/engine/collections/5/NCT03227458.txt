      fat-free mass (FFM) in response to dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) alone and combined with
      exercise in postmenopausal women. The body of evidence from carefully executed Randomized
      Controlled Studies (RCTs) provides support for DHEA therapy to increase aBMD and FFM in older
      women. Less is known about whether DHEA therapy enhances the effects of exercise on the aging
      musculoskeletal system when an appropriate mechanical stimulus is applied.
