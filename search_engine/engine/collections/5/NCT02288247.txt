    
      The study will be conducted in consecutive periods of open label treatment with enzalutamide
      followed by randomized double-blind treatment with continued enzalutamide or placebo, in
      combination with docetaxel and prednisolone.

      Open Label (Period 1)

      Participants will receive open label treatment with enzalutamide. At week 13, all
      participants will be assessed by prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and imaging. Participants
      with no confirmed PSA response or evidence of radiographic progression will be ineligible for
      participation in Period 2 and will typically have safety follow up; however, Period 1
      treatment may continue for some participants as long as the investigator considers it to be
      of clinical benefit (stopping on initiation of any new antineoplastic therapy). Participants
      with confirmed PSA response will continue Period 1 until disease progression.

      Enrollment to Period 2 will cease after approximately 274 participants have been enrolled or
      182 primary endpoint events have been reached, whichever occurs first. Participants who are
      not randomized into period 2 at this time may continue receiving open label treatment in an
      extension period.

      Randomization (Double Blind) (Period 2)

      Participants with confirmed disease progression on enzalutamide alone who continue to meet
      all eligibility criteria may proceed to randomization. Treatment allocation will be in a 1:1
      ratio, stratified by disease progression in Period 1 to the following treatments:

        -  Enzalutamide with docetaxel and prednisolone

        -  Placebo with docetaxel and prednisolone

      Any ongoing participants in Period 2 at the point of unblinding in the enzalutamide+docetaxel
      arm that are still receiving and benefitting from enzalutamide treatment , will have the
      option to continue treatment via an extension period.
