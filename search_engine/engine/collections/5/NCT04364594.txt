      diagnosis and targeted therapy. Thanks to the experimentation of new therapeutic strategies,
      it becomes more and more evident how some subgroups of patients can benefit from a specific
      treatment, while others would have no benefit.

      Alongside these innovative clinical research techniques, early diagnosis that would lead to
      identifying those at risk of a new disease and new infection is becoming increasingly
      important.

      COVID-19 occurred in China in December 2019 but probably already had an expression in the
      previous months. The number of victims reached its peak in January 2020 with prevalent
      involvement of patients already at risk or with previous physical debilitations. But even
      apparently healthy and young individuals can be affected by infections with a lethal outcome.
      Since January 2020 new cases have been registered all over the world and prevalently in
      Italy. The main way of infection identified is the respiratory tract, but infection through
      conjunctival may not be excluded.

      The main outcome of this research is to investigate the positivity of the COVID-19 virus in
      the conjunctival mucosa to establish a new diagnostic target.

      All patients will receive both the conjunctival swab and nasopharyngeal swab. The
      conjunctival swab will be performed in each eye and both swabs will be inserted into the same
      virus test tube. The swab samples will be sent in the same day to the microbiology laboratory
      for examination by Real Time-PCR.

      The secondary outcome will be to evaluate the possible positivity of the conjunctival swab
      with the degree of systemic impairment. This objective has the purpose of personalized
      medicine.
