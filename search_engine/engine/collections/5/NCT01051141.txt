      audio (~5,700 patients) and will test a developmentally appropriate, tailored intervention.
      Specifically, 900 patients aged 14-20 in the ED who screen positive for problematic alcohol
      use in the past 3 months will be randomized to the combinations of three ED-based conditions:
      1) computer brief intervention-CBI; 2) therapist/intervener delivered brief intervention-IBI;
      or 3) enhanced usual care-EUC. All participants will be randomized to one of two follow-up
      conditions: 1) adapted motivational enhancement therapy-AMET; or 2) enhanced usual care-EUC
      that will take place 3 months post-ED. All participants will receive written information
      regarding community resources; individuals who meet alcohol use disorder criteria will
      additionally receive substance use treatment referrals.

      Recognizing that brief interventions are important, but not necessarily sufficient, for
      change in all adolescents and young adults who misuse alcohol, the primary specific aims of
      the proposed study will determine the independent effectiveness of immediate "on-the-spot"
      ED-based brief intervention conditions, 3-month follow-up brief treatment conditions, and
      combinations of conditions, for decreasing alcohol use and improving health-related outcomes
      (including injury, mental health, and other risk behaviors) at 6- and 12-months follow-up.
