      with the Lido Workset has been important in making adjustments to the Lido Workset to show a
      greater degree of sensitivity in assessing varying degrees of spasticity.

      Healthy control subjects will be used to compare the spasticity data of multiple sclerosis
      subjects with subjects with normal muscle tone to determine the sensitivity of the Lido
      measurements.

      The testing will be performed one time for each patient and will take approximately 25
      minutes. The servo-controlled torque motor system will analyze resistance to passive movement
      of the knee. This testing may be repeated for a group of randomly selected subjects from both
      the MS subjects and control subjects. The testing for this subset of subjects will be done as
      follows: first session, second session one week after the first session, third session three
      weeks after the first session. The total length of time for participation in this study may
      be up to three weeks. This additional testing will be done in order to compare the results
      with the Lido data obtained at similar timepoints from the subjects enrolled in the Cannabis
      for Spasticity in MS study. Each subject will be given the option to participate in the
      extended testing or to decline.
