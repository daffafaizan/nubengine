    
      This is a single-arm open-label phase Ib and phase II clinical study assessing the safety and
      relative efficacy of concurrent talimogene laherparepvec in combination with radiotherapy in
      patients with soft tissue sarcomas. Patients will be treated with neoadjuvant radiation and
      weekly intratumoral injections of talimogene laherparepvec. Weekly injections of talimogene
      laherparepvec will be continued until surgery. Surgery will be performed 4-6 weeks from the
      end of radiation therapy to allow for resolution of acute toxicities per current standard of
      care.
