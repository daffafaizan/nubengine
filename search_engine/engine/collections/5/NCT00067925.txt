      patterns that contribute to the formation of peak bone mass are developed during childhood.
      The IMPACT intervention was designed to increase bone density and ultimately prevent
      osteoporosis during adulthood. IMPACT included physical education, food service, and
      classroom environmental and behavioral components and was delivered by physical education
      (PE) specialists, food service personnel, and classroom teachers.

      A group of 718 sixth grade girls (mean age 11.1) from twelve middle schools in central Texas
      participated in the study. The group was 72% non-Hispanic white, 12% Hispanic, 5% African
      American, and 11% other ethnicity. After baseline measurements were completed in the fall of
      2000, the twelve middle schools were pair-matched based on school characteristics (ethnicity,
      % economically disadvantaged, % girls in athletics) to a control (usual health education
      program) or the IMPACT program. The intervention was implemented for 18 months and consisted
      of three major components: a PE component, which emphasized daily weight-bearing activities
      (WBA); a health lessons component consisting of sixteen behaviorally-based lessons which
      emphasized WBA, calcium-rich foods, and osteoporosis prevention; and a food service
      component.

      Outcome measures included physical properties of the students' heel bones, calcium
      consumption, physical activity, and psychosocial factors believed to be precursors to these
      behaviors. Changes at the school environmental level, such as the number of calcium rich
      foods offered in the cafeteria and the number of opportunities offered for weight-bearing and
      aerobic activity, were also assessed.
