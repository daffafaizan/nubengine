      brain MRI and for whom dexmedetomidine would otherwise be the sedation regimen of choice will
      be eligible for enrollment. The investigators propose to limit the study to patients
      undergoing only brain MRI as these studies are of a predictable length (25-30 minutes);
      therefore the sedation regimen can be more easily standardized. Parents of eligible patients
      would be approached prior to or during the pre-sedation assessment and told about the study
      and, if they agree to enroll, informed consent would be obtained. Assent will be obtained
      from children 7 years of age and greater, if they are otherwise developmentally capable of
      giving assent. The goal is to enroll 50 subjects (25 per treatment group) which would be
      sufficient to detect a 25% or greater difference in the mean maximal heart rate or blood
      pressure decrease from baseline between the 2 groups.

      Following consent, subjects would be randomized to be sedated with either
      midazolam-dexmedetomidine or ketamine-dexmedetomidine and, upon achieving an appropriate
      depth of sedation, undergo their MRI. Monitoring during the MRI and subsequent recovery would
      occur in compliance with the current Norton Children's Hospital Sedation policy.
      Recovery-related behavior would be assessed using the Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium
      Scale.
