    
      The goal of this prospective randomized study is to compare whether there is a clinically
      relevant difference in the rate of first attempt successful intubation between the Ambu King
      Vision Video Laryngoscope and direct laryngoscopy using the Miller Blade Laryngoscope. Other
      parameters of clinical relevance such as grade of laryngeal view, percentage of glottic
      opening, number of insertion attempts, time for successful tracheal intubation, and
      complications will also be assessed.
