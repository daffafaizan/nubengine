      across a variety of contexts. Yet despite the prominence and apparent importance of these
      nonverbal sounds in human communication, the investigators still know very little about their
      influence on human perception and behaviour. That's why, in this study, the investigators
      will examine specifically the influence of nonverbal vocal production on pain tolerance.

      The remainder of the study will involve up to three trials of a pain tolerance (cold pressor)
      task, during which the investigators will ask participants to produce vocalisations (e.g.,
      screams or words) while submerging the participant's hand in bath of circulating cold water.

      The results of the study will contribute to our theoretical understanding of the functions of
      nonverbal vocal communication in humans, in particular the influence of nonverbal vocal
      production (i.e., yelling) on pain tolerance.
