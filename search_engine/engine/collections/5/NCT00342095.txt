    
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is severe, chronic, disabling autoimmune disease that
      significantly affects health status and quality of life. Since the disease occurs most often
      in young to middle-aged adults, SLE can also affect work and disability. However, there is
      currently little information on work-related disability from longitudinal, population-based
      studies of SLE.

      Disease damage will be assessed using the System Lupus international Collaborating Clinics
      (SLICC)/American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Damage Index, a standardized and validated
      instrument that is completed by the patient's physician.

      This study will allow us to determine the feasibility of obtaining reliable data on disease
      damage from more than 50 physicians involved in the treatment of patients in the Carolina
      Lupus Study. This developmental work is a necessary foundation for any additional follow-up
      studies of the Carolina Lupus Study cohort. We will also be able to examine associations with
      disability in patients and in controls and to examine the contribution of various factors to
      the increased disease severity experience by African-American SLE patients.
