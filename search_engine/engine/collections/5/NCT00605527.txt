      accumulation in the air sacs, which leads to low blood oxygen levels and respiratory failure.
      Common causes include pneumonia, sepsis, and lung trauma. Symptoms, including breathing
      difficulty, low blood pressure, and organ failure, usually develop within 24 to 48 hours of
      the original injury or illness. Most patients require immediate care in an intensive care
      unit, and the main form of treatment is mechanical ventilation, which delivers oxygen and a
      continuous level of pressure to the damaged lungs. Although progress has been made in
      understanding how ALI/ARDS develops, it is still unknown why recovery outcomes differ among
      people. Differences in the genetic basis of protein C and fibrinolysis pathways, which both
      play a role in preventing blood clots, may be a factor in determining the severity of and
      recovery from ALI. The purpose of this study is to analyze plasma and DNA from children with
      ALI/ARDS to identify biomarkers and genetic variations that may be related to clinical
      outcomes.

      This study will enroll children who are hospitalized with ALI/ARDS. Participants' medical
      records will be reviewed to gather information about symptoms, physical exam findings,
      mechanical ventilator settings, and laboratory test results. A blood collection will occur on
      Days 1 and 3. Study researchers will analyze plasma biomarkers and use high throughput DNA
      sequencing technology to analyze participants' DNA.
