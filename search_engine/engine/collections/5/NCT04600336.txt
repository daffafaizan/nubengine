      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the effects of two doses of oxybutynin chloride (oxybutynin) on hot flash scores
      relative to placebo.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess study accrual rates and compliance with the therapy. II. To characterize the
      safety and adverse event profile of two doses of oxybutynin in the study population.

      III. To evaluate the consistency of the results across the various methods used to evaluate
      the efficacy of oxybutynin (i.e., hot flash scores versus hot flash frequencies, mean
      differences versus 50% or greater reduction since baseline, single day versus full week to
      define patients' baseline hot flash scores).

      IV. To compare patient-reported quality of life and hot flash interference, as measured by
      the Hot Flash Related Daily Interference Scale (HFRDIS), across arms.

      V. To compare other changes in patient symptoms, as measured by the Symptom Experience
      Questionnaire, across arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 arms in a 2:2:1:1 ratio according to the dynamic
      allocation scheme.

      ARM A: Patients receive low-dose oxybutynin chloride orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days
      8-49 (6 weeks) in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive high-dose oxybutynin chloride PO BID on days 8-49 (6 weeks) in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM C: Patients receive low-dose placebo PO BID on days 8-49 (6 weeks). After 6 weeks,
      patients may cross over to Arm A per physician discretion.

      ARM D: Patients receive high-dose placebo PO BID on days 8-49 (6 weeks). After 6 weeks,
      patients may cross over to Arm B per physician discretion.

      There will be a 6-week follow-up for Arm C and Arm D patients who participate in the optional
      crossover phase.
