      and reduced LV ejection fraction. The clinical benefit of CRT is mediated by LV reverse
      remodelling (decrease in LV end-systolic volume over time). However, 30 to 50 % of these
      patients will not experience LV reverse remodelling following CRT.

      Classical parameters of dyssynchrony obtained by conventional methods of echocardiography
      (including doppler tissue imaging) have a limited value in predicting CRT response.
      Meanwhile, patients with a Left Bundle Branch Block (LBBB) on the electrocardiogram
      experience more frequently LV reverse remodelling than those without a LBBB.

      LBBB is responsible for specific LV contractile abnormalities that can be identified by
      speckle tracking strain echocardiography (early septal contraction, stretching of late
      contraction of the postero-lateral wall). The predictive value of these abnormalities remains
      to be studied.

      Thus, it has been hypothesised that these LBBB-related contractile abnormalities may be
      independent predictors of LV reverse remodelling and outcome following CRT.

      The present observational prospective study aims at identifying echocardiographic parameters
      (based on the LBBB-like contraction of the LV ascertained using new methods of
      echocardiography including speckle tracking strain) that are linked to CRT response and a
      better outcome following CRT.
