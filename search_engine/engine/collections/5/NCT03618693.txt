      with relevant acute postoperative pain. Perioperative analgesic techniques aiming at
      optimizing postoperative analgesia have to be investigated. Optimal postoperative pain
      management is one of the key factors leading to enhanced recovery after surgery. Optimal
      analgesia should aim for optimized patient comfort, fast functional recovery with the fewest
      side effects thus encouraging the DREAMS concept (DRinking, EAting, Mobilizing and Sleeping).

      The perioperative additional use of a spinal single shot analgesia, or a transversus
      abdominis plane block to general anaesthesia are validated options to enhance pain therapy
      compared to systemic analgesia alone. However, if the impact on pain scores has been
      described previously, the impact on the quality of recovery (QoR) is still unclear. Using the
      assessment of QoR allows for a much more objective and broader assessment of the quality of
      the postoperative treatment. Indeed, patient's perioperative experience cannot be only
      focused on pain scores but should involve items like physical independence, patient support,
      comfort, emotion. All these items are included in already validated QoR questionnaires like
      the QoR 15 or QoR 40.

      The rationale behind this randomized, parallel group, single centre, interventional, active
      controlled trial is to assess with the QoR 15questionnaire within 24 hours after surgery the
      quality of recovery of prostatectomy patients treated with 3 different analgesia concepts.
