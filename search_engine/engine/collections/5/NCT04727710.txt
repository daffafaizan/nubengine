      intervention for men undergoing prostatectomy, with input from patients and their partners.
      Three patients who had previously undergone prostatectomy, and had expressed interest in
      participating in future research endeavors, and their partners were recruited to inform the
      design of the intervention. This group of six stakeholders identified the types of distress
      experienced by newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients and their partners, as well as their
      favored intervention approaches. These stakeholders do participate in the intervention or
      control groups in part 2 of this study.

      Researchers used thematic analysis to assess the type of distress identified by stakeholders
      as well as approaches favored by them. They mapped these themes on the available mindfulness
      approaches, identified in their review, to develop an intervention that best captures the
      concerns of prostate cancer survivors and partners.

      Part 2 is the pilot study. Researchers will enroll 20 more couples (men who are planning to
      undergo radical prostatectomy and their partners) to participate in a pilot study of the
      intervention. The pilot study will have 2 cohorts (groups). Half of the couples will be
      randomly assigned to the mindfulness intervention (intervention group) and the other half
      will receive the usual care (control group). All participants in the intervention and control
      groups in part 2 of the study will be analyzed to determine the effects and feasibility of
      the intervention.
