    
      This Phase 1, single-center, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled study
      investigates the safety, tolerability, and PK profile of single and multiple ascending doses
      of intravenous (IV) ETX2514 when administered intravenously alone and in combination with
      sulbactam and/or imipenem/cilastatin in healthy adult participants.

      The study will be conducted in four Parts: A, B, C, and D. Part A will explore the safety and
      tolerability of a single ascending dose (SAD) of IV ETX2514 over 8 cohorts. Part B will
      explore the safety and tolerability of multiple ascending doses (MAD) of IV ETX2514 over 4
      cohorts. Part C will explore the safety and tolerability of IV ETX2514 when administered as a
      single dose in combination with sulbactam (1.0 gram [g]) and/or imipenem/cilastatin (0.5 g)
      to healthy participants over 2 cohorts. Part D will explore the safety and tolerability of
      multiple doses of combined IV ETX2514/sulbactam (1.0 g)/imipenem/cilastatin (0.5 g) to
      healthy participants.
