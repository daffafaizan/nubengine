      Despite the recognized benefits of regular physical activity, older adults remain among the
      most inactive segments of the U.S. population. A number of studies have demonstrated the
      health impact and resultant reduction in chronic disease risk achieved by improving physical
      activity patterns. Effective telephone-based counseling approaches for promoting and
      sustaining regular physical activity among older adults have been developed and validated.
      Such mediated interventions provide a level of individual tailoring and ongoing support to
      long-term adherence, while allowing for ongoing program delivery that is more flexible,
      convenient, and potentially lower-cost than face-to face program delivery formats.
      Telephone-based delivery format also allows for potentially greater reach into segments of
      the older population that may find it difficult or unappealing to come to community settings
      on a regular basis.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      A 12-month randomized trial in which women and men ages 50 years and above living in the San
      Francisco Bay area who meet medical and physical activity criteria, following a baseline
      evaluation, be randomized to one of three study arms: telephone-supervised, home-based
      physical activity instruction via a trained health educator; telephone-supervised, home-based
      physical activity instruction via a supervised peer facilitator; or an attention-control arm
      consisting of health educator-based telephone delivery of non-physical activity oriented
      health information and support. All subjects will have a follow-up evaluation at 6 and 12
      months.
