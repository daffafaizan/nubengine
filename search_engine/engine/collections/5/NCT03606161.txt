      I. Determine feasibility of conducting 10 sessions of navigated repetitive transcranial
      magnetic stimulation (nrTMS) during the post-surgical rehabilitation time period.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Explore the effects of the nrTMS training program on motor recovery. II. Explore changes
      in cortical activity: electroencephalographic (EEG) activity including event-related
      potentials (ERPs) and motor evoked potentials (MEPs) will be assessed from baseline to end of
      treatment (EOT).

      OUTLINE:

      Between 1-7 days after standard of care surgery, participants undergo 10 nrTMS sessions over
      30 minutes each over 3 weeks.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 3 months.
