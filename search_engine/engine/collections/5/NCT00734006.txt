      low-amplitude transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in healthy human subjects during
      wakefulness and during drug-induced responsive sedation and unresponsive sedation.
      Simultaneously, high-density electroencephalography (Hd-EEG) will be recorded to evaluate the
      temporal and spatial characteristics of evoked responses and induced rhythms over the cortex.
