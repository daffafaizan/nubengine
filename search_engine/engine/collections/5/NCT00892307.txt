      as coronary anatomy. The results derived from these scans will be compared to standard SPECT
      imaging.

      To further evaluate obstruction in the coronary arteries, physicians may refer for an
      invasive Coronary Angiogram, the current gold standard for diagnosis of Coronary Artery
      Disease (CAD). By validating the DSCT scanner as a system with which to assess the extent of
      obstruction in the coronary arteries, physicians may be able to lessen the occurrence of an
      invasive exam.

      Procedures: Each pilot anticipates enrolling 20 subjects.

      Pilot 1: Clinical Follow-up Rest/Stress Adeno-SPECT and Research Stress /Rest Adeno-DSCT
      obtained in the same patient during the same period of stress testing

        -  Radiation: Thallium injection for rest SPECT

        -  Drug: Single dose Adenosine Infusion for DSCT and SPECT

        -  Radiation: Sestamibi injection for stress SPECT

        -  Drug: CT contrast

        -  Radiation: Stress DSCT /Rest DSCT

      Pilot 2: Research Stress/ Rest Adeno-DSCT obtained within 30 days of initial positive SPECT
      finding

        -  Drug: Adenosine Infusion for DSCT

        -  Drug: CT contrast

        -  Radiation: Stress DSCT /Rest DSCT

      Both pilot studies will relate results to subject history, ECG and cardiac angiogram, if
      available
