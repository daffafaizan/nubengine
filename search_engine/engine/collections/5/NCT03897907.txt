      complete the randomized intervention immediately after completing baseline testing.
      Post-intervention testing will also be completed immediately after the randomized
      intervention. A follow-up REDcap survey will be sent by email to assess function and pain at
      2 weeks, 6 weeks and 3 months.

      Intervention Psychologically Informed Education Group Psychologically Informed Education
      Medium There are many ways to provide patient education, but the investigators believe that
      adolescents will respond well to video education on a tablet. Adolescents are extremely
      comfortable with this technology, and the video will allow for standardized education among
      all participants.

      Development of Psychologically Informed Education for adolescents with AKP Recommended adult
      pain science education will be modified using published recommendations for the adolescent
      population and tailored to anterior knee pain.(Robins, Perron, Heathcote, & Simons, 2016) The
      education session will teach participants how the body processes nociception and experiences
      pain, and pain does not mean tissues are being damaged. Additionally the psychologically
      informed education video will use the framework called the "Common Sense Model of
      Self-Regulation" which advocates for education to address five cognitive dimensions: (1)
      identity (the effort to evaluate symptoms and label the illness); (2) cause (the subjectively
      formulated belief of what is causing the symptoms); (3) time-line (the patient's perception
      of how long the problem will last); (4) consequences (the patient's predictions of how the
      illness will affect them in different areas of their life); and (5) controllability (the
      patient's belief regarding their outcome and personal ability to change it).(Leventhal,
      Phillips, & Burns, 2016) Control Group Participants in the control education group will watch
      a video on the iPad equal in length to the psychologically informed education video. The
      control video will discuss basic anatomy of the knee and provide no psychosocial education or
      positive reinforcement about their condition.
