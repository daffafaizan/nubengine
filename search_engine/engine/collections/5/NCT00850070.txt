      might ameliorate core symptoms of autism at least in young (under age 6) subjects. However,
      those studies had somewhat questionable methodologies, a major one being that the doses of
      sapropterin used were roughly one tenth that thought to be needed to provide physiologically
      meaningful increases of sapropterin in the central nervous system (CNS). This study will look
      at the impact of a sustained exposure to this higher dose in well-diagnosed young children
      with autism.
