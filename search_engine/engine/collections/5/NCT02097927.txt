      sensory-enhanced beverage on energy intake through ad libitum food consumption and subjective
      feeling of appetite using visual analogue scales (VAS) compared to 2 control beverages
      following repeated exposures. Each participant will consume each beverage 10 times. This
      includes 2 satiety-testing sessions on site at Leatherhead Food Research, and 8 occasions
      consuming the product as a mid-morning snack during the participants' normal routine. Each
      participant will attend the Nutrition Unit on 6 different occasions (plus one screening
      visit) before and after repeated exposures to the beverages at home. The order in which
      participants receive the beverages will be counterbalanced and randomised. There will be a
      two-week washout period in which none of the beverages are consumed between the different
      beverage manipulations. Participants will fast overnight before each visit and consume the
      same evening meal before each test day. Participants will be instructed to avoid consuming
      food or calorific beverages for one hour before or after consuming the beverage. Following
      the last satiety testing day participants will be debriefed and open questions will be asked
      about experiences of the beverages in a focus group format.
