      on national development strategies planning. Improving secondary prevention will strongly
      promote stroke management in the rapid developing phase of Chinese economy and expansion of
      health situation. At present lack of high-quality medical resources, low medical permeability
      cannot remedy extensive prevention failure of stroke. Mobile healthcare is easier to conduct
      and still in the early stage of explosive growth. This research group has established an open
      management platform of stroke prevention. And collaborate with Peking University Institute of
      Information Technology to develop a smart phone application which can be personalized
      medication reminder, record medication compliance, home blood pressure and blood glucose test
      results, also can provide doctor-patient communication platform and symptoms alarm. The
      investigators want to verify whether mobile application based on stroke strengthen prevention
      management is more effective than traditional management model or open stroke management
      platform. Whole blood-impedance based platelet aggregation(WBA) method and VerifyNow detected
      by aspirin or clopidogrel responsiveness will provide individualized anti-platelet drug
      selection. Control group will be selected from the National Stroke data registration database
      platform and open platform for stroke prevention. Follow-up period is 2 years. Endpoint event
      is defined as stroke death or relapse. Primary measure outcomes are change of the stroke
      recurrence rate and mortality after secondary prevention.
