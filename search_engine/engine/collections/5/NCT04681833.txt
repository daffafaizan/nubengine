    
      Advaccine Clinical Research is developing a recombinant Respiratory Syncytial Virus (rRSV)
      vaccine - BARS13 for the protection of children (6 months to 5 years old) and the elderly
      from RSV infection.

      This is a two centre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in healthy adults
      aged 60-80 years old to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the rRSV investigational
      vaccine, BARS13.

      This study will be conducted in two centres in Australia with CMAX as the coordinating site.

      Vaccinations for all participants will occur before local Australian RSV peak season
      (winter/early spring). A total of up to 120 eligible participants will be enrolled
      administered by IM injection to the deltoid region of the arm. Cohort 1 (low repeat dose)
      includes one dose of 10micrograms of the vaccine on one arm and one dose of placebo on the
      other arm given sequentially on Day 1 and 29. Cohort 2 (high repeat dose) includes one dose
      of 10micrograms of the vaccine on each arm given sequentially on Day 1 and 29. Cohort 3 (high
      repeat multiple dose) includes one dose of 10microgarms of vaccine to each arm sequentially
      on Day 1, 29 and 57.
