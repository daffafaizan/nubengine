      included to assess safety and feasibility. The first six patients enrolled will be monitored
      weekly for safety during two treatment cycles (4 weeks) for adverse events to assure there
      are no unexpected or prohibitive toxicities. If safety signals emerge from this group of
      patients, the protocol may be discontinued or modified.
