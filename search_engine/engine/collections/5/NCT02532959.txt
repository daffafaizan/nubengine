      The collection devices are clean and intended for single-use. They are manufactured with
      approved medical grade materials. Patients were asked to breath into a single-use, medical
      grade mouthpiece which is connected to the collection bag or tube. The design of the
      collection devices does not allow the patient to rebreathe the exhaled gas sample. Patients
      enrolled in the clinical study were asked to breathe into the breath collection device for 2
      to 4 breaths. Breath collection is completely non-invasive. Breath samples were held for 30
      days and retested at the end of the 30 day period to determine if the VOC profile has changed
      over time.
