      surgical resection for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma can help delineate normal from
      cancerous mucosa. The High resolution microendoscope, developed by our collaborators at Rice
      university, can allow for real time visualization of tissue nuclei. The overall aim of this
      study is to determine if this device can be used to enhance the accuracy of intraoperative
      margin detection during tumor resection for head and neck cancer.

      At the time of tumor resection for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, a wide field
      imaging device will be used to identify suspicious areas. The High resolution device will
      then image representative areas from the tumor, the tumor margin, and normal mucosa. A
      topical dye, proflavin, will be placed on the tissue to enhance the visualization of nuclei
      prior to imaging with the HRME device. Following imaging, biopsies of the imaged areas will
      be taken and submitted for pathology diagnosis. The images of the biopsies will then be
      compared and the device will be evaluated for accuracy of margin detection at the time of
      tumor resection.
