      disorder characterized by symptoms such as dyspnea, chronic Cough, and sputum production
      along with persistent airflow limitation that is not fully Reversible.

      Evidence provided by post hoc analysis of clinical trials and large observational studies
      suggests a beneficial effect of beta-blockers on mortality and exacerbation in mild to
      moderate COPD patients.

      Evidence concerning cardio selective B blockers. Over the past 20 years' non selective B
      blockers have largely been replaced with cardio selective blockers. Cardio selective beta
      blockers such as atenolol and metoprolol are at least 20 times more potent at blocking B-1
      receptors than B-2 receptors. At therapeutic doses the B-1 blocking effect, and therefore the
      risk of bronco constriction, is negligible. In addition there is strong evidence that
      B-blocked cause up-regulation and sensitization of B-receptors.
