      acute antibody-mediated rejection through transcriptomic analysis of peripheral blood in
      patients with ABO blood type incompatibility kidney transplantation at Seoul National
      University Hospital. Through this, a classification model was developed to distinguish
      accommodation and antibody-mediated rejection using peripheral blood marker at the time of
      the protocol biopsy on the 10th day after renal transplantation, and recently reported as a
      new peripheral blood marker-based molecular diagnostic method. On the 10th day after surgery,
      transcriptomic analysis through RNA-seq was performed using samples of peripheral blood from
      18 patients with accommodation and 10 patients with antibody-mediated rejection confirmed by
      protocol biopsy. The candidate genes were validated in the discovery set and another
      independent training set through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
      Finally, a 5-gene classification model including COX7A2L, CD69, CD14, CFD, and FOXJ3 was
      developed through logistic regression analysis.

      To evaluate the diagnostic effectiveness (sensitivity, specificity) for the peripheral blood
      marker-based molecular diagnostic method by prospectively recruiting patients with ABO blood
      type incompatible kidney transplantation is needed. And, it is necessary to evaluate the
      effectiveness of whether the peripheral blood marker-based molecular diagnostic method can
      predict antibody-mediated rejection or accommodation as a result of protocol biopsy that will
      be performed on the 10th day after transplantation - peripheral blood samples collected
      earlier than the 10th day (day 5 and day 7) after ABO blood type incompatible kidney
      transplantation.
