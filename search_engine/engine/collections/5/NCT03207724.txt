      intervention will be interleukin-1-alpha antagonist (Xilonix) in addition to standard
      chemotherapy. The first aim is to assess the safety and identify the maximum tolerated dose
      of Onivyde with 5-fluorouracil/folinic acid in combination with the study agent, Xilonix. The
      study will also create a repository of serum, tissue, and fecal specimens to investigate
      novel biomarkers related to cachexia with pancreatic adenocarcinoma and interleukin-1-alpha
      blockade. Lastly, the study will assess for a correlation between cachexia, activity, and
      PROs on domains of quality of life.
