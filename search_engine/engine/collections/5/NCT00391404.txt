      individually or in combination. Despite the great achievement in improving patient survival,
      these treatments also greatly enhance the adverse effects on the unfortunate children. Our
      research group has recently conducted a pioneer study on the bone mineralization and bone
      mineral density (BMD) study in longterm childhood cancer survivors in local patients who have
      completed anti-cancer treatment for at least five years. This landmark study showed that
      persistent treatment-related adverse effects on skeletal development are common (up to 50%)
      in local long-term survivors of childhood cancers. Thus, it is important during this critical
      period of rapid somatic growth in adolescents and young adults that these cancer survivors
      achieve their peak potential for bone mineralization and strengthening. In this proposed
      study, we investigate with a randomized and controlled study design on the efficacy of a
      second-generation oral bisphosphonate, alendronate, to improve BMD over a 36-week period in
      long-term survivors of childhood cancers in Hong Kong. In addition to alendronate, all
      subjects in the active and control groups will receive alfacalcidol (vitamin D) and calcium
      carbonate throughout the whole study period. The study results will help paediatric
      oncologists to decide on the optimal remedial treatments against osteoporosis in long-term
      cancer survivors.
