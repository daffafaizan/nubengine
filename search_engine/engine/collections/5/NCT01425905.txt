      poses an enormous public health burden. Insulin resistance (IR) is a major physiological
      precursor to T2D. Depressive symptoms are associated with IR in adolescents and adults,
      predict adult-onset T2D, and contribute to increased risk for T2D mortality and morbidity.
      Depressive symptoms theoretically induce IR by promoting stress-induced behaviors (altered
      eating, lowered fitness) and upregulating physiological stress mechanisms (cortisol, NPY).

      Psychotherapy for depression improves IR in adults, but it is unknown if ameliorating
      depressive symptoms prevents progression of IR in adolescents at risk for T2D. The aims of
      this protocol are: 1) to assess the effects of a 6-week cognitive-behavioral (CB) depression
      prevention group (the Blues Program) vs. a 6-week standard-of-care health education (HE)
      group on reducing depressive symptoms and improving IR in adolescent girls at risk for T2D;
      2) to assess the stress-related behavioral and physiological factors that mediate the
      relationship underlying decreases in depressive symptoms and improvements in IR; and 3) to
      test if genotypic variation in NPY is related to severity of depressive symptoms and IR and
      moderates the efficacy of the CB intervention. The proposed study will permit a rigorous test
      of the degree to which depressive symptoms contribute to IR. The Blues Program is brief,
      easy-to-administer, cost-effective, and efficacious for reducing depressive symptoms among
      adolescent girls. If the Blues Program also improves IR, it would have the potential to have
      a major impact on T2D prevention in a considerable subset of youth.
