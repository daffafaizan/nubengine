      with nevirapine (200 mg bid) and rifampicin had sub-therapeutic nevirapine levels (<3.0 mg
      mg/L). In a control group of 38 patients using nevirapine without rifampicin there were no
      sub-therapeutic levels. A dose increase of nevirapine while patients who are receiving that
      rifampicin may be required. Both nevirapine and rifampicin are tepatotoxic agents as are
      other agents used in treatment of HIV or tuberculosis. Using a higher nevirapine may prevent
      the occurrence of sub-therapeutic nevirapine levels, but may also induce more liver toxicity.
      To address these issues, we designed a randomized prospective study to evaluate the safety,
      efficacy and pharmacokinetics of nevirapine 400 mg/day versus 600 mg/day with a two weeks
      lead-in 200 mg/day and 400 mg/day respectively, in TB-HIV co-infected patients who taking
      rifampicin and short-term efficacy and toxicity.
