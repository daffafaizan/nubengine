    
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 3-arm, multi-center,
      parallel-group study with an open-label extension (OLE) period. The study includes a
      Screening Period (of up to 28 days) and a 12-week Double-Blind Period (Day 1 through Day 85)
      for all subjects. Subjects completing the Double-Blind Period through Day 85 will be provided
      the opportunity to continue in the OLE Period of the study to receive treatment through
      approximately one year. Subjects who do not participate in the OLE Period will be followed
      for 84 days in a Safety Follow-up Period.
