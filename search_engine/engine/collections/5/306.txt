74. analytic study of the a- and b-lipoprotein micellar groupsand of nonesterified fatty acids of the plasma in normal pregnancyan analytical study has been made on 39patients, using a chemical method whichallows the simultaneous detailed evaluationof the lipidic and a- and b-liproproteinicfractions of the plasma.  in addition thenon-esterified fatty acids have been titrated,the b-proteins and the uric acid assayed,and numerous indices and deducible ratiosmade from the data obtained.  the existenceof quantitative dyslipidemia has beenproven, starting gradually, especially in the4th-5th month of pregnancy, and most-ly regarding the b-lipoproteins, prevalentlythe slow subfractions, greater increaseof glycerides than phosphatides and cholesterol,but with a non-proportional in-crease of b-proteins (lower proteinic content).it has, moreover, been noted thatthere is a prevalent rise of free cholesterol inthe fraction of b-lipoproteins witha reduction of the total esterification coefficient.the morphological picture of thelipidic rate in pregnancy shows characteristicswhich, according to the authors,are like those to be seen in the lipidic rate ofmale presenility.
