      preparation-to-colonoscopy (PC) interval is one of the important factors. The bowel
      preparation with split-dose PEG (polyethylene glycol) is an obviously uncomfortable process,
      it is usually difficult to ingest PEG in time. Therefore, the investigators conducted a
      prospective randomized control study to evaluate the effectiveness of fixed PC interval for
      satisfactory bowel preparation in the afternoon colonoscopy using mobile phone short message
      service (SMS), which reported that it could increase patient's compliance in other practical
      era
