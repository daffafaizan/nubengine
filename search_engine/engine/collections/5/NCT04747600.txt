    
      Introduction: Pancreatic cystic neoplasms (PCNs) comprise neoplasms with a wide range of
      benign and malignant varieties. The most common include serous cystic neoplasms (SCNs),
      mucinous cystic neoplasms (MCNs), intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs), and solid
      pseudo-papillary neoplasms (SPPNs).

      Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) are
      used to diagnose different PCNs types. The cyst fluid aspiration and analysis is performed in
      difficult differential diagnosis. Frequently, amylase and CEA levels are measured. The choice
      of surgery depends on cyst location and size and includes pancreatico-duodenectomy or distal
      pancreatectomy.

      Objectives: The aim of this study was to evaluate the outcomes after pancreatic surgery when
      adopted as the management of true exocrine epithelial cystic neoplasms.

      Patients and methods: Between June 2014 and January 2018, 63 patients referred to our
      tertiary referral center with diagnosis of true exocrine cystic neoplasms of the pancreas
      accepted for surgery were included in the present prospective cohort study. Patients were
      categorized according to preoperative diagnosis into: serous cystic neoplasms (Group A: 30
      patients), mucinous cystic neoplasms (Group B: 13 patients), intra-papillary mucinous
      neoplasms (Group C: 9 patients), whereas the last 5 patients diagnosed as solid
      pseudo-papillary neoplasms (Group D). Demographic data, perioperative data and univariate
      analysis for malignancy, recurrence and pancreatic fistula were collected and analyzed.
