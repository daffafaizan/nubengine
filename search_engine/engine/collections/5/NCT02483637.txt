      chronic bronchitis. There are two phases to this study. Phase A will enroll up to 12 subjects
      and will treat a single lobe to assess safety, feasibility and histology/immunology. After
      review of the data by the Data Safety Monitoring Board, Phase B of the study would begin. In
      Phase B of the study, Phase A subjects would have their remaining two lobes treated. In
      addition up to 24 subjects will be enrolled and will have all upper and lower lobes treated
      to assess safety, feasibility and immunology.
