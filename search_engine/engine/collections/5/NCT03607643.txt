      signaling pathways, inhibiting angiogenesis, inducing apoptosis, and overcoming chemotherapy
      resistance. In phase I trials, cannabinoids have been shown to enhance the uptake of
      chemotherapy into malignant cells without affecting normal cells. The investigators seeks to
      demonstrate that the combination of chemotherapy with BRCX014 will have a greater anti-tumor
      and anti-proliferative activity when compared to standard of care alone.
