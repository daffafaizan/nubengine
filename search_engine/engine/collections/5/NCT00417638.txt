      indwelling central venous catheter in a closed-loop manner. The system has received 510(k)
      approval from the FDA for use in temperature management in neuro-surgical and cardiac
      patients during surgery and in recovery/intensive care. It has also received European CE mark
      and Australian TGA approval. Animal data in a model of acute myocardial infraction support
      the hypothesis that rapid cooling, prior to acute PCI, may reduce infarct size. Meta-analysis
      of the previous acute MI trials ICE-IT (N = 228; 1:1 randomization, hypothermia : control,
      Innercool Therapies, Inc.) and COOL MI-I (Radiant Medical, Inc) suggests there is a reduction
      in infarct size as measured by 30-day SPECT in the population of patients with anterior MIs
      who were cooled below 35 C prior to PCI.

      This study is designed to investigate the safety, feasibility and efficacy of rapid
      endovascular cooling in the setting of acute PCI in patients with anterior infarctions.
