      chemoembolisation (TACE) as the standard of care. A recent meta-analysis showed that
      radioembolization with beta-emitting Yttrium-90-loaded glass microspheres (TheraSphere速) in
      patients with HCC achieves a median objective response in 79% of cases (range 29-88%) and
      median survival exceeding 15 months has been reported in patients at intermediate stages who
      have been treated with TheraSphere速.

      In patients with HCC at an advanced stage (BCLC-C) the single treatment that has shown a
      statistical advantage on overall survival and disease progression is sorafenib, that provides
      a median survival of 10.7 months. Based on the results reported in literature, the estimated
      median expected survival of patients with advanced HCC treated by TheraSphere速 can be as long
      as 12 months.

      After approval on July 2007 of a treatment protocol of Y-90 for compassionate use by the
      institutional IRB, at the National Cancer Institute of Milan 40 consecutive patients have
      been treated with radioembolization with Yttrium-90 microspheres (Theraspheres速) according to
      the same guidelines of the present prospective phase II protocol. The initial series of 40
      patients treated according to a compassionate use of Y-90 has been instrumental for the
      assessment of the procedure's safety and tolerability. The present study has been targeted to
      60 cases including the fist series of 40 "compassionate" patients, due to their adherence to
      the same inclusion/exclusion criteria of the proposed phase II study.
