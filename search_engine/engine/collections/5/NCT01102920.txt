      sleep. OSAS may affect at least 4% of the men and 2% of the women in middle-age. In Sweden,
      prevalence figures of 200 000 have been reported. The mechanisms behind OSAS is not fully
      explained but functionally impaired upper airways muscles, causing a reduction in tonic and
      phasic contraction during sleep, are proposed one key explanation. The reduced contractions
      cause partial or complete occlusion of airflow, which in turn cause oxygen desaturation and
      sleep fragmentation. Patients commonly report everyday life consequences including loud
      snoring, sleep disturbances, daytime sleepiness, reduced alertness and concentration, and
      involvement in motor vehicle accidents. Between 7% and 70% of patients suffer from depression
      and anxiety (figures vary extensively because of methodological differences in existing
      studies). Due to cardiovascular consequences, OSAS is also linked to hypertension, myocardial
      infarction, and stroke. Approximately 75% of patients with severe OSAS carry overweight.
      First line measures recommended for OSAS are conservative including lifestyle modifications,
      CPAP, and oral appliances. Current state-of-science concludes that CPAP is best possible
      evidence-based treatment. Despite the use of life style modification recommendations in terms
      of physical activity and weight loss in accepted guidelines of OSAS, randomised clinical
      trials supporting these recommendations are rare. Hence, the value of health behaviour
      modifications has yet to be established. Research within this area is therefore of major
      interest and urgency, which has motivated the present study design.
