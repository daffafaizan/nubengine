      I. To evaluate the efficacy of cobimetinib plus atezolizumab (COTEZO) in cohorts of advanced
      rare tumors using objective response rate (ORR) per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine progression-free survival (PFS) on COTEZO in cohorts of advanced rare tumors
      per RECIST v1.1 and immune-related (ir)RECIST.

      II. To determine overall survival (OS) on COTEZO in cohorts of advanced rare tumors.

      III. To determine disease control rate (DCR) and duration of response (DOR) on COTEZO in
      cohorts of advanced rare tumors per RECIST v1.1 and irRECIST.

      IV. To determine objective response rate (ORR) per immune-related RECIST criteria.

      V. To determine safety profile and adverse events encountered by patients with advanced rare
      tumors treated with COTEZO.

      VI. To collect and bank tumor tissue and peripheral blood for future correlative analyses
      from patients with advanced rare tumors treated with COTEZO.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants receive cobimetinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and atezolizumab
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants followed up every 3 months thereafter.
