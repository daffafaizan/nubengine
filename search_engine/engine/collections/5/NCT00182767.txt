      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of ixabepilone when
      combined with pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride (HCl) liposome (pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin hydrochloride) in women with previously treated advanced ovarian epithelial,
      primary peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube cancer or metastatic breast cancer.

      II. To determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients. III. To determine the
      clinical efficacy of this regimen in patients with platinum- and taxane-resistant advanced
      ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal cavity, or fallopian tube cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study of ixabepilone
      followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive ixabepilone intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21-28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for up to 2 years.
