      (MRgFUS) in patients with chronic neuropathic pain whose medicines are not working well. The
      device that will be used to create and send ultrasound waves through the skull is called the
      ExAblate Transcranial system. The ultrasounds waves will precisely target a small part of the
      brain known as the thalamus. Chronic neuropathic pain is a common type of disabling pain that
      affects people.

      Usually, people with chronic neuropathic pain are treated with medicines to control the pain.
      However, these medications may not provide adequate relief of the pain or may be associated
      with undesirable side effects. This study intends to investigate the use of a new technology
      The ExAblate transcranial system for treating patients that are not responding to medications
      and continue to have disabling pain.

      The ExAblate Transcranial system will be used to destroy a small cluster of cells that may be
      causing the study participant's pain . The ExAblate uses ultrasound to heat a small spot in
      the brain. The process of ablation is similar to a magnifying glass that uses light to heat a
      small spot on a piece of paper. Ultrasound passes through the skin and skull and into the
      brain to focus on a spot the study investigator wants to treat.Once the spot is destroyed, it
      cannot grow back.
