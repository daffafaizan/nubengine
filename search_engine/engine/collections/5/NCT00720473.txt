      treatment response in elderly bipolar depressed patients receiving lamotrigine and
      age-matched, non-depressed controls.

      We intend to test these hypotheses:

        1. At least 50% of older subjects with bipolar depression will respond treatment with
           lamotrigine as evidenced by a 50% reduction on the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale
           (MADRS). In addition, treatment with lamotrigine will be safe and well tolerated as
           evidenced by a drop-out rate of less than 10% due to adverse effects.

        2. Compared with healthy age-matched, non-demented, non-depressed controls, subjects with
           geriatric bipolar depression will demonstrate abnormalities in cerebral energy
           metabolism as assessed by elevated levels of glutamate and lactate, and decreased levels
           of NAA, using 1H MRS at 4T.

        3. Successful treatment with lamotrigine in geriatric bipolar depression will result in
           decreases in lactate and glutamate, and elevations in NAA.

        4. Baseline measures of executive functioning and information processing speed (measured by
           performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), Trails A and B and Stroop tests)
           will be impaired in subjects with geriatric bipolar depression compared with healthy
           controls. These measures will improve with successful treatment with lamotrigine and
           correlate with improvements in markers of cerebral energy metabolism (lactate,
           glutamate, NAA).
