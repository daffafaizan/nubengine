      of sarilumab 200 mg SC injection administered to active RA patients. Active RA is defined as
      having a Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) >10.0. All patients will have had an
      inadequate response to MTX (treated with 12.5-20 mg/wk. for at least 3 months) and have had
      no prior exposure to biologic medications for RA. The MTX will be continued throughout the
      trial allowing for dose reduction at the Primary Investigator's discretion due to safety.
      There will be a total of twenty (20) patients enrolled into the trial.
