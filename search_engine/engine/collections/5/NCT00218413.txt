      is an alkaloid that is derived from the tobacco plant responsible for the psychoactive and
      addictive effects of smoking. Immunotherapy may be useful in preventing and treating nicotine
      dependent individuals. NicVAX is a nicotine vaccine, a type of immunotherapy that may be
      effective in smoking cessation and preventing relapse to nicotine. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various dosing levels and dosing frequencies of
      NicVAX in treating nicotine dependent individuals.
