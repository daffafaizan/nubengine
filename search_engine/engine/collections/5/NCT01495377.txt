      procedures and as pain relief in icu-patients when the patient is spontaneously breathing and
      the airway is not secured by endotracheal intubation. In these circumstances inability to
      clear the pharynx by swallowing may increase risk for aspiration.In a previous study ( not
      yet published) we showed that remifentanil induce subjective swallowing difficulties in
      healthy volunteers and the aim of this study is to determine weather remifentanil infusion in
      healthy non-intubated volunteers increase risk for pulmonary aspiration. To assess this
      question we are going to study 14 volunteers who are randomised to receive remifentanil
      infusion with target concentration 3 ng/ml during 60 minutes at one occasion and an equal
      amount of saline at the other. Radioactive Technetium colloid solution is parallelly infused
      through a pliable catheter transnasally. After remifentanil infusion is stopped the
      transnasal catheter is removed and the volunteer is asked to swallow water to clear the
      remaining radioactivity from upper gastrointestinal tract. Thereafter lung scanning with a
      gamma camera is performed. Through which mechanism remifentanil cause swallowing difficulties
      is not known.To determine weather remifentanil induce general muscle weakness in volunteers
      measurements of grip strength using Jamar dynamometer are performed before, during and 15
      minutes after remifentanil infusion.
