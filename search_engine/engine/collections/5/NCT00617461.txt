      dose versus a low (1200mg/day) dose of GEn in subjects with post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) who
      have a history of an inadequate response to gabapentin treatment. The study is a cross-over
      design. Prior to screening subjects are required to have a demonstrated history of an
      inadequate response (as determined by the investigator) to at least 1800 mg/day of
      gabapentin. Prior history of treatment with gabapentin includes current treatment at
      1800mg/day (2 weeks) or prior treatment with ≥1800mg/day (4 weeks). Subjects could also have
      been treated with pregabalin monotherapy (150-300mg/day, ≥4 weeks) and had an inadequate
      response.

      Subjects are treated with gabapentin 1800mg/day during the Baseline Period and are randomized
      if during the Basleline Period they are compliant with gabapentin treatment and have a
      24-hour average pain intensity score ≥4.0 based on an 11-point pain intensity numerical
      rating scale (PI-NRS). Subjects are then randomized to receive gabapentin enacarbil (either
      1200mg/day or 3600mg/day in a 1:1 ratio) for Treatment Period 1 (28 days). Followed by a dose
      of 2400mg/day for 4 days and the alternate fixed dose (either 3600 mg/day or 1200 mg/day) for
      Treatment Period 2 (28 days).
