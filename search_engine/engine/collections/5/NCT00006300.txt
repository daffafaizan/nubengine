      not been well characterized. Thus, in the present study, through a retrospective chart
      review, we document the prevalence of oral complications in AA patients and the risks for
      oral manifestations in a case-control study. Schizophrenic patients represent controls.
      Information includes the following; demographic, clinical and radiographic information for
      cases and controls. Additional data collection for only AA patients includes prior medical
      therapy, CBC and differential, disease duration, new oral manifestations during AA treatment
      and medical treatment response. We determine if systemic clinical features of AA predict oral
      manifestations, and if oral manifestations predict treatment outcomes for AA patients.
      Finally complications following dental treatment are compiled and reviewed to establish
      initial treatment guidelines for these patients.
