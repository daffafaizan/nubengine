      AF. Subjects will undergo percutaneous PEF ablation for pulmonary vein isolation as well as
      cavotricuspid isthmus interruption and other left atrial ablations at the investigator's
      discretion. Subjects will then be followed at 30 days, 75 Â± 15 days, 6 months and 12 months
      for adverse events, recurrence of arrhythmia after a 90 day blanking period and other
      relevant outcome measures.
