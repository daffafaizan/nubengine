      cause of cancer death among U.S. men. 221,000 new cases and 29,000 deaths are expected in
      2003. The incidence of prostate cancer diagnosis is increasing at 3% per year. Prostate
      specific antigen (PSA) screening has resulted in improvements in early diagnosis of prostate
      cancer. However, available treatments all may have a significant negative effect on quality
      of life.

      Studies have implicated a beneficial association between ASA use and a lower risk of other
      types of malignancies, including stomach, esophageal, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer.
      There is significant evidence to suggest that aspirin has a protective effect against
      prostate cancer.
