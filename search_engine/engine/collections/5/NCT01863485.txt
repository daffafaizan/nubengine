      Pharmacokinetics of CM082 tablets in Chinese Patients With Advanced Solid Tumors. After the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or the optimal biological dose is identified, an expansion
      cohort of ~20 advanced renal cell carcinoma patients will be enrolled to further characterize
      the safety and tumor response by CT.
