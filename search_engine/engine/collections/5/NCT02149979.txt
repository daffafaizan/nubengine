      the wound edges until natural healing process ensue and reach a phase, where it is closed and
      can sustain the daily tensile forces.

      The wound closure devices include sutures, staples, tapes, tissue adhesives. The Applied
      Physics group at the Tel Aviv University has developed a Temperature Controlled CO2 Laser
      Soldering system for soft tissue bonding.

      This system includes features that make laser soldering suitable for clinical use. The
      Temperature Controlled Laser Soldering System is composed of CO2 fiberoptic laser device,
      Infrared fiber-optic radiometer, a computerized temperature control program, propriety grip
      device (Clamps) and concentrated Human Albumin as a soldering agent.
