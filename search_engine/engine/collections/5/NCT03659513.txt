      placed on venous-venous extracorporal membrane oxygenation (vv ECMO) to provide a bridge
      during the time when lungs alone cannot provide necessary support. This procedure is gaining
      prominence but it is largely unknown how medications, especially antibiotics, given to the
      patient on ECMO is distributed throughout the body as compared to patients without ECMO.
      Since the serum level of medication determines the biological activity of the drug, it is
      important to know if there is a difference in drug distribution between ECMO and non-ECMO
      patients. The investigator already collected well-established data on several antibiotics on
      non-ECMO as a part of FDA labeling. The study will help to determine if the concentration of
      currently prescribed are sufficient enough to reach their intended concentration in the
      study.
