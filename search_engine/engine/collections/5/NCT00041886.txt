      soft tissue metastases not well controlled by conventional methods of treatment, defined as
      ongoing pain despite maximum pharmacologic interventions, or severe side effects like mental
      status alteration from medication. Prior experience with similar techniques in the liver,
      kidney, heart, bones, prostate, lymph nodes, brain, pancreas, and nerve ganglions has found
      that ablation of a specific volume of tissue with the application of RFA energy is safe and
      effective. We are hopeful that this method of tissue ablation could assist in the difficult
      management of patients with painful lesions. The goal will be to reduce pain, or to reduce
      use of analgesics. Any decrease in strength of opiate used, or in dose equivalent
      same-medication on a per week basis will be considered significant.
