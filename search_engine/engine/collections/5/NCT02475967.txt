      platform for one month during study period. The medical content of the packages will be
      gathered from a multidisciplinary input of both medics (e.g. cardiologists) and paramedics
      (e.g. psychologists).

      E-Learning packages type I: videos with information from caregivers. In these videos, medics
      and paramedics are interviewed to highlight the etiology, pathophysiology and treatment of
      coronary artery disease; the associated comorbidities and the ways to prevent recurrence.

      E-Learning packages type II: videos in which patients are interviewed. Patients can help each
      other to adhere to their treatment plan, by sharing stories from their own experience about
      their illness and the rehabilitation afterwards. Short clips of maximum 2 minutes will be
      provided to study participants.
