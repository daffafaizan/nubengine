      I. To determine if varenicline plus a behavioral intervention consisting of a brief
      clinician-delivered intervention and tobacco quitline follow-up, decreases postsurgical
      complications through 24 weeks after surgery when compared to placebo plus the behavioral
      intervention in lung cancer patients who undergo surgery and are motivated to stop smoking.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare changes from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks after surgery in the patient quality
      of life (Linear Analogue Self-Assessment [LASA]-12) domains between the intervention
      (varenicline) and control group (placebo).

      II. To compare changes from baseline to 6, 12 and 24 weeks after surgery in the patient
      quality of life related domains (LASA) for the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ)-9 and
      Smoking Self Efficacy Questionnaire (SEQ)12 between the intervention and control groups.

      III. To compare the proportion of patients 12 weeks and 24 weeks after surgery who endorse
      ("Was It Worth It") each treatment (intervention versus [vs] control groups).

      IV. To compare post-operative care (as measured by length of hospital and high dependency
      unit stay) between the intervention and control groups.

      V. To compare treatment adherence between the intervention and control groups. VI. To compare
      rates of smoking abstinence between the intervention and control groups as a covariate of the
      primary outcome only.
