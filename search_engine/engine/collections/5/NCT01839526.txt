    
      Patients who meet all eligibility criteria based on screening assessments will be scheduled
      to return to the clinic for assessments of renal function and other disease-related
      parameters, which may be scheduled over one or more clinical investigation visits. The
      clinical investigation visit(s) will be scheduled such that renal and cardiac assessments
      occur after the required medication washout (see exclusion criterion); other procedures may
      be performed either before or after the medication washout, at the discretion of the
      investigator.

      Up to 100 patients will be enrolled in the study, including a minimum of 15 patients in each
      of the following age groups (based on age at screening): 5 to 11 years, 12 to 17 years, and
      18 to 25 years.

      All patients will be encouraged to enroll in the Fabry Registry (NCT00196742) for continued
      follow-up after completion of the study.
