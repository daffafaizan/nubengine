      the patient admitted in intensive care unit for acute hypoxemic respiratory failure. A new
      high flow oxygen delivery system (Fisher and Paykel Health care) has been developed
      (Optiflow). The system used a heated humidifier and heated breathing circuit via a nasal
      interface. High flow nasal therapy (Optiflow) is associated with the generation of
      significant positive airway pressure in healthy volunteers. Positive expiratory pressure may
      have a number of benefits in respiratory failure which include improved ventilation/perfusion
      matching with improved oxygenation, reduced airways resistance and reduced work of breathing.
      Moreover high flow nasal therapy may improve oxygen administration by decreasing oxygen
      dilution, decreasing death space and using high levels of humidification
