      primarily sedative properties, possesses additional anti-arrhythmic properties. So far the
      investigator has found that dexmedetomidine has the ability to prevent or terminate
      arrhythmias like atrial ectopic tachycardia (85% success) and junctional ectopic tachycardia
      (75% success). The most dramatic effect however was observed in the acute termination of
      reentrant SVT with a success rate of > 96%. More importantly we found that dexmedetomidine
      terminates SVT without causing any sinus pause or asystole (frequently seen with adenosine)
      and thus avoiding the feeling of "impending doom". In this study adenosine is being compared
      head to head with dexmedetomidine in a cross over study, for both safety and efficacy when
      given for the termination of SVT in the electrophysiology (EP) lab. Additional EP parameters
      will be measured to elucidate the exact site of dexmedetomidine's mechanism of action.
