      psychology (PP) intervention is associated with greater improvements in blood pressure
      compared to an attention control condition. The pilot trial additionally evaluates the
      efficacy of the PP intervention with respect to psychological well-being,
      hypertension-related health behaviors, autonomic cardiac control, and high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein. Serum blood assays will facilitate exploration of mechanistic indicators
      linking psychological well-being to cardiac functioning.
