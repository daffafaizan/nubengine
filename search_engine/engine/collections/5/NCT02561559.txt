      Radiotherapy.

      The investigators objective is to evaluate rate of local control of treated lesions in
      patients treated with Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) using Volumetric Modulated
      Arc Therapy (VMAT) for lung metastases from soft-tissue sarcomas. Overall and disease free
      survival will be evaluated as secondary endpoints.
