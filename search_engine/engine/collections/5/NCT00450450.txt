    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Compare improvement in event-free survival of patients with hematologic cancer or other
      diseases undergoing filgrastim (G-CSF)-stimulated bone marrow transplantation (BMT) vs
      conventional BMT.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare the incidence and time to engraftment in patients treated with these regimens.

      II. Compare rates of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in patients treated with
      these regimens.

      III. Correlate incidence of acute and chronic GVHD with absolute T-cell numbers, Th1 vs Th2
      profile of T cells, dendritic cell populations, and T-regulatory cell content.

      IV. Assess the impact of G-CSF-stimulated BMT as a stem cell source on hospital stay and
      treatment-related mortality at day 100 in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to risk
      (high vs intermediate vs standard).

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Co-enrolled on COG-ASCT0431 or COG-AAML0531; Patients receive a
      conditioning regimen as defined on that treatment study.

      ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA (ALL): Patients undergo total-body irradiation (TBI) twice daily
      on days -8 to -6. Patients receive thiotepa IV on days -5 and -4 and high-dose
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3 and -2. Some patients with CNS leukemia or very
      high-risk ALL in first complete remission receive cranial radiotherapy.

      ACUTE MYELOID LEUKEMIA, JUVENILE MYELOMONOCYTIC, CHRONIC MYELOGENOUS LEUKEMIA, OR
      MYELODYSPLASTIC SYNDROMES: (myeloid malignancies) Patients receive busulfan IV over 2 hours
      every 6 hours on days -9 to -6 and high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 to
      -2.

      GRAFT-VS-HOST DISEASE (GVHD) PROPHYLAXIS: Co-enrolled on COG-ASCT0431 or COG-AAML0531:
      Patients undergo GVHD prophylaxis as defined on that treatment study.

      ALL: Patients receive tacrolimus IV or orally beginning on day -2 and continuing until day
      42, followed by a taper until day 98. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, and
      6.

      MYELOID MALIGNANCIES: Patients receive cyclosporine IV continuously or orally beginning on
      day -1 and continuing until day 42 or day 50, followed by a taper for 8-16 weeks. Patients
      also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.

      ALLOGENEIC BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION (BMT): Patients are randomized to 1 of 2
      transplantation arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo filgrastim (G-CSF) -stimulated allogeneic BMT on day 0.

      ARM II: Patients undergo conventional allogeneic BMT on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1 year and then annually for
      5-10 years.
