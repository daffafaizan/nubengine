    
      Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the leading cause of blindness in type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (DM)
      patients, as a consequence of impaired blood flow in the retina. Optical coherence tomography
      angiography (OCT-A) is a newly developed, non-invasive, retinal imaging technique that allows
      detection of perfused and non perfused areas of the retina without the injection of dye. This
      OCT-based method permits adequate delineation of the perifoveal vascular network, and allows
      objective identification of microvascular changes, such as capillary dilation or presence of
      microaneurisms. It is also capable to detect paramacular areas of capillary non perfusion
      and/or enlargement of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ), representing an excellent tool for
      assessment of diabetic retinopathy.

      Given that all these features are commonly seen in diabetic patients, the relationship of
      these microvascular changes with systemic factors such as metabolic control or duration of
      the disease still need to be elucidated. Interestingly, further studies are required to
      investigate whether these changes reflect those occurring elsewhere in the body affected by
      diabetic microvascular disease, as the kidneys or the brain. If these relationships were
      demonstrated, early detection of these microvascular changes could lead to modifications in
      the pharmacological management of diabetic patients, as a way to reduce the risk of future
      complications in both the eye and other organs. The aim of this study is to evaluate the role
      of OCT-A in the evaluation of the perifoveal vascular network in type 1 diabetic patients,
      and to investigate the relationship between these OCT-A-derived parameters and demographic
      and clinical factors, as metabolic control and duration of the disease.
