      cognitive training, 4 hours per week, plus aerobic exercise, four 30 minute sessions per
      week. The first 12 weeks involves neurocognitive training, using auditory training exercises
      from Posit Science Brain HQ. The second 12 weeks involves social cognitive training, using
      the Posit Science SocialVille modules. Aerobic exercise occurs as two 30-minute sessions at
      the clinic and two at home weekly. Intensity of aerobic exercise is tailored to maintain an
      individualized target heart rate zone and is monitored by a heart rate recorder. A weekly
      one-hour Bridging Skills Group with other members of the treatment condition is designed to
      aid generalization of training to everyday life situations.
