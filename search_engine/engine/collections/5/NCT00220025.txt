    
      Two groups of patients, having 10% of their body surface area involved with psoriasis
      vulgaris, will receive narrowband phototherapy. One group will have skin type I-IV, or light
      skin and the second group will have dark skin, or type V-VI.

      All patients will receive phototherapy, with narrowband UVB, three times a week for six
      weeks, or a total of 18 treatments. 6mm punch skin biopsies will be done prior to starting
      therapy and at the completion of the study. Clinical assessments and photography will be done
      parallel to the skin biopsies. Results (clinically and histologically) of both groups will be
      compared.
