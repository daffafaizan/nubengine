    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if the combination of pinometostat, at a dose of 54 or 90 mg/m^2/day, and
      azacitidine, at a dose of 75 mg/m^2 daily for 7 days, is safe and tolerable in patients with
      MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia, either in the relapsed/ refractory setting or in those
      who choose not to undergo standard induction therapy in the previously untreated setting.
      (Phase Ib) II. To determine the preliminary efficacy, as determined by overall response rate
      (complete response [CR], complete response with incomplete bone marrow recovery [CRi],
      partial response [PR], and morphologic leukemia-free state [MLFS]), of pinometostat
      administered at the maximum tolerated dose from the phase 1b, combined with azacitidine
      administered at 75 mg/m^2 daily for 7 days, in patients with MLL-rearranged acute myeloid
      leukemia, either in the relapsed/refractory setting or in those who choose not to undergo
      standard induction therapy in the previously untreated setting. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Perform correlative studies to evaluate for on-target effects, cellular differentiation,
      and decreased leukemia cell proliferation in these patients. (Phase Ib and II) II. To observe
      and record anti-tumor activity. (Phase Ib)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase Ib, dose-escalation study of pinometostat followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive pinometostat intravenously (IV) continuously on days 1-28 and azacitidine IV
      over 10-40 minutes or subcutaneously (SC) for 7 of the first 10 days of the cycle. Treatment
      repeats every 28 days for 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.
