      Primary

        -  Compare the disease-free survival rate in women with stage III breast cancer treated
           with adjuvant chemotherapy with vs without darbepoetin alfa.

      Secondary

        -  Compare local recurrence and overall survival in patients receiving these regimens.

        -  Compare toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare quality of life and fatigue frequency in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according the chemotherapy regimen (CEF vs TAC). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive 1 of the following regimens:

             -  Regimen CEF: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV, epirubicin hydrochloride IV, and
                fluorouracil IV on day 1.

             -  Regimen TAC: Patients receive docetaxel IV, doxorubicin hydrochloride IV, and
                cyclophosphamide IV on day 1.

      Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression and
      unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive 1 of the following regimens:

             -  Regimen CEF: Patients receive regimen CEF as in arm I. Patients receive darbepoetin
                alfa if hemoglobin falls to â‰¤ 13.0 g/dL. Darbepoetin alfa is discontinued when
                hemoglobin rises to > 14.0 g/dL.

             -  Regimen TAC: Patients receive TAC as in arm I and darbepoetin alfa as in arm II,
                regimen CEF.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, before each chemotherapy course, at the completion
      of study therapy, and at 6 and 12 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,234 patients will be accrued for this study.
