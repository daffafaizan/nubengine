      treatment for complex congenital heart defects in infancy. Over 40% of children with complex
      heart defects will have neurodevelopmental deficits that persist throughout childhood even
      after a successful surgical procedure in infancy1. These deficits are typically related to
      basic motor perceptual motor or visual motor skills. Problems integrating what is seen
      (visual perceptions) with body movement (motor skills) makes it difficult for children to
      participate in peer play and limits their ability to succeed in school, thereby having a
      significant impact on the child's quality of life.

      Traditional, therapist-delivered rehabilitation programmes to address these delays in
      neurodevelopment have not previously been attempted. It would be difficult to provide direct
      rehabilitation programmes to these patients given that their defects are rare and few
      patients are located within the same geographical area. Home-based, parent-delivered
      rehabilitation programmes have previously been shown to be effective at improving the motor
      skills of school-age children with complex heart defects5. Since a home-based parent
      delivered model would enable the participation of infants regardless of geographic location,
      the feasibility of using such a model for delivering neurodevelopmental rehabilitation should
      be investigated.
