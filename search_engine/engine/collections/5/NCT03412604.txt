      on multiple, individualized multifocal tACS stimulation sessions based on individual PET and
      MRI information in patients with amyloid-positive PET with the hope that this leads to
      microglia activation and decrease in cerebral amyloid and tau depositions in human patients
      with AD.This would have immense translational impact, as gamma tACS is an intervention that
      is portable, does not require expensive hardware, can be widely applied to large numbers of
      patients with AD, as well as, given its favorable side effect profile, even to patients at
      earlier stages of the disease who have cerebral amyloid/tau without clinical symptoms.

      The investigators aim to enroll 10 individuals with AD with evidence of increased cerebral
      amyloid burden on amyloid PET imaging. This would allow for a final sample size of 5-6 fully
      evaluable subjects. Each subject's participation in this study will consist of approximately
      31-35 visits: 1 day for consent and screening procedures, 5-7 days of baseline procedures
      (this includes the PET scans), 20 tACS study visits, and 5-7 days of follow-up assessments.
      Subjects will undergo baseline cognitive assessment, structural and functional MRI
      characterization, PET imaging to assess amyloid burden, tau deposition and level of microglia
      activation, and resting-state EEG measurement. Additionally, subjects will undergo a TMS-EEG
      and a tACS-EEG recording session to assess brain plasticity levels and identify markers of
      response to stimulation. All subjects will subsequently undergo 20 sessions of
      gamma-frequency (40 Hz) tACS. At the end of the 20 sessions, subjects will then repeat the
      baseline assessments over 5-7 visits, including repeat PET imaging to assess for changes in
      amyloid burden, tau deposition, and microglia activation.
