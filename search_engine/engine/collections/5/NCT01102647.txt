    
      A plant sterol supplementation study will be conducted in individuals who are heterozygous
      for phytosterolemia compared to non-carriers. The study will use a double-blind, randomised,
      crossover, placebo-controlled design in which participants will consume 2 treatments
      including 1.6 g of plant sterol pills and a placebo pill, each for 4 weeks. A 4 week washout
      period will separate the two treatment periods. Plant sterol concentrations will be measured
      by gas liquid chromatography and absorption will be measured by the ratio of campesterol to
      lathosterol in plasma. Cholesterol absorption and synthesis will be measured by dual stable
      isotope technique, involving simultaneous administration of 13C-cholesterol and deuterium
      oxide, respectively.
