      Peripheral Arterial Disease (TASC II) statement and the Russian guidelines for limb ischemia
      treatment (2010), reconstructive surgery is preferred for type D lesions. Patients with type
      C lesions can be managed by either stenting or bypass surgery. Despite the fact that
      aorta-femoral reconstructions long-term results are better than the diffuse aorta-iliac
      lesions endovascular treatment results, the surgery risk is significantly higher than the
      endovascular surgery risk regarding criteria of mortality, complications, and return to
      normal activity.

      All reports of iliac arteries stenosis percutaneous angioplasty indicate that the primary
      technical and clinical success rate exceeds 90%. The figure reaches 100% in the case of local
      lesions. The technical success of iliac arteries long occlusions recanalization reaches
      80-85%. Improvement of endovascular equipment designed for the total occlusions treatment
      increases technical success of recanalization. The TASC II materials summarize the several
      large studies results which present the data on the operated segment artery patency at the
      level of 70-81% within 5-8 years of follow up. A large number of authors note the actuality
      of aortic-iliac type C and D segment lesions endovascular treatment recommendations revision
      according to the TASC II.
