      post training groups. Function (fMRI) Imaging will be used to measure changes in cortical and
      sub-cortical responses to a series of affectively controlled visual images, presented during
      scanning. MRI Thermometry Imaging will be used to construct three dimensional temperature
      maps of subjects while performing meditation in the scanner.
