      dramatic declines in morbidity and mortality. However, emerging data suggest that chronically
      infected patients may be aging prematurely, and/or experience increased incidence of
      age-related conditions. These phenomena are poorly understood. The overall goal of the CHAIN
      project is to support the expansion of innovative research on the effects of chronic HIV
      infection, co-morbidities, and aging on the central nervous system (CNS). We propose the
      initiation of a clinical portion to better understand the nature of the aging process in
      HIV-infected patients, with an emphasis on brain disease. This is a pilot, feasibility study
      to inform the design of a larger, prospective cohort study.

      We plan to enroll 20 older HIV-infected patients (more than 50 years old) and 20 younger
      controls (20-40 years old), matched for gender and race/ethnicity. Participants will undergo
      a series of tests, at one comprehensive assessment. Demographic and medical history data will
      be abstracted from the medical record. Each participant will undergo a medical history and
      physical examination, and a battery of tests designed to evaluate neuropsychological
      function, activity, sleep patterns, frailty, emotional well-being and sexual health. These
      will consist of self-administered questionnaires and neuropsychological tests, as detailed in
      the Methods section. Innovative measures will be included such as an activity monitor worn by
      participants, and a Wii balance board to assess standing balance. Participants will be asked
      to keep a diary and wear the activity monitoring device for one month. Plasma and serum
      samples will be collected on one occasion for future testing of potential biomarkers.
