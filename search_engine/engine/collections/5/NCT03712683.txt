      infertile women, there is a controversy regard the treatment of SCH in infertile women .

      There are few published data on the prevalence of SCH and the outcome of treatment of SCH in
      infertile women, many were conducted during IVF cycles . Moreover there are inconsistent
      results in these studies being authors advised to treat SCH before IVF and some other
      articles find out no any benefit regarding treatment with Thyroxine in SCH
