      preoperative planning will be performed in order to determine the reduction, placement and
      choices of implants. After the operation, the accuracy of the reduction and implants choices
      and placements will be verified. The reductions will be evaluated with an angle between the
      diaphysis axis and a line connecting the medial epicondyle with the lateral epicondyle and an
      angle between the diaphysis axis and the articular surface in the coronal plane and distance
      between the anterior diaphysis and the anterior articular surface in the sagittal plane for
      the 3D images of distal humerus. The reproducibility will be evaluated by the differences of
      the parameters between pre- and post-operative images.
