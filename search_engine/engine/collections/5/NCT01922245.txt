      often chronic consequence of stroke, with detrimental effects on patient autonomy and
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL). Although beneficial in some cases, the effectiveness
      of behavioral therapy is often limited, and therefore new complementary treatments must be
      developed in order to improve rehabilitation of post-stroke aphasia.

      In most individuals, language areas in the brain are localized in the left hemisphere. After
      stroke, there is evidence that the brain reorganizes such that either areas close to damaged
      language areas in the Left Hemisphere, or anatomically similar areas in the Right Hemisphere,
      are recruited to perform language tasks.

      Recently, studies have begun to examine the effects of non-invasive brain stimulation on
      aphasia rehabilitation. One such technique is transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS),
      which involves administering weak electrical currents through surface electrodes on the
      scalp. The effects can either stimulate an area, or inhibit an area of the brain. The main
      hypothesis is that stimulating language areas in the Left Hemisphere in conjunction with
      speech language therapy will facilitate reorganization of language-relevant areas of the
      brain, and improve expression.

      The proposed study will compare the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)
      activating language centers in the Left Hemisphere and sham tDCS, in right-handed individuals
      with chronic post-stroke aphasia. This study will provide information on the effects of tDCS,
      in conjunction with speech-language therapy, on aphasia rehabilitation.
