      Pectoral nerve block will be performed by anaesthetist (not blinded) in cardiac
      catheterization laboratory using ultrasound guidance and strict aseptic technique.

      Control group:

      A sham "block" will be performed by anaesthetist in cardiac catheterization laboratory using
      strict aseptic technique.

      Patients of both groups will be monitored by the Cardiologist ( performing the procedure) and
      the Nurse from the monitoring room.

      A minimum period of 15 minutes will be allowed following the block, prior to device
      implantation procedure by cardiologist.

      Numeric rating scale (NRS) will be used for assessment of pain. The assessment will be
      carried out at every 15 minutes from the start of the procedure till the end of the procedure
      (0, 15, 30, 45, 60 minutes etc) and also at specific time points. Numerical rating scale will
      also be assessed when the patient experiences pain at any point and in the recovery room (0,
      15, 30 and if needed, 45, 60 minutes).

      Further post-operative pain scores will be collected at 4 hours and 8 hours post-procedure.
