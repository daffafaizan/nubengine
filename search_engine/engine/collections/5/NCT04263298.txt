      preferred to hormone receptor positive (HR+), human epidermal growth factor receptor-2
      negative (HER2-) MBC, chemotherapy may be reserved as the initial treatment for patients with
      rapid clinical progression, life-threatening visceral metastases, and need for rapidly
      symptom control. Either prolonged chemotherapy or endocrine therapy may be used as
      maintenance after disease control. However, which maintenance strategy is superior in terms
      of delaying disease progression as well as maintaining quality of life (QOL) remains
      uncertain. This phase III trial aims to compare the efficacy and safety of fulvestrant or
      capecitabine as maintenance therapy after first-line chemotherapy in HR+/HER2- MBC.
