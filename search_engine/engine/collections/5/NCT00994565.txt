      with daily activity monitoring and distance counseling. The intervention focuses on lifestyle
      modification and takes 12 months. The study population consists of those volunteering from
      1100 eligible employees from a Finnish insurance company. The primary outcomes are change in
      physical activity measured in MET hours per week, work productivity and sickness absence, and
      health care utilization. Secondary outcomes include various physiological measures.
      Cost-effectiveness analysis will also be performed. The outcomes will be measured by
      questionnaires at baseline, after 6, 12, and 24 months, and sickness absence will be obtained
      from the employer's registers.
