      malignancies,especially in acute lymphocytic leukemia. Recently the anti-CD20 CAR T cells has
      been used in the treatment of relapsed/refractory DLBCL and exhibited good clinical outcomes.

      However, patients treated with CAR-T may face relapse of CD19 or CD20 mutation. Therefore we
      attempt to maintain and relieve patients by sequential therapy of the HSCT and hope to
      combine their advantages.
