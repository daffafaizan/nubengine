      perceptions of their school experiences pre and post cancer diagnosis.

      This study will utilize qualitative interview methods. Potential participants who meet
      inclusion criteria will be approached by the principal investigator to obtain consent and
      assent in accordance with institutional guidelines. Upon giving consent, the child will
      participate in a one-hour audio-taped interview session with the principal investigator. The
      interview session will begin with some general rapport building questions to help the child
      grow comfortable with the interviewer, the interview room, and the interview format. The rest
      of the interview will consist of questions pertaining to the child's school experiences both
      before and during diagnosis and treatment for malignancy. The interview will conclude with
      the child being asked to draw a picture of themselves at school before diagnosis, and of
      themselves at school since being diagnosed. Demographic data will be collected from each
      participant's medical chart pertaining to age, gender, ethnicity, diagnosis, and the type of
      school attended before and after diagnosis and the principal investigator and study staff
      involved in data coding will complete field note entries directly following the conclusion of
      each interview or data coding session (see Appendix V). The participant's involvement in the
      study will end at the conclusion of the interview session.
