      hours and met all creteria for extubation. Patients who needed reintubation for upper aiway
      obstruction, neurological or hemodynamic alteration were excluded. The diaphragm ultrasound
      was performed during spontaneous breathing test or pressure support ventilation trial
      measuring the dipahragmatic excursion (DE) and the diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF)
      whithin 24 hours before extubation. The investigators compared the median values of DE and
      DTF in the group of successfully extubated patients and the group of patients who needed
      reintubation.

      Our study compared the utility of DTF and DE to predict extubation success.
