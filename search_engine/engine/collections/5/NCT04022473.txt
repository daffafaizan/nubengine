    
      Subjects randomized (1:1) to either Bafiertam (monomethyl fumarate) or Tecfidera (dimethyl
      fumarate) will enter a double-blind titration period where they will receive either Bafiertam
      95 mg twice daily (BID) or Tecfidera 120 mg BID for 7 days. Following the titration period,
      they will enter a maintenance period in which they will receive Bafiertam 190 mg BID or
      Tecfidera 240 mg BID for 4 weeks.
