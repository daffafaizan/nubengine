        -  Determine whether prophylactic cranial irradiation improves survival after effective
           locoregional/systemic therapy in patients with stage IIIA or IIIB non-small cell lung
           cancer.

        -  Determine the neuropsychologic impact of this therapy in these patients.

        -  Assess quality of life of patients receiving this therapy.

        -  Determine the impact of this therapy on the incidence of CNS metastases in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease stage (IIIA vs IIIB), histology (non-squamous cell vs squamous cell), and prior
      surgery (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation 5 days a week for 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation.

      Patients are followed 3 months during the first year, every 6 months for 2-3 years and then
      annually thereafter. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at months 6, 12, 24, 36, and
      48.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,058 patients (529 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 36 months.
