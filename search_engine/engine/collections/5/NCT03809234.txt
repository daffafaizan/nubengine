      bio-distribution of the 5-HT3R antagonist ondansetron.

      Specifically:

        1. Intravenous administration of ondansetron is expected to yield low CSF exposure.

        2. Co-administration of ondansetron with intravenous tariquidar, an inhibitor of Pgp efflux
           transporters, will result in increased CSF exposure of ondansetron.
