      frequency. It becomes the evaluation of therapeutic effect and the important monitoring
      indicators of clinical follow-up after surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy. The second
      generation of high-throughput gene sequencing (NGS) is an important means of detecting ctDNA,
      which can detect trace ctDNA from smaller plasma samples. The DNA dynamic monitoring of stage
      II to IIIA non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was performed by the NGS technique to verify
      prognostic predictive effect of ctDNA in stage IIA to IIIA NSCLC patients after operation.
      The lung cancer related genes mutation map and frequency between primary tumors and
      infiltrated regional lymph nodes seems not exactly consistent. In this study, the
      investigators will compare the lung cancer related genes mutation map and frequency between
      primary tumors, bloodstream and infiltrated lymph node by the NGS technique.
