      nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Radiotherapy and surgery are the treatments of choice for recurrent
      NPC. This study aims to compare 3 year overall survival(OS) rate of surgery versus IMRT.A
      stratified-block randomized approach will be used to randomly assign patients into two
      treatment groups after stratification according to N staging (N0 vs non-N0). Patients with
      rNPC will be recruited and randomized into two groups in 1:1 ratio. The primary outcomes will
      be 3 year overall survival(OS), the secondary outcome measures will be PFS,LPFS,RPFS,DMFS,and
      toxicities.Assessment will be performed at baseline and during 3 years post-randomization.
