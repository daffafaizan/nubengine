    
      -  Because no one knows which study option is best, participants will be "randomized" into
           one of two study groups: topical dexamethasone or topical tacrolimus.

        -  Participants will take the medication by mouth rinse four times a day for 5 minutes at a
           time. After rinsing they will spit out the medication and will not be able to eat or
           drink for 15 minutes.

        -  Participants will also take anti-fungal medication (fluconazole) orally once a week.

        -  After two weeks on study treatment, participants will have a blood drawn to monitor
           tacrolimus levels.

        -  After the final treatment (4 weeks), participants will have the following tests and
           procedures: clinical examination; questionnaire; blood tests; oral culture; optional
           tissue biopsy.
