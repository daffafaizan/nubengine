      patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina undergoing cardiac
      catheterization and percutaneous coronary intervention who are at high risk for
      contrast-induced acute kidney injury. The study will investigate the effects of remote
      ischemic preconditioning before cardiac catheterization on rate of contrast induced acute
      kidney injury and novel biomarkers of renal injury/protection within 48hrs of cardiac
      catheterization.
