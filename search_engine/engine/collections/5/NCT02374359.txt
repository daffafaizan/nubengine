      hospital (Neurology department) between January 2010 and September 2013, and who had the
      diagnosis of cryptogenic stroke at discharge. All patients routinely underwent 24-hour ECG
      recording and an echocardiography during the hospitalization. The investigators have a global
      population of 210 patients who met these characteristics.

      The investigators analyze the presence of atrial tachycardia in 24-hour ECG register in
      patients with cryptogenic stroke. The investigators consider atrial tachycardia as four or
      more consecutive atrial ectopic beats.

      The investigators analyze baseline characteristics (cardiovascular risk factors, renal
      function, left atrial size _measured in M mode echocardiography in long paraesternal axis_
      and total number of premature atrial complexes in the 24-hour ECG monitoring.

      The patients are stratified according to the presence or absence of atrial tachycardia in
      24-hour ECG data.

      The investigators follow the clinical events (AF, recurrent stroke or death) of patients from
      the electronical medical data of general physician and the re-hospitalizations for recurrent
      ictus in our hospital (which is the reference hospital of the zone) and mortality during 12
      months.
