      company with an established system for developing such patient-physician feedback programs.
      Participating physicians will ask their patients to participate in the program after
      CerefolinNAC® has been prescribed and provide them with a brochure containing an introduction
      to the program and instructions on how to enroll. Patients self-enroll, take a brief survey
      before starting their CerefolinNAC® prescription, and then two brief follow-up surveys at 6
      weeks and 12 weeks. As patients complete surveys within the study, their physician will
      receive individualized feedback reports outlining their patient's treatment experience and
      progress. Patients will also receive a copy of their own reports, to help encourage them to
      continue taking CerefolinNAC® as directed. Patients will also receive educational materials
      about managing their early memory loss.
