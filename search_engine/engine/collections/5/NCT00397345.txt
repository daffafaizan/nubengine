    
      This is an international, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group study
      to investigate whether a minimum of three doses of TroVax® added to first-line standard of
      care therapy, prolongs the survival of patients with locally advanced or metastatic renal
      clear cell adenocarcinoma.

      The primary endpoint is survival. The study is designed to be pragmatic, limiting additional
      study related investigations to a minimum. Protocol mandated scans and X-rays are limited to
      two time points (baseline and week 26) to permit comparison of the percentage of patients
      with progressive disease at 6 months as a secondary efficacy endpoint. Six months was
      selected based on review of published literature indicating that progressive disease was
      commonly observed by 26 weeks in patients with renal cancer. Endpoints such as tumour
      response by RECIST are considered of secondary importance to survival and will be determined
      by radiological examinations ordered at the discretion of the investigator based on the
      clinical status of the patient and will be based the interpretation of the patient's
      care-team (investigator and local radiologist).

      After signing the study informed consent form and meeting the baseline enrolment criteria
      patients will be assigned by the investigator (their physician) to one of the following
      defined first-line standard of care regimens based on what is best for the patient and
      consistent with local practice:

        1. subcutaneous low dose IL-2

        2. interferon-α (excluding pegylated IFNα)

        3. sunitinib

      TroVax® is administered at a dose of 1E9TCID50/ml in 1ml by injection into the deltoid muscle
      of the upper arm at regular intervals up to 8 weeks apart up to a maximum of 13 doses.
