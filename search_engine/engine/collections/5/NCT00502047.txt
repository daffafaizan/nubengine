      cholesterol (LDL, high risk cholesterol) are the major risk factors for heart disease,
      myocardial infarction and angina pectoris. Moreover, these conditions represent the major
      cause of death in the Western world.

      Of the measures established to reduce blood cholesterol levels, the introduction of
      consumption of dietary fibre is a novelty. The term dietary fibre defines a variety of
      substances that are found in plants and are resistant to digestion by human gastrointestinal
      enzymes.

      The studies performed up until now to determine the effects of fibre on blood lipids have
      demonstrated that consumption of soluble fibre can reduce cholesterol.
