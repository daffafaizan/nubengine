      deceased renal transplant patients regarding oxidative stress and renal function.

      Adult primary graft recipients of deceased renal donors will be randomly assign to treatment
      (NAC) or control group and prospectively evaluated for 90 days. Treatment group will receive
      N-acetylcysteine 600 mg bid po from 0 to 7th postoperative day (PO). Renal function will be
      determined by serum creatinine, Cockroft-Gault estimated GFR (eGFR) at 7th, 15th, 30th, 60th
      and 90th PO and dialysis free Kaplan-Meier estimate curve. Serum levels of thiobarbituric
      acid reactive substances (TBARS), which are markers of lipid peroxidation and oxidative
      stress, will be determined using the thiobarbituric acid assay from 0-7th PO. Statistical
      analysis will be performed using SPSS 16.0.
