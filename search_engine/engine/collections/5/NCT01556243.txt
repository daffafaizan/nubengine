      Primary

        -  To assess the local recurrence (LR) rate with breast-conservation in patients with
           multiple ipsilateral primary breast cancer (MIBC).

      Secondary

        -  To examine the conversion rate to mastectomy secondary to persistent positive margins;
           poor cosmesis within the first year of attempting breast-conservation surgery (BCS) or
           inability to satisfy the radiation dose constraints on the boost to the lumpectomy bed
           of each site of disease.

        -  To assess whether patients who did not undergo re-excision for close margins (< 2 mm)
           have a higher local recurrence (LR) rate than patients for whom negative margins were
           achieved.

        -  To assess patient's perception of cosmesis and incidence of breast lymphedema.

        -  To assess incidence of breast lymphedema

        -  To examine the type and severity of adverse effects of breast conserving surgery and
           radiation for women with multiple ipsilateral primary breast cancer (MIBC).

        -  To examine the radiation-related side effects of whole-breast radiation with a boost to
           1 large or > 1 lumpectomy site.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo breast-conserving surgery (BCS) with all lesions resected to negative
      margins using 1 lumpectomy or 2-3 separate lumpectomy incisions at the discretion of the
      surgeon. Patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy and/or endocrine therapy at the discretion of
      the treating medical oncologist based on tumor characteristics.
