      during the last two decades. Initial experiences showed high rates of hospital mortality,
      reaching up to 75-85% in patients requiring life-sustaining treatments, particularly
      mechanical ventilation. An increasing number of clinical experiences has been reported
      pointing to a significant improvement in survival of these patients. However, it is not clear
      if this results are generalizable to settings with resource constraints. Therefore, the
      purpose of this study is to determine 30 day mortality in cancer patients admitted to the
      intensive care unit in a resource limited setting.

      This study is a prospective cohort of cancer patients admitted to the ICU in which the
      investigators will evaluate the prognostic of cancer patients admitted for a ICU trial or
      treatment in ICU without limitations. This study will not consider any change in the
      treatment plan of the patients. The source of the data will be the clinical records of the
      patients during the admission and the records of the cancer unit. There will be no direct
      contact of the research team with the patients or their family.
