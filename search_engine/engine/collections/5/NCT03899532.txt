      United States. Secondary brain injury caused by the complex interplay of inflammatory
      mediators induced by a primary insult is the major contributing factor for morbidity and
      mortality after TBI. While the primary injury is irreversible, the inflammatory cascade
      leading to the development of the secondary injury may be preventable. As a result, all the
      current research in TBI is focused on preventing initiation of this secondary insult.

      Remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) is a process where normal tissues are subjected to short
      cycles of ischemia and reperfusion, which have been shown to reduce the sequelae of an
      ischemic injury at a remotely injured site. RIC has been shown to improve the outcomes after
      myocardial infarction, sepsis, transplantation, reimplantation, and elective neurologic
      surgery.It is thought to work by releasing endogenous systemic anti-inflammatory mediators
      and humoral factors and by using neural pathways, rendering global protection to the body
      against subsequent ischemic insults in a remote are. This protection provided by RIC has two
      phases, an early (short) phase and a late (prolonged) phase, both of which have proven to be
      effective in reducing ischemic size and improving survival. Multiple animal studies and a
      small randomized clinical trial have shown the protective effect of RIC in patients with TBI.
      The effectiveness of RIC in patients with traumatic brain injury is still under investigation
      not yet established.
