    
      This was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active comparator-controlled,
      parallel-group, multi-center study with variable treatment duration in approximately 900
      patients with relapsing multiple sclorosis (RMS). The maximal treatment duration in the study
      for an individual patient was 2.5 years.

      Eligible patients were randomized to receive either experimental ofatumumab subcutaneous
      (s.c.) injections every 4 weeks or active comparator teriflunomide orally once daily. The
      dose regimen for ofatumumab for this study was a loading dose regimen of 20 mg at Day 1, Day
      7 and Day 14, followed by a maintenance dose regimen of 20 mg administered every 4 weeks
      starting at Week 4. In order to blind for the different formulations, double-dummy masking
      was used i.e. all patients will take injections (containing either active ofatumumab or
      placebo) and oral capsules (containing either active teriflunomide or placebo).
