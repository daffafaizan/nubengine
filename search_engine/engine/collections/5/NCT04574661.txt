      ( 220 mg ) and to compare the effectiveness of Intermittent Occlusion and Static Stretching
      of the lower limb muscle group in preventing the development of exercise induce Muscle
      Soreness. As muscle soreness is very major and basis problem of every individual , specially
      after enrolling into some physical activity .

      First consent form will be given to both male and female participants from 18 to 25 years of
      age and after that PAR-Q Questionnaire will be filled for every individual, so that we will
      check their readiness for the Exercise then all the four Vitals will measured from every
      individual .They will randomly assigned by lottery method to intervention group and control
      group. Both group individuals will be exerted by Warm up for 5 mints, heel raise in 3 sets
      for 10 to 15 mints until we get 4 on RPE scale, by asking to hold dumbbells of 2 kg on both
      of the hands. Rate of perceived exertion (RPE) is calculated by Borg grading scale .Plus, leg
      circumference, ROM of planter and dorsal flexion and numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) will be
      measured for comparison within and between the groups. Again vitals will be monitored.
