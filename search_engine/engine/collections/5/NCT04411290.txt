      patients with solitary or multiple nodules, and US-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) has
      become the gold standard test for detecting thyroid cancer. Moreover, a further US-based risk
      stratification of thyroid nodules with Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System (TI-RADS)
      has been currently proposed for better and easier decision making. However, the presence of
      multiple nodules in the thyroid gland may decrease the diagnostic value of these preoperative
      diagnostic tools. The prevalence of incidental carcinoma identified on the final histological
      examination of the patients who underwent surgery for presumably benign thyroid diseases was
      previously reported to be roughly around 5 to 10%. Most of the previous studies also showed a
      lower risk of carcinoma in multinodular goitre (MNG) compared to solitary thyroid nodule
      (STN). However, some recent surgical series have reported that the risk of thyroid carcinoma
      in benign thyroid diseases is significantly higher than previously reported.

      The purpose of the present study is to detect the accuracy of preoperative cytology and
      US-findings (TI-RADS) and the prevalence of thyroid carcinoma in patients operated for
      thyroid diseases and to discuss all malignancy risk factors in detail along with final
      histopathological report. Cytology-histology discrepant cases will also be further evaluated
      for sampling and interpretation errors, and possible solutions to increase the accuracy of
      preop testing are going to be proposed. The accuracy of the preference of total thyroidectomy
      procedure will be evaluated considering the prevalence of incidental carcinomas diagnosed
      postoperatively, and whether there are variations in the risk of malignancy with respect to
      final pathology of patients will also be discussed in detail.
