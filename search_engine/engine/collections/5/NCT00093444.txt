        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of heat activated doxorubicin HCl liposome when
           combined with radiofrequency ablation in patients with primary or metastatic tumors of
           the liver.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of heat activated doxorubicin HCl liposome.

      Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 30 minutes. Approximately 15 minutes after
      the beginning of the doxorubicin HCl liposome infusion, patients undergo radiofrequency
      ablation with needles inserted into the tumor(s) and heated to the target temperature for
      approximately 12-60 minutes.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of heat activated doxorubicin HCl liposome
      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least
      6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      Patients are followed at 28 days, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2
      years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
