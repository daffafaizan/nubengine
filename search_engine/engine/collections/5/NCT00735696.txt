      stages are associated with poor survival rates, a median survival rate of approximately 3.9
      months if left untreated.

      Angiogenesis is a process for wound healing and restoring blood flow to tissues after injury.
      It is the physiological process involving the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing
      vessels. Angiogenesis may be promoted by growth factors and in diseases such as cancer, where
      growth factors are over expressed, the body loses the ability to maintain a balanced
      angiogenesis. This may embellish the existing supplies of blood; potentially increasing the
      delivery of oxygen and nutrients supplies for cancer growth and survival.

      Ramucirumab is an angiogenesis inhibitor; and is believed to block the promotion of the
      growth factor to form new blood vessels, thus reducing the blood supply to the cancer cells.
