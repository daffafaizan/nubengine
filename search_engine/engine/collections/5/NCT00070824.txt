      measurable physiologic effects that are associated with acupuncture, suggesting the
      possibility of a neurophysiologic explanation. In addition, brain research continues to
      uncover a complex set of endogenous neurologic control systems, such that it has become clear
      that the brain plays a major role in the modulation of pain perception and control. If
      acupuncture can be demonstrated to have a consistent effect on specific areas of the brain,
      it will become possible to explore the potential efficacy of acupuncture based on measurable
      neurophysiologic responses.
