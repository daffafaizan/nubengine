    
      In this blinded, unrandomised trial the investigators would like to investigate the change in
      Cormack and Lehane grade when using both videolaryngoscope (Macintosh videolaryngoscope, Karl
      Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany) and BonfilsÂ® (Karl Storz, Tuttlingen, Germany). They also want to
      record the success of intubation and the time needed until successful endotracheal intubation
      when using this technique as well as complications (trauma to the oral cavity, dental trauma,
      and regurgitation seen by the anaesthesiologist) that may occur. Also saturation (SpO2) at
      the end of the procedure will be noted and adjuncts that are used.
