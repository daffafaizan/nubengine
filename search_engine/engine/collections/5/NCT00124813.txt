      be effective in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM). In this study,
      the researchers have chosen a regimen which can be administered on an outpatient basis.

      After 3-8 cycles of T-CID patients with at least stable disease will be randomized to receive
      thalidomide or thalidomide plus oral idarubicin as maintenance therapy for at least one year
      or until progression.
