      lean body mass and muscle wasting, immunologic compromise, slowed wound healing, and related
      bone loss, all which contribute to increased morbidity, mortality, and prolonged recovery
      from injury. The results of hypermetabolism persist for weeks to months depending on the
      severity of the insult. Massive burns can cause severe catabolism and are an excellent model
      to study the general effects of injury on protein metabolism. Severe burns are characterized
      by dramatic increases in energy utilization and alterations in the metabolism of
      carbohydrates, fat, and protein.

      Insulin treatment improves net protein synthesis in the severely burned, principally through
      improved muscle protein synthesis. Although controversy exist as to whether insulin is
      effective as an anabolic hormone through increasing protein synthesis or decreasing protein
      breakdown, we believe that consideration of the methods and experimental protocols used in
      the various studies bear consideration when evaluating this topic.
