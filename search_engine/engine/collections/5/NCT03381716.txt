      Considering psychosocial factors, treatments, and the outcomes in men versus those in women
      with acute aortic dissection, explored the association of sex with psychosocial
      characteristics and mortality risk. Of 884 patients, 211 (23.9%) were women. The median
      duration of follow-up was 2.9 years (25th -75th percentiles: 1-4 years ).
