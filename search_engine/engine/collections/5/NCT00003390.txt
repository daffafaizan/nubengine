      metastatic renal cell carcinoma. II. Investigate the safety of HMAF given to this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene intravenously for 5 minutes every day
      for 5 consecutive days. Treatment is repeated every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed after every 2 treatment courses.
