    
      Objective: The mission of Human Brain Collection Core (HBCC) is to gain insight into the
      causes and mechanisms of mental disorders.

      Study Population: To be able to conduct this research, we obtain brain and other tissues from
      deceased individuals with and without psychiatric disorders.

      Study Design: This protocol provides the ethical and scientific framework for tissue
      donations through referrals from Offices of the Chief Medical Examiners, hospitals or funeral
      homes. The next of kin are contacted to give permission for brain donation from the deceased.
      Once the tissue is obtained, it is frozen, catalogued and processed for distribution to other
      researchers and for in-house analysis. The HBCC dissects specific brain tissues based on
      request. All collaborations are subject to approval by an oversight committee. Currently,
      HBCC can leverage over 1,000 brains from a variety of psychiatric disorders and
      non-psychiatric subjects.

      Outcome measures: Outcomes vary with specific collaborations, but include characterization of
      DNA, RNA, protein and other brain constituents that provide unique information at the
      molecular level. The data thus obtained are expected to provide new insights into brain
      physiology and the molecular pathology of psychiatric disorders, possibly leading to the
      identification of new therapeutic targets.
