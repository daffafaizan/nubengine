    
      A phase II, multicentre, open-label, randomized two-arm study. Subjects treated in first-line
      with panitumumab and FOLFOX and with wild type RAS mCRC confirmed in liquid biopsies before
      starting second line treatment will be screened for this trial. Only subjects who have
      interrupted panitumumab for < 3 months (panitumumab continuation) will be included.

      Eligible subjects will receive FOLFIRI + panitumumab until disease progression, onset of
      unacceptable drug toxicities, or subject/physician's request to discontinue. A control arm of
      subjects treated with FOLFIRI alone will be included. Subjects will be assigned in a 3:2
      ratio to receive FOLFIRI + panitumumab (Group A) or FOLFIRI alone (Group B). Randomization
      will be stratified by primary tumour location (left vs right). A blood sample will be
      obtained at baseline and at disease progression in order to determine the mutational status
      of RAS/BRAF and other biomarkers.

      Tumour response assessment will be performed by the investigator according to Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) criteria (version 1.1). Subjects will be
      evaluated for tumour response every 8 weeks until documentation of disease progression.
      Responding disease will be confirmed no less than 28 days after the criteria for response are
      first met. Subjects with symptoms suggestive of progressive disease should be evaluated for
      tumour progression at the time the symptoms occur. After second-line treatment
      discontinuation, information on subsequent lines of treatments at the physician discretion
      and survival will be collected in follow-up visits carried out every 12 weeks (Â± 4 weeks)
      until the end of the study (approximately 20 months after the inclusion of the last subject
      in the study).
