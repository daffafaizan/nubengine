      Connecticut. The imaging procedure occurs over a two day period.

      On the first day participants are injected with [123I]ÃŸ CIT, an investigational radioactive
      material that localizes in the brain. Study participants will also have a thorough neurologic
      examination and standard neuropsychological testing, including testing of memory,
      concentration, abstraction and visual spatial functions.

      Twenty-four hours later study participants return to the Institute for Neurodegenerative
      Disorders where an investigational scanning procedure will be used to obtain SPECT (single
      photon emission computed tomography) images of the brain.

      Participants may be contacted to repeat these procedures every 12 to 18 months.
