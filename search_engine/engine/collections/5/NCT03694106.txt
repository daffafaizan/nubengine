      the application of this technology to psychotherapeutic settings to enhance treatment
      outcomes. A novel integration of Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) informed psychotherapy and
      digitized data collection systems called T.E.A.M. therapy exists that bridges this gap and
      has yet to be tested. The purpose of this study is to explore whether TEAM CBT appears safe
      and feasible and has results similar to comparable and similar benchmark studies. This
      outcome will provide pilot data and a rationale for whether to pursue a separate randomized
      controlled trial in the future. We will compare the results of TEAM therapy using electronic
      data collection to similar psychotherapeutic treatments for common psychiatric problems such
      as depression, anxiety, relationship conflicts and maladaptive behaviors. We will also
      explore the data for its use in predictive modeling. This study is part of a wider goal of
      developing best practices in dissemination of standardized measurement based psychotherapies
      that are effective and use technology via computerized delivery systems guided by therapists.
      It is hoped that with computer based measurement systems for psychotherapy, more accurate and
      frequent information for therapists is available to modify earlier and more effectively their
      approaches. The measurement based systems will also allow performance by psychotherapists to
      be measured accurately and enable a type of machine based learning environment with feedback
      systems in place to improve providers' patient care in a more precise and personalized way.
