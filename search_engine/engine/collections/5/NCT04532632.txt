      Research Hospital with the diagnosis of Coronavirus disease-19 will be determined by scanning
      the hospital registry system. It was planned that patients discharged from the intensive care
      unit would be called by phone and their complaints about smell and taste disorders were
      evaluated with a questionnaire.
