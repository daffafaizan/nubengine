      and well-being of HIV-infected individuals. However, when the treatment regimen is not
      followed carefully, the therapy can be ineffective in managing one's HIV, and also can allow
      for the development of strains of HIV that may be resistant to treatment. Effective ART
      adherence interventions can help patients to avoid potentially serious individual and public
      health consequences of suboptimal adherence, but such interventions are often expensive and
      too intensive for clinics to support offering over time to their patients. This study will
      develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an individualized, interactive, computer-software
      intervention program delivered in clinical care in increasing ART adherence in HIV-infected
      individuals. Because the intervention is a software program, clinic resources required for
      implementation and sustaining availability over time are minimized.

      Participants in this ~18-month study were recruited from one of 5 participating clinics that
      provide HIV care and randomly assigned to control (an assessment only version of the
      software) or intervention (assessment and tailored intervention software) arm. Participants
      completed their assigned task in concert with their regularly scheduled HIV medical care
      visits (but no more frequently than once a month). Primary outcomes were measured at each
      medical visit. The effect of the adherence intervention was evaluated through comparison of
      treatment and control arm adherence reports over time and VL.
