      to standard antiviral therapy with Peg IFN and ribavirin will increase the rate of sustained
      virological response (SVR) in patients difficult to treat, such as HCV-positive women in
      post-menopausal women with genotype 1, not only those who have never been treated, but also
      in those who have not responded to previous treatment with peginterferon and ribavirin (Riba)
      Objectives Retreatment Primary objective Verify whether the sustained virological response
      (SVR defined as HCV RNA undetectable at 24 weeks of follow-up) in menopausal women with HCV
      CAH genotype 1 who have not achieved a sustained virological response with a previous
      treatment with PEG IFN/ribavirin may increase by at least 20% after treatment with PEG IFN
      alfa 2b and boceprevir (1.5 mcg / kg QW) + Ribavirin (800-1400 mg / day) The primary efficacy
      endpoint, achieving SVR, will be evaluated with descriptive statistics (n,%) for each
      treatment arm.

      Secondary objective It is represented by evaluation of the percent of patients with early
      virological response (undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 2, 4, 8 or 12) that reach SVR.

      Na√Øve patients

      Primary objective Verify whether SVR, defined as undetectable HCV-RNA at 24 weeks of
      follow-up may increase by at least 25% after treatment with PEG IFN alfa 2b plus ribavirin
      and boceprevir vs. PEG IFN alfa 2b plus ribavirin alone, in postmenopausal women with CHC
      genotype 1 not previously treated The primary efficacy endpoint, achieving SVR, will be
      evaluated with descriptive statistics (n,%) for each treatment arm.

      Secondary objective It is represented by evaluation of the percent of patients with early
      virological response (undetectable HCV RNA at weeks 2, 4, 8 or 12) that reach SVR.
