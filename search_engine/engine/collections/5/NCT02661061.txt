      of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV)-diagnosed
      recurrent unipolar depression and followed-up weekly to assess recovery according to standard
      criteria. Blood samples for epigenetic studies will be taken at baseline. Treatment-as-usual
      will continue throughout the entire trial. Participants who meet standardised response
      criteria will then be invited to be randomised to course of four two-weekly ketamine or
      midazolam (active comparator) infusions. Block randomisation will be independently performed.
      Physical, psychotomimetic and cognitive outcomes will be monitored before, during and after
      infusions. Blood samples will be taken at four time-points in the first infusion session and
      before the final infusion for neuroplasticity biomarker studies.Trial Interventions:
      participants will receive four two-weekly infusions of either ketamine at 0.05mg/kg or
      midazolam at 0.045mg/kg. All infusions will be administered by a consultant anaesthetist.
      Repeated infusions of ketamine have been shown to be safe and well-tolerated by patients with
      mental illness. Minor haemodynamic changes and psychotomimetic side-effects can occur and
      will be assessed regularly during infusions and for 200 minutes afterwards.

      Participants will be followed up over six months to assess for relapse according to
      standardised criteria. This is the highest-risk period for relapse and investigators
      hypothesize that ketamine will provide additional neurotrophic support (assessed by the
      laboratory biomarker project) which will result in lower relapse rates when compared to
      midazolam.
