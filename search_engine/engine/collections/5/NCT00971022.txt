      will consist of about 8 people who will discuss beliefs about generic medication, awareness
      of discount generic prescription programs, and use of the discount generic prescription
      program. The focus group will last about 90 minutes.

      During the focus group, you will complete a form that asks for basic demographic information
      (such as your age and sex).

      The focus group discussions will be taped, and the recorded tapes will be transcribed
      word-for-word. The taped recording of the focus group study will be stored in a safe and
      secured locker by the study chair. The taped recordings will be destroyed after 5 years.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will end once you complete the focus group.

      This is an investigational study.
