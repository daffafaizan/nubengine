      contacted via a telephone call by a pulmonologist, who will perform a triage with a screening
      questionnaire between 24-48 hours before the scheduled procedure. The pulmonologist will seek
      for history of fever, respiratory symptoms, and/or close-contacts COVID-patients. After
      exclusion of all respiratory symptoms or history suggestive of COVID-19, patients will be
      evaluated for serum IgG and IgM levels using a rapid test.

      Only after complete evaluation and revision of serological levels, body temperature will be
      measure before entering the endoscopy unit. Patients will be isolated in an individual
      preoperative and recovery room after the endoscopic procedure, avoiding contacts with other
      patients. The endoscopy staff (endoscopists, nurses, administrative personal, anesthesia
      staff) will use personal protective equipment (PPE) including N95 face mask, face shield,
      shoe covers, gowns, and gloves.

      All the staff will be evaluated for nucleic acid PCR testing within three days before
      resuming activities in the endoscopy unit, all staff members will be evaluated for
      respiratory symptoms and changes in body temperature before starting daily activities. At the
      end of the study all the staff will be evaluated for IgM and IgG antibodies against COVID-19.
