      cultural adaptation of the original US NCI's version of the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire. The
      questionnaire will be translated and administered to a sample of 96 Italian patients. After
      protocol amendment in November 2016, the second step was modified and consists of test-retest
      reliability assessment of the Italian language version of the PRO-CTCAE questionnaire that
      was developed in the first step, with a minimum of 59 Italian speaking patients to be
      enrolled. A validation study is planned and will be the subject of a separate protocol.
