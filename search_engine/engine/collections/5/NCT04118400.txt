      the rapid breathing and large variations in respiratory patterns. The setting and adjustment
      of the ventilator for premature neonate is not easy, often resulting in poor
      patient-ventilator interaction, increased work of breathing, patient discomfort and delayed
      weaning . Recently, a new ventilation mode (NAVA; Neurally Adjusted Ventilatory Assist) mode,
      allows the respirator to provide a proportional ventilation mode based on the patients'
      diaphragm electrical activity, which was validated in many domestic and international
      clinical researches. The NAVA mode improves patient-ventilator interaction, reduces work of
      breathing and contributes to early weaning and extubation . When participating in this study,
      the neonate with receive a special oral tube placement, which is used to replace the original
      gastric tube to monitor the electrical activity of the diaphragm. The aims of the study are:
      1. To select the appropriate ventilation mode and parameters (for example, switch to NIV-NAVA
      mode); 2. To monitor intermittent apnea, bradycardia and the frequency of cyanosis, 3. To pay
      attention to the changes in maximum peak pressure, adjust appropriate pressure support, and
      avoid lung injury. The predicted outcomes of NAVA mode for premature neonate may include : 1.
      Measurement of the lower PIP value to maintain proper and synchronized ventilation; 2.
      Monitoring of the diaphragm activity (Edi) signal to evaluate the work of breathing and
      estimate the weaning time.
