      meeting the inclusion criteria will be recruited and blindly divided into 2 groups of equal
      numbers. The first groups will be treated with autologous BM-MSC, while the second group will
      be treated with autologous AT-MSC. The outcomes and improvements will be assessed using the
      American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) Impairment Scale (AIS). Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI) will be performed at base line and after 12 months of the stem cell transplantation.
