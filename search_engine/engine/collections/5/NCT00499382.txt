      take part in this study, you will go through both of these procedures as you normally would.

      For both imaging exams, you will be lying on your back. Every effort will be made to make you
      as comfortable as possible. For theNM cardiac scan, you will be hooked up to a heart monitor
      that will take a picture every time your heart beats. Your heart will be imaged from several
      different views. This exam will take about 30 minutes.

      The PET/CT cardiac scan will be done after completion of your normally scheduled PET/CT scan.
      For this scan, you will be hooked to a heart monitor that records the beats of your heart.
      While this monitor is attached, you will be imaged with the PET/CT scanner. The PET/CT
      cardiac scan will take about 10-15 minutes after your PET/CT exam is completed.

      Both imaging exams will provide a number that corresponds to the percent of blood pushed out
      of the left ventricle of your heart during a resting state.

      Taking part in this study should add between 10-15 additional minutes to your PET/CT visit.
      This is due to the additional cardiac imaging time.

      This is an investigational study. A total of up to 50 patients will take part in this study.
      All will be enrolled at UTMDACC.
