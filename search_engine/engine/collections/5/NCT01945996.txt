      intervention for patients with diabetes delivered entirely via mobile phones. TExT-MED FANS
      (Trial to Examine Text-based mHealth for Emergency Department Patients With Diabetes With
      Family And Friend Network Supporter) will unite the benefits of mHealth (scalability, ease of
      access) and social support interventions (personalized motivation, emotional support). The
      Diabetes FANS text message based curriculum will make it easier for friends and family to
      become supporters. Additionally, augmenting TExT-MED with the FANS social support module will
      be more effective than TExT-MED alone. The personalized support of TExT-MED FANS will also be
      more effective than providing TExT-MED in combination with a community health worker
      supporter who lacks a pre-existing relationship with the patient. Through this innovative
      combination, I can create a more cost-effective and diffusible mHealth solution that
      maintains the personal connection of social support interventions. To date there has only
      been one study evaluating social support interventions for patients with diabetes using
      mHealth, but in this study participants were paired with other subjects with diabetes (not
      friends or family) and it required intensive face-to-face support group time. TExT-MED FANS
      will provide key insights into the utility of combining social support interventions
      delivered solely via mHealth in low-income Latino patients. These insights will help future
      interventions achieve maximal impact on diabetes and other chronic disease management.
