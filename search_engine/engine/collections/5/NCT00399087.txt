      patients with malignancies for whom single agent docetaxel is a reasonable treatment option.
      All patients will receive docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg/m2 on day 8 of a 21-day cycle either
      without (Arm A) or with prednisone 5 mg bid on days 1 - 21 (Arms B and C). (Patients on all
      arms will receive premedication with dexamethasone around the time of docetaxel
      administration either as described in the product insert for arm A or as used in prior
      prostate cancer phase III studies for arm B and C. The 1st cohort of patients on Arm A and
      Arm B will receive perifosine orally at a dose of 50 mg per day for the first 14 days of the
      21-day cycle. On each arm, the perifosine dose will be escalated in subsequent groups to 50
      mg bid and then 50 mg tid as tolerated. Alternating cohorts of 3 patients will be entered
      first to Arm A and then to Arm B. At the completion of arms A and B, 3 cohorts of patients
      will be entered who will receive perifosine weekly at doses of 900, 1200 and 1500 mg. The
      total dose will be divided into 300 mg doses which will be delivered at least 4 hours apart.
      The perifosine dose escalation for each arm will be performed separately according to the
      following algorithm. For each arm, a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) will be defined as a dose
      that can be given without grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity in more than 1/3 patients. If
      2/3 patients in any cohort encounter a grade 3/4 non-hematologic toxicity, an additional 3
      patients will be added. If the dose is intolerable for >3/6 patients then the previous dose
      level will be declared the MTD for that arm.
