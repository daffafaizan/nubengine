      disease, and pregnant women risk serious illness and premature labor from flu. The Advisory
      Committee on Immunization Practices recommends that women receive a flu vaccine in flu
      season, and tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine
      during each pregnancy (ideally between 27-36 weeks) to lower the risk for flu and pertussis
      disease for themselves and their infants. However, only half of pregnant women in the US
      receive a flu and Tdap vaccine, respectively; only 33% of women receive both vaccines. Lack
      of vaccination stems from a combination of patient (lack of knowledge, vaccine hesitancy),
      provider (suboptimal communication skills, missed opportunities), and system (e.g. lack of
      standing orders and patient reminders) factors. An effective intervention is needed to
      improve flu and Tdap vaccination rates for pregnant women. To address these low vaccination
      rates the investigators plan to use a clustered RCT (randomizing practices), allocating half
      of the participating practice sites within each health system to the VAX-MOM intervention and
      the other half to standard of care. The multi-component VAX-MOM intervention will be
      comprised of: training in communication, provider prompts, standing orders, and feedback on
      vaccination rates.
