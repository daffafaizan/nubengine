           Hormone therapy is recommended Eligard 45 mg acting for 6 months. It will be ideally
           administered the day of start of radiation therapy or within 3 months before the first
           day of radiotherapy.

           Nevertheless, free prescription is left to investigators. When using other hormonal
           strategies (anti-androgen agonists, LHRH antagonists or LHRH), an administration for six
           months will be critical.

        2. Radiotherapy

      Conformational Radiotherapy techniques in Intensity-Modulated (IMRT)

      2.1) Doses prescribed

        -  PTV1 PTV5 to 66 Gy in 30 fractions of 2.2 Gy

        -  PTV Pelvis: 54 Gy in 30 fractions of 1.8 Gy

        -  PTV Loge 60 Gy in 30 fractions of 2 Gy 6 Gy A complement of 3 in two additional
           fractions Gy may be delivered across the lodge PTV.

        -  PTV Relapse Lodge: In addition to treating the PTV Lodge, additional radiation of 6 Gy
           in 3 fractions of 2 Gy may be made to bring the total dose of 72 Gy in 36 fractions of 2
           Gy.

      2.2) Treatment

      Radiation Guided by a picture (IGRT) will be performed daily. This daily recalibration will
      be based at least on bone structures. It will be possible to readjust the nodal structures.
