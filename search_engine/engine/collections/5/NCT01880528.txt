      I. To explore the adverse event profile of lisinopril, during and after external beam
      radiation therapy (RT) to the lung.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To explore the level of patient-reported acute respiratory distress (dyspnea) during and
      after external beam RT.

      II. To explore the level of patient-reported symptoms during and after external beam RT.

      III. To explore the impact of lisinopril treatment on patient quality of life (QOL) during
      and after external beam RT.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Beginning within 7 days of beginning radiation therapy, patients receive lisinopril
      orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-7.

      ARM II: Beginning within 7 days of beginning radiation therapy, patients receive placebo PO
      QD on days 1-7.

      In both arms, treatment repeats every 7 days for until 3 months after completion of radiation
      therapy in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
