    
      HEALTHY PARTICIPANT FOR CLINICAL TRIAL

      Study will enroll 10 Thai healthy participants, 5 male and 5 female, aged 18-60 years.

      Participants will be admitted in the inpatient ward to receive a single oral dose of IVM (400
      µg/kg).

      After a volunteert has provided written informed consent, the investigator will determine if
      the volunteer is eligible for enrollment in the study. This will be done by reviewing the
      inclusion and exclusion criteria and completing all of the screening assessments. Screening
      assessments may be carried out over more than one day, provided that all required assessments
      are completed within the 14 days prior to admission for Ivermectin administration.

      The blood collection for Standard Membrane Feeding Assay, Direct Feeding Assays,
      Pharmacokinetic analysis, Plasma for Plasmodium assays and mosquito IgG assays should be
      obtained at the scheduled times relative to when the participant was dosed.

      The total duration for each volunteer's participation in the study is approximately 2 months.

      HEALTHY PARTICIPANT FOR BLOOD DONOR

      Study will enroll 10 healthy participants, aged 18-60 years. Each participant will donate
      blood up to 42 ml via venipuncture up to three blood donations. There will be at least 28
      days between each blood donation from the same subject.

      Blood will be maintained at 37°C in a warm water bath until mixed with ivermectin compounds
      or metabolites by Pharmacology staff and fed to mosquitoes by Armed Forces Research Institute
      of Medical Sciences (AFRIMS) staff. Any remaining blood after SMFAs will be discarded. No
      blood samples will be transferred to AFRIMS. Participants for blood donation should not be
      the same participants enrolled in the clinical trial above.
