      oxidation in two groups of adults with SCA within one week before and after 9 weeks of
      intervention in a randomized, double blinded study. One group (n =12 ) will receive an
      intervention of resistance exercise and HMB supplement, and the other group (n=12) will
      receive resistance exercise and a placebo (maltodextrin). Participants will be assigned a
      study code and all information and samples will be stored under the assigned code.
