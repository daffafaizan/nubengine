      with the electroacustimulation device will decrease their PONV and subsequently increase
      their overall satisfaction.

      The primary outcome will be post-operative nausea and vomiting scores on a scale of 1-10
      based on surveys which will be performed at 30m, 60m, 120m, and 24h post-op.

      Secondary outcomes will be the amount of rescue nausea medications required by the patients,
      time to discharge, subjective pain assessment and the impact of their symptoms on the
      activities of daily living since being discharged from the surgery center based on survey,
      and amount of narcotic received.

      This project would also aim to reduce the amount of time patients spend in recovery
      post-operatively, reduce hospital admissions secondary to persistent nausea and vomiting, and
      educate students and trainees about alternative methods of treating and preventing
      postoperative nausea and vomiting.
