      and has become an important part of our culture. Programs are delivered around the world in a
      wide variety of fields and subjects. They serve as an auxiliary tool for the improvement,
      awareness, empowerment, treatment and response to a range of social and personal behavioral
      issues and behaviors, eradication of harmful behaviors, and more.

      In the literature there is ample evidence and proof of the nature of the effects and impact
      of different programs on the group of participants involved. Many successes in these programs
      relate to the contents of the program, the level of interest among the participants, the way
      the program is delivered, the degree of interaction between the facilitators and the
      participants, and more.

      Yet there is little reference in the literature to the aspect that examines the program
      facilitators themselves and the potential impact that the programs will have on a variety of
      aspects and personal measures in the lives of the facilitators. Among these measures is the
      experience of instruction, including the experience of teaching and learning embodied in it,
      the involvement of the ego and the involvement of the facilitator in the tasks, the impact on
      the values and the personal level of the facilitators, including impact on their self-esteem.

      This study will examine, through quantitative and qualitative research, how the delivery of
      the program "In Favor of Myself" to school children influences the program facilitators
      themselves, and the effect on their self-esteem, body-image, and media literacy.

      The research hypothesis is that the self-esteem, body image, media literacy, the sense of
      ability, and personal empowerment of the group of facilitators who delivered the program will
      be increased, and their behavior will change according to the subjects of the program.
