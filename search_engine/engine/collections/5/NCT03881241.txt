    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, post-marketing, observational, case series study to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of the EVOS SMALL Plating System in subjects with proximal
      or distal (pilon or ankle) tibial fractures. Subjects will be recruited in the hospital
      emergency room or surgical department, at the point of identification of the need for ORIF
      surgery, and the decision is made to use the EVOS SMALL Plating System. The choice of medical
      and surgical treatment will be made independently by the Investigator in the regular course
      of practice and will not be influenced by this study protocol.

      Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled in order to ensure at least 90 evaluable
      subjects, with a minimum of 45 evaluable subjects having either a) proximal or b) distal
      tibial fractures.

      Safety monitoring will include documentation device- and surgery-related AEs. Efficacy will
      be monitored by assessment of post-operative fracture resolution according to standard
      radiological practice (X-rays), clinical complications, reoperation rate, DRI, EQ-5D-5L, and
      pain VAS.
