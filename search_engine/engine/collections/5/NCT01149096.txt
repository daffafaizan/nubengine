      I. To evaluate short- and long-term toxicities in bone marrow donors treated with vs without
      filgrastim before harvest.

      II. To compare 10-year mortality and cancer in donors treated with vs without filgrastim.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate the incidence of acute and chronic graft-vs-host disease in the marrow
      recipients enrolled on COG-ASCT0631 with four parameters assessed in the bone marrow
      harvests: absolute T-cell numbers, Th1 vs Th2 profile of T-cells, dendritic cell populations,
      and T-regulatory cell content.

      OUTLINE: Donors are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I (unstimulated harvest): Donors undergo conventional (i.e., unstimulated) bone marrow
      harvest on day 0.

      ARM II (stimulated harvest): Donors receive filgrastim subcutaneously on days -4 through 0.
      Donors then undergo bone marrow harvest on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, donors are followed up at 1, 6, and 12 months and then
      annually for up to 10 years.
