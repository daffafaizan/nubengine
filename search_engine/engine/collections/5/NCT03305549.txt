      delayed strategy for RRT initiation among patients with incident stage 3 AKI - in which RRT
      was delayed unless specific metabolic or clinical indications for RRT were present - was safe
      and averted the need for RRT in nearly half of the critically ill participants, in comparison
      to an early RRT initiation strategy. The hypothesis for this study is: for prevalent patients
      with established AKI-D, a conservative dialysis strategy - in which hemodialysis is not
      continued unless specific metabolic or clinical indications for RRT are present - will
      shorten time to RRT-independence and improve the likelihood of renal recovery.

      The RAD-AKI Pilot Study is a 2-arm randomized clinical trial of hospitalized patients with
      dialysis-requiring acute kidney injury (RAD-AKI) that will compare conventional thrice-weekly
      intermittent hemodialysis dialysis (control) to a "conservative dialysis strategy." The
      primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the safety and feasibility of the proposed
      intervention and study design.
