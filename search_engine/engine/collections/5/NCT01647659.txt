    
      The purpose of this open-label, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period crossover study with
      incomplete washout is to evaluate the relative bioavailability of 2mg GSK1120212 pediatric
      oral solution formulation in comparison to 2mg GSK1120212 tablet formulation, to investigate
      the safety and tolerability of a single dose of the GSK1120212 pediatric oral solution
      formulation as compared to a single dose of the GSK1120212 tablet formulation, and to
      investigate the palatability of the GSK1120212 pediatric oral solution formulation.

      Subjects will be assigned to one of two possible treatment sequences according to the
      randomization code provided to the sites by GSK: a single dose of 2mg GSK1120212 pediatric
      oral solution formulation then a single dose of 2mg GSK1120212 tablet formulation, or a
      single dose of 2mg GSK1120212 tablet formulation, then a single dose of 2mg GSK1120212
      pediatric oral solution formulation. Administration of GSK1120212 in either sequence will be
      followed by 7 days of serial blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma
      GSK1120212. Safety assessments, including assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory
      values (hematology, clinical chemistry and urinalysis) and vital signs, will be made
      throughout the study. After completing the pharmacokinetic assessments for two periods,
      eligible subjects may transition to MEK114375, an open-label rollover study of GSK1120212.
