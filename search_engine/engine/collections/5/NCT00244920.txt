        -  Compare the effect of neoadjuvant androgen-ablation therapy with vs without squalamine
           lactate on induced tumor regression and grade migration in patients with locally
           advanced high-risk adenocarcinoma of the prostate undergoing a radical prostatectomy.

        -  Compare the duration of clinical disease-free survival of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Determine the applicability of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) serology as an endpoint
           determinant in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the feasibility and potential safety effects on wound healing and recovery in
           patients treated with these regimens before and after a radical prostatectomy.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive leuprolide intramuscularly once a month for 3 months and oral
           bicalutamide once a day for 2 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive leuprolide and bicalutamide as in arm I plus squalamine lactate
           IV over 4 hours once weekly for 6 weeks.

      Seven weeks after beginning treatment, patients in both arms undergo standard radical
      prostatectomy. Patients then continue to receive leuprolide and bicalutamide with or without
      squalamine lactate for up to 6 additional weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for at least 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 132 patients (66 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study.
