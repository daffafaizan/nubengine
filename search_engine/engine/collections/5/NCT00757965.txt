        -  To obtain epidemiological information and biological material on a population based
           series of colorectal cancer cases.

        -  To define the proportion of colorectal cancer incidence attributable to mutations in
           known predisposing genes such as MLH1 and MSH2.

        -  To establish whether mutations at other loci may predispose to colorectal cancer, by
           comparing the frequency of alteration candidate genes in colorectal cancer patients with
           the corresponding frequency in cancer-free controls identified through the European
           Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC) study.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients complete an epidemiological questionnaire. The questionnaire also requests
      identifying information about the patient's first-degree relatives.

      Blood samples are collected from patients. DNA is extracted from these blood samples, from
      samples collected from cancer-free control participants in MREC-SEARCH-CONTROL, and from
      additional controls through the European Prospective Investigation of Cancer (EPIC) study (a
      population-based study of diet and health based in Norfolk, East Anglia). DNA samples are
      analyzed for polymorphisms of low penetrance cancer susceptibility genes.

      In addition to the colorectal cancer patients recruited for this study, patients with breast,
      ovarian, prostate, colorectal, bladder, kidney, pancreatic, brain, and esophageal cancer,
      malignant melanoma, and lymphoma cancer are recruited for the following related clinical
      trials: MREC-SEARCH-BREAST, MREC-SEARCH-OVARIAN, MREC-SEARCH-PROSTATE,
      MREC-SEARCH-ENDOMETRIAL, and MREC-SEARCH-CANCER.
