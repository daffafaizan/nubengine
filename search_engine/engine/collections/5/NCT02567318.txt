      (NCT02527395) where areas of secondary hyperalgesia, heat pain detection thresholds, pain
      during 1 min. thermal stimulation and test results from the Pain Catastrophizing Scale and
      the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Score will be retrieved. The study consists of 1 study
      day. The study day will be conducted at a maximum of 2 months and a minimum of 2 weeks after
      the completion of the previous study (NCT02527395).The results of the previous study
      (NCT02527395) will be blinded until all participants have completed the study day.

      All study participants will complete a MRI-scan of the brain.

      The MRI scans will be performed with a Siemens MAGNETOM Verio 3 tesla, with b17 software, and
      a 32-channel head coil. The MRI-scan sequence is as follows:

        -  3D Localiser

        -  3D T1 weighted iso

        -  AX Diffusion tensor imaging

        -  AX Epi resting state fMRI

        -  AX Gre field map

        -  AX Epi ASL

        -  AX T2-weighted blade

        -  AX T2-weighted flair

        -  AX T2-weighted* Gre

      Total MRI-scan time is estimated to approximately 40 minutes.
