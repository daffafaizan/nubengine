      children who have a risk factor for type 2 diabetes to determine the prevalence of abnormal
      glucose metabolism in such patients. At the time of glucose screening all children will be
      given a dietary habit survey and two measures of depression/self-esteem to complete so that
      we may measure the correlation of depression and obesity and depression and abnormal glucose
      metabolism.

      The second part tests the efficacy of a family based educational program in lowering fasting
      glucose in children who screen positive for type 2 DM, hyperinsulinemia, or impaired glucose
      tolerance. This educational assessment will be administered in an observational
      non-randomized, non-blinded fashion. The dietary habit survey and the measures of self-esteem
      and depression will aid us in creating this family based educational study.
