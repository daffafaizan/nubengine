      their routine cardiac catheterization prior to second stage palliation. Upon arrival to the
      pre-catheterization area, NIRS probes will be placed on the child's forehead and data along
      with vital signs will be collected at initial placement, 3 minutes and at 5 minutes. The
      monitor will be disconnected as the routine pre-catheterization procedures proceed.

      Once the child is in the catheterization suite, the monitor will be reconnected and the
      routine catheterization procedures will proceed. After the standard sheath for
      catheterization is placed in the child, a routine superior vena cava saturation (COOX) will
      be drawn and the NIRS reading along with routine vital signs will be documented. At the same
      time the routine saturation is drawn, an additional 2ccs of blood will be drawn for a lactate
      level. At 3 and 5 minutes after the routine saturation, a COOX will be drawn and the NIRS
      reading along with vital signs will be documented. The catheterization will continue as
      usual. At the end of the case, a final NIRS reading and vital signs will be documented prior
      to the removal of the probes.
