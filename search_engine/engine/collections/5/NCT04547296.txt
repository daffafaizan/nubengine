      large sample, multi-center, randomized and controlled methods. From October 9, 2020 to
      October 9, 2022, participants undergoing hepatectomy surgery under general anesthesia will be
      recruited. Participants will be randomly assigned, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive Sodium
      bicarbonate Ringer's solution or control (Acetate Ringer's solution). The randomization
      sequence will be computer-generated, and randomization will be performed in blocks and will
      be stratified according to participating center. After entering the operating room, the two
      groups were pre-dilated with sodium bicarbonate Ringer or acetate Ringer (30 min, 8 ml/kg).
      After the operation started, the two groups of participants were maintained with 4-5 ml/kg/h
      Ringer's solution during the operation. Blood gas index (but are not limited to these data)
      at intraoperative will be recorded. At the same time, other dates will be recorded.The
      participation of each patient is scheduled for 1 month.
