    
      Methods: One hundred and twenty-one females (average ± sd age, 60 ± 9 years), with a
      diagnosis of knee OA were distributed randomly into 4 groups: 35 patients who did not receive
      any treatment (control), 23 patients in the placebo group, 32 patients in the low dose PSW
      group (14.5W, 19 minutes and 17KJ), and 31 patients in the high dose PSW group (14.5W, 38
      minutes and 33KJ). An 11-point numerical pain rating scale (NPRS) and "Knee Osteoarthritis
      Outcome Score" (KOOS) were used to assess pain and function in 3 stages: initial evaluation
      (pre-treatment), immediately after post-treatment, and a 12-month follow up.

      Results: The 4 groups were homogeneous prior to treatment with respect to demographics, pain,
      and functional scales data. We demonstrated the short-term effectiveness of the PSW at low or
      high doses in patients with knee OA. Both treatment groups showed significant improvement in
      pain and function when compared to the control and placebo groups (P<0.05). There were no
      differences between PSW doses, despite the fact that a low dose of PSW seems to be more
      effective in the long term.

      Conclusion: The PSW is an effective method for pain relief, functionality, and quality of
      life improvement in females with knee osteoarthritis in the short-term. On the basis of our
      results, we recommend PSW application in the female population with knee OA. However,
      conclusions regarding the 12-month follow up should be analyzed carefully due to the high
      dropout rate.
