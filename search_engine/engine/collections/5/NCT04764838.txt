      effect of yoga on sexual function in primipara pregnant women. The data of the research will
      be collected through the "Data Collection Form, Female Sexual Function Scale (FSFI)" and The
      Body Exposure During Sexual Activities Questionnaire (BESAQ), which are created by the
      researchers by scanning the literature. Research Volunteers who apply to SBU Haseki Training
      and Research Hospital Pregnancy Outpatient Clinic and meet the sample selection criteria will
      constitute the sample of the study. In order to determine the minimum sample size required
      for this study, the power analysis 80% power and Î± = 0.50 were calculated to include a total
      of 138 women with a minimum 69 sample size in each group. The intervention and control ratio
      is 1. However, considering the probability of loss, 150 pregnant women will be randomized.
      The data will be interviewed online with pregnant women and online yoga training will be held
      for the intervention group, and the data will be uploaded to the ISM SPSS 22.0 (Statistical
      Package for the Social Sciences) statistics program; Parametric (Anova and T test) and
      nonparametric (Mann-Whitney U Test, Kruskal Wallis, Chi Square) statistical methods will be
      used.
