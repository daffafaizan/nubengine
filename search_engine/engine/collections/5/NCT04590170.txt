      the COVID-19 emerged in December 2019 and was declared pandemic in March 2020.

      Although the majority of reported COVID-19 cases are mild, approximatively 5% of patients
      require a stay in intensive care unit, with mechanical ventilation.

      dysfunctions.

      Little is known about the rate and clinical presentations of PCIS among patients surviving to
      COVID-19.

      The objective of this study is to describe the clinical manifestations of PCIS in COVID-19
      patients, and their rehabilitation process until home return.
