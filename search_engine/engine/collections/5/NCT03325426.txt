      individuals, especially if such strategies promote healthy lifestyles. Physical activity is
      currently recommended for adults CV health, but physical activity levels are known to be low
      in populations with diabetes or chronic kidney disease. One prior study of the use of
      pedometers (not associated with wireless technology or provider feedback) in children with
      CKD did not significantly improve physical activity levels. Supervised walking appeared to
      provide some benefit in individuals with type II diabetes, but overall compliance was poor.
      Interview of adolescents and young adults with chronic illnesses has shown preference for the
      use of electronic devices and online tools for disease management.Thus, use of sophisticated
      electronic devices such as FitBits© (wireless pedometers worn on the wrist that sync with
      cell phones) may improve disease control by engaging young patients in self-monitoring of
      their own health and lifestyle behaviors. This pilot study aims to determine if use of
      FitBits© coupled with provider feedback will increase awareness of young adults of their
      physical fitness and improve blood pressure levels.
