      from nine General Practitioner (GP) practices in order to estimate medically attended Adverse
      Events of Interest (AEIs), for people who have received an influenza vaccine. This study will
      also actively follow patients who were exposed to seasonal influenza vaccination for 7 days
      in three of the nine GP practices using a customised card-based adverse drug reaction
      reporting system, in order to determine whether a more active approach to surveillance can
      capture higher rates of AEIs.
