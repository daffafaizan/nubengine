      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose of cediranib maleate (AZD2171 [cediranib]) in
      combination with selumetinib sulfate (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate).

      II. To describe the toxicity profile associated with AZD2171 (cediranib) in combination with
      AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate.

      III. To describe the tumor responses and identify any activity of this AZD2171 (cediranib) in
      combination with AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate.

      IV. To explore, through correlative studies, the effect of AZD2171 (cediranib) with or
      without AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate on serum markers of apoptosis.

      V. To assess the pharmacokinetic interaction of AZD2171 (cediranib) in combination with
      AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate.

      VI. To study the association of clinical (toxicity and/or tumor response or activity) with
      the pharmacologic (pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic) parameters, and/or biologic (correlative
      laboratory study) results.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study followed by a dose-expansion cohort study.

      Patients receive cediranib maleate orally (PO) once daily (QD) and selumetinib sulfate PO QD
      or twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 (days 8-28 of cycle 1). Cycles repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cycles may be extended to 12 weeks
      after 1 year of study treatment.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up at 3 months.
