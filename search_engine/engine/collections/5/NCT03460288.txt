      problematic and pathological gambling behavior. The main objective of the study is to
      investigate the extent to which the online program leads to a significant reduction in
      pathological gambling. The primary outcome is the Pathological Gambling Adaptation of the
      Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsory Scale (PG-YBOCS total score) as a measure of the severity of
      pathological gambling symptoms. Secondary outcomes are further measures of gambling-related
      symptoms, such as the South Oaks Gambling Screen (SOGS), as well as rates of depression,
      measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire - 9 items depression module (PHQ-9), and rates
      of impulsivity, measured with the impulsivity subscale of the Eysenck's Impulsivity Inventory
      (I-7). The training is expected to lead to a significant reduction in
      problematic/pathological gambling behavior (PG-YBOCS) and all secondary outcomes when
      compared to a control group. The study design is a randomized-controlled trial with one
      intervention group and one wait-list control group and two assessment times (pre and post).
      The intervention group receives the download link for the training program directly following
      the baseline survey and can use the training over a period of 8 weeks, whereas the wait-list
      control group receives access to the training after completion of the post-survey.
