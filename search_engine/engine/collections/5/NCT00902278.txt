      United States by the Food and Drug Administration.Current influenza virus vaccines consist of
      3 components: the HA protein from an H1N1 virus, an H3N2 and an influenza B virus.Influenza
      vaccines are evaluated and approved by the FDA on the basis of HA and NA content. However,
      different manufacturing processes are involved in the preparation of these commercial
      vaccines and evidence suggests that each of these vaccines contain similar patterns of HA
      protein but different patterns of influenza influenza internal proteins such as NP and M1.
      The presence of these additional internal proteins of influenza virus which are targets of T
      cell responses suggest not only the potential for additional protection derived from
      influenza vaccines other than antibody mediated protection but also differential levels of T
      cell mediated protection between different manufacturers of commercial influenza
      vaccines.Each subject will have four blood samples taken- prevaccination and at Days 7, 14,30
      and 3-5 months post vaccination. These samples will be tested for T and B cell responses and
      the results compared between different manufacturers.
