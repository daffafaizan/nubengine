      blood culture bottles at bedside versus lab inoculation (delayed inoculation) of ascitic
      fluid in the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. This study had a small sample
      size (29) and goal is to validate results with a larger sample size. The aim of current
      proposed study is to assess for non inferiority of lab inoculation of ascitic fluid culture
      versus current standard of blood culture bottles. To achieve 90% power and true sensitivity
      95%, goal is to enroll 460 patients within the course of a year or until number of samples is
      reached, with plan to compare the sensitivity of bedside inoculation of blood culture bottles
      versus the lab using sterile plate techniques as per current lab culture technique. Unlike
      previous study, all comers for ascitic fluid collected will be analyzed that are to undergo
      diagnostic paracentesis.
