      morbidity. The introduction of robotic surgery has only served to accelerate this trend by
      allowing more complex surgeries to be performed using a minimally invasive technique. A key
      requirement of any minimally invasive gynecologic procedure is adequate visualization of the
      pelvis. This necessitates moving the bowel into the upper abdomen which is facilitated by
      placing patients in the Trendelenburg position. Steep Trendelenburg in the range of 30-40
      degrees has historically been referenced as necessary for adequate visualization, but modern
      studies have found 16-28 degrees to be adequate. In practice, most physicians obtain the
      maximum Trendelenburg available as increasingly complex surgeries are attempted using
      minimally invasive techniques.
