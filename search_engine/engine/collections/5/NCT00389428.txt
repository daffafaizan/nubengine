      cytarabine and daunorubicin. The two drugs are present inside the liposome in a 5:1 molar
      ratio. The development of CPX-351 (cytarabine:daunorubicin) Liposome Injection was based on
      1) defining a synergistic ratio of the two active moieties, cytarabine and daunorubicin,
      using cell-based screening assays and 2) designing a liposomal drug carrier to maintain this
      ratio after intravenous administration. CPX-351 was found to be more active in in vivo models
      of cancer than combinations of conventional cytarabine and daunorubicin. Both cytarabine and
      daunorubicin are active chemotherapeutic agents, each approved for clinical use in the United
      States for the treatment of hematological neoplasms.

      CPX-351 is being developed with the hypothesis that it is superior to the currently used
      regimen of cytarabine and daunorubicin in the treatment of acute leukemia. This phase I study
      will determine the dose to carry forward into phase II trials.
