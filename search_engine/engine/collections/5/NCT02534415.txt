      assess therapeutic effects of topical hyaluronic-acid on secondary wound healing of free
      gingival graft donor site.

      Primary outcome variables that pain and burning sensation changes were assessed at 3, 7, 14,
      21 days after surgery by the examiner. Pain and burning sensation were assessed by patients
      using the VAS, score 0 indicate no pain or burning sensation, score 10 indicate severe pain
      or burning sensation. Secondary outcome variables included color match, consistency and
      epithelization of the wound area. These parameters were assessed by the same examiner at 3,
      7, 14, 21 and 42 days after surgery. Color of the palatal mucosa was assessed by comparing it
      to that of the adjacent and opposite site using the VAS. Score 0 indicate no color match and
      score 10 indicate very good color match. Consistency of the palatal mucosa was assessed with
      a blunt instrumentation and scored as soft or firm. Epithelialization was scored clinically
      as none, partial or complete.

      Sample size has been estimated in 12 subjects per treatment groups. Random allocation of the
      treatment sites to test and control groups will be performed using a computerized selection
      of random numbers for allocation of the study groups.

      Clinical images obtained at baseline, 3, 7, 14, 21 and 42 days after surgery from each
      treatment site.
