    
      The study consists of 2 treatment cohorts with refractory chronic cough: Idiopathic Pulmonary
      Fibrosis (IPF, Cohort 1) and Chronic Idiopathic Cough (CIC, Cohort 2). In each cohort, the
      study will include two treatment periods of 14 days each separated by a Washout Period of 14
      days between Period 1 and Period 2. The two periods will be identical except that in Period
      2, patients will crossover to the alternate treatment from that received in Period 1,
      according to a 1:1 randomization scheme.

      During each period, patients will self-administer study drug (i.e., 40 mg PA101 or Placebo
      PA101 via eFlow) three times daily for 14 consecutive days of each period. Objective cough
      count will be recorded over 24-hour period using a cough count device (Leicester Cough
      Monitor) at the Baseline, Day 7 and Day 14 of each treatment period.

      In the IPF cohort, patients will be allowed to use antifibrotic therapy (i.e., pirfenidone,
      nintedanib, and N-acetylcysteine) during the course of the study provided that the dose is
      stabilized at least 3 months prior to Screening and throughout the study period.

      Clinical safety assessments will be performed at the start and end of each treatment period.
