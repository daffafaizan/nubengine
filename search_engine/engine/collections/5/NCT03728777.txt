    
      Study design: double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study.

      To ensure enough participants, and due to the risk of a heterogeneous cohort, a cross-over
      design is chosen, where participants are their own controls. 10 patients with mitochondrial
      myopathy and 10 patients with fatty acid oxidation defects will be included. Eligible
      patients will be randomized using a 1:1 assignment ratio to receive placebo or RSV first.
      Each treatment will be administered orally twice daily for 8 weeks, followed by a 4 weeks
      wash-out, and afterwards a new 8-week treatment period.

      During the 20-week trial period, subjects will visit the trial site on five occasions, for
      functional assessments (cycle ergometer testing), blood sampling and questionnaires.
