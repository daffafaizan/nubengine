    
      This is a non -interventional (observational) post authorization safety study (PASS): no
      vaccine will be administered as part of the study.

      This pregnancy registry study is a combination of a retrospective (outcomes occurred before
      the start of participant enrollment) and prospective (outcomes occurred after the start of
      participant enrollment) cohort study using active identification and enrollment of pregnant
      women and their offsprings inadvertently exposed to CYD-TDV during pregnancy or up to 30 days
      preceding the LMP.

      The study period will be from July 2016 (first availability of Paran√°'s Immunization
      Registry) to July 2022 (end of last follow-up interview for offsprings), and the participant
      enrollment period will last approximately 1 year.

      Study duration per participant will vary depending on: 1) the stage of pregnancy at the time
      the participant will be enrolled; 2) whether the participant will be included retrospectively
      or prospectively. The maximum duration will be 22.5 months (up to 9 months of pregnancy + 42
      days post-delivery [puerperium period] + 12 months post-birth).
