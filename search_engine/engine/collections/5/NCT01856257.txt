      including kidney damage. Transplant recipients have to take anti-rejection medications to
      prevent their immune system (the body's natural defense system against illness) from
      rejecting their new kidney. Most patients who receive a kidney transplant must take these
      anti-rejection medications for the rest of their lives, or for as long as the kidney
      continues to work.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if NULOJIXÂ® (belatacept), will minimize serious
      long term side effects seen with anti-rejection medications while still protecting the
      transplanted kidney from damage. The researchers also want to learn more about the safety of
      this treatment and the long term health of the transplanted kidney.
