      self-management program for preventing falls among people with multiple sclerosis (PwMS). To
      accomplish this objective, the investigators have designed a web-based fall prevention
      program called Free From Falls Online (FFFO), based on the traditionally in-person program
      developed by the National Multiple Sclerosis Society. The specific aims of this study are
      three-fold: (1) to evaluate the effectiveness of an online fall prevention self-education
      program by comparing fall frequency between participants and controls; (2) evaluate the
      impact of FFFO by comparing patient reported measures of physical function, fatigue,
      self-efficacy, psychosocial illness impact, social participation and satisfaction, and
      perception of global health between participants and controls; (3) and to determine usability
      of and satisfaction with FFFO.
