      above 20mmHg determined at right-heart catheterization. Depending on the presentation and
      pathogenesis, patients are classified according to five main groups. A correct classification
      is crucial, since it is essential for the available therapy options.

      A promising non-invasive method to provide important hemodynamic and clinical Information is
      the fully-automatic analysis of thoracic computed tomography images. This method can yield a
      number of quantitative morphologic readouts of the lung vasculature and the parenchyma.

      This study aims to identify quantitative markers from the fully-automatic image analysis,
      which allow a discrimination between the various PH patient groups.
