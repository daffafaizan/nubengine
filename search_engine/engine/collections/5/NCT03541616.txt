    
      In patients discharged from hospital after an admission for acute heart failure (HF)
      decompensation, subclinical atrial fibrillation (AF) of 30 minutes or greater in duration is
      common (at least 15% of patients without prior AF) and is associated with increased risk of
      re-hospitalization within 30-days.

      Study Objectives:

        1. To evaluate the prevalence of subclinical AF ≥30 minutes in duration in patients
           discharged from hospital following an admission for acute HF exacerbation and who have
           no known history of clinical AF.

        2. To examine the temporal association between subclinical AF ≥30 minutes in duration and
           30-day hospital readmission for HF.
