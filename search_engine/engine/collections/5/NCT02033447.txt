      1.1 To conduct a dose escalation safety trial of magnetic nanoparticles injected into the
      prostates of men prior to cystoprostatectomy. 1.2 To conduct a dose escalation safety trial
      of magnetic nanoparticles injected into the prostates of men prior to prostatectomy. 1.3 To
      evaluate ex-vivo prostates with a special marker to determine the retention and distribution
      of the magnetic nanoparticles in relation to the intended target area at time of injection

      SECONDARY 2.1 To evaluate the anatomical distribution of magnetic nanoparticles compared with
      injection site in prostate assessed by both Perls' staining and postoperative imaging (MRI
      and CT) of the ex vivo tissue
