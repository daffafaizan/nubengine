      disproportionately affected. Among high school youth , 38% report lifetime cigarette use, and
      9.3% report having smoked a whole cigarette before the age of 13. In Southeast Michigan,
      African-American youth are at disproportionate risk of engaging in tobacco use and
      co-occuring substance use and other risk behaviors. To address these significant public
      health concerns, we developed Storytelling 4 Empowerment (S4E), a targeted and tailored
      mobile-health (mHealth) application (app) intervention to be delivered in health clinic
      settings. The proposed research aims to develop culturally congruent and developmentally
      appropriate modules focused on tobacco use prevention and risk reduction to be included as
      part of the S4E mHealth app. The proposed research will also determine the preliminary
      efficacy of S4E in reducing tobacco use, alcohol and other drug use, sexual risk behaviors,
      and improving HIV/STI testing in a sample (n=50) of youth ages 13-21 living in Southeast
      Michigan.
