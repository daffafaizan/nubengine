      after dental preparation, (ii) the thickness and color of the LVs obtained before of the
      cementation procedures on white and black value background, (iii) and the final color of the
      LVs bonded to dental substrates obtained after cementation. For LVs cementation two cements
      will be used, the light-cured resin cement and the flowable composite, which will be randomly
      divided into two groups (n=31). The color of LVs will be performed with visual evaluation
      based on Vita and 3D Master scales and with a spectrophotometer Vita Easyshade (Vita
      Zahnfabrik / Bad Saeckingen, Germany) based on CIEL*a* b system. Data collected will be
      evaluated for translucency parameter (TP) and color variation (Î”E) according to luting agent,
      thickness and color of the LVs as well as color of dental substrate. Additionally, the color
      obtained with visual evaluation and with spectrophotometer will be compared to evaluate the
      level of agreement between the color observed by the operator and the color named by the
      spectrophotometer.
