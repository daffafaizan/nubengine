      (RVF) virus transmission and its related chronic disease/infection attack rate, during an
      interepidemic period in a high-risk region that has seen repeated RVF outbreaks. The results
      will be used to develop and refine predictive algorithms for RVF Virus transmission, based on
      epidemiological, environmental, and remote sensing data, with the ultimate goal of providing
      improved early detection of significant RVF outbreaks. It is expected that the analysis of
      test-performance characteristics will determine the best use of serologic assays in Kenya's
      next RVF epizootic/epidemic. The primary outcome measure will be the current RVF-specific
      seropositivity profile for a cross-sectional survey population in Ijara District in northeast
      Kenya. The secondary outcome measures to be studied will be: 1) an assessment of the
      behavioral factors associated with risk of seropositivity (previous infection) in the study
      population; and 2) the association of selected long-term ophthalmological and clinical
      outcomes with seropositivity. The study design for this protocol involves questionnaire
      administration to consenting participants of Ijara District, followed by performance of
      medical exams, ophthalmologic exams, and phlebotomy on all participants. ELISA testing for
      RVF will then be performed on the blood samples obtained, and all ELISA screen-positive
      samples will have confirmatory testing by plaque-reduction neutralizing antibody testing.
