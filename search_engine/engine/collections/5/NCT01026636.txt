      distributed in the body and removed over time) and safety of a single dose of ceftobiprole in
      pediatric patients undergoing treatment with systemic antibiotics and may be used to guide
      dosing recommendations for ceftobiprole in children. This study is an open-label (all
      patients will know the identity of the drug) single-dose, pharmacokinetic study in infants
      and children =3 months to <18 years of age who are medically stable as judged by the clinical
      investigator and require therapy with antibiotics. Patients will be given a 2-hour i.v.
      infusion (given directly into the vein) of 7, 10, or 15 mg/kg ceftobiprole. The study
      population will be grouped according to the following 4 age groups: =12 to <18 years of age;
      =6 to <12 years of age; =2 to <6 years of age; and =3 months to <2 years of age. Every
      attempt will be made to include patients of both sexes in each age group. Safety evaluations
      will include clinical laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis),
      pregnancy testing, vital signs, physical examination, monitoring of adverse events, and
      recording of concomitant medications. Patients will be given a single 2-hour i.v. (given
      directly into the vein) infusion of ceftobiprole. The total duration of the study is
      approximately 18 days, including screening and posttreatment.
