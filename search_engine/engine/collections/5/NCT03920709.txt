      in CD4+ T cells in a form that is neither targeted by the immune system nor by ART, the
      complete eradication of replication competent HIV or the establishment of a long term
      remission state in infected individuals represents an outstanding challenge.

      The persistence of reservoirs has been mainly linked to the survival and clonal expansion of
      pools of long lived infected memory CD4+ T cells and to low level viral replication in
      tissues where ART penetration may be incomplete. One such tissue may be mucosal surfaces
      which are challenging to study in human populations.

      As part of the Milieu Interieur project, coordinated by Institut Pasteur, investigators have
      developed and validated a standardized approach for sampling the nasal mucosa. From this
      simple sampling procedure it is possible to analyze both the local mucosal host immune
      response at the proteomic and metabolomic level, and also the mucosal microbial flora.

      As part of Milieu Interieur investigators have defined these diverse phenotypes for a subset
      of donors and are currently extending the analysis to the 1,000 healthy donors cohort that
      will give reference range values for the nasal mucosa.

      Investigators wish to compare with relevant patient groups, in particular HIV infected
      individuals to see how infection, treatment, and natural host control may differentially
      impact the mucosal immune response and viral reservoir
