      to treatment, as imaging soon after starting therapy might be able to better define the
      likelihood of response. Functional imaging refers to scans that measure characteristics other
      than size and shape (anatomic imaging), as measured by CT scans. We are interested in
      evaluating the potential value of diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI), which in some
      settings can be used very early in treatment in predicting patients' response to treatment.

      Diffusion MRI (dMRI) detects changes in cell structure, and has the potential to detect and
      measure cell changes that occur in response to treatment. Several groups are investigating
      the use of dMRI to monitor treatment responses. This strategy has been most frequently
      explored in humans in patients with brain tumors, where dMRI has been demonstrated to predict
      response to treatment early after starting treatment. A few studies have looked at response
      in other cancers. These studies showed early changes in patients who later responded to
      treatment, with changes seen within one to 2 weeks.

      Although diffusion MRI has been shown to be useful in several cancer types, it has not been
      explored in the evaluation of lymphoma. This pilot study will evaluate the imaging
      characteristics of Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma (DLBCL) by dMRI prior to treatment and 7
      days after initial chemotherapy in order to explore whether dMRI is useful in evaluating the
      response of lymphoma to chemotherapy.
