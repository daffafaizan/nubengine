      disciplines particularly orthopaedic surgeries. However the state of consciousness can
      potentially cause patient anxiety thus sedation is often utilized as a mean to improve
      patient satisfaction and increase patient acceptance of CNB.

      Conventionally, the anaesthesiologist administers sedatives for the patients. Propofol is the
      commonly used drug for sedation due to its favourable pharmacokinetic profile, which results
      in fast induction, easy control of depth of sedation and rapid recovery. It can be infused by
      using target-controlled infusion (TCI) devices where the anaesthetists titrates propofol by
      setting desired target plasma and effect site concentration. However it is difficult to judge
      precisely patient requirements for adequate patient sedation, comfort and analgesia as
      patients' needs differ.

      Patient-controlled sedation (PCS) is a valid option, initially adapted from post surgery
      patient-controlled analgesia. It allows patients to titrate sedative medication to their
      comfort and therefore present an option that addresses the needs of patients with strong
      desire to maintain sense of control during procedures.

      This study was designed to compare total propofol requirement between PCS versus TCI sedation
      (TCIS), complications and patient satisfaction, in patients undergoing lower limb orthopaedic
      surgery under CNB.
