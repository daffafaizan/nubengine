      arise from the epithelium (outer lining) of the ovary. In 2015 it was reported found in 1.2
      million women and resulted in 161,100 deaths worldwide. Among women it is the seventh-most
      common cancer and the eighth-most common cause of death from cancer. Treatment for ovarian
      cancer consists of surgery, chemotherapy, immunotherapy and sometimes, radiotherapy. The kind
      of treatment depends on many factors, including the type of ovarian cancer, its stage and
      grade, as well as the general health of the patient.

      Adoptive immunotherapy with cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) reactive with specific viral
      antigens has proven to be effective. Here, the investigators aim to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of multiple infusions of ovarian cancer specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in
      patients.
