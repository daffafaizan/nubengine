      chemotherapy. The standard first-line treatment for advanced NSCLC is platinum based
      combination chemotherapy. The response rates are less than 30% and a substantial amount of
      patients will experience unnecessary toxicity in terms of e.g. nausea, vomiting, neuropathies
      or a considerable risk of renal toxicity. The median progression free survival is 3-4 months
      and consequently, the median overall survival is less than one year (Hotta et al 2007).
      Addition of new biological agents to standard chemotherapy regimens may improve the outcome
      for these patients.
