      intervention or a control group for 12-weeks. The control group will be provided with an
      informational handout from the American Cancer Society describing exercise recommendations
      and guidelines for cancer survivors. At the end of the study, control group participants will
      be offered compensation for participation in a community-based cancer specific exercise
      program (e.g., BfitBwell, Fit Cancer, Livestrong at the YMCA). Supervised exercise sessions
      will take place twice per week for approximately one hour, and include aerobic, muscular
      strength and endurance, balance, and flexibility components. Sessions will be delivered
      synchronously (i.e., in real-time/live) via Zoom. Exercise will be individualized based on
      the results of baseline fitness assessments and medical history. The intervention will also
      include virtual, group-based discussion sessions which operationalize behavior change
      techniques to increase physical activity. Discussion sessions will take place in the same
      groups, synchronously, via Zoom.
