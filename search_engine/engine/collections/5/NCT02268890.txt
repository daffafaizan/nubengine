    
      This is a Phase 4, single-arm, open-label (all knew the intervention of study), and
      multicenter (when more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research
      study) study to explore the pharmacokinetics with relapsed (the return of a medical problem)
      or refractory (not responding to treatment) multiple myeloma. The study consists of a
      Screening phase and a bortezomib treatment phase with defined PK sample collection time
      points. Participants will receive bortezomib intravenous injection two times a week up to 2
      weeks (on Days 1, 4, 8, and 11) and followed by a 10-day resting phase (Days 12 to 21) for 1
      treatment cycle. Pharmacokinetics will primarily be evaluated. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
