      have emerged in recent years in the world of clinical abortion care. Traditionally, doulas
      are non-medical individuals trained to provide emotional support, pain management strategies,
      relaxation techniques, and information to pregnant women during labor. The positive impact of
      doulas on obstetrical health outcomes and patient satisfaction is well accepted.

      Women with the support of a doula have been shown to have shorter labor, and rate birth as
      less difficult and more satisfying, than do mothers without doula support. They also report a
      greater ability to cope with labor and require less epidural and IV pain medication. In
      recent years, the term full spectrum doula has emerged to describe doulas who extend their
      supportive services to women at any stage of a pregnancy, including the management of a
      miscarriage or undesired pregnancy ending in abortion. The Doula Project, created in 2007 in
      New York City, and the Bay Area Doula Project, founded in 2011in San Francisco, were two of
      the first organized efforts to train doulas to provide abortion care and are now the largest
      in the United States. Scientific research on the impact of doulas during abortion and
      miscarriage management has been limited, but anecdotal reports from patients and providers
      suggest a positive impact on patient satisfaction. In this study we aim to test the impact of
      doulas on the physical, emotional, and overall experience among women undergoing a MVA for an
      early pregnancy failure or undesired pregnancy at the Penn Family Planning and Pregnancy Loss
      Center. We also aim to assess the impact of doula support from the medical assistants
      perception.
