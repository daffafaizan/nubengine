      system (PNS) activity with a central acetylcholinesterase inhibitor improves insulin
      sensitivity and reduces adipose tissue oxidation in obese African American women (AAW)
      compared to white women (WW). A cross-over study will be performed in matched cohorts of AAW
      and white women subjected to chronic central acetylcholinesterase inhibition with galantamine
      versus placebo, given orally over a 4-week period. Insulin sensitivity will be measured using
      the gold standard hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Adipose tissue will be obtained through
      subcutaneous fat biopsies where F2-isoprostanes will be quantified.
