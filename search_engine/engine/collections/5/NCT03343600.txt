    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicenter phase II clinical trial. In the trial,
      post-allo-HSCT patients with signs of bone marrow engraftment and without evidence of CMV
      reactivation will be enrolled. All enrolled patients will be monitored for their blood CMV
      DNA copy numbers by Q-PCR and safety throughout the trial. In addition to their routine
      post-allo-HSCT care, eligible patients will receive imatinib (100mg/tablet, 2 tablets daily)
      or placebo (2 tablets daily) administration after myeloid engraftment (defined as absolute
      neutrophil count higher than 500 for three consecutive days). While receiving the trial
      therapy, patients will have a regular CMV surveillance every week by the quantification of
      plasma CMV DNA copies. During the administration of the investigational drugs, other
      concomitant anti-CMV prophylaxis treatments are prohibited. When a patient has any signs
      suggesting CMV infection that the treating physician determines that an anti-CMV therapy is
      indicated, the patient will be defined as failure of prophylaxis for the efficacy evaluation.
      Whether the conventional anti-CMV therapy is started or not, the investigational drugs with
      imatinib or placebo will be continued till at least Day+100 unless the patient is defined as
      prophylaxis failure or withdraws from the study including personal reasons, early mortality,
      disease recurrence after transplantation, pregnancy, or the investigator decides that the
      subject should be withdrawn for safety reasons or physical conditions.
