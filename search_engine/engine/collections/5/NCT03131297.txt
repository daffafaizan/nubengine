    
      : Anal fistula treatment is associated with increasing risk of anal incontinence until 40% of
      cases. New and alternative treatments (glue, advancement flap, plugâ€¦) decrease this risk, but
      with fistula efficacy treatment in 40 to 60% of cases. Radiofrequency might destroy fistula
      tract without lesion of anal sphincter.

      Objective : Fistula healing rate and anal continence, 6 and 12 months after radiofrequency
      procedure.

      Methods : Clinical and MRI evaluation before, 6 and 12 months after treatment. Patients : 50
      patients with low, high, complex and Crohn disease fistula. An intermediate analysis is
      expected after the first 20 patients, to verify morbidity.

      Evaluations :

        -  Fistula clinical healing 6 and 12 months after procedure

        -  Fistula MRI healing 12 months after procedure

        -  Anal continence before and after procedure

        -  Feasibility og radiofrequency procedure

        -  Morbidity

        -  Success and failure prognostics factors of this procedure

      Schedule :

        -  First inclusion march 2017

        -  Last inclusion march 2018

        -  Evaluations until march 2019.
