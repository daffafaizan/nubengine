      alterations in the GAG- and PG profile appear to impact the quality of the dermal epidermal
      junction (DEJ). Previous biological and clinical evaluations of ER4017, a C-glycoside
      biomimetic of xylose, showed its capacity to stimulate GAG- and PG synthesis and to improve
      morphogenesis of the whole DEJ.

      The aim of the study is to investigate the gene expression in human epidermis treated with
      ER4017 following sequential sellotapes strips after a 3 months ER4017 topical application.
      For this purpose, the modulation of gene expression is determined using a cDNA microarray
      technology. Stratum corneum disruption is performed following 3 months topical application on
      skin inner forearms. All the experiments are performed in 10 elderly healthy men. Volunteers
      are clinically and biophysically evaluated at baseline and then at monthly intervals or at 3
      months respectively.
