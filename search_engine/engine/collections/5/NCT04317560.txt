      included. Patients were divided into 2 groups. In group 1 were treated with only
      artrosythesis. In group 2 were treated with artrosythesis and liquid platelet rich fibrin. In
      group 2, patients were injected with 1.5-2cc of liquid platelet-rich fibrin within the
      superior joint space at operation day. Pain and subjective dysfunction were recorded using a
      visual analog scale and Helkimo index at operation day and tenth day, one month later and 3
      months later.
