      the electronic medical record will be approached and consented as described above in "Subject
      Enrollment" and "Procedures for obtaining consent".

      For research purposes, 20mL of blood will be drawn and stored for biobanking at the following
      timepoints: at baseline (i.e., after enrollment and before randomization), 5-7 days
      post-randomization, and on the day of discharge.

      After enrollment and blood collection, patients will then be randomized to therapeutic
      anticoagulation (LMWH for most subjects but UFH for those with morbid obesity or moderate to
      severe renal dysfunction as noted below) or standard of care.

      Based on the MGH COVID-19 Treatment Guidance document, the risk stratification recommends
      daily complete blood count (CBC), comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP), creatine kinase (CPK),
      ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). In addition,
      PT, PTT, fibrinogen, and D-dimer are recommended to be checked every other day if in the ICU
      or daily if elevated. Given that by virtue of the inclusion criteria of our study (i.e., a
      D-dimer >1ug/mL), all of our patients will be within Category 3 and all of the above markers
      will be obtained for clinical purposes and thus will also be documented for research
      purposes. For clinical risk stratification, LDH is to be checked daily if elevated and
      troponin to be checked q2-3d if elevated. If clinically indicated, procalcitonin will be
      measured and IL-6 obtained in patients in Category 2 or 3 disease severity. If measured for
      clinical purposes, LDH, troponin, procalcitonin, and IL-6 will be recorded for research
      purposes.
