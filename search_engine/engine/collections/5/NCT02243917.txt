      pharmacodynamic profiles, the MTD and/or RP2D, and the effect of fed vs. fasted state on the
      bioavailability of orally administered CB-5083. The objectives of the dose expansion phase
      are to confirm the safety and tolerability of the RP2D, to further assess the PK and
      pharmacodynamic profiles and to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumor activity of CB-5083 in
      subjects with tumors for which there is biologic plausibility of unique sensitivity to
      CB-5083 mechanism of action (MOA) based on pre-clinical data. The objectives of the Food
      Effect Stage is to determine the effect of fed vs. fasted state on the bioavailability of
      orally administered CB-5083.
