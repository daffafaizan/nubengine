      prospective study investigating the gait evolution before and after a surgical treatment by
      long spinal instrumentation with pelvic fixation.

      Investigators are planning to analyze the gait, before and 6 months after surgery.
      Investigators will use 2 qualitative criterions with a gait analysis and a walking test, and
      1 quantitative criterion with a questionnaire assessing the patient's functional change.
      Investigators will use as surgical treatment a long double end spinal fixation without
      fusion, investigators use an ilio sacral screw as pelvic anchor on each side.

      Evaluation of changes in gait after pelvic fixation of a long spinal instrumentation will
      make it possible to extend or, on the contrary, restrict the indications for pelvic fixation
      surgery in walking patients, who are candidates for pelvic fixation.
