      of Naples. Patients with severe EPH were randomly assigned to Sympathectomy or Sympathicotomy
      Group in 1:1 ratio .

      Bilateral ETSs were performed in a one-stage procedure by the same surgeon. General
      anaesthesia using single-lung ventilation technique was performed and patient was placed in
      standard lateral thoracotomy position. Immediately after the induction of anaesthesia, a
      local infiltration with 2% lidocaine and epinephrine was injected at each port 5 minutes
      before the incision to reduce postoperative pain. The first port was placed in the 3th
      intercostal space below and anterior to inferior angle of scapula and through that a 10 mm 30
      degree camera was inserted. A second 5 mm working port was placed at the same intercostal
      space in the anterior axillary line. After identification of sympathetic chain, in
      Sympathectomy Group the T3 ganglion was excised at the top of the third rib while in
      Sympathicotomy Group the sympathetic chain was resected between T2-T3 ganglia at the same
      level but the T3 ganglion was left intact. At the end of the procedure, a 16 F drainage was
      inserted through the port and the lung was re-inflated to allow the air drainage from pleural
      cavity and to prevent pneumothorax. The drain was subsequently removed.

      All measurements on cardiac autonomic function were performed one week before ETS and
      different post-operative time-points (7 days, 1, 3 and 6 months after ETS). The results were
      prospectively registered and then retrospectively analyzed.
