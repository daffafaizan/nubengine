      healthy eating, increasing physical activity and reducing alcohol intake; however, few
      Canadians engage in behaviours that are in line with cancer prevention guidelines. This may
      be in part due to lack of access to evidence-based information and the mixed messages on
      effective cancer prevention strategies that are propagated in the popular media.

      The McMaster Optimal Aging Portal (the Portal) is a knowledge translation (KT) tool launched
      in 2014 to increase public access to trustworthy health information. Citizen-friendly content
      (blog posts, evidence summaries, web resource ratings) provide easy-to-read 'bottom line'
      messages appropriate for all audiences. Investigators would now like to know if and how KT
      strategies used to disseminate citizen-targeted information on cancer prevention impact
      knowledge, behavioural intentions and health behaviours of Canadian adults.

      This study will use a sequential mixed-methods design consisting of a two-arm randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) and a qualitative process study to explore RCT findings in depth. This
      formative approach will allow for a deeper analysis of the outcomes of interest (knowledge,
      intentions and behaviours), and the KT process. Following baseline data collection, eligible
      participants will be randomized to a 12-week intervention or control group.

      During the intervention, participants will have access to the Portal, be invited to follow a
      Twitter and Facebook feed, and receive tailored weekly email alerts including blog posts and
      evidence summaries on cancer prevention. Control group participants will have access the
      Portal in a 'self-serve' fashion, but will not receive KT strategies.
