      fasting from food and drinks. At 8.30 AM the study protocol will start. The studied subjects
      will lie calm supine in a ICU bed able to provide passive head up and head down tilt. They
      will be connected to a Siemens SC9000 monitor showing their ECG waves and to a Nexfin (BMEYE)
      monitor for continuous noninvasive blood pressure (NBP) assessment. Both waves (ECG and NBP)
      will be recorded on a laptop PC through analogic/digital input/output converter (PowerLab
      8/35, ADinstruments). The studied subjects will undergo to a sequence of (1) spontaneous
      breathing at 10 degrees head up, (2) spontaneous breathing at 7 degrees head down, (3)
      noninvasive ventilation at 10 degrees head up, and (4) noninvasive ventilation at 7 degrees
      head down. The sequence 1-2-3-4 will be randomized. After this four phases, a fluid challenge
      of ringer acetate 15ml*kg will be intravenously administered and the a sequence 1-2-3-4 will
      be repeated after a new randomization. Noninvasive ventilation will be provided with a facial
      mask with ventilatory setting: Psupp 8 cmH2O, PEEP 5 cmH2O, FiO2 0.28. Psupp will be
      decreased by 2 cmH2O steps if the inspiratory tidal volume will be >10ml*kg. During both
      spontaneous breathing and noninvasive ventilation the subjects will breathe following a
      metronome at 18bpm.

      HRV analysis will be conducted following the recommendation of the Task Force of the European
      Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology (see
      reference).

      Furthermore, the healthy volunteers will be studied by trans-thoracic ultrasound assessment
      with a Philips EPIQ7 sonographer, during each study phase.
