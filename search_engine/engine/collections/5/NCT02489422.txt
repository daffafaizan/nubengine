      I. To conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial of the yoga skills training (YST) versus a
      caring attention control (AC) group among adults with colorectal cancer (CRC) receiving
      chemotherapy to determine preliminary efficacy for the primary outcome of fatigue, secondary
      outcome of depressive symptoms, and possible mediators (i.e., psychological stress, circadian
      disruption, inflammation) as assessed by standard measures.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To measure the impact of the YST versus the AC on daily assessments of fatigue, depressive
      symptoms, and proposed mediators in the same trial and explore relationships among daily and
      standard assessments.

      II. To qualitatively assess perceived efficacy of the YST and AC and acceptability of new
      methodology through semi-structured interviews in a subset of 20-40 participants.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (YST): Patients participate in YST consisting of four 30 minute in-person yoga
      sessions at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8 that instructs skills to enhance mindfulness and promote
      relaxation, through instruction of awareness, movement, breathing practices, and meditation.

      GROUP II (AC): Patients participate in four 30 minute in-person sessions of supportive
      conversation at weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.
