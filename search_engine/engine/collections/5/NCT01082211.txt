      Primary

        -  To evaluate skin, breast, and chest wall adverse events occurring within 1 year after
           completion of 3D-conformal partial-breast re-irradiation following repeat
           breast-preserving surgery in patients with locally recurrent breast carcinoma.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the adverse events occurring after 1 year from the completion of
           re-irradiation and at any time.

        -  To evaluate in-breast control rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  To evaluate freedom-from-mastectomy rate in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the rate of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in this patient population and to
           document eradication of CTCs by locoregional therapy.

        -  To determine whether translational objective will correlate with eradication or presence
           of CTCs with in-breast recurrence and distant metastasis-free survival.

        -  To evaluate cosmesis as judged by the patient and independent evaluation.

        -  To evaluate distant metastasis-free survival, mastectomy-free survival, and overall
           survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal accelerated partial-breast irradiation twice daily,
      5 days a week, for 3 weeks.

      Some patients undergo blood sample collection at baseline and within 3 weeks after completion
      of radiotherapy for circulating tumor cells analysis.

      Some patients complete questionnaires on cosmesis at baseline and at 1 and 3 years following
      radiotherapy.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically for 4-5 years and
      then every year thereafter.
