      Northwest. We plan to recruit 10 female and 5 male volunteers. Each subject will donate
      her/his blood (20 milliliters) at three time points: a) before initiation of Ramadan, b) 14
      days later, and c) 30 days later (60 milliliters total over one month). Because the dates of
      Ramadan in 2021 occur on April 12th through May 11th, the three days of the blood collection
      will be April 10th, April 27th and May 11th Â± 1 day. Due to current COVID-19 restrictions,
      mass gatherings at mosque do not happen. This study deploys a mobile phlebotomist who is a
      licensed healthcare practitioner who will set up a droplet barrier phlebotomy station. The
      time of phlebotomy is determined based on the hydration status of each individual. The
      specimens will be packed in an ice cooler and processed (centrifuged and divided into
      aliquots) at Bastyr University Tierney laboratory and stored in a -80 degree Celsius freezer
      until analyzed at the same time for the three time points. Narrative data will also be
      collected through individual conversations (phone or in-person) at the completion of Ramadan,
      reflecting on the study and any heightened sense of spirituality.
