      Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) was incorporated as non-invasive treatment of many
      musculoskeletal conditions. However, the effects of ESWT on coccydynia are less discussed.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of ESWT on the outcomes of coccydynia.
      Patients were allocated to ESWT (n=20) or physical modality (SIT) group (n=21) randomly, and
      received total treatment duration of 4 weeks. The visual analog scale (VAS), Oswestry
      disability index (ODI), and self-reported satisfaction score were used to assess treatment
      effects. The VAS and ODI scores were significantly decreased after treatment in both groups,
      and the decrease in the VAS score was significantly greater in the ESWT group. The mean
      proportional changes in the ODI scores were greater in the ESWT group than in the SIT group,
      but the between-group difference was not statistically significant. The patients in the ESWT
      group had significantly higher subjective satisfaction scores than SIT group. The
      investigators concluded that ESWT is more effective and satisfactory in improving discomfort
      and disability caused by coccydynia than the use of physical modalities. Thus, ESWT is
      recommended as an optimal treatment option for patients with coccydynia.
