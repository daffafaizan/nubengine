      medication), double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study. Subjects meeting all the
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria during Visit 1 (Screening Visit) will
      enter a two week Run-in Period. Subjects failing screening will not be eligible for
      re-screening. During the run-in and double-blind treatment periods subjects will maintain an
      electronic daily diary to record morning and evening peak expiratory flow (PEF), asthma
      symptom scores and rescue albuterol/salbutamol use. At Visit 2 (end of run-in/Randomisation
      Visit), subjects meeting the eligibility criteria will be randomised receive treatment with
      either fluticasone furoate 50 mcg once daily, fluticasone propionate 100 mcg twice daily or
      placebo. In addition all subjects will be supplied with albuterol/salbutamol inhalation
      aerosol to use as required to treat symptoms. Subjects will attend 6 on-treatment visits at
      Visits 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 18 and 24 respectively). Subjects will receive
      treatment for 24 weeks. A follow-up contact will be performed 1-week after completing study
      medication (Visit 9). Subjects will participate in the study for up to a maximum of 27 weeks
      (including screening, treatment and follow-up contact).
