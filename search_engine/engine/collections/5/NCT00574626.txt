      cytarabine, and cytoxan (BEAC) with autologous hematopoietic rescue. The patients will be
      stratified according to good and poor prognosis category and relapsed vs. first partial
      response categories. The patients will have bone marrow or peripheral stem cells collected
      according to standard protocols. A standardized hematopoietic growth factor will be used for
      mobilization and post-transplant. The patients' PSC or BM product will be assayed via
      invitro-culture techniques for occult tumor, and by molecular biologic assays. The patients'
      outcome for transplantation will be evaluated with response to transplantation, relapse rates
      and event free survival being the measured end points.
