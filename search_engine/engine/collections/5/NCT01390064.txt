      breast cancer subjects will be enrolled into the study. The vaccine doses will be prepared
      and dispensed by the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences (UAMS) Pharmacy following
      the manufacturer's instructions. Subjects will receive 1.0 mL subcutaneous (SC) injections of
      the vaccine on 5 separate occasions during Weeks 1, 2, 3, 7, and 19. The first cohort will
      begin with the 300 mg dose, and then the subsequent cohorts will escalate to 500 mg or
      de-escalate to 100 mg as determined by the toxicity criteria. The immunization at week 19 is
      considered a booster immunization. The vaccine will be administered at rotating sites on the
      limbs or abdomen. The study will last for approximately 12 - 24 months.
