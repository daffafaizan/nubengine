      inclusion and exclusion criteria, informed consent will be obtained. If a patient does not
      wish to participate in this study, he/she will receive alternative treatment at the
      discretion of their ED provider.

      The provider will place orders in the electronic medical record for "Headache study order
      set". This order set includes Compazine® 10 mg IV, Benadryl® 25 mg IV, and "study drug".
      Pharmacy will receive the order for the study drug. The research pharmacist will randomly
      assign participants to group A (1000 mg Ofirmev®) or group B (15 mg ketorolac). He/she will
      fill medication vials and IV bags in each "study kit". The kit for group A will contain a
      100mL bag containing 1000 mg acetaminophen and a placebo vial of normal saline as well as
      both Compazine® and Benadryl®. The kit for group B will contain 100mL 0.9% normal saline and
      a vial containing 15 mg ketorolac as well as Compazine® and Benadryl®. The "study kit" will
      be sent to the emergency department via the tube system. When the study kit arrives, he/she
      will give each patient Compazine® and Benadryl®, hang the IV bag, and administer the contents
      of the vial. Therefore, every patient will receive a "push" of the contents in the vial
      (ketorolac or normal saline) and an 100mL infusion (Ofirmev or normal saline).
