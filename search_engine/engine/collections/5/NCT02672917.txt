    
      Open label, multicenter, non-randomized, dose escalation/expansion trial of MVT-5873 as a
      single agent and in combination with modified FOLFIRINOX (mFOLFIRINOX) in subjects with
      pancreatic and other CA19-9 positive malignancies. The study will define a Maximum Tolerated
      Dose (MTD) of MVT-5873 for a Q2 week schedule (Group D), an MTD of MVT-5873 for a Q4 week
      schedule (Group C), and an MTD for a Q2 week schedule of MVT-5873 in combination with
      mFOLFIRINOX (Group E). Each group will utilize a conventional 3+3 study design to identify
      the MTD and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      Following the definition of an MTD in each group, the RP2D of MVT-5873 as a single agent and
      in combination with mFOLFIRINOX will be defined. Following the completion of the dose
      escalation phase for each group, an expansion group of up to 30 additional subjects will be
      treated at the RP2D for each group. In Group D, subjects will be subdivided into two groups
      of up to 15 subjects: subjects without peripheral blood expression of CA19-9 and subjects
      with peripheral blood expression of CA19-9. MVT-5873 pharmacokinetics (PK) and
      pharmacodynamics (PD) will be determined in each group.
