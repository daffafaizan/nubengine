      with increased risk of concussion (also known as mild traumatic brain injury, or mTBI) and
      sub-concussive injury from repeated head impacts (RHI) due to the aggressive and high-speed
      nature of the game. Current protective equipment used by players are not sufficient to reduce
      concussion incidence and severity, nor are there any therapeutics available to prevent
      concussion. This study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial to determine
      if an omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) fish oil supplement containing 3.0 grams of
      docosahexaenoic acid (DHA; 22:6n-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA; 20:5n-3) can reduce blood
      biomarkers of sub-concussion injuries compared to placebo (high-oleic safflower oil) over a
      course of the American football season among collegiate football athletes.

      The dosage of DHA/EPA used in this study is generally safe, and procedures involved, monthly
      blood draws, surveys, and Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), pose minimal risks to
      participants. While this study provides no direct benefit to participants, successful
      outcomes of this study can benefit the society by shedding light on development of potential
      preventative therapeutics for sports-induced mTBI and brain injury from RHI. The risk-benefit
      profile is appropriate for conducting this study. Based on preclinical studies and previous
      clinical study results, the investigators expect that in comparison to placebo treatment, DHA
      and EPA treatment throughout the course of one American football season can maintain lower
      levels of sub-concussion associated biomarkers, inflammatory cytokines, and cardiovascular
      risk markers. The investigators also expect participants treated with DHA and EPA to have
      lower brain MRI imaging markers of sub concussion injury.
