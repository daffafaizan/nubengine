      have built a combined closed-loop anesthesia system using BIS as the control variable, two
      proportional-integral-differential control algorithms, a propofol and a remifentanil
      target-controlled infusion systems as the control actuators. A recent study has shown that
      such system is able to provide clinically adequate anesthesia. The aim of the present study
      is to assess the system during rigid bronchoscopy. Two groups of patients are compared: one
      in which propofol and remifentanil are administered by the anesthesiologist using
      target-controlled infusion systems, and one in which propofol and remifentanil are
      administered automatically by the combined closed-loop anesthesia system. In both groups, the
      goal is to maintain BIS between 40 and 60, the recommended range during anesthesia by the
      manufacturer. We expect the combined closed-loop anesthesia system group to do similar or
      better.
