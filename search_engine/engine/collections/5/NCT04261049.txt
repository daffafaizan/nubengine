      leads to diminished physical activity, a lesser quality of life, as well as a higher risk of
      inactivity related comorbidities including mortality. This is thought to be caused by an
      inability to voluntarily activate your quadriceps muscle due, in part, to knee joint swelling
      and joint-related pain. Incomplete muscle activation causes quadriceps weakness.

      Individuals with quadriceps weakness exhibit changes in their walking biomechanics which is
      associated with diminished physical function and lesser physical activity in those with knee
      OA. Therefore, it is critical to develop interventions that target mechanisms causing
      decreased quadriceps activation in order to restore optimal walking biomechanics and improve
      physical activity.

      The ZILRETTA knee injection is an FDA approved, extended release corticosteroid for in
      patients with knee osteoarthritis and has been shown to reduced knee pain for 3 months in
      approximately 70% of patients. Currently, there are no studies that have examined ZILRETTA's
      objective effectiveness on physical activity, biomechanics, and performance tests in patients
      who have received an injection.

      The overall purpose of the current study is to examine the effect of a ZILRETTA knee
      injection on functional and performance tests including quadriceps neuromuscular activation,
      quadriceps strength, walking gait biomechanics, and a battery of physical performance
      outcomes at 4 and 8-weeks following injection in 35 individuals with knee OA.
