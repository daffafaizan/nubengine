      cytogenetic response to interferon will have improved survival times. In addition, evidence
      exists that even patients who do not demonstrate a cytogenetic response to interferon
      treatment can still benefit from treatment, in terms of survival, compared to patients not
      treated with interferon. This indicates that if a patient is better able to tolerate
      interferon, he or she may have improved survival even without cytogenetic response.
      Preliminary studies suggest that PEG-Intron is more convenient for patients (administered
      once weekly rather than daily), is better tolerated than interferon, and can produce
      hematologic remission in interferon-a resistant patients. Phase II studies are needed to
      ascertain the overall hematologic and cytogenetic response rates to PEG-Intron in such
      patients.
