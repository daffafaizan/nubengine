palliation by radiotherapythe purpose of radiotherapy in the managementof cancer of the lung is first to cure the disease;second, to prolong useful and comfortable exist-ence; and third, to provide comfort and relief ofsuffering to those who are symptomatic and in-curable.cancers of the lung vary quite widely in theirresponse to radiation.  those of glandular origin,the adenocarcinoma, are more often than not ofmodest susceptibility and sometimes quite resis-tant.  the very undifferentiated, the so-called oat-cell cancers, are often of exquisite sensitivity, re-sponding to irradiation almost like lymphomas.most cancer of the lung, however, is squamous-cellcarcinoma and as such may be considered to bemoderately radiosensitive in much the same orderof magnitude as squamous-cell carcinoma of theskin, cervix or larynx, and should, in theory, becurable by this means in the same degree.  unfor-tunately, this has to date not been found to betrue.  the reasons are principally two: first andforemost, by the time a diagnosis is made, cancerof the lung has more often than not, estimated at80% and more, spread beyond the site of origin,thus making cure by any effective means presentlyavailable unlikely.  second, the substrate in whichthe cancer grows, the lung, tolerates radiation lesswell than do the tissues which surround the highlyradiocurable epithelial cancers such as carcinoma ofthe skin, cervix, and larynx, thus making an un-favorable therapeutic ratio.
