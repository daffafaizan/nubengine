      most important drawbacks of PDT is the pain during illumination.

      It has been shown that daylight PDT is an effective treatment for actinic keratosis. In order
      to examine the efficacy of daylight PDT for acne vulgaris, we used a split-face design: the
      face was divided into two symmetrical contralateral treatment areas: the left was covered
      with a light-impermeable dressing, while the right face was exposed to daylight. After 2
      hours outdoors, the right side of the face was covered, and the left half was illuminated
      with red light.
