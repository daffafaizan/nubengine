      study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide administered as
      maintenance treatment to subjects with CLL who have responded to first-line therapy
      (induction) achieving a response of at least PR and are at high risk of early progression.
      This study will compare the efficacy of lenalidomide maintenance treatment versus placebo at
      prolonging progression free survival (PFS); and as secondary endpoints assess overall
      survival, the safety of lenalidomide treatment and evaluate Minimal residual disease (MRD)
      kinetics in peripheral blood whilst subjects are on maintenance.

      Although maintenance therapy has been established in recent years for the treatment of a
      subset of subjects with Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL), it is a novel concept in the management
      of CLL. It is not regularly used and only a limited number of small studies have been
      conducted evaluating consolidation/maintenance therapy for limited periods of time with
      alemtuzumab or rituximab. Based on the limited amount of available data, it appears that
      maintenance therapy may improve the quality of remission in CLL subjects and prolong
      progression-free survival (PFS). A large phase 3 trial investigating lenalidomide as
      maintenance following response to second line therapy is ongoing. However, a large
      well-controlled study has not been conducted to investigate the beneficial effect of
      maintenance therapy following front line therapy; specifically in subjects with aggressive
      disease. This phase 3 study will evaluate whether lenalidomide maintenance therapy will
      prolong PFS in CLL subjects with a high risk of early progression following first line
      treatment.
