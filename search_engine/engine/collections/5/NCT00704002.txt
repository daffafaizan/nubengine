      isolated, displaced neck fractures of the fifth metacarpal. The primary outcome criterion is
      the functional status measured by the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH)
      questionnaire. Secondary outcome criteria are pain, range of motion (ROM), grip strength, and
      radiological parameters.
