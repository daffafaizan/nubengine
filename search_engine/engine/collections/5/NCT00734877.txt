      (MEL200)-based tandem transplant approach, consisting of mucosal and other toxicities.

      For the TT4 trial, we are proposing to compare standard TT3 (S-TT3) to TT3-Lite (L-TT3).
      L-TT3 will employ various strategies aimed at improving the therapeutic Index of S-TT3 by
      reducing toxicities while maintaining the superior results reported for S-TT3 in terms of
      frequency and duration of CR, EFS, and. The following strategies will be utilized in L-TT3:

        -  Applying only 1 instead of 2 cycles of induction and consolidation therapy prior to and
           after tandem transplant. This is supported by the well known association between prior
           exposure to mucotoxic therapies4, 5 and worse post-transplant mucositis, particularly
           when etoposide is used in the mobilizing regimen6 such as in VDTPACE.

      Note: Randomization has been discontinued and accrual is closed to the L-TT3 arm. This trial
      is currently enrolling as a single-arm trial for patients to receive S-TT3.
