      I. To compare the proportion of patients progression-free one year after treatment with
      axitinib plus androgen deprivation versus (vs.) androgen deprivation therapy alone and
      surgery in newly diagnosed prostate cancer patients with lymph node metastases (TxN1M0 or
      TxNxM1a) or clinical suspicion of lymph node metastases.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the rate of pathologic complete response (pCR) in the primary tumor.

      II. To evaluate time to progression. III. Describe the perioperative and postoperative
      morbidity of pre-surgical treatment.

      IV. Evaluate the effects of a 6-month time course of androgen deprivation with or without
      axitinib in prostate cancer tissue and blood.

      V. Develop a prospective tissue archive of prostate tumors that have metastasized to lymph
      nodes.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive antiandrogen therapy per standard care for 8 weeks.

      Patients are then randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive antiandrogen therapy per standard care and axitinib orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) for 4 months. Patients then undergo radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node
      dissection.

      ARM II: Patients receive antiandrogen therapy per standard care for 4 months and then undergo
      radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 and 3 months, every 3
      months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly
      thereafter.
