      of sarcopenia increases with age. Muscle atrophy is caused by an imbalance between the
      anabolic and catabolic processes in chronic kidney disease. Sarcopenia and physical
      inactivity progress synergistically. Decreased physical performance is associated with
      sarcopenia. In hemodialysis patients, daily physical activity level and physical performance
      decrease. Cognitive impairment is common in chronic kidney disease. Uremic toxins can cause a
      decrease in cognitive function. One of the most important problems associated with
      hemodialysis is pain and pain negatively affects functional capacity and quality of life.
