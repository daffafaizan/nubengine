      the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in Western countries. One-year survival of
      patients with best supportive care remains low. Non-small-cell lung cancer accounts for
      almost 85% of all lung cancer cases. Approximately 70% of patients have locally advanced or
      metastatic disease at presentation and are not candidates for surgery.
