      survival, and quality of life in patients with stage IIIB or IV non-small cell lung cancer
      treated with 3 versus 6 courses of mitomycin, vinblastine, and cisplatin.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by stage of disease
      (stage IIIB vs IV). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive
      cisplatin IV over 4 hours, mitomycin IV, and vinblastine IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Mitomycin is not administered during course 3. Arm II: Patients receive chemotherapy as in
      arm I. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Mitomycin is not administered during courses 3 and 5. Quality of life
      is assessed after completion of 3 courses of chemotherapy for patients in arm I and after
      completion of 4, 5, and 6 courses for those in arm II. Patients may receive radiotherapy
      beginning after completion of chemotherapy.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 310 patients will be accrued for this study.
