    
      A prospective study of 30 patients with senile or complicated cataract scheduled to do
      phacoemulsification surgery in Tanta University Hospital

      Two groups will be divided:

        1. Group (1): Cataract will no diabetic retinopathy

        2. Group (2): Cataract associated with diabetic retinopathy.

      All patients will be subject to Full ophthalmologic examination before the surgery. Imaging
      will include OCTA. OCTA will be performed using cirrus OCT (Zeiss, Inc., USA). High-quality 6
      x 6 mm OCTA macular scans and 3 × 3-mm papillary scan with strong signal-noise ratio with
      adequate centration on the fovea and optic nerve head respectively will be selected.

      Segmentation will be used to evaluate superﬁcial and deep capillary retinal plexus
      projections in addition to the choriocapillaries. If errors in segmentation were detected,
      manual correction would be performed. The superﬁcial retinal capillary plexus (SCP) will be
      delineated with an inner boundary at the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and an outer
      boundary 10 µm inside the inner plexiform layer (IPL). The deep retinal capillary plexus
      (DCP) will be segmented with an inner boundary 10 µm inside the IPL and an outer boundary at
      10 µm beneath the outer plexiform layer (OPL).

      The vessel density metric from enface OCT angiogram will be used as an indicator of macular
      retinal and papillary perfusion. Vessel density (VD) analysis computes the percentage of area
      occupied by OCTA detected vasculature in a measured area. Choriocapillaries flow voids will
      be computed to assess choriocapillaries circulation.

      The measurements of the OCTA, axial length, intraocular pressure will be obtained before the
      phacoemulsification surgery. Optical coherence tomography and IOP measurements will also be
      obtained 1 week after surgery.
