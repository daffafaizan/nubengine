      which IF will be compared to a standard western diet. Patients will be recruited at the John
      L. Trotter MS center and randomly assigned to either a standard western diet or an IF diet
      (1:1). Enrolled subjects will complete a clinical and laboratory assessment before starting
      the diet (baseline), at week 6 and at end of the study (week 12). The primary outcome will be
      leptin at week 12 measured in the peripheral blood. Secondary outcomes will be: 1) peripheral
      blood metabolic profiling; 2) anthropometric (body mass index and waist circumference) and
      total body fat measures; 3) gut microbiota richness and composition.
