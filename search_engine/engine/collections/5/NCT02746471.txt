      study will characterize clinical actions initiated by Reveal LINQ arrhythmia detection and
      estimate procedure-related acute infection rate. Approximately 1,500 subjects will be
      implanted with a Reveal LINQ ICM and undergo continuous remote monitoring and be followed
      prospectively from insertion through 36 months.
