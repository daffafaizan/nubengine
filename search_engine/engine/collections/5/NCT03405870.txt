      from metabolic and immunologic derangements that lead to organ dysfunction, shock and
      sometimes death. Both "good" (high density lipoprotein, HDL) and "bad" (low density
      lipoprotein, LDL) cholesterol should be protective against sepsis by helping to clear
      bacterial toxins from the blood stream and by providing a fuel for endogenous
      corticosteroids, part of the body's protective stress-response in shock. However, for
      partially unknown reasons, cholesterol levels drop to critically low levels in early sepsis,
      leaving the body unable to protect itself against sepsis via these mechanisms. Currently,
      lipid emulsions are available that are FDA approved for intravenous nutrition in critically
      ill patients (including sepsis) and may be capable of elevating serum cholesterol levels.
      This Phase II randomized pilot clinical trial, proposes to assess the following in a cohort
      of patients with early sepsis (first 24 hours): 1) safety and tolerability of the proposed
      lipid injectable emulsion (Smoflipid) and any adverse effects, 2) the drugs ability to
      optimally elevate cholesterol at 48 hours, and 3) preliminary measures of biological activity
      and clinical outcomes.
