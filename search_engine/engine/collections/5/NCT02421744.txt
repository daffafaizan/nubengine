    
      This is a single blind randomized-controlled trial to test the effects of a task oriented
      training on locomotor function, mobility and balance in multiple sclerosis subjects with mild
      to moderate gait impairments (EDSS 4-5.5).

      Subjects and methods:54 multiple sclerosis patients will be recruited in two outpatient
      rehabilitation clinics (Azienda Ospedaliero- Universitaria di Ferrara and Azienda
      Ospedaliero-Universitaria Pisana). Informed consent will be obtained. Participants enrolled
      will be included in 2 different treatment groups: experimental group will receive 10 TOCT
      sessions over 2 weeks (2 hours/each session) followed by a 3 months home exercise program,
      whereas control group will be included into a delayed-treatment group. Three subjects with a
      supervisor physiotherapist will take part at the TOCT. Primary outcome measure will be
      walking endurance (Six Minute Walking Test); as secondary outcome we will test gait speed
      (Timed 25-Foot Walk), balance (Dynamic Gait Index) and mobility (Time Up and Go Test);
      through self-assessment questionnaires we will evaluate motor fatigue (Modified Fatigue
      Impact Scale - MFIS), walking ability (Multiple Sclerosis Walking Scale - 12), health-related
      quality of life (Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale - 29 and Functional Assessment of Multiple
      Sclerosis). In addition to clinical outcomes, in a convenience sample we will have: (i)
      balance assessment (force platform); (ii) motorcortex oxygenation during walking (fNIRS);
      (iii) muscle oxygenation (NIRS); (iv) force and EMG signal; (v) mechanical and electrical
      fatigue assessment; (vi) brain connectivity (EEG). Outcome measures will be assessed 1 week
      prior to treatment initiation (T0), after two weeks to treatment initiation (T1), after the 3
      months exercise program (T2) and at 3 months follow-up (T3) to evaluate treatments retention,
      by a clinician blinded to the treatment.

      The specific aims will be (i) to test the effects on walking, mobility, balance, fatigue and
      health-related quality of life; (ii) to test the effects on cerebral oxygenation (fNIRS)
      during walking; (iii) muscle oxygenation (NIRS); (iv) force and EMG signal; (v) Mechanical
      and electrical fatigue assessment; (vi) brain connectivity (EEG) and (vii) to investigate the
      3 months home exercise program's feasibility, satisfaction and adherence.
