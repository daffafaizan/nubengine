      of perceptual processing are unlikely to improve during 6 weeks' treatment with placebo,
      while being very responsive to either imipramine or fluoxetine. Depressed patients who do not
      show evidence of poor right hemispheric functioning respond significantly more often to
      placebo than those with poor right hemispheric functioning , and do not show an advantage of
      drug over placebo. 100 patients will be tested with verbal and nonverbal dichotic tests, and
      then treated sequentially with bupropion, escitalopram, and imipramine. Preferential
      hemisphere for auditory processing will be correlated with treatment outcome.
