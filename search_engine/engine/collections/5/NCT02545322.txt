    
      Aim of this study is the clinical evaluation of an image-guided adaptive radiotherapy (ART)
      concept. This involves the adaption of the radiotherapy treatment plan according to changes
      in tissues and variations in patients position and posture during a radiotherapy treatment
      course, based on repeat CT scans.

      It is prospectively investigated, if dosimetric improvements can be achieved using this
      approach and if the method using the software-package "ReDeform" can be implemented in
      clinical Routine. For that purpose 2 repeat CT scans are acquired during the radiotherapy
      course (week 3 and week 5 of radiotherapy). The Initial CT scan is "matched" to the follow-up
      CT-scan by means of deformable image registration.
