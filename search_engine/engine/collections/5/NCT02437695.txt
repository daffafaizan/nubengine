      peripheral neuropathy, lumbar-cervical discopathy, or history of orthopaedic surgery or
      trauma will exclude. The demographic data of patients, ASA, Charlson Comorbidity Index (CMI),
      Body Mass Index (BMI), operating time (OT) and Trendelenburg time (TT) will obtain from
      patient records. Patients will be questioned as to whether or not PPI had developed, if so,
      in which extremity, in what form (sensory-motor), duration, whether or not a doctor had been
      consulted, if so, what treatment had been given and whether or not the PPI had continued.
