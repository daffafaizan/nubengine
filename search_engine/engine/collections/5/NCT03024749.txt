      involved in the study. The investigators set up a more detailed classification system for
      spinal vascular malformations. In accordance with inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria,
      this cohort study will include 380 samples in the study period of three years. According to
      the spinal angiography, the correct diagnosis and treatment strategy will be made. The
      minimally invasive surgical treatment methods and new techniques will be adopted such as
      spinal superselective angiography, preoperative embolization, intraoperative
      electrophysiological monitoring, intraoperative angiography, etc. All the enrolled patients
      will be visited a total of four times, postoperative day 1 and postoperative day 7, followed
      up postoperative 3 months and 12 months. The anatomical cure rate and spinal cord function
      will be assessed objectively. All data will be recorded in the network database platform.
