      increase the dose to 3.0 mg/day following 28 days of treatment. The selected dose levels (1.5
      and 3.0 mg/day ABR-215757) are predicted to be effective based on preclinical studies of
      autoimmune disease including the SLE MRL model. Previous experience in humans as well as in
      preclinical models supports safe administration of ABR-215757 at doses up to and including
      3.0 mg/day. The duration of the study is expected to be sufficient to detect changes in
      disease activity in this group of patients. Near steady state plasma levels of ABR-215757 in
      humans are reached in 14 days.
