      difficult intubation algorithm by the American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) in 2013
      (1). Videolaryngoscopes are known to be superior to traditional direct laryngoscopy in cases
      of difficult airway, glottic visualisation is obtained more easily and less airway trauma is
      seen (2). Portable videolaryngoscope which is used in difficult airways (3). There are 2, 3,
      and 4 numbered blades. In the light source of the blade of the videolaryngoscope, there is a
      camera which is connected to a video screen monitor. In addition to passing soft tissues by
      visualisation, the camera is helpful in defining the glottic appearance (1).

      There are studies which have compared the hemodynamic response and increase in IOP in
      intubation using direct laryngoscope and various videolaryngoscopes and airway devices .
      However, to the best of our knowledge there is no study comparing the effect on the increase
      in IOP of videolaryngoscope and direct laryngoscope. The aim of the current study was to
      compare IOP, hemodynamic parameters and throat pain in the use of videolaryngoscope and the
      direct laryngoscope.
