      morphine and its metabolites, M3G and M6G, across the blood-brain barrier.

      Study phase: IV Study Design: This is a sequential enrolment study design in which elective
      surgical patients presenting for repair of an ascending thoracic aneurysm and fitted with a
      CSF drain as part of their standard of care will be approached for permission to draw blood
      samples at specified times during their hospital course. Concomitantly, samples of CSF will
      be collected from the CSF drainage system (CSF is normally wasted).

      Morphine will be used as the primary analgesic agent (this is within the standard of care).
      Samples will be collected at specified time intervals for 5 days or until the CSF drain is
      removed (whichever comes first). Samples collected will be analysed for morphine, its 3- and
      6- glucuronide metabolites, inflammatory cytokines, markers of CNS injury and anatomical
      integrity of the BBB. Area under the concentration vs. time curve will be calculated and the
      effect on morphine metabolism and penetration across the BBB will be determined using a
      repeated measures analysis of variance technique (as used in our previous study).
