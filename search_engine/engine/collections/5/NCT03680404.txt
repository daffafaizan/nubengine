      and ethnicities represented in CVD prevalence. Unfortunately, a disparity exists such that
      the black population (BL) is disproportionately affected compared to other groups, including
      the white population (WH). While the underlying cause of this disparity is multifactorial,
      vascular dysfunction (i.e., impaired vasodilation and/or augmented vasoconstriction) is a key
      contributor. As has been previously observed, BL exhibit a heightened vasoconstrictor
      response to both pharmacological (e.g., alpha-adrenergic receptor agonists) and environmental
      (e.g., cold pressor test) stimuli compared to their WH counterparts. Additionally, reactive
      oxygen species (ROS) and the subsequent reduction in nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability may
      partially mediate this response.

      Interestingly, the small blood vessels in the skin (cutaneous microvasculature) in BL, but
      otherwise healthy individuals, produce an impaired blood flow response to local heating when
      compared to age-, body mass index (BMI)-, and gender-matched WH. However, pre-treatment of
      the cutaneous microvasculature with either allopurinol or apocynin (xanthine oxidase
      inhibitor and NADPH oxidase inhibitor, respectively) abolishes this skin blood flow
      difference. These drugs inhibit possible sources of ROS, which, as mentioned, may be
      mediating the heightened vasoconstrictor response in BL. Accordingly, apocynin administration
      in previous research using an animal model ameliorates alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated
      vasoconstriction, possibly due to a reduction in ROS. The role of xanthine/NADPH oxidase and
      the production of ROS on alpha-adrenergic receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in humans
      remains unknown.
