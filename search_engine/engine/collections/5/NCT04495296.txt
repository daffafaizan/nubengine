    
      There are two parts in the study. Part I is mono-therapy dose escalation and dose expansion
      study, and Part II is dose escalation and dose expansion study of combination therapy.

      Part I: Mono-therapy dose escalation and dose expansion study:

        1. Mono-therapy dose escalation regimen: The dose escalation study will be conducted using
           3+3 dose escalation method at two dosing regimens, i.e."once every 2 weeks
           (Q2W)"and"once every 3 weeks (Q3W)".

        2. Mono-therapy dose expansion regimen: When the dose level in Q2W group in the
           mono-therapy dose escalation study is escalated to the MTD/MAD/RP2D, two expansion
           cohorts will be added at this dose level with about 30 (20-40) subjects with positive
           CLDN18.2 expression.

      Group A: TST001 RP2 DG/GEJ adenocarcinoma with positive CLDN18.2 expression 20-40 Group B:
      TST001 RP2D Non-G/GEJ adenocarcinoma with positive CLDN18.2 expression 20-40

      Part II: Dose escalation and dose expansion study of combination medication

      The dose escalation and dose expansion study will be conducted in the following two cohorts:

      Group C - first line: TST001+CAPOX Positive CLDN18.2 expression GEJ C 20-40 Group
      D-second-line +: TST001+paclitaxel Positive CLDN18.2 expression G/GEJ 20-40

      The trial will last approximately 3 years from the enrollment to the completion of both Par I
      and II studies, sample size approximate 165-210 subjectsï¼Œwith assessments including safety
      labs, ECGs, MUGA scans, PKs and PDs and CT/MRI tumor assessments, based on the Q2W and Q3W
      dosing schedules.
