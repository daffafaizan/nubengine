      Primary

        -  Determine the therapeutic activity of neoadjuvant induction therapy comprising
           gemcitabine, cisplatin, and gefitinib in patients with stage IIIA non-small cell lung
           cancer undergoing surgery.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the stage downsizing and complete resectability rate in patients with no
           progressive disease who undergo surgery after treatment with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

      Patients receive induction therapy comprising gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
      22, 29, 43, and 50; cisplatin IV over 3-6 hours on days 2, 23, and 44; and oral gefitinib
      once daily on days 51-79. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Within 2-7 days after completion of induction therapy, patients with
      no progressive disease undergo tumor resection.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at least every 3 months for 2
      years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 55 patients will be accrued for this study.
