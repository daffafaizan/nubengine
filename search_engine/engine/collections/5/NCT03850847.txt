      1, a semi-structured interviews with SDMs will be conducted. The sampling frame will balance
      interviews with those that were approached or not for organ donation, and consented or not to
      organ donation. Interviews will be informed by two complementary theoretical frameworks.
      Building on Step 1 results, in Step 2 a national telephone survey of SDMs will be conducted
      to test which factors are associated with end-of-life decisions.
