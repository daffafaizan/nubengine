    
      This is a 24 week, open-label, non-randomized, phase II study evaluating intravitreal
      ranibizumab dosed every 14 days in subjects with exudative macular degeneration who have
      persistent intraretinal or subretinal fluid despite chronic monthly anti-VEGF therapy (>6
      months). Subjects must have had a minimum of 5 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections administered
      every 4-6 weeks in the 6 months preceding enrollment.

      Consented, enrolled subjects will receive multiple open-label intravitreal injections of 0.5
      mg ranibizumab administered every 14 days (Â± 3 days). Subjects who have resolution of fluid
      will convert to monthly ranibizumab for the remainder of the study. If fluid recurs, subjects
      will return to biweekly treatment.

      Patients will be assigned to receive treatment with either ranibizumab vial or PFSs so that
      approximately 10 patients will be treated with each delivery method option, and syringe
      preparation time (SPT) will be measured by an assistant who will be observing the procedure
      and timing with an automated stopwatch.
