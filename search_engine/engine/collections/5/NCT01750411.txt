      treatments. The SARP will gain a better understanding of asthma and its endotypes, in
      children and adults, by defining the disease at the molecular and cellular levels in the
      context of the temporal phenotypic expression of the disease. To this end, the SARP
      investigators will utilize both mechanistic and evoked phenotype approaches to: 1)
      characterize developmental molecular, cellular and physiologic phenotypes in children and
      adults with mild to severe asthma, and 2) to further elucidate the evolving pathobiology and
      pathogenesis of severe asthma and its sub-phenotypes and 3) compare these features over time.
      This approach involves a shared longitudinal protocol conducted across all participating
      centers which includes common information on all SARP participants. Additionally, SARP
      investigators have each identified mechanistic research questions to be included in the
      shared longitudinal protocol. At Wake Forest University investigators are specifically
      interested in genetic influences on disease severity and the use of statistical modeling
      techniques to better understand disease phenotypes. Together, these longitudinal and
      mechanistic approaches will enable prediction of phenotype stability/fluctuation and
      pharmacologic responses and identification of novel, disease-modifying targets for treatment.
