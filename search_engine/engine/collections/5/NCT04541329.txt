      a FDA-approved medication for the treatment of cutaneous psoriasis. This study will examine
      how Tildrakizumab affects immune cells within psoriatic skin lesions. Fifteen subjects with
      moderate to severe psoriasis will be enrolled. Biopsy samples will be collected and undergo
      molecular profiling to correlate profiles with and to predict Tildrakizumab treatment
      response.
