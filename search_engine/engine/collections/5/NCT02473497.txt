    
      Crizotinib is indicated in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with metastatic non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose tumors are anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive as
      detected by an FDA-approved test. Commercially available dosage forms are 250 mg and 200 mg
      capsules. This expanded access protocol (EAP) is designed to provide access to an alternative
      oral formulation of crizotinib for those patients who are unable to swallow capsules.
