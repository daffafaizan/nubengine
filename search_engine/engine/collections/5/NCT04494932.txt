      1985, and have been reported to be present in up to 26% of shoulder arthroscopies. While the
      exact cause of SLAP tears is unknown, they are often related to traumatic events and sports
      activity, particularly overhead sports such as baseball. Type II SLAP tears, which are
      characterized by superior labral fraying with a detached biceps anchor, are the most common
      subtype, based on the classification by Snyder et al. Treatment options include SLAP repair,
      biceps tenodesis, biceps tenotomy, and debridement.

      One of the common complaints after SLAP repair is pain and stiffness. However, the more
      recently-described Biceps Tenodesis for SLAP tears improves upon this by addressing the long
      head of biceps which is thought to be the pain sources. However, only one small prior RCT has
      evaluated this, finding minimal difference. Both procedures are currently considered standard
      of care, and are decided upon based on patient and surgeon preference.

      This will be a single-center randomized controlled trial. The study is comparing SLAP repair
      and biceps tenodesis in patients under 30 undergoing surgery for SLAP tears. The purpose of
      the proposed study is to evaluate the effect of SLAP repair versus biceps tenodesis in the
      management of SLAP tears in patients under 30 years old.
