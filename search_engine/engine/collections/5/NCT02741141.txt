    
      The main purpose of this study is to show a significant decrease of the CS rate with the use
      of the new partograph developed by Neal and Lowe.

      Secondary purposes are

        -  To reduce the use of oxytocin during labour without increasing maternal or neonatal
           morbidity;

        -  To decrease immediate per-operative complications and post-operative complications
           associated with CS
