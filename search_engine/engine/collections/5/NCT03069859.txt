      the feasibility of administering a prophylactic dose of TXA to prevent the onset of PPH
      amongst parturients undergoing cesarean section and spontaneous vaginal delivery. Our primary
      outcome will be to determine the proportion of patients who receive the investigational
      product successfully. Our secondary outcomes include 1) additional feasibility endpoints余 2)
      safety endpoints and 3) various other clinical endpoints. These clinical endpoints include a)
      incidence of PPH (and severe PPH)余 b) total number of transfusions余 c) use of uterotonic
      drugs余 and d) hospital length of stay. The investigators anticipate that TXA can be safely
      administered to parturients prior to delivery. The investigators also believe it will be an
      effective prophylactic therapy for PPH and will reduce its severity and associated morbidity.
      Results from this trial will be used to design and conduct a larger multicentered trial,
      powered to assess the outcomes of interest. Furthermore, this prophylactic use of TXA for PPH
      could improve outcomes of parturients not only in Ontario but worldwide where effective
      management of PPH remains an ongoing challenge.
