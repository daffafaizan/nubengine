      tablets administered as an extended regimen (84 consecutive days of active tablets followed
      by seven days medication free) following a traditional regimen of two 28-day cycles (21 days
      of active tablets, followed by seven days of placebo tablets) of norgestimate/ethinyl
      estradiol tablets. All patients will receive norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol tablets in a
      traditional regimen for two 28-day cycles. Following the Traditional Treatment Phase, all
      patients will receive norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol tablets in an Extended Regimen Treatment
      Phase, consisting of 84 days of treatment with norgestimate/ethinyl estradiol tablets. Safety
      evaluations include physical examinations, adverse event reporting and vital signs. The
      hypothesis of the study is that a triphasic extended regimen would not result in breakthrough
      bleeding and spotting when the progestin dose drops. Traditional Regimen: two 28 day cycles
      of norgestimate 180 mcg daily for 1 week, 215 mcg daily for 1 week, 250 mcg daily for 1 week,
      placebo daily for 1 week. Extended Regimen: four uninterrupted cycles of norgestimate 180 mcg
      daily for 1 week, 215 mcg daily for 1 week, 250 mcg daily for 1 week, 1 week medication-free.
      In both Treatment Regimens patients receive ethinyl estradiol 25 mcg in each active tablet.
      The study is 147 days, Traditional days 1-56 and Extended days 57-147
