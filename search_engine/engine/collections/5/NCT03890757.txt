      intercostal nerve blocks have variable success and high potential for local anaesthetic
      toxicity. Serratus anterior plane block is relatively novel technique that is less invasive,
      easier to perform and improve pulmonary function that reduces the incidence of pneumonia,
      number of ventilator days, and mortality, especially those sustaining five or more rib
      fractures
