      composition of a foetus of same postconceptional age. The adequacy of the quality of protein
      supply could influence the rate and the relative composition of weight gain.

      Aim of the study is to investigate protein balance according to feeding regimen and the
      association between exclusive human milk feeding and fat free mass content at term corrected
      age in a cohort of very low birth weight infants.

      A prospective observational study. Infants are included according to inclusion criteria.
      Enrollment is performed at hospital discharge. Infants are divided into two groups
      (exclusively human milk or exclusively formula) according to own mother's milk availability.
      At enrollment macronutrients' intakes and protein balance are determined. Anthropometric
      measurements and body composition are also assessed. Nutritional composition of human milk is
      calculated by infrared spectroscopy (MIRISÂ® AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Protein balance is
      determined according to nitrogen balance standard method. Body composition is assessed by an
      air-displacement plethysmography system system (PEA POD Infant Body Composition System,
      COSMED SRL, Roma, Italy). At term corrected age anthropometry and body composition
      assessments are repeated.
