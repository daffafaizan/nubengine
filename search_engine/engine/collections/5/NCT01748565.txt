      premature birth and the unavoidable exposures to treatments regularly used for premature
      infants,including mechanical ventilation and oxygen as well as conditions that occur
      frequently among premature infants including infection. Almost all infants who are born
      prematurely are exposed to either mechanical ventilation, extra oxygen, and many will develop
      at least one infection; however, not all premature infants will develop BPD. There is
      currently no way to identify those infants who are at risk for developing BPD, nor are there
      prognostic or diagnostic tests to determine the severity of lung disease in the first year
      after discharge from the hospital.

      The application of UPLC-tandem mass spectrometry for quantification of urinary biomarkers of
      oxidative stress is an important technical innovation that will permit sensitive and
      reproducible analyses of urinary biomarkers with minimal sample preparation to better define
      disease phenotypes. Establishing a direct correlation between biomarkers of oxidative stress
      and GRP will accelerate investigation into the mechanisms leading to chronic pediatric lung
      disease and childhood origins of pulmonary disease.
