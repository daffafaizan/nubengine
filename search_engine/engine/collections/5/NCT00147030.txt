    
      This is a multicentre prospective randomised controlled trial to determine whether a
      reduction of body temperature by 3-4°C following perinatal asphyxia improves survival without
      neurodevelopmental disability.

      Full term infants will be randomised within 6 hours of birth to either a control group with
      the rectal temperature kept at 37 ± 0.2°C or to whole body cooling with the rectal
      temperature kept at 33.5 ± 0.5°C for 72 hours followed by slow rewarming.

      The outcome will be assessed at 18 months of age by survival and neurological and
      neurodevelopmental testing.

      Eligibility criteria:

      Term infants less than 6 hours after birth with moderate or severe perinatal asphyxia (a
      combination of clinical and EEG criteria).

      Exclusion criteria:

      Infants expected to be 6 hours of age at the time of randomisation or infants with major
      congenital abnormalities.

      Intervention:

      Intensive care with whole body cooling versus intensive care without whole body cooling
      (babies are cooled to 33.5°C for 72 hours)

      Main Outcomes:

      Death and severe neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 months of age

      Secondary Outcomes:

      Cerebral thrombosis or haemorrhage, persistent hypotension, pulmonary hypertension, abnormal
      coagulation, arrhythmia and sepsis in the neonatal period. Neurological impairments at 18
      months

      Number of patients required: 236.

      On 30th November 2006, when recruitment closed, 325 babies had been recruited.
