    
      This study describes patient perceptions related to device attributes, which are of
      importance in describing overall patient perception. A range of potential device benefits
      (e.g. ease of use, convenience, confidence, presence or absence of fear, side effects related
      to administration) is captured using a questionnaire based on the outputs of patient
      interviews.

      The study aims to characterize patient attributes that will indicate when one device may
      result in greater patient satisfaction than another. Patient attributes are composed of
      patient characteristics (e.g. age, sex, self efficacy, expectations of treatment, perception
      of their illness) and RA characteristics (e.g. disease severity, disease duration, prior
      treatment, functional impairment).
