      stimuli in normal individuals (normal volunteers) and patients. This protocol replaces a
      similar protocol (80-EI-0093) which served the same purpose. Normal adult volunteers will be
      recruited and will undergo an eye exam to assure that there are no visual system problems.
      Volunteers will be studied in one or more sessions where eye movement, verbal or hand
      movement responses are recorded in response to visual stimuli. Patients with diseases
      affecting the oculomotor or visual systems will also be recruited to help us better
      understand these systems and to help characterize their specific disease.
