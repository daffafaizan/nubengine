      response as chemotherapy may not clear pre-formed organ amyloid. Doxycycline has been shown
      to have inhibitory effects on amyloid fibril formation as well as de-fibrillogenic effects
      and shown to be beneficial in in vitro, murine models and other preclinical studies. The
      investigators will prospectively evaluate the safety and efficacy of doxycycline in AL
      amyloidosis patients when used in conjunction with anti-plasma cell chemotherapy.
