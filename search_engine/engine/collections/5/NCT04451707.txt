      in warm waters. For example, the incidence is high in Florida and Vibrio infections are now
      reportable in the United States. Different species of Vibrio are described. A distinction is
      made between choleric vibrios belonging to serogroups O1 and O139, responsible for cholera
      epidemics, and non-choleric vibrios. Our study will focus on non-cholera vibrios. Vibrio
      infections can occur by eating contaminated raw seafood or by exposure of a wound to the
      marine environment. They occur mainly during the hot summer months. This can be explained on
      the one hand by higher water temperature and on the other hand by increased beach use. With
      global warming, it is possible that Vibrio infections may increase in number and location.
