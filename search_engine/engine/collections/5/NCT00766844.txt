      (within 3 days after aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage). The single-arm single-institution
      non-randomized prospective study evaluates effects of cervical spinal cord stimulation on
      prevention of cerebral arterial vasospasm.

      The patients are followed for 12 months after completion of stimulation.
