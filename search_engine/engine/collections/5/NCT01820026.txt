    
      Unblinded randomized controlled trial with randomisation stratified by epidemiological class
      of infection.

      After obtaining informed consent at enrollment, participants will undergo medical examination
      with a detailed anamnesis and will begin collecting data on the following parameters:

        -  Demographic characteristics (age, sex, etiology of cirrhosis, when the diagnosis was
           made).

        -  Severity of liver disease(defined by the Child-Pugh classification, MELD score), indices
           of renal function and serum electrolytes.

        -  APACHE score in the case of development of sepsis

        -  Compensated cirrhosis / decompensated cirrhosis

        -  If decompensated, will be listed complications (ascites, esophageal-gastric varices,
           hepatic encephalopathy, coagulopathy, Hepato-Renal Syndrome, variceal bleeding).

        -  Treatment and dosage (eg Î²-blockers, diuretics)

        -  Hemodynamic parameters (heart rate / blood pressure)

      Patients enrolled will be randomized and treated with conventional therapy provided for
      community-acquired infections or with the "2nd line antibiotic therapy", based on use of of
      imipenem-cilastatin.

      The protocol of antibiotic therapy chosen for this category of patients will be based on a
      antibiotic class recommended for a specific site of infection in international guidelines for
      the treatment of nosocomial infections and / or healthcare associated with a high safety
      profile and is already used in the investigators hospital. The cost of empirical treatment
      with imipenem / cilastatin is roughly comparable to that with the currently used first-line
      antibiotics for such infections, and frequently used drugs in the forefront of these patients
      are ineffective is therefore necessary to embark on a new antibiotic with higher costs also
      in terms of days of hospitalization.

      During the hospitalization will be recorded the type of infection, empirical therapy, its
      duration, side effects, isolated pathogens and their resistance, when available, the
      occurrence of complications related to infection and mortality.

      The efficacy of therapy will be assessed based on the resolution of infection attested by
      normalization of clinical , biochemical and microbiological parameters and the instrumental
      tools.
