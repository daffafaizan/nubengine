    
      Each cycle of study treatment lasts 21 days. The patient will take erlotinib by mouth once
      daily. On day 1 of every cycle, the patient will receive bevacizumab intravenously over a
      30-90 minute time period.

      CT scan(s), MRI(s) and/or x-ray(s) of the cancer site will be performed every 6 weeks (2
      cycles) to assess the extent of the response to treatment.

      Bloodwork will be performed before the first dose of erlotinib and bevacizumab at Cycle 1,
      Cycle 2, Cycle 3, and at the end of treatment.

      At the completion of the treatment a physical exam, vital signs, blood tests, urine tests and
      standard radiologic testing will be performed.

      The duration of study depends upon how the patients' mesothelioma responds to treatment as
      well as how well the patient tolerates the medication.
