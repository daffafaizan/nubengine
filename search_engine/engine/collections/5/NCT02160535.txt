      Control estimates that between 1.4 and 1.8 million civilians in the US sustain a traumatic
      brain injury (TBI) each year. The objectives of the study will be evaluated in a civilian
      population which has sustained a mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). Research has found that
      the total cost due to headache in the US workforce is $20 billion per year, most of which is
      in the form of reduce productivity while at work. For patients with TBI who are already
      struggling with cognitive and health challenges in an effort to be productive, it seems
      reasonable to suspect that chronic PTH may slow rehabilitation efforts and successful
      re-entry into the work force and societal responsibility. Results from this study have the
      potential to contribute to recommendations for treatment of chronic PTH.
