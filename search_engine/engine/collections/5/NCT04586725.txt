      in the lower limbs, resulting in a reduction of blow flow (Hiatt, 2001). Globally, it is
      estimated that 236 million people are living with PAD, with the number of cases increasing by
      24% from 2000 to 2010. A classic symptom of PAD is intermittent claudication (IC),
      characterised by ischemic muscle pain precipitated by exertion and relieved by rest. IC is
      associated with various comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and
      dyslipidaemia as well as reductions in physical function, quality of life, and balance.
      National and international guidelines recommend supervised exercise therapy as first line
      treatment for patients with IC.

      To assess IC impairment in response to an exercise intervention, maximal walking capacity is
      typically the primary outcome in randomised controlled trials (RCT's). This involves a
      patient walking for as long as possible until ischemic leg symptoms, fatigue or other
      symptoms prevent them from continuing. This is assessed by a number of exercise testing
      protocols including the six-minute walk test (6MWT). The American Thoracic Society provide
      guidelines for performing a standardised 6MWT including verbal phrases that are conducted
      every minute. Conversely, Montgomery and Gardner suggest encouragement every two minutes.
      Encouragement has been shown to significantly affect walking performance by as much as 30
      meters in heart failure and respiratory disease populations. However the effect of
      encouragement on walking performance in people with IC is yet to be investigated.
