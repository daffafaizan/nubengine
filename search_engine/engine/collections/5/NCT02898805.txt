    
      The experimental design involves the construction of a multi-center, controlled, randomized,
      single-blind, versus Armolipid Plus®.

      Patients with mild hypercholesterolemia, of both sexes and aged between 18 and 75 years, will
      be recruited, from the beginning of the study and for the next 2 weeks, from 30 Cv
      specialists and/or GPs (25 patients each).

      The subjects will be enrolled in the 50/50% male/female ratio ± 10% comparable for age, in
      order to obtain a proper comparison between groups with similar demographic characteristics
      or not statistically different.

      The subjects, selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria, will be divided into
      two groups, subjected to centralized randomization at the "Diagnosis and Treatment of
      hypertension Center" to receive one of two different treatments, a tablet/day of the new
      nutraceutical LopiGLIK® (Akademy Pharma) containing Morus Alba, immediately after a meal, vs.
      a tablet/day of Armolipid Plus, always immediately after the meal. During the first two weeks
      both groups will follow the prescribed diet and assume the placebo. At the end, blood tests
      (traditional metabolic parameters, blood glucose, HbA1C, fasting insulin, transaminase
      levels, CPK) and the endothelial function will be assesed. During the next 16 weeks a group
      will assume LopiGLIK® (Akademy Pharma) containing Morus Alba, the other will assume Armolipid
      Plus and everyone will continue to follow the prescribed diet. At the end of this period
      blood tests will be repeated. Tablets of Armolipid Plus, LopiGLIK® and placebo will be
      provided by Akademy Pharma free of charge
