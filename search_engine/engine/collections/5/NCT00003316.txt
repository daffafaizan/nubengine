      persistent leiomyosarcoma of the uterus who failed higher priority treatment protocols. II.
      Determine the toxicity of gemcitabine in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat
      every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression. Patients with
      partial response, complete response, or stable disease receive at least 3 courses of therapy.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years.
