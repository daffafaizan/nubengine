      children anesthetised for pediatric heart surgery are analysed since September 2007. 100
      children received propofol and up to now 80 children received sevoflurane during
      cardiopulmonary bypass. Blood gas analysis, laboratory results and vital parameters are
      compared before and after cardiopulmonary bypass for each group. Duration of intensive care
      treatment and time to dismission from hospital are compared between groups. Changes relative
      to baseline are analysed by paired t-Test with correction for multiple testing. Differences
      between groups are analysed by unpaired t-Test with correction for multiple testing
