      urological procedures are reported severe complications in this patient population.

      After having studied the available literature on this particular topic the investigators have
      decided to prepare a retrospective analysis of approximately 250 robot- assisted radical
      cystectomy and radical prostatectomy surgical procedures. In due consideration of
      perioperative prophylaxis of thrombembolic Events we determine the clinical and radiological
      signs of venous or arterial thrombembolism postoperatively with a particular focus on early
      postoperative pulmonary embolism events.

      This is a retrospective analysis of 250 robotic-assisted radical cystectomy and radical
      prostatectomy surgical procedures.
