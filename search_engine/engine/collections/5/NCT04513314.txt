    
      This is a pilot feasibility study involving a randomized, single-blind, controlled comparison
      scheme examining the efficacy and safety of standard of care (n=10) combined with valproate
      alone, and in combination with quetiapine (N=10) , in order to reduce the magnitude of
      agitation associated with COVID 19 delirium as assessed by the RASS scale when weaning from a
      ventilator, and reduce need for dexmedetomidine as assessed by number of doses of
      dexmedetomidine administered.
