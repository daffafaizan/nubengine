i. urinary excretion of neutral 17-ketosteroids and pregnanediol bypatients with breast cancer and benign breast disease .urinary levels of neutral 17-ketosteroid fractions and pregnanediolexcreted by 114 women, 56 premenopausal and 58 postmenopausal, weredetermined . subjects studied were included in 4 premenopausal groups(breast cancer 6, benign breast disease 18, sick control 8, well control24) and 3 postmenopausal groups (breast cancer 21, sick control 17, wellcontrol 20) .levels of androsterone and etiocholanolone excreted by premenopausalpatients with breast cancer were significantly less than levels excretedby other premenopausal groups, and they did not differ significantlyfrom levels excreted by postmenopausal patients with breast cancer .disproportionately lower levels of the 11-desoxy-17-ketosteroids than11-oxy-17-ketosteroids excreted by premenopausal patients with cancerresulted in significantly lower ratios than those found in otherpremenopausal groups . ratios associated with premenopausal patientswith cancer did not differ significantly from those of postmenopausalpatients with cancer .lower levels of androsterone and etiocholanolone were not explained bydebilitation .
