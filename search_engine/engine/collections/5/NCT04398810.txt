      diseases, and robotic cholecystectomy was also currently being performed. Many patients
      complained pain around the wound, shoulder and back after surgery. Several methods had been
      attempted to reduce postoperative pain, previous studies showed that oral medications such as
      NSAIDS, administration of local anesthetics in wounds and abdominal cavity, low-pressure
      penumoperitoneum, humidification of intraperitoneal washing fluid, And active residual gas
      suction in the abdominal cavity had been found to relieve postoperative pain.

      Robotic cholecystectomy, similar to laparoscopic cholecystectomy, also formed
      pneumoperitoneum to secure the surgical space during operation. Based on the results
      published in various studies, it had known that the most effective method of pain relief for
      laparoscopic pain was to create low-pressure pneumoperitoneum.

      In this study, investigators attempted to prove the effectiveness of low pressure
      pneumoperioneum through a prospective randomized controlled trial between the experimental
      group with the low-pressure pneumoperitoneum and the control group with the standard-pressure
      pneumoperitoneum during robotic single-hole cholecystectomy.
