      [1.2]. This hemodynamic stress may lead to an imbalance between myocardial oxygen consumption
      and supply and therefore induce myocardial ischemia, which may be endurable in the patients
      with normal cardiovascular condition but is potential harmful to the patients with coronary
      heart disease. Thus it is critical to attenuate the cardiovascular stress induced by
      laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation in the high risk patients.
