      blinded treatment) to the end of a 12 weeks' double-blind treatment period based on patient
      diaries. Patients recorded their motor symptoms in half-hour blocks as OFF, ON without
      dyskinesia, ON without troublesome dyskinesia, or sleeping using the Hauser Parkinson's
      Disease home diary.

      Key secondary Endpoints (tested hierarchically):

        -  Change in time spent "ON without troublesome dyskinesia"

        -  Patient Global Impression of Change

      Other Endpoints:

        -  Percentage of patients with response to therapy, defined as a mean OFF time reduction of
           at least 2 hours

        -  Change in oral levodopa and levodopa equivalent dose
