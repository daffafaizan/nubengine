      Diabetes Knowledge Survey. Health, medical and demographic history, height and weight, waist
      and hip circumferences, and blood pressure were recorded. HbA1c and low-density lipoprotein
      cholesterol (LDL-C) level were tested. All of these data were measured 3 months later at the
      conclusion of the study intervention.
