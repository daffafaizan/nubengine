      I. Describe the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects, including acute and chronic
      dose-limiting toxicity, cumulative toxicity, and time to recovery, in pediatric patients with
      refractory leukemia who are treated with a 30-minute daily infusion of topotecan (TOPO) for
      up to 12 consecutive days every 3 weeks.

      II. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of TOPO that results in tolerable, predictable, and
      reversible toxicity.

      III. Determine the precautions and supportive therapy that should be used and the clinical
      and laboratory studies needed to monitor or alter therapy to prevent unacceptable toxicity in
      these patients.

      IV. Observe any antileukemic effects that may occur during this phase I study in which
      duration of treatment is increased from 7 to 9 and then 12 days and TOPO doses are escalated.

      V. Determine the recommended phase II pediatric dose of TOPO. VI. Characterize the
      pharmacokinetic parameters of TOPO and evaluate changes in these parameters with the first
      and last doses to determine whether there is drug accumulation.

      VII. Correlate, if possible, these pharmacokinetic parameters with clinical response and
      toxicity.
