      alters the response to ethanol (i.e., the rewarding and reinforcing effects) using a
      validated laboratory paradigm of intravenous (IV) ethanol infusion. Fifty non-treatment
      seeking heavy drinkers (NTSHDs, N=50), will undergo three test days each: once after
      receiving a placebo medication, once after receiving moderate dose perampanel, and once after
      receiving a higher dose of perampanel. This experiment is the first step in a series of
      expedient studies that will rapidly determine perampanel's potential as a treatment for
      alcohol dependence. If findings show perampanel reduces the rewarding and reinforcing
      properties of alcohol in the laboratory setting (in humans), it would provide a strong
      rationale for clinical treatment trials with this medication. This approach is innovative
      because it tests a highly novel AMPA-R antagonist for the treatment of alcoholism, and uses a
      state-of-the-art computer assisted IV alcohol pump infusion system (called CAIS) to reduce
      variability in blood alcohol concentrations, thus improving the data quality.
