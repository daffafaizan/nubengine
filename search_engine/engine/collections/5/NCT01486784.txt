      32711, in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia. This study will target subjects 60 years
      of age and older (with non-M3 AML who have relapsed or refractory disease after standard
      therapy or who are newly diagnosed and not candidates for standard induction therapy) and
      subjects 18-59 (relapsed or refractory after failing 3 prior lines of therapy). Subjects
      would receive the study drug in 4 weeks dosing periods via one of three different treatment
      schedules (once weekly, twice weekly or three times weekly dosing). They will receive
      treatment for up to 6 cycles, however treatment may be extended at the discretion of the
      study doctor if felt to be in the best interest of the subject. Up to 46 subjects will be
      enrolled on this study at the University of Pennsylvania, depending on the number of subjects
      needed in the Phase I component in order to determine the MTD. The primary objective of the
      Phase 1 component of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of TL32711, and
      the MTD in this patient population. The primary objective of the Phase 2 portion of this
      study is further define the safety and tolerability, and provide preliminary efficacy data.
