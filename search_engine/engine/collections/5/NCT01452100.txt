      ultimately occlude medium-sized arterioles and capillaries of the kidney, skin,
      gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. The diagnosis relies on histopathological
      demonstration of cholesterol cristal embolism in any target organ, or can be assumed if the 3
      following criteria are met (1) presence of one or more precipitating factors (2) renal
      function deterioration in atherosclerotic patients (3) ischemic changes of the extremities or
      demonstration of retinal CCE. Despite the dismal prognosis in multisystem CCE mortality the
      optimal treatment remains unknown.

      In most patients, avoiding the precipitating factors and combination of statin and RAS
      inhibitor are recommended. The benefit of prednisone is uncertain, but its dramatic impact
      has been underlined in several short retrospective series, even with moderate daily dosage
      (0,2-0,5 mg/kg). However, adverse side effects of steroid therapy in uremic elderly with CCE
      have not been assessed. In addition, the optimal duration of the treatment has not been
      assessed. The lack of randomized controlled trial in CCE precludes significant advances. The
      investigators decided to assess whether prednisone started early, at mild dosage and for a
      short period prevents death and progression to end-stage renal failure in patients with
      severe CCE, as compared to placebo.
