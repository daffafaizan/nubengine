      wake disorders are co-morbid conditions of Alzheimer disease, and there is evidence to
      suggest that the interactions are bidirectional. Neuronal activity promotes the production
      and secretion of amyloid Î², which could actually drive pathogenesis early in the course of
      Alzheimer disease, and has been described in sleep wake disorders and epilepsy. Epileptic
      seizures in Alzheimer disease are often subtle, nocturnal and easily overlooked. We propose a
      prospective study using long-term EEG monitoring in combination with polysomnography to
      diagnose epilepsy and sleep wake disorders in Alzheimer disease, and correlate these findings
      with clinical data, Alzheimer disease biomarkers and imaging studies (MRI and
      amyloid/tau-PET). It is the hypothesis of the investigators that participants with Alzheimer
      disease and interictal spikes or specified sleep wake disorders (e.g., frequent nocturnal
      awakenings) during 48 hour scalp EEG and polysomnography are at risk for having hippocampal
      seizures, which are often clinically silent and not detected on scalp EEG. The investigators
      will invite 15 of these participants to undergo EEG studies with foramen ovale electrodes to
      determine the prevalence of these hippocampal seizures. The ultimate goal is to improve the
      outcome of patients with Alzheimer disease by early treatment of epilepsy and restoring
      sleep-wake disturbances.
