      morbidity including stress, anxiety, and depression. In particular, mothers of patients with
      single ventricle physiology who require neonatal surgery, face a great deal of stress related
      to the risk of serious complications including neonatal death. Previous studies have
      suggested that providing emotional psychosocial support may modify the development of
      significant psychosocial problems in parents of children with congenital heart disease. The
      pediatric palliative care team specializes in multiple elements of psychological and
      spiritual care for families of such children.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate maternal psychological distress and to examine
      the potential impact of early palliative care team consultation on maternal anxiety and
      depression symptoms, coping, and quality of life/family functioning in the care of neonates
      born with single ventricle physiology. Mothers will complete four questionnaires measuring
      anxiety, depression, and quality of life/family functioning at a prenatal follow up visit and
      again prior to neonatal surgical hospital stay discharge (or at 30 days). Infants will be
      randomly assigned (by date of birth) to receive early palliative care team consultation or
      usual care (no or late palliative care intervention).

      The investigators hypothesize maternal stress, anxiety, and depression will be lower in the
      palliative care intervention group compared with the control group, and maternal coping
      mechanisms and perceived quality of life and family functioning will improve at the
      pre-discharge assessment.
