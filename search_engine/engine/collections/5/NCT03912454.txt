      BMAC is a cellular rich fraction of bone marrow aspirate that can be readily prepared at the
      point of care without additional processing steps to manipulate or isolate cells. In
      addition, BMAC contains growth factors from the peripheral blood which may promote disc
      healing.

      Study Summary:

      The study population will consist of up to 20 patients aged 18- 60 with unresolved low back
      pain attributable to intervertebral disc degeneration. Clinical exam will indicate the
      intervertebral disc as the source of pain with features such as midline pain, pain upon
      rising from a seated position, or positive responses to centralization maneuvers. Moderate
      single level lumbar disc (L1-S1) degeneration (<50% disc height) will be confirmed on MRI.
      Other low back pain generators must be eliminated prior to study enrollment. Subjects must
      meet minimum score criteria on baseline PROs (VAS>=40 and ODI>=30). Subjects that meet all of
      the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study.

      Enrolled subjects will undergo bone marrow aspiration and intradiscal injection by an
      experienced orthopedic spine surgeon. Subjects will be followed for 1 year to evaluate the
      effects of the disc injection.
