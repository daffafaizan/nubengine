      morbidity and mortality. Despite recommendations from the American Geriatrics Society for the
      Choosing Wisely Initiative, there are clear examples where clinicians do not often follow
      best practices leading to patient harm. These include: (1) testing and treatment for
      asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older women, (2) prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening
      in older men, and (3) aggressive treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemics for type 2
      diabetes.

      Clinical decision support nudges, informed by behavioral economics and social psychology and
      delivered via electronic health records (EHRs), are promising strategies to reduce the misuse
      of services. Behavioral economics-informed interventions influence conscious and unconscious
      drivers of decision making, are low cost, and can be incorporated into existing systems.

      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of three clinical decision support
      nudges on three clinical quality measures, indicators of patient safety, and clinician
      attitudes.
