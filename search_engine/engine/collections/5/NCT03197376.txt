    
      This is a randomized, active-controlled, double-blind, Phase 3 study in 2,250 healthy infants
      (6 to 8 weeks of age). Subjects will receive 3 doses of either PNEUMOSIL (3 groups receiving
      vaccine from different lots) or Synflorix (1 group) at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. The first
      675 randomized subjects will receive a booster dose of either PNEUMOSIL or Synflorix at 9
      months of age that matches the treatment assignment for the priming phase. Standard EPI
      vaccinations in The Gambia will be given concomitantly with all 4 doses of the study
      vaccines. Out of the 675 booster subjects, subjects who consented for further evaluation will
      participate for the assessment of immune persistence 12 (+1) months after the booster
      vaccination

      The primary objectives are to demonstrate that the three lots of the Pneumosil vaccine is
      consistent by evaluating the immune responses, and to demonstrate that the immune responses
      generated by Pneumosil are non-inferior to those generated by Synflorix. The safety and
      tolerability of Pneumosil will also be evaluated.
