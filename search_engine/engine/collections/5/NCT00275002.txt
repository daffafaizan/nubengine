      I. Determine the sustained objective response rate to the combination of O6-benzylguanine and
      temozolomide in pediatric patients with recurrent or progressive high-grade gliomas and brain
      stem tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor type
      (high-grade gliomas vs brain stem tumors).

      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour followed by oral temozolomide on days 1-5.
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed to the earliest of 30 days
      following discontinuation of therapy or the initiation of additional anti-cancer therapy or
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study.
