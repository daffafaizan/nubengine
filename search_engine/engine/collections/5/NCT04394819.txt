      and impairs quality of life. The most important goal in rehabilitation; despite the existing
      deficiencies, the highest level of functional independence of the patient is to increase the
      quality of life. EMG-triggered biofeedback electrical stimulation (EMG-triggered-BF-ES)
      increases the patient's active participation and motivation in rehabilitation, creates visual
      or auditory BF, provides muscle reeducation, decreases spasticity, prevents atrophies and
      increases joint mobility and increases muscle functionality by increasing the patient's
      functionality. There are areas of use the EMG-triggered-BF-ES such as cerebrovascular disease
      (CVO), spinal cord injury, and CP. When the literature is examined; studies were found to be
      few, and no study evaluating the upper extremity was found in children with CP. The purpose
      of our study is the investigation of the effects of EMG-triggered-BF-ES treatment applied on
      hand functions, muscle strength, and quality of life in patients with CP.
