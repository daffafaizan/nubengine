      properly placing endosseous dental implants in the posterior maxilla. Grafting of the
      maxillary sinus has been regarded as one of the most reliable surgical alternatives to
      correct this problem. Several sinus grafting techniques, using different materials, have been
      reported showing high survival rates. However, there are many factors that may alter the
      outcomes of this procedure.

      The maturation and consolidation of the grafted area relies on the proper formation of a
      functional graft-vital bone complex. This maturation process requires an adequate migration
      of osteogenic cells from native bone, that could be limited in situations where the
      dimensions of the maxillary sinus are excessive. Hence, the purpose of this research project
      is to determine the influence of the distance from the lateral to the medial wall of the
      maxillary sinus on the outcomes of a sinus augmentation procedures performed using the
      lateral approach using clinical, radiographic and histomorphometric analysis.
