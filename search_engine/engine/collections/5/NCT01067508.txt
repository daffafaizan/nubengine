      within safe intake limits occurs in water obtained from artesian wells in Fiji (Fiji Water,
      Inc.). Other drinking waters (e.g. Aquafina, Crystal Geyser, etc.) have all trace minerals
      including silicon removed by reverse osmosis. Silicon may be a necessary mineral for bone
      health. Therefore, this study aims to demonstrate the potential beneficial effects of
      short-term intake of silicon-rich water (85 mg/day of silicon in the diet from 1 liter of
      Fiji Water) compared to deionized water (with no silicon) over 12 weeks in normal
      postmenopausal women. The women to be studied will be stratified by bone density (based on T
      score by DEXA) and have analyses of biomarkers of bone metabolism to achieve the following
      specific aims:

        1. To conduct a prospective randomized controlled trial in two mixed groups of 15 normal
           postmenopausal women and osteopenic pre- and peri-menopausal women receiving either 1
           liter per day of FIJI water (A) or 1 liter per day of purified drinking water with no
           minerals (B). During screening we will ask prospective participants about their
           menopausal status (where post-menopausal means having no menstrual period for one year),
           block on their menopausal status, and randomize to either Treatment A or Treatment B.
           There will be 7-8 post-menopausal women and 7-8 pre- or peri-menopausal women in each
           group.

        2. To determine silicon absorption by measuring urinary silicon excretion

        3. To determine bone resorption and turn over markers by measuring urinary N-Telopeptide,
           serum bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, procollagen Type I Intact N-Terminal
           Propeptide, 25 hydroxyvitamin D, parathyroid hormone (PTH) and calcium.
