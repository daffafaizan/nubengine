      home-based HIV counselling and testing (HBHCT) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) are scarce. The
      few existing data suggest that only 13% to 54% of HIV-infected persons identified through
      HBHCT enter pre-ART care. No studies have rigorously evaluated interventions aimed at
      improving linkage to pre-ART care following HBHCT in SSA. This study will evaluate the effect
      of follow-up counselling after HIV diagnosis through HBHCT on linkage to pre-ART care in
      Masaka, south-western Uganda.

      The study is a cluster randomised trial of the effectiveness of referral to pre-ART care and
      follow-up counselling (intervention) compared to referral to pre-ART care only (control), for
      individuals diagnosed with HIV through HBHCT. The intervention will be administered at months
      1 and 2, and linkage to care assessed at month 6 post-HBHCT. Data will be collected on
      socio-demographic characteristics, sexual risk profile, HIV testing history, HIV status
      disclosure, linkage to care, CD4 count testing and results, cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, and
      ART initiation. At least 224 HIV-infected participants will be enrolled from 28 clusters
      (14/study arm). Approximately 84 HIV-uninfected individuals will also be recruited into the
      study to reduce the possibility of revealing the sero-status of the HIV-infected
      participants.
