      study. We encourage people who have previously undergone genetic testing and were found to
      carry the mutation that affects their family as well as those who do not know their genetic
      status to contact us. Those who wish to participate and to learn the results of genetic
      testing, may do so after undergoing genetic counseling. It is also possible to participate
      without learning the results of genetic testing. Participants eligible to complete study
      visits will travel to Miami (at our expense) approximately every 12-24 months for a period of
      10 years or longer and will perform various biomarker procedures. Between visits,
      participants will complete phone calls about their health.
