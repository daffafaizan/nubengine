    
      A prospective, non-controlled, non-randomized, single center study of a treatment regimen of
      a protease inhibitor or a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in combination with
      raltegravir in patients with HIV-1 infection who have been, and continue to be, fully
      controlled on a standard HAART regimen of a PI or an NNRTI plus 2 NRTIs, and the effect of
      the change in regimen on peripheral fat distribution.

      This pilot study will contain 30 patients who will be followed over a period of one year
      starting from the date of the medication change from an NRTI-based regimen to a
      raltegravir-based NRTI-sparing regimen. Potential changes in fat distribution (fat content as
      assessed by fat volume) will be measured with serial MRI's of the thighs.
