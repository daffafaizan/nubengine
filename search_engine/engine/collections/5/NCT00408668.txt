      Oxford. The other vaccine (PEV3A) has been designed jointly between the Swiss Tropical
      Institute and a Swiss company called Pevion Biotech Ltd. These are new vaccines that have
      been given to only a limited number of people before.

      We aim to test these vaccines by:

        -  assessing their ability to prevent malaria infection

        -  determining how good they are at triggering a detectable immune response against malaria

        -  studying their safety further

      Volunteers will be given up to six vaccinations over three months and will then be exposed to
      malaria infection. We do this by allowing mosquitoes infected with malaria to bite them under
      closely regulated conditions and observing if and when they develop blood stage malaria. If
      the vaccines provide some protection from malaria infection then either they will not develop
      malaria after the bites or the time taken to develop malaria will be longer. If not all
      volunteers are protected then we will be able to try and improve our vaccines by comparing
      the immune responses of volunteers who are protected to those not protected.

      The information we get from this study may help to prevent malaria infection and disease in
      those who live in endemic areas and in travellers. The results of this study will be
      published in scientific journals and may be presented at professional meetings.
