      increase carbon dioxide re-breathing, which can result in low blood oxygen levels, reduced
      oxygen delivery to muscle and reduced exercise capacity. The purpose of the study is to
      determine the effect of wearing two different types of commonly-worn face masks (diposable
      and cloth) during exercise on blood and muscle oxygenation. Twelve participants who are
      experienced with cycling will take part in this randomized cross-over study that will assess
      blood oxygenation (i.e. pulse oximetry) and muscle oxygenation (with near infrared
      spectroscopy) during a progressive step exercise test to exhaustion. The conditions include
      no mask, a disposable mask, and a cloth mask. Outcome variables include exercise duration,
      rating of perceived exertion, blood oxygen saturation levels, and oxygenated, deoxygenated,
      and total hemoglobin at the quadriceps muscle.
