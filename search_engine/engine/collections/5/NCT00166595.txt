      and pharmacogenetics of risperidone in children with PDD. Currently the PPRU network is
      conducting a PK study whose aim is to establish a new enantio-selective micro-assay
      methodology and to generate preliminary population PK data of risperidone and its metabolites
      in PDD. This study focuses on pharmacogenetic evaluation of PDD patients having little or no
      effect, those that are unusually sensitive and those experiencing drug toxicity/adverse
      events at standard risperidone dosages.

      In this study two 5 ml blood samples will be drawn at a regulary scheduled PK visit.
      Alternatively pooled waste blood samples or a buccal swab can be obtained.
