      respective therapeutic implications of cardio-vascular risk factors and stroke. For that
      reason consecutive patients with ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack (brain, spinal
      cord, or retinal) and structural (e.g. patent foramen ovale), septic or aseptic endocarditis
      or myocarditis, or supra-ventricular or ventricular arrhythmia, who are admitted to our
      University Hospital, are enrolled. Multifactorial assessment of risk factors is based on
      medical history, laboratory biomarkers, electrocardiogram incl. cardiac autonomic function
      analysis, and (long-term) cardiac rhythm monitoring, as well as transthoracic and
      transesophageal echocardiography. Inclusion of follow-up visits permit longitudinal and
      prognostic evaluation of routine diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for secondary
      stroke prevention (e.g. implantable loop recorders or interventional closure of patent
      foramen ovale).
