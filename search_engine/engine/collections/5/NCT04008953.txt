      hemodynamics. Methods approved for volume assessment include the use of echocardiography to
      measure left ventricular end diastolic area (LVEDA), central venous pressure (CVP) and
      pulmonary artery diastolic pressure (PAD). LVEDA is considered the good predictor for volume
      status assessment. CVP and PAD are invasive can potentially subject the patient to
      complications. Recently study performed an ultrasound assessment of the internal jugular vein
      (IJV) as a useful means of volume status assessment intraoperative under general anesthesia.
      In the pediatric population, only few studies are carried out to assess the use of ultrasound
      for intravascular volume assessment. This study will evaluate use of Ultrasonography of IJV
      in volume assessment in pediatrics will undergo renal transplant surgery and correlate IJV
      diameter, cross sectional area to CVP and LVEDA.
