      towards negative stimuli and whether the bias can be modified using a subsequent attentional
      bias training. During this training participants learn to direct their attention away from
      threatening stimuli. In a between-subject placebo controlled design participants will receive
      either intranasal oxytocin or placebo before the training to examine whether oxytocin could
      facilitate the effects of the attention training. Effects of the training and of oxytocin on
      the training will be assessed by means of an eye-tracking anti-saccade task. Based on
      previous studies showing the strongest effects of threat-attentional bias training in high
      anxious subjects, the study will recruit participants with an elevated trait anxiety.
