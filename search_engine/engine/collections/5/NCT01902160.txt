      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of temsirolimus in combination with brentuximab
      vedotin in patients with relapsed and refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.

      II. To assess the safety of brentuximab vedotin in combination with temsirolimus in patients
      with relapsed and refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.

      III. To assess the toxicity profile of this regimen in the above patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the overall response rate (ORR) to the combination of brentuximab vedotin and
      temsirolimus in relapsed and refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.

      II. Evaluate the role of inflammatory markers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, tumor
      necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha), and IL-10, as early predictors of treatment response.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.

      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8 or days
      1, 8, and 15 and brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
