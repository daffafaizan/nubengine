      lung cancer caregiver and patient well-being through a caregiver delivered intervention,
      Caregiver Oncology Needs Evaluation Tool (CONNECT). The investigators propose to evaluate a
      novel technology-based intervention, CONNECT, informed by theory with input from an advisory
      panel including a lung cancer caregiver and stakeholders. The purpose of CONNECT is to
      empower and educate caregivers about the benefits of supportive care resources and to
      systematically identify unmet needs and connect lung cancer caregivers with tailored
      supportive care resources. CONNECT is designed to be low cost and to capture the various
      resources offered in different oncology environments to support future adaptation and
      dissemination for heterogeneous healthcare settings.
