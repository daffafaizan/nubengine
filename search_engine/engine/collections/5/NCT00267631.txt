      Obesity is a public health issue in the United States. Obesity amongst children is rising at
      an alarming rate. Thirty percent of US children aged 6 to 19 are over weight and 15 % are
      obese1. It is estimated that over 18 million US children are over weight. The long-term
      impact of childhood obesity on such diseases as Diabetes, Asthmaand Hypertension, is well
      studied. The effects of childhood obesity on the current health status of the pediatric
      population have not been studied.

      B. Methodology:

      As part of routine patient care, we measured length in addition to weight of patients 2 years
      to 18 years of age presenting to the pediatric emergency department. A report was run monthly
      to calculate the BMI of all patients for whom data is available. The data were plotted on the
      year 2000 gender based BMI for age percentile growth charts from CDC. A retrospective
      electronic chart review was conducted for patients At Risk body weight (BMI â‰¥ 85%), and were
      compared to "control" or healthy (BMI of 25 - 75 %) group for six groups of final ED
      diagnoses of infectious disease (ID). Data were entered and analyzed via SPSS 14.0 for
      Windows 2000 software systems.
