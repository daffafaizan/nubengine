      implant is defined as an integrated implant in the patient's jaw bone at the time of
      assessment. Secondary endpoints include the assessment of implant stability, crestal bone
      levels, peri-implant soft tissue conditions, implant success, and patient satisfaction and
      related outcomes over several intervals within a 12-month period.
