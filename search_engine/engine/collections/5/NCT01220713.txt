      facing the readiness, retention and quality of life of Department of Defense(DoD) service
      members and Veterans. The inadequacy of established treatment regimens and evidence-based
      science in post-concussive symptoms (PCS)/MTBI is forcing a closer look at non-conventional
      treatments of this condition. Hyperbaric oxygen (HBO2) is a potent intervention with
      demonstrated efficacy in dive-related injuries, soft tissue healing, and carbon monoxide
      poisoning.

      This study is prospective, randomized, double-blinded and controlled. A total of 60 subjects
      will be randomly assigned to one of three treatment arms of the study: 20 subjects into the
      1.5 atm abs oxygen equivalent HBO2 treatment, 20 subjects into the 2.0 atm abs oxygen
      equivalent HBO2 treatment and 20 subjects into the sham treatment (a placebo exposure
      equivalent to breathing atmospheric air). The protocol utilizes a pre- and post-treatment
      comprehensive performance battery that will allow for meaningful clinical outcomes and a
      broad understanding of the effects of the treatment. This project represents a collaboration
      between the Department of Defense (DoD), the Richmond Veterans Administration Medical Center
      (VAMC) and Virginia Commonwealth University. Service members will be recruited from military
      bases/treatment facilities (MTF), receive hyperbaric oxygen at existing DoD hyperbaric
      chambers and be evaluated by the established Virginia Commonwealth University-Center for
      Rehabilitation Sciences and Engineering (CERSE), a collaborative research center co-located
      at the Richmond VAMC and VCU.
