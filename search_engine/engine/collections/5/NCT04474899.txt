      to receive either moxonidine 0.4mg daily or amlodipine 5mg and will later receive the
      alternate treatment.

      Comprehensive testing will occur after each 12 week treatment phase and will include
      assessment of muscle sympathetic nerve activity, gut microbiome analysis and metabolic
      markers.
