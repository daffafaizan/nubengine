    
      Aim of the study: Comparison of efficacy of cyclophosphamide 148mg/kg in 12 weeks and
      mycophenolate mofetil 1200mg/mÂ² during 18 months, in children with steroid dependent
      nephrotic syndrome.

      The 70 patients will be recruited in the 26 centres of paediatric nephrology in France,
      included and randomized at the time of a relapse. They will receive the same steroid
      treatment in the 2 arms.

      The primary point will be occurrence of a relapse during the 24 months of follow-up.
      Detection of relapse will be done by using dipsticks and confirm by biological dosages
      (albuminemia and proteinuria/CREATININURIA ratio). Clinical and biological check up will be
      done every 3 months during all the study.
