      digital impressions of the dental arches, therefore avoiding the use of conventional
      impression materials. Digital impression procedures are claimed to be an approach to improve
      the accuracy of dental restorations by minimizing the error prone to conventional impression
      and gypsum model casting, enabling a high degree of standardization. Patients often prefer
      intraoral scan when compared to the traditional impression. Digital impression is also
      recommended when patients have remaining teeth that are extremely mobile or misaligned, due
      to the risk of exfoliation during the conventional impression procedure.

      Despite its poor scientific and clinical evidence, the use of digital technologies into the
      daily practice registers a rapidly growing.

      The precision of digital impressions depends on two different parameters: the resolution of
      the optical scanning system, and the precision of the matching algorithm which may
      significantly influence the precision of full arch scans. In order to minimize the effect of
      matching artifacts, only small parts of the dental arch in close vicinity of the teeth are
      recommended to be scanned.

      For prosthetic restoration purpose, several studies regarding the accuracy of digital vs
      analogue impression have been performed, but none comparing the accuracy of digital vs
      partially digital workflow for prosthetically driven guided dental implant insertion.
