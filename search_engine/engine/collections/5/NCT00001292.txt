      which are believed to behave in a Mendelian manner. Families for study will be ascertained
      through articles in the Ichthyosis Focus, (the newsletter of the Foundation for Ichthyosis
      and Related Skin Types), physician referrals, and patient self-referrals. Efforts will be
      made to further characterize the clinical findings in both affected persons and unaffected
      gene carriers. Using candidate genes, especially those known to be involved in structural
      abnormalities of skin, we will attempt to map and isolate major genes contributing to
      expression of the disease phenotype. Failing this direct approach, a random search of the
      genome (so-called, "reverse genetics") will be utilized. In addition, normal and diseased
      skin will be used in cell culture and animal experiments (under a separate protocol) to test
      new therapeutic modalities.
