      of the anterior segment in the bimaxillary proclination cases treated by first premolar
      extraction. Torque loss affects the final outcome of the treatment negatively.

      Adding a lever arm to the lingual wire will transmit the point of force application at or
      apical to the center of rotation which will reduce or eliminate toqrue loss during anterior
      segment retraction.
