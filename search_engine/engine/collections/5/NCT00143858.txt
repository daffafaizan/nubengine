      passes through the limb. The limb also acts as an electrical conductor whose electrical
      impedence changes with limb geometry and volume. Each time the heart beats, the volume of the
      limb segment changes, and therefore its electrical impedence changes. A plethysmograph can be
      used to measure volume changes of a part of the body by producing a plethysmographic
      waveform. Selectively capturing a number of these plethysmographic wave forms with acceptable
      noise levels and averaging them using the EKG as a reference-timing signal generate a highly
      reproducible pulse volume signal. Signal averaged pulse volume measurement will be obtained
      non-invasively from the lower extremities of patient volunteers. A disposal non-occluding
      electrical monitoring strap will be applied to the calf of each patient. Changes in the
      calf's size/volume caused by changes in the patient's cardiac output and calf blood flow will
      result in electrical impedance changes. These changes will be recorded by an analog
      admittance plethysmograph attached to the lower extremity strap. The analog plethysmograph is
      coupled to a digital computer for signal enhancement and measurement.
