    
      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) has been reported to be effective for the treatment of knee
      osteoarthritis (OA). This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a single intraarticular
      injection of PRP for the treatment of early knee OA.

      In a prospective trial with 6-month follow-up, patients with early knee OA were recruited and
      received a single intraarticular PRP injection. Several outcomes were measured.
