      persistent atrial fibrillation (AF) in recent decade. However, catheter ablation of AF is
      associated with the occurrence of procedure-related thromboembolic events, especially the
      risk of asymptomatic cerebral embolism detected by brain high-resolution diffusion-weighted
      magnetic resonance imaging (hDWI). Meanwhile, ablation index guided high-power short-duration
      (AI-HPSD) strategy with the advanced SmartTouch SurroundFlow (STSF) catheter is an
      increasingly used technique for catheter ablation of AF, which is proposed to be associated
      with relatively wider and superficial lesions, less risk of esophageal injury, and shorter
      procedure time plus higher rate of first-pass pulmonary vein isolation. Moreover, the
      advanced STSF catheter in AI-HPSD strategy features with the Surround Flow entire tip
      irrigation system, which is a wide-spread distribution of the irrigating solution (56
      irrigation holes), resulting in homogenous cooling and protection from thrombus formation and
      reduced incidence of steam pops. Thus, comparing with the standard radiofrequency ablation
      technique using the SmartTouch (ST) catheter, the AI-HPSD strategy may associate with much
      lower risk of periprocedural asymptomatic cerebral embolism, with the application of advanced
      STSF catheter and shorter procedure time. Therefore, this study is designed as a prospective
      randomized controlled study to evaluate the risk of asymptomatic cerebral embolism during
      catheter ablation of AF with AI-HPSD strategy versus standard radiofrequency ablation
      settings, with the diagnosis of asymptomatic cerebral embolism is determined by brain hDWI.
