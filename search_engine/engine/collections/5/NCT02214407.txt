    
      ARM A: DECITABINE (DAC)

      Decitabine (DAC) will be administered at 20 mg/m2 intravenously daily for 5 days every 28
      days.

      Treatment will be delayed at the discretion of the investigator (up to D56) for febrile
      neutropenia (≥ 38.5°C; absolute neutrophil count [ANC], < 1,000/μL), clinical and/or
      microbiologic infection with grade 3 to 4 neutropenia (ANC < 1,000/μL), or hemorrhage with
      grade 4 thrombocytopenia (< 25,000 platelets/μL). If renal or hepatic dysfunction occurs,
      treatment will be stopped until resolution or withheld if dysfunction persists more than 4
      days. Persistent grade 4 thrombocytopenia or neutropenia beyond D49 will mandate bone marrow
      evaluation.

      Treatment will be continued until an event is reached. Events and thus study exit will be
      acknowledged only after agreement between the investigator and a Trial Committee.

      Allopurinol, 300mg/d, will be started at the time of inclusion; hydration during treatment
      will be administered to all patients. In (the rare) case of necessity, prophylactic
      anti-emetics could be given.

      Hydroxyurea may be added during the first 3 cycles if WBC counts > 30 G/L, and mandatory if
      WBC > 50 G/L. The daily dose will be adapted to maintain WBC below 15 to 20 G/L.

      ARM B: HYDROXYUREA (HY)

      Hydroxyurea (HY) 1g/d once daily, with dose adjustments (up to 4g/d) to maintain a WBC count
      between 5 and 10 G/L. Allopurinol, 300mg/d started at the time of inclusion will be
      administered to all patients.

      Treatment will be continued until an event is reached. Events and thus study exit will be
      acknowledged only after agreement between the investigator and a Trial Committee. This is
      intended to prevent early dropout, notably in the HY arm.

      Dose escalation will be performed by steps of 0.5 g/d, up to 4 g/d, if the WBC has been
      reduced by less than 20% and remains > 15 G/L. HY will then be adapted to maintain a WBC
      count between 5 and 10 G/L. HY will be lowered if platelets decrease by > 30 X 109/L (if
      initially below 100 X 109L). HY will be discontinued in cases of grade 4 thrombocytopenia or
      neutropenia, and reintroduced at a lower dose after recovery to grade ≤ 3. Persistent grade 4
      thrombocytopenia or neutropenia after a 4 week discontinuation will mandate bone marrow
      evaluation.
