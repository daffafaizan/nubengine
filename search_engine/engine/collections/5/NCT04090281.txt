      Adult patients will be eligible for inclusion if they provide informed consent and have no
      contraindications for 12-months of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT).

      Baseline Evaluation:

      Overview of clinical protocol: Patients with successful PCI will receive a genotype guided
      recommendation, upon discharge, based on CYP2C19 genotype. Patients who are determined to
      have CYP2C19 poor metabolizer (PM) or intermediate metabolizer (IM) status will be
      recommended to receive 12-months of prasugrel. Patients who are determined to have CYP2C19
      normal metabolizer (NM), rapid metabolizer (RM), or ultra-rapid metabolizer (UM) phenotype
      will be recommended to receive a de-escalation treatment, guided by on-treatment platelet
      reactivity phenotype at 14 days, post discharge.

      30-day, 6-month, and 12-month Follow-up: Patients will be contacted by phone or visited
      during one of their regularly scheduled appointments, at 14 days, 30 days, 6 months , and 12
      months, to complete "Follow-up Case Report Forms" to collect outcomes data. The 12-month
      follow up communication with enrolled patients will end their participation in the study.
