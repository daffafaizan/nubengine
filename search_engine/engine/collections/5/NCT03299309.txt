      will receive temozolomide 200 mg/m2/day x 5 days. If they are receiving bevacizumab at the
      time of enrollment, they will continue bevacizumab 10 mg/Kg every 14 days.

      Patients who are â‰¥ 18 years of age will receive a tetanus (Td) booster at the time of
      enrollment. Immunotherapy begins with a Tetanus (Td) pre-conditioning vaccine delivered
      intradermally (i.d.) in the right groin at the site of the vaccine injection 6-24 hours prior
      to the first vaccine on day 21. The PEP-CMV vaccine will be administered as follows: PEP-CMV
      Component A mixed with Montanide ISA-51 (1:1 volume ratio) intradermally administered half in
      the RIGHT groin and half in the LEFT groin.

      The first 3 PEP-CMV vaccines will occur every 2 weeks, then PEP-CMV vaccines will continue
      monthly (+/- 2 weeks) for no more than 10 years. Blood will be obtained for immune system
      monitoring.
