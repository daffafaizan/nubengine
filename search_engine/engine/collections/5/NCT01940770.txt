    
      To confirm the safety and efficacy of Bydureon (hereinafter referred to as Bydureon) in
      long-term use in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus under actual drug use.

        1. Primary Objective To confirm the safety profile in Japanese patients with type 2
           diabetes mellitus receiving Bydureon under daily practices.

        2. Secondary objective As the secondary objective of this S-CEI, the following items are to
           be investigated.

             -  Frequencies of AEs related to cardiovascular events, hypoglycaemia, digestive
                symptoms, and injection site reaction.

             -  Development of pancreatitis, renal impairment (especially acute renal failure),
                hypersensitivity reaction, and malignant tumour (especially thyroid tumour and
                pancreatic malignancy)

             -  Safety in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment

             -  Changes of weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, fasting blood sugar, fasting
                insulin, HbA1c, and blood lipids

             -  Bydureon administration under daily practices focusing on the patient's
                demographics and clinical characteristics of diabetes mellitus (duration of
                diabetes mellitus, treatment duration, complications, Bydureon administration, etc)

             -  Anti-exenatide antibody titer in AE cases (hypersensitivity, loss of control of
                blood sugar)
