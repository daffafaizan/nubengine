      and exclusion criteria, study primary and secondary outcome measures and study procedures).

      The MK-3475-189-Japanese Extension Study enrolled a total of 30 participants and the analyses
      included 10 participants (pembrolizumab =4; control = 6) that had been previously enrolled in
      the MK-3475-189 global study (NCT02578680), resulting in a total of 40 participants.
