      artery disease (CAD). Coronary physiological assessment is advocated in the catheter
      laboratory to guide percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and it is widely accepted that
      an FFR ≤ 0.80 is a good indicator for vessels to benefit from revascularization.
      Nevertheless, a significant proportion of PCI patients continue to experience adverse events
      related to both stented segment and/or residual or diffuse disease. Our group recently
      demonstrated the feasibility of pullback pressure gradient (PPG) derived from virtual
      Quantitative Flow Ratio (QFR) pullback curve, which is an index of atherosclerosis functional
      pattern and can be used to epitomize the pathophysiological pattern of CAD as focal or
      diffuse.

      In this regard, the current study will investigate the incremental value of PPG added to QFR
      haemodynamic assessment in ischemia-causing vessels received PCI in predicting adverse
      outcomes.

      The study cohort is derived from the PANDA-III study (Comparison of BuMA eG Based
      BioDegradable Polymer Stent With EXCEL Biodegradable Polymer Sirolimus-eluting Stent in
      "Real-World" Practice) (NCT02017275). In this cohort, vessels with measurable QFR≤ 0.80 will
      be included. According to the PPG index calculated from QFR virtual pullback curve and
      treatment strategy chosen, the included vessels were divided into three groups(vessels with
      PCI strategy and low PPG index (group A), vessels with PCI strategy with high PPG index
      (group B) and vessels with conservative strategy (group C)) and 2-year clinical outcomes for
      each group will be compared.
