    
      -  The participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each of 6 treatment cycles.
           Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days (4 weeks), during which time the participant will be
           taking the study drug enzalutamide by mouth (4 pills daily). The diary will also include
           special instructions for taking the enzalutamide.

        -  The participant will also be undergoing external beam radiation therapy during the
           study, for a duration of 8 Â½-10 weeks. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient
           basis. This part of the study is considered standard of care.

        -  The participant will be required to have fiducial markers placed within the prostate as
           part of this study. These are very small gold markers that are placed in the prostate.
           This procedure is similar to the biopsy that the participant had to diagnose their
           cancer. This procedure is routinely performed to permit imaging and position corrections
           to improve the precision of the external beam (radiation) delivery (Image Guided
           Radiation Therapy). The placement of the three gold markers is performed by an
           Urologist. The fiducials are placed under ultrasound guidance. This is also considered
           standard of care and is not experimental.

        -  Planned Follow-up: Participants will be followed on study at a 3 month follow-up after
           treatment (cessation of enzalutamide). Additional follow-up to assess the status of the
           participant's cancer will be conducted at the discretion of the treating physicians as
           part of the participant's routine medical care.
