           gram-negative microorganisms, both aerobes and anaerobes within the gastrointestinal
           tract. The main advantage of rifaximin is that it is poorly absorbable, which minimizes
           the antimicrobial resistance and adverse events and renders the drug safe in all patient
           populations. In addition, rifaximin has a better activity against gram-positive
           organisms than norfloxacin.

        -  The appreciation of the potential role of enteric flora in the pathogenesis of several
           gastrointestinal diseases has broadened the clinical use of rifaximin, which is now used
           for hepatic encephalopathy, small intestine bacterial overgrowth, inflammatory bowel
           disease, and Clostridium difficile infection. Theoretically, by reducing the total
           number of the gut bacteria, rifaximin could also be used to achieve intestinal
           decontamination in patients with liver cirrhosis and ascites, thus preventing
           spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

        -  A small retrospective study concluded that rifaximin suppresses intestinal bacterial
           overgrowth, bacterial translocation in cirrhotic patients with ascites with no history
           of previous spontaneous bacterial peritonitis episodes. Prospective clinical trials are
           warranted to evaluate the role of rifaximin for prevention of spontaneous bacterial
           peritonitis recurrence in cirrhotic patients.
