      participate.

      Participants will receive intensive physical therapy and working memory training for 14
      weeks.

      Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using motor imagery and working-memory tasks
      will be completed prior to and following therapy, as will be sensory organization tests
      (SOT), motor performance measures, and neuropsychological assessment.

      Prior to the start of CN-NINM training, each participant will undergo baseline evaluations
      including structural and fMRI, balance tests (SOT), Dynamic Gait Index (DGI),
      neuropsychological assessment (Handedness; Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI)
