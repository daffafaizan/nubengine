      their dinner. On the day prior or the day that patients are coming in for their pre-operative
      surgery blood work, we ask that they take the second dose with lunch, if their appointment is
      in the afternoon.

      At the start of the study and at the end of the study (3-6 weeks), patients will undergo
      interviews, complete questionnaires, and have lab tests to determine if this drug is
      effective to reduce progression of prostate cancer and is safe to use.

      Patients will also receive a multivitamin/mineral supplement for the 3-6 weeks that they are
      on this study and will be required to take one (1) every day. It is required that patients
      not take any other vitamin/mineral or herbal preparation containing isoflavones and avoid
      eating or drinking soy products.

      We anticipate that most patients will be scheduled for a prostatectomy 3-6 weeks (+/- 3 days)
      from start of study agent. In addition to their first visit, patients will be required to
      come in the day of the surgery for prostatectomy.
