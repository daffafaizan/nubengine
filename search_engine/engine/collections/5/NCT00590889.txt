      the incidence of prosthetic valve endocarditis. The null and alternative hypotheses of this
      study are:

        -  Ho: Patients receiving SJM Masters Series valves with Silzone coating will have an equal
           incidence of PVE when compared to those receiving the conventional cuff.

        -  Ha: Patients receiving SJM Masters Series valves with Silzone coating will have a
           reduced incidence of PVE when compared to those receiving the conventional cuff.
