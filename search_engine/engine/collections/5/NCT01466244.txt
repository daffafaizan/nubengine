    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Compare cetuximab activity, as reflected in response rate (RR), in PTEN-deficient and
           PTEN-expressing cancers.

      Secondary

        -  Examine RR, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) in PTEN-deficient
           and PTEN-expressing cancers, by treatment arm.

      OUTLINE: Tissue microarray slides collected earlier from ECOG-E5397 are immunostained with
      PTEN antibody and analyzed with AQUA.
