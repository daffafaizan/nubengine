      followed in the outpatient diabetic clinic of our hospital.

      Each patient will visit the Research Laboratory of the Diabetes Centre of our Department. The
      visit will take place in the morning in a fasting state of about 12 hours. Demographic data
      will be recorded along with the patients' habits, lifestyle, current medication and complete
      medical history of concomitant diseases.

      This will be followed by anthropometric measurements (weight, height, BMI) and afterwards
      blood samples will be taken for the determination of urea, creatinine, glucose, HbA1c and
      lipids. Part of each blood sample will be collected in tubes containing EDTA to determine
      fasting c-peptide concentrations. The presence of microalbuminuria will be assessed from a
      morning urine sample by calculating urinary albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR).

      The functionality of the heart's autonomic nervous system will be assessed through the use of
      heart rate variability (HRV) measurements, using the standard Ewing's tests panel: deep
      inhalation, standing up and Valsalva's manoeuvre. Changes in blood pressure when changing
      from the supine to the standing position will also be recorded. Subsequently, the
      distensibility of the large vessels will be determined, by calculating the conduction
      velocity of the pulse wave between the carotid and the femoral artery (pulse wave velocity
      (PWV)).

      Finally, a full transthoracic echocardiographic study will be carried out to assess
      functionality, systolic and diastolic, of the left ventricle (LV).

      All data will be recorded in an electronic database for statistical processing.
