    
      The overall aim of this prospective study is to provide an in-depth characterization of
      clinical and immunological features of patients hospitalized in UZ Leuven because of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. For this purpose, clinical data and blood, nasopharyngeal/rectal swab,
      and if safe, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung tissue samples will be collected
      from PCR- or CT-confirmed COVID-19 patients, with varying degrees of disease severity.
      Assessed characteristics will be compared between severe and non-severe COVID-19 patients,
      and between COVID-19 positive and negative ('control') patients.
