        1. Determine whether rituximab/belimumab/mmf is safe and tolerable in the treatment of
           patients with early diffuse cutaneous (dc)SSc when compared to patients treated with
           placebo/placebo/mmf, as assessed by comparison of adverse and serious adverse effects.
           In this study stand of care will be protocolized as mycophenolate mofetil.

        2. Determine whether rituximab/belimumab/mmf is more effective than placebo/placebo/mmf, as
           measured by change in CRISS, which is a composite outcome measure provisionally endorsed
           by the ACR for scleroderma clinical trials. It incorporates change in the mRSS, FVC
           percent predicted, physician and patient global assessments, and HAQ-DI. Additionally,
           hemoglobin corrected diffusion capacity (DLCO), Medsger Severity Scale (MSS), and by
           other physician and patient derived outcome measures will be used.

        3. Determine the biological activity of rituximab/belimumab/mmf vs placebo/placebo/mmf as
           assessed by effect on histology of skin, gene expression of skin and blood, change in
           B-Cell profiles including assessment of B regulatory cells, and effect on serological
           and cutaneous biomarkers of disease activity.
