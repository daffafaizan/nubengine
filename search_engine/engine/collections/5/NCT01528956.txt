        -  To perform whole-genome sequencing, deep sequencing, micro RNA analysis, methylation
           status, copy number variation analysis, and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
           analysis in pediatric adrenocortical tumors and compare those results to those of the
           same patient's normal cells.

      OUTLINE: Archived tumor and blood samples are analyzed for whole-genome sequencing, deep
      sequencing, micro RNA , methylation status, copy variation, and single-nucleotide
      polymorphisms. Results are then compared with patients' normal cells.
