      By injecting ASCs either into the internal carotid artery, these regions may become populated
      with the ASCs, thereby potentially restoring brain function. ASCs are a patient-derived
      ("autologous") cell transplantation technology that is delivered to the patient into the
      internal carotid artery and intravenously. The therapy is composed of cells derived from a
      patients' own adipose tissue that are isolated within approximately 1 hour and immediately
      delivered back to the patient.
