      Specific Aims:

      To investigate the interrelationship between macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) and
      free T4 in patients with PAH with a working hypothesis that an increased release of MIF into
      the pulmonary vasculature during cardiopulmonary exercise changes the normal balance between
      plasma MIF and T4.
