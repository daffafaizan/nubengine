      I. Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that can be utilized for a single
      treatment of Pc 4-PDT (silicon phthalocyanine 4 photo dynamic therapy) on subjects with
      mycosis fungoides (MF)/cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) stage IA-IIA, by evaluating an
      accelerated dose escalation protocol consisting of a single exposure to PDT using
      topically-applied Pc 4 and visible light at a wavelength of 675 nm, followed by assessment of
      skin biopsies to analyze cellular and molecular changes induced by Pc 4-PDT. (Cohort I)

      II. Determine safety and tolerability of repeated light (PDT) exposures after a single
      application of Pc 4 to a MF/CTCL plaque, using topically-applied Pc 4 and visible light at a
      wavelength of 675nm, followed by assessment of skin biopsies to analyze cellular and
      molecular changes induced by Pc 4-PDT. (Cohort II)

      III. Identification of targets for assessment of efficacy to assist in planning for a Phase
      II study.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive silicon phthalocyanine 4 topically and then undergo PDT.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks,
      and 30 days.
