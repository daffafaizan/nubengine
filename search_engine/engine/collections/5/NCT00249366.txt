      patients on chemical dependence units without other illness. On general medical hospital
      wards, withdrawal may be affected by comorbid medical illness. A clinical trial was
      undertaken to determine whether there is a difference between symptom-triggered (ST) and
      fixed-schedule (FS) dosing of lorazepam in patients hospitalized on general medical wards at
      a University medical center. Subjects were assessed by their nurses with the Revised Clinical
      Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol (CIWA-Ar) scale. Subjects in the ST arm received
      lorazepam doses based on CIWA-Ar score. Subjects in the FS arm received scheduled lorazepam
      with tapering over 4 days.
