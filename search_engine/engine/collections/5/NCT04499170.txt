      biochemical changes occur. One of the factors associated with old age is the decrease in the
      ability to balance posture and the high risk of falls. The literature brings the benefits of
      physical exercise in improving balance and preventing falls. However, few studies point to
      the benefits of flexibility techniques and their relationship with balance. The objective of
      this research is to evaluate the immediate effect of the muscle energy technique (TEM) on
      postural control responses in the elderly and young adults. The sample will be selected for
      convenience, with 50 participants of both sexes, young people between 18 and 35 years old and
      elderly people between 60 and 85 years old. Evaluation of postural control will be performed
      through the force platform during the unipodal and semi-tandem balance tests (2 repetitions
      of 30 seconds each, with rest of 30 seconds between them). The main parameters of postural
      control will be calculated using the pressure center derivative. After the balance tests, the
      participants will be submitted to TEM and immediately afterwards reassessed on the force
      platform. An analysis of variance will be used to compare the effects between groups (young
      versus elderly) and intervention (pre- and post-TEM) and the effects of interaction on the
      main variables of postural control. A beneficial effect of TEM is expected, especially in the
      elderly group. The results found in this study will contribute to the use of TEM and the
      increase of relevant clinical information to benefit the ability to balance in the elderly,
      in order to reduce the risk of falls.
