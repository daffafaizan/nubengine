      prevalence is still increasing. Asthma can be treated and controlled with guidance of health
      care professionals, and self-monitoring is an important aspect in this control.

      Respiratory nurses have become common caregivers in the treatment and control of asthma.
      Advances in information and communication technology have created the potential to monitor
      the asthma status of patients at a distance, named telemonitoring. These two developments
      come together in nurse-led telemonitoring programmes. Lung function tests, from which the
      peak expiratory flow (PEF) is the most commonly used, are recorded into an electronic
      monitor. By transferring monitor data to a central database a nurse can continuously
      supervise the disease status of individual patients. The use of stepwise protocols can enable
      nurses to independently adjust the medication by one step.

      Design: Randomized controlled trial comparing a nurse-led telemonitoring programme versus
      regular care in asthmatic outpatients aged 7 years and older.

      Primary outcome parameter: asthma-specific quality of life. Secondary outcome parameters:
      symptoms, generic quality of life, direct and indirect costs, satisfaction.
