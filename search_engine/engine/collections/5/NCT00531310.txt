      STUDY DESIGN:

      Patients less than 30 years of age with CML in 1st or 2nd chronic phase or 1st accelerated
      phase and a matched related donor, an unrelated cord blood donor, or an unrelated adult
      donor, will receive 6 days of IV Fludarabine, 4 doses of IV Busulfex, and 5 doses of
      Alemtuzumab. Patients with persistant RT-PCR positive BCR-Abl and/or Philadelphia chromosome
      positivity by cytogentics after Day + 100 and a matched related donor would receive DLIx1. If
      still BCR-Abl or Philadelphia chromosome positive at Day +180 and a matched related donor,
      patients would receive a second dose of DLI. All patients will receive STI-571 (Gleevec)
      after hematological reconstitution. Studies for immune reconstitution, chimersim, and MRD
      will be performed postt AlloSCT.
