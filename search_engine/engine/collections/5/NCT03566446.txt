      cancer diseases, that arise due to mutations in the hematopoietic stem cells in the bone
      marrow. Median age at diagnosis is approximately 65 years of age and approximately 400 Danes
      are diagnosed with MPN annually. The MPN comprise essential thrombocythemia (ET),
      polycythemia vera (PV) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). In December 2013 two independent
      research groups reported on the occurrence of somatic mutations in exon 9 of the calreticulin
      gene in patients with ET and PMF.

      The overall rationale for a vaccine with CALR-mutant epitopes is that it will initiate a
      CALR-mutant specific immune response, which will "release the brakes" on the CALR-mutant
      specific immune response.

      10 patients treated with standard therapy are needed for the trial and each patient will
      receive 15 vaccinations over the course of one year.
