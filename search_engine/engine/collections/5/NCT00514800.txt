      in the community is often inadequate. Home blood pressure monitoring may increase patients'
      involvement in their care, increase compliance, and reduce the need for patients to attend
      their GP if blood pressure is adequately controlled. However the value of home monitoring to
      improve BP control is unclear and there is now a window of opportunity for evaluation before
      their use becomes widespread in the UK. Furthermore its use in stroke patients presents
      unique challenges relating to the consequent neurological disability.
