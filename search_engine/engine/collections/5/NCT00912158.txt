      positive airway pressure (BiPAP) to standard medical therapy (ST) on intensive care unit
      (ICU) stay, hospital stay, mortality, need for endotracheal intubation, partial arterial O2

      output in patients admitted to the respiratory intensive care unit (ICU) or cardiac care unit
      (CCU) with acute CPE with gas exchange abnormalities and to evaluate the impact of heart
      failure type on the outcome of different therapeutic schedules.
