      I. Evaluate if no additional intervention is noninferior to intrathecal analgesia (ITA) for
      postoperative pain experience 24 hours after surgery after laparotomy for gynecological
      malignancy within an established enhanced recovery pathway which includes incisional
      liposomal bupivacaine (ILB).

      II. Evaluate the effect of intrathecal analgesia on patient satisfaction with postoperative
      analgesia after laparotomy for gynecological malignancy.

      III. Report the impact of ITA use on cost. IV. Validate the Quality of Recovery (QOR)-15 in
      our population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo standard of care laparotomy and then receive liposomal bupivacaine.

      ARM II: Patients undergo standard of care laparotomy and then receive liposomal bupivacaine
      and hydromorphone intrathecally (IT).
