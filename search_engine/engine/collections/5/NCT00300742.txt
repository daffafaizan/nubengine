      abuse. Evidence has shown this population to have higher rates of psychiatric comorbidity,
      higher caloric intakes during meals, higher rates of tobacco use, more frequent binge
      episodes, and an earlier age of onset for binge eating and alcohol abuse. It is believed that
      topiramate may reduce binge eating and has been found helpful in reducing the cravings
      associated with alcohol consumption.

      This study is to test the feasibility of administering topiramate to individuals with alcohol
      dependence and binge eating disorder. This will involve determining the adequacy of the
      amount of assessment and scheduled visits.
