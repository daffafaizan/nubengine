      approximately 70 % of pregnant women i Norway, should have an OGTT performed in gestational
      week 24-28. Among those women, all primiparas above the age of 25 years old.

      women will be asked to participate in the study when they attend an ultrasound examination at
      the Obstetric outpatient clinic in gestational week 18-20. Prior to inclusion, participants
      need to sign written informed consent.

      Included women will get an appointment for OGTT in gestational week 24-28 at the Clinical
      trial unit, Stavanger University hospital. The OGTT will be performed according to national
      guidelines. The participants will fill in a single questionaire with information on age,
      height, ethnicity, whether there is diabetes in close family, any other illnesses, smoking
