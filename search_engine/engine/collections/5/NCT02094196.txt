      adapting the behavior to environmental changes, i.e. learning in response to reward
      contingencies. This learning deficit is of clinical relevance particularly during therapy and
      for the psychosocial outcome.

      The reduced availability of central dopamine D2-receptors in detoxified alcohol dependent
      patients observed in PET investigations and their hypothetical effects on reward-related
      learning are in line with evidence for learning deficits in hypodopaminergic states,
      particularly for avoidance learning in non-dependent samples. Growing evidence indicates that
      the learning-related striatal dopamine signals are modulated by higher executive functions
      involving, e.g., the prefrontal cortex.

      Here, broad glutamatergic outputs of the prefrontal cortex are crucial for subcortical
      learning mechanisms and match with recent models of interactive dopamine-glutamate
      dysfunctions and models of neurotrophic signaling in alcohol dependence.
