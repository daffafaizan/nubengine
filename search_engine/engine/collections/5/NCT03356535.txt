      are associated with disease-related lifestyle factors. This study identified metabolic
      signatures reflecting lifestyle patterns and related them to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      risk in the EPIC cohort. Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis related seven modified Healthy
      Lifestyle Index variables (diet, BMI, physical activity, lifetime alcohol, smoking, diabetes,
      hepatitis) to 132 targeted serum-measured metabolites, and a liver function score in a nested
      study of HCC with 147 case-control pairs. The association between the resulting PLS scores
      and HCC risk was examined in multivariable conditional logistic regression models where odds
      ratios (OR) and their 95% confidence intervals (95%CI) were computed. The PLS-derived
      lifestyle component reflected a high propensity towards healthy behaviours. Its metabolic
      counterpart was positively related to the following metabolites: SM(OH) C14:1, C16:1 and
      C22:2, and negatively to glutamate, hexoses, and PC aaC32:1. The lifestyle and metabolomics
      components were inversely associated with HCC risk with OR for a 1-SD increase in scores
      equal to 0.49(95%CI=0.35 to 0.68) and 0.28(0.18 to 0.43).

      Measuring a specific metabolites panel may identify strata of the population at higher risk
      for HCC and can add substantial discrimination compared to questionnaire data
