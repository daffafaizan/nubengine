      Melanosis and keratosis are the most common manifestations of arsenicosis. The exact
      mechanism of development of keratosis is not clear. With chronic ingestion of arsenic
      contaminated water the excretion of arsenic through skin increases and also the oxidative
      stress, which in turn cause cellular damage. These changes may influence the growth of normal
      bacteria and consistency of skin, which may be responsible for keratosis. In different study
      results shown that, vitamin E, a potential antioxidant that halts lipid peroxidation and
      maintains cell membrane integrity, also detoxified arsenic from the body. Normal skin
      bacteria mainly composed of Gram +ve bacteria. In arsenicosis, this pattern changes from Gram
      +ve bacteria to Gram -ve bacteria. Still now no study have been conducted to see, the effect
      of vitamin E on skin bacteria in arsenicosis, as skin bacteria changes. Therefore, this study
      will be conducted to observe any change in aerobic bacterial pattern on the skin of
      arsenicosis before and after administration of vitamin E capsules. Fifteen patients with skin
      manifestations, 15 arsenic exposed control, 15 healthy volunteers will be recruited on the
      basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. They will be provide vitamin E capsules 200 IU
      twice daily for 12 weeks without any interruption. Water and nail samples will be collected
      for confirming the diagnosis. Skin samples will be collected two times (before and after
      giving vitamin E) for qualitative analysis of bacteria. All the patients, arsenic exposed
      controls and healthy subjects will be provided with same capsule in same dosage schedule. So,
      this study will find any change of skin bacteria pattern after administrating vitamin E
      capsule.
