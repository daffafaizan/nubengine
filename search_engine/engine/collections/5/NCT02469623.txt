      protocol and their corresponding NCT numbers are as follows:

      NCT01914549 (Protocol CL-SVT-001, Site Belgium, Bruges Dr. Duytschaever = PI) NCT01875614
      (Protocol CL-SVT-002, Sites in the UK, Drs. Grace, Hall, & Schilling = PIs) NCT03368781
      (Protocol CL-SVT-004, Site Hamburg, Germany Prof. Willems = PI) NCT02469623 (Protocol
      CL-SVT-005, Site Prague, Czech Republic Prof. Neuzil = PI) NCT02469636 (Protocol CL-SVT-006,
      Site Santiago, Chile Dr. Bittner = PI) NCT02469649 (Protocol CL-SVT-008, Site Ontario, Canada
      Dr. Verma = PI)

      All of the above records were combined into one as all protocols were essentially identical
      and one study report was written that encompasses the data/results for all protocols.
