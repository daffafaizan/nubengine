    
      This study is being done to evaluate whether the Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound System Assisted
      FHR phantom testing conclusions can be extrapolated onto human fetal heart rate measurements,
      where CTG (GE Corometrics 170 Series Fetal Monitor) is to provide a reference value. It
      should be noted that the Vscan Access R2 Ultrasound System with Assisted FHR has a different
      intended use than CTG (momentary FHR value versus continuous monitoring of FHR patterns and
      trends) and this aspect is out of scope of this research.

      Usability data will be gathered for further user experience optimization.
