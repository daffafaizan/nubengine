    
      The proposed study will be a prospective cohort study of all patients with actinic cheilitis
      presenting to the study institution, the Queen Elizabeth II Health Science Center in Halifax,
      from March 1st 2021- March 1st 2023.

      Patients will be consented to participate at the time of their initial consultation. They
      will fill out the demographics form, a preliminary survey and have the required photographs
      taken on that same day. A biopsy will be performed prior to treatment to establish the
      histological grade of their actinic cheilitis based on the degree of dysplasia. After the
      treatment is received, they will follow-up in 1 month for reassessment. At this point, a
      second treatment will be offered if clinical remission has not been achieved. Patients will
      continue TCA treatments at 1-month intervals until clinical remission is reached. Once
      remission is achieved, they will fill out the post-treatment questionnaire and have their
      second set of photos taken.

      Final follow-up will occur 6 months post remission. At this point patients will be assessed
      for clinical recurrence. A third set of photos will be completed during this appointment.
