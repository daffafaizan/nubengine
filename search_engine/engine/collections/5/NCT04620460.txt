      schizophrenia patients. We plan to enroll 40 patients. After screening and baseline
      evaluations, patients with schizophrenia will be treated with active LIFUS or sham
      stimulation for 3 weeks on the left DLPFC. The multimodal MRI will be acquired. Clinical
      symptoms and cognitive function will be assessed respectively at baseline, after the first
      treatment and after the end of the treatment.
