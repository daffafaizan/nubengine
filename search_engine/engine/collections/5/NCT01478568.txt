      interaction between mirabegron and desipramine. The effect of mirabegron on the plasma
      concentration of desipramine will be evaluated after 13 day repeated administration. The
      recovery of CYP2D6 activity is also being explored by comparing the pharmacokinetic profiles
      of desipramine after a 2 week wash-out period.
