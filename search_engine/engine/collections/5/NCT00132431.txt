      includes Sensipar on bio-intact parathyroid hormone (biPTH), adjusted serum calcium (Ca),
      serum phosphorus (P), and calcium-phosphorus product (Ca x P) levels in the management of
      SHPT in CKD subjects on dialysis by determining achievement of National Kidney Foundation
      Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) Guideline targets. - To assess the use of
      vitamin D sterols and phosphate binders when Sensipar is incorporated in the treatment of
      SHPT. - To assess the safety and tolerability of Sensipar.
