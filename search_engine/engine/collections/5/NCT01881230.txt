    
      ABI-007-MBC- 001 is a Phase 2/3, multicenter, open-label, randomized, study that will compare
      the safety and efficacy of weekly nab-paclitaxel in combination with gemcitabine or
      carboplatin to the combination of gemcitabine and carboplatin as first line therapy in female
      subjects with Estrogen Receptor (ER), Progesterone Receptor (PgR), and human epidermal growth
      factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative (triple negative) metastatic breast cancer (TNMBC) or
      metastatic triple negative breast cancer. In the phase 2 portion of the study, the
      combinations of nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel plus carboplatin will be
      evaluated, and a comparator arm of gemcitabine combined with carboplatin will be used. In the
      phase 3 portion of the study, the selected nab-paclitaxel combination treatment will be
      compared to gemcitabine combined with carboplatin to evaluate progression free survival,
      safety and tolerability, overall survival, disease control rate and duration of response in
      women with metastatic triple negative breast cancer.

      Due to changes in the treatment landscape since the initiation of this trial, the decision
      was made not to proceed to the Phase 3 portion of the study.
