           large series of 3,142 patients with traumatic spinal fractures, Wang et al., 2012,
           reported that 54.9% of the patients had fractures in the thoracolumbar spine. Patients
           with complete neurological deficits generally have thoracic fractures, possibly due to a
           small canal diameter when compared to the cervical or lumbar spine Although grouped
           together, TLST is comprised of injures to the more rigid thoracic spine (T1-T10), the
           flexible and transitional thoracolumbar junction (T11-L2), more susceptible to injuries,
           and the lumbar spine L3-5. Early diagnosis and adequate management may improve patients'
           outcome and decrease its inherent disability.(1)

        -  Morphological classification of thoraco-lumbar fractures is based on the Magerl
           classification modified by the AOSpine Classification Group. For this evaluation
           radiograms and CT scans with multiplanar reconstructions are essential. In some cases
           additional MR images might be necessary.(2)

        -  The goal of fracture treatment is to obtain and maintain a stable reduction and early
           mobilization. A secondary aim is to restore sagittal alignment which has gained
           increasing emphasis in the last decade.(3)

        -  Posterior short segment fixation including the proximal and distal adjacent normal
           vertebrae is the most commonly performed surgery for the vast majority of thoracolumbar
           fractures, Posterior pedicle screw fixation has been shown to be simple, familiar,
           efficient, reliable, and safe for the reduction and stabilization of most fractures and
           remains the most popular technique.(4)

        -  The aim of our study is to compare between monoaxial short segment pedicle screw
           fixation and polyaxial short segment pedicle screw fixation
