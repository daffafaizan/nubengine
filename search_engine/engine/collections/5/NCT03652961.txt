      who do not have RA. The purpose of this study is to examine your immune cells and proteins
      before you start to take study medication and after you start treatment with an approved
      therapy for RA, abatacept that will be given in combination with Methotrexate and/or
      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDS) that are approved for the treatment of RA. This study will
      assess whether you have clinically responded to these medications. This assessment will also
      include a study of whether characteristics of your immune system were changed by therapy with
      the study drug, abatacept.
