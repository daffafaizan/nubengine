      orally-administered C7 in G1D.

      Triheptanoin: a triglyceride oil containing three odd-carbon chain-length fatty acids (i.e.,
      a triglyceride of 7-carbon heptanoic acid). Triheptanoin will be taken 4 times per day
      (approximately every 6 hours) by mouth. it is dosed 4 times per day, divided evenly, and the
      total C7 daily dose will re-place 40% or 45% (depending on group) of the daily caloric intake
      from fat in the usual diet, based on current protocol guidelines. The oil should be taken
      approximately one hour before meals, and will be mixed with fat-free, sugar-free yogurt or
      pudding for administration.

      Up to thirty-six subjects will be enrolled in a 10-day maximum tolerable dose trial of C7.
      Initiation of C7 dosing will be conducted in the Children's Medical Center Dallas ambulatory
      Care Pavilion neurology Clinic. Subjects will be provided with C7 oil to take over the 7 days
      of administration.

      Subjects will not be required to stop other medications. Subjects will be directed to
      maintain their usual medications, including rescue seizure medications, as necessary for the
      course of the study. Subjects may have any clinical medical records transferred back to their
      referring physician at completion of the study.
