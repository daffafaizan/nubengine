      thoracic radiation followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) based on a randomized
      trial that demonstrated a significant improvement in overall survival (OS) with PCI.
      Unfortunately radiation therapy to the brain is associated with neurocognitive toxicity,
      which may be at least in part related to radiation induced injury to neural progenitor cells
      in the hippocampus. Both human and animal data suggest an inverse relationship between
      radiation dose to the hippocampus and performance on neuropsychological testing. We
      hypothesize that hippocampal sparing PCI will allow improved performance on tests of short
      term memory and executive function compared to a historical control (RTOG 0212) receiving the
      same dose of conventional PCI. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate performance
      on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised for delayed recall at 6 months following
      hippocampal-sparing PCI relative to the historical control. Secondary objectives are to
      estimate: 1) composite cognitive function following hippocampal-sparing PCI relative to the
      historical control and 2) the rate of metastases in the hippocampus at 2 years following
      hippocampal-sparing PCI. The long term goal of this research is to reduce the long term
      sequelae of radiation therapy for both primary and metastatic brain tumors.
