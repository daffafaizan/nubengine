      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Hyperinsulinemia stimulates ovarian cytochrome P450c17
      alpha activity, in obese and nonobese women with PCOS, thereby increasing serum levels of
      17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, androgens concentrations, decreasing SHBG and promoting the
      clinical features of hyperandrogenism.

      In women with PCOS, weight loss improves insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism, resulting
      in improvement of clinical symptoms. Since lean women with PCOS do not have the option of
      weight loss, it is important to know weather diet composition and meal timing distribution
      may influence glucose metabolism and hyperandrogenism.

      We hypothesized that a timing pattern of increased nutrient intake of protein and
      carbohydrates in the morning, with decreased caloric intake at night would improve insulin
      sensitivity and hyperandrogenism in lean women with PCOS.

      Objective:The objective of this study is to investigate the effects of two isocaloric diets
      with different meal timing distribution on insulin resistance and hyperandrogenism in lean
      PCOS women.
