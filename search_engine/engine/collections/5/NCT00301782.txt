      Primary

        -  Compare the response rate in patients with poor-prognosis extracranial nonseminoma germ
           cell tumors treated with intensive induction chemotherapy comprising cisplatin,
           vincristine, bleomycin, and carboplatin followed by bleomycin, etoposide phosphate, and
           cisplatin (BEP) vs standard BEP chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare overall and progression-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, randomized study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating center, pre-protocol low-dose chemotherapy (yes vs no), and other
      clinically important factors. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (BEP): Patients receive bleomycin IV over 15 minutes once on day 1 or 2 and days 8
           and 15 and etoposide phosphate IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1-5.
           Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II (CBOP/BEP): Patients receive chemotherapy according to the following schedule:

             -  Weeks 1-6: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours on days 1, 2, 8, 15, 16, and
                22 (OR over 4 hours on days 1-5 and 15-19); vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22,
                29, and 36; bleomycin IV over 15 minutes on days 1, 15, 29, and 36 and bleomycin IV
                continuously on days 8-12 and 22-25; and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days
                8 and 22.

             -  Weeks 7-15: Patients receive bleomycin IV continuously on days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19
                and etoposide phosphate IV over 1 hour and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1-5.
                Treatment repeats every 21 days for 4 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.
