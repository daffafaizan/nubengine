    
      1. Patients: 30 patients (10 patients in each 3 group)

        2. Indication:

             -  Patients with Primary hepatocellular carcinoma combined liver cirrhosis (Hepatitis
                B, C, Non-B Non-C)

             -  Planned to right hepatectomy or extended right hepatectomy

             -  Patients who need right portal vein embolization due to insufficient expected
                remnant liver volume (< 40%) or severe hepatic dysfunction(ICGR15>10%)

             -  Child A classification

             -  ICG R15 < 25%

             -  Age : 20 - 70 years old

             -  Expected life period > 3months

             -  The patients who agreed to this study.

        3. Contraindication

             -  Patients who planned liver transplantation

             -  Age <20 or >70 years old

             -  Pregnant women

             -  Patients on acute infection

             -  Acute hepatic failure

             -  Child class B or C

             -  Heart failure

             -  Patients who did not agree to this study.

        4. Allocation: We will allocate patients randomly to three group including control group.

        5. Methods

             -  Group 1: 4 days injection of G-CSF -> Plasma pheresis, Selection of CD34 cell ->
                Right portal vein embolization and infusion of CD34 cell into left portal vein.

             -  Group 2: 4 days injection of G-CSF -> Plasma pheresis -> Right portal vein
                embolization and infusion of mononuclear cell into left portal vein.

             -  Group 3 (control): Right portal vein embolization

           ( -> after 4 weeks, operation will be performed)

        6. Evaluation: Change of liver volume, liver function test before and after portal vein
           embolization
