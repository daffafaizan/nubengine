      treatment compared to Androgel (topic gel) after 60 days of starting use. The efficacy
      endpoint will be verified through the percentage of participants which presented at the end
      of 60 days normalized levels of total testosterone (<300 ng/dL to >1050 ng/dL). Secondary
      efficacy endpoints will be collected throughout the study through: evaluation of symptoms of
      erectile dysfunction (The International Index of Erectile Function - IIEF), symptoms of
      prostatic disease (International Prostate Symptom Score - IPSS), measurement of abdominal
      perimeter and clinical global response to treatment (CGI-I questionnaire). As exploratory
      investigation, the satisfaction/comfort of Nasotestt use will be assessed by a specific
      questionnaire that will be applied to participants at the end of study. Safety evaluation
      data will include report of all adverse events, including type, frequency, intensity,
      seriousness, severity and action taken related to the investigational product of the study.
