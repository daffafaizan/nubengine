      several lymphocyte subsets from lymph nodes. This results in immunosuppression that has a
      beneficial effect in patients with multiple sclerosis.

      Our laboratory reported that increased expression of a possible biomarker signature,
      consisting of TLR2, TLR4 and CCR1, in a T-subset is associated with rapid MS progression. The
      investigators will test whether a significant proportion of patients at baseline upregulate
      this biomarker signature in one or more T-subsets, whether expression of this biomarker
      signature changes with treatment with Gilenya and whether expression levels of this signature
      predict disease activity or progression over a 12 month followup period. The investigators
      will study patients who are already being treated with Gilenya by their neurologists or who
      are already being treated with Gilenya as part of a clinical trial sponsored by Novartis
      Pharmaceuticals Canada. Patients will not be treated with Gilenya for the purposes of our
      study.
