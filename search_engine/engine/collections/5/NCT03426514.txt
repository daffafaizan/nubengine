      four or more ports has been routine in most laparoscopic colorectal resections. However，the
      drawbacks are the need for added manpower, consisting of another assistant to provide
      counter-traction, as well as costs and the unaesthetic effects of additional ports. In order
      to minimize surgical trauma, improve cosmesis ,reduce manpower，single-incision laparoscopic
      surgery (SILS) is attracting increasing attention. But it is challenging and highly demanding
      techniques. Becoming proficient at three-port laparoscopic surgery can make the transition to
      SILS more nature.Few studies about three-port laparoscopic surgery for colorectal
      cancer（TLSC） have been reported currently.More studies, especially large-scale, randomized
      controlled trials are needed to establish the best indications for TLSC. This is a
      single-center, open-label, non-inferiority, randomized controlled trial. A total of 282
      eligible patients will be randomly assigned to TLSC group and CLSC group at a 1:1 ratio. It
      will provide valuable clinical evidence for the objective assessment of the the feasibility,
      safety, and potential benefits of TLSC compared with CLSC.
