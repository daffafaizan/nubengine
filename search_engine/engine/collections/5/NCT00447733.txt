      high suicide rates, high treatment drop-out rates and long-lasting interpersonal, work,
      school, health and legal problems. Because mental disorders and substance use disorders
      co-exist and interact, it may be important to provide a treatment that addresses the
      substance misuse and mental health problems in an integrated and comprehensive way.
      Additionally, the health services for patients with mental health and substance use disorders
      are usually provided by different services and health professionals that rarely cooperate or
      have qualifications on both kinds of disorders. This also calls for an integration of the
      services on an organizational level. This approach of integrating services and treatment
      approaches for both diseases in a comprehensive way is called Integrated Treatment. Several
      studies have shown that Integrated Treatment is effective in treating the comorbidity of
      severe mental illness and substance use disorders. The over-all aim of this study is to
      evaluate the effects of evidence-based Integrated Treatment in anxiety and/or depression with
      co-occurring substance use disorders. The effects of the treatment will be assesses on
      changes in substance use and psychopathology.
