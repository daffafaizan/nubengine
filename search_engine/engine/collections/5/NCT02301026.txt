      Kidney Disease (CKD), who may suffer from absolute iron deficiency due to continuous blood
      losses and/or functional iron deficiency due to erythropoiesis stimulating agent treatment or
      impaired release from iron stores.

      Much evidence indicates that adequate iron supply is necessary to achieve optimal responses
      to ESAs and thereby potentially avoid ESA induced ADRs.

      Pharmacosmos has been working with dialysis providers for many years and identified a medical
      need for a new safe and cost-effective low dose intravenous (IV) iron that can be
      administered frequently. Diafer® is a new low dose iron formulation based on iron
      isomaltoside 1000, with doses restricted to maximum 200 mg iron pr. injection. No test dose
      is needed and Diafer® may be administered as a push injection.

      The primary objective of the study is to monitor initiated Diafer® therapy administered
      according to hospital practice and the product labeling in routine clinical practice in HD
      patients with CKD. The scientific rationale being to fulfil a need for systematic
      information/auditing on applied practice including long term experience with the use of IV
      iron in the HD setting. This information will provide an evidence base for optimised
      treatment procedures.
