      controlled cross over study with randomization of the order of interventions. After 5 days
      each on low salt (about 1 gram/day) and high salt (about 6 grams/day)diet, with a washout
      period of at least four weeks in between, every subject was treated with Enalapril and
      Placebo on two consecutive days, followed by a Fenoldopam infusion for three hours, during
      which natriuresis and renal function testing were performed.
