      platinum-based CRT and is FDA-approved for initial treatment of LAHNSCC, but outcomes remain
      unfavorable. Recently, EphB4 has emerged as another rational target. While minimally
      expressed in normal tissue, it is highly expressed in LAHNSCC and has been implicated in
      resistance to both EGFR-targeted therapy and to RT. Suppression of EphB4 in the preclinical
      setting has enhanced tumor death and enhanced radiosensitivity. The novel agent sEphB4-HSA is
      a fusion protein that binds the ligand for EphB4 and leads to inhibition of tumor
      proliferation and angiogenesis. It was well-tolerated as monotherapy in a phase I trial but
      has yet to be explored in combination with radiotherapy or EGFR-directed treatments. A
      combined modality approach adding sEphB4-HSA to standard-of-care RT plus cetuximab represents
      a rational, targeted approach for investigation in patients with high risk LAHNSS
      p16-negative or any patient with heavy smoking histories. Moreover, a short window period of
      sEphB4-HSA monotherapy between baseline biopsy and repeat biopsy prior to initiation of
      cetuximab with RT will both minimize potential treatment delay and allow for the
      identification of potential biomarkers of response to sEphB4-HSA. Finally, a third optional
      biopsy, to be done if feasible after initiation of cetuximab-radiation, will allow us to
      identify radiosensitization markers and potential markers for treatment de-escalation. MTD.
