      feedback about their brain activity while undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging.
      Previous research has shown that participants can successfully use the feedback to
      self-regulate their brain responses. In this study patients who have successfully completed a
      detoxification programme will be trained to down-regulate/upregulate responses of
      motivational brain regions that are activated during exposure to alcohol/life goal-related
      stimuli (pictures of alcoholic drinks/life goals related). The investigators hypothesise that
      learning to self-regulate these neural responses will enable patients to better control
      craving responses to environmental alcohol cues after detoxification treatment. Patients in
      the intervention group will undergo 6 neurofeedback training sessions, spread across 4
      months. Outcomes of the training will be compared with a group of patients who will not do
      the neurofeedback training but receive standard treatment (e.g. support groups and
      medication).
