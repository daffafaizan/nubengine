      recently extubated patients having some form of dysphagia with elevated risk for silent
      aspiration.One challenge providers face when managing post extubation dysphagia (PED) is that
      there are no best practice guidelines on how to evaluate for PED, specifically how to
      evaluate for silent aspiration (aspiration without cough response).

      One method that has been suggested is the Yale Swallow Protocol (YSP), a pass/fail screen for
      aspiration consisting of a three ounce water challenge as well as a brief cognitive screen
      and oral motor exam. The assumption of the YSP is that silent aspiration (aspiration without
      a cough response) is volume dependent. This is based on a study of over 4000 patients that
      underwent both a FEES (5mL puree and 5mL liquid boluses) and a 3oz water challenge. Results
      from previous literature indicated that the 3oz water swallow had a high sensitivity for
      detecting aspiration (98%). This was again studied with a double blind research design with
      25 patients, comparing results of the 3oz water challenge with results of videofluoroscopic
      swallow study. This showed 100% sensitivity for detecting aspiration, 64% specificity, 78%
      positive predictive value, and 100% negative predictive value. However, no published study
      has evaluated the YSP in recently extubated patients and so it is unclear if the high
      sensitivity and specificity would be retained. Investigators aim to determine the sensitivity
      and specificity of the Yale Swallow Protocol in identifying aspiration in recently extubated
      patients.
