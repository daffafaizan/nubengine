      involved in the body's immune response), is the hallmark of MS. Recent evidence suggests that
      plasma cells are resident in the meninges (protective membranes of the brain and spinal cord)
      of people with Multiple Sclerosis (pwMS). Ixazomib is a drug which has been effective in
      treating multiple myeloma, a disease caused by aberrant plasma cells. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate whether ixazomib can reduce or clear OCBs from the cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) of pwMS. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either ixazomib
      capsules (active drug arm) or placebo capsules (placebo arm) for up to 24 months.
      Participants with relapsing remitting MS (who are stable on disease modifying therapy) and
      those with progressive MS (who are not on disease modifying therapy) will be invited to take
      part in the study.
