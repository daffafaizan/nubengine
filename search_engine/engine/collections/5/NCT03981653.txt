      of pro- and antiangiogenic factors such as placenta growth factor (PlGF) or Soluble FMS like
      tyrosin-kinase-1 (sFlt-1), and more particularly on human differentiated trophoblastic cells
      from "healthy" placentas. The measurement of the variation in gene and protein expression of
      placental angiogenic factors will provide a better understanding of their pathophysiology.

      Secondary objectives are the study of trophoblastic differentiation and placental functions,
      and the study of the impact of chemical compounds on the biological functions of the
      placenta. To do this, these "healthy" placentas may be exposed to different factors that
      promote the occurrence of specific pregnancy pathologies such as pre-eclampsia and vascular
      intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), caused by placental dysfunction. This will make it
      possible to test molecules and vector approaches targeted directly at the trophoblast, in
      order to consider therapeutic targets, which do not exist to date.
