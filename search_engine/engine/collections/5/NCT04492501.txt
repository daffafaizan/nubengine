      moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 in addition to standard treatment; An Open label,
      Phase 2 Study Clinical Phase: multi arm, Phase 2 Open Label Conducted by: Department of
      Pulmonology and Critical Care; Pak Emirates Military Hospital. Sample Size: 600 Study
      Population: Hospitalized COVID-19 patients aged â‰¥18 years to 80 years of with Moderate-
      severe-critical disease Study Duration: 1st April, 2020 to 31st July 2020 Study Design: This
      open label phase 2 trial will assess the efficacy and safety of following treatment options
      1. Standard treatment including steroids 2. Therapeutic plasma exchange in addition to
      standard treatment 3. Therapeutic Plasma exchange in combination with Convalescent Plasma in
      addition to standard treatment 4. Tocilizumab in addition to standard treatment 5. Remdesivir
      alone or in combination with Therapeutic plasma exchange in addition to standard treatment 6.
      Mesenchymal stem cell therapy in combination with other investigational treatments in
      addition to standard treatment Operational Definitions

        1. Moderate disease:

           COVID-19 positive case with lung infiltrates < 50% of total lung fields on Chest X-ray /
           peripheral ground glass opacities (GGOs) on High Resolution Computerized Tomography
           (HRCT)chest but no evidence of hypoxemia.

        2. Severe disease:

           COVID-19 pneumonia with evidence of hypoxemia (RR > 30/minute or PaO2 on ABGs < 80mmHg
           or PaO2/FiO2 (PF ratio) < 300 or lung infiltrates > 50% of the lung field).

        3. Critical illness:

           COVID-19 pneumonia with evidence of either respiratory failure (PaO2 < 60mmHg) or
           multiorgan dysfunction syndrome (MODS) measured by Sequential Organ Failure assessment
           (SOFA score) > 10 or septic shock (Systolic BP less than 90 or less than 40mm Hg of
           baseline in hypertensive or Urine output < 0.5 ml/kg/hour).Age, sex, comorbidities, date
           of symptoms, source of infection, type of admission SOFA score, Clinical status, vital
           signs including temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, oxygen requirement,
           Complete Blood counts (CBC) with neutrophil counts, lymphocytes count, C-reactive
           Proteins (CRP), chest imaging (CT or X-ray), location and status in hospital

        4. Cytokine release storm (CRS):

      Diagnostic criteria of Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) CRS is defined as fever of equal to or
      more than 100 F persisting > 48 hours in absence of documented bacterial infection and ANY of
      the following in the presence of moderate, severe or critical disease

        1. Ferritin >1000 mcg/L and rising in last 24 hours

        2. Ferritin >2000 mcg/L in patient requiring high flow oxygen or ventilation

        3. Lymphopenia < 800 cells/ul or lymphocyte percentage <20% and two of the following

             1. Ferritin >700 mcg/mL and rising in the last 24 hours

             2. LDH > 300 IU (reference 140-250 IU/L) and rising in the last 24 hours

             3. D-Dimer >1000ng/mL (or >1mcg/ml) and rising in the last 24 hours

             4. CRP >70 mg/L (or >10 hsCRP) and rising in the last 24 hours, in absence of
                bacterial infection

             5. If any 3 of above presents on admission no need to document rise

      5. Standard treatment: As per Institutional COVID-19 Management Guidelines all patients of
      moderate, severe and critical COVID-19 received standard protocol of aspirin,
      anticoagulation, ulcer prophylaxis, awake Proning (if PaO2 < 80mmHg) and corticosteroids. All
      patients of CRS received Methylprednisolone 1 mg/kg irrespective of disease severity. 6.
      Therapeutic Plasma exchange (TPE) Therapeutic plasma exchange: 1-1.5 plasma exchange daily
      (1-5 sessions) with replacement fluid Fresh frozen Plasma (FFP) (whole volume) to 70 willing
      patients of moderate, severe and critical disease with evidence of CRS after explaining the
      investigational role of this therapy. TPE will be given in addition to standard treatment to
      70 patients randomly. TPE related complications to be documented 7. Recovery Recovery to be
      defined by de-escalation of patients condition from severe to moderate, or from moderate to
      mild, plus at least 2 of the following; serum Ferritin < 1000 ug/ml (and decreasing trend on
      two consecutive days), serum LDH normalization, C-reactive protein > 50% fold reduction (and
      decreasing trend in on two consecutive days),), ALC > 1000 and PT/APTT normalization.
