      program to increase suicide prevention outreach and target Veterans at highest risk for
      suicide. Using a new predictive model, REACH VET, short for Recovery Engagement and
      Coordination for Health - Veterans Enhanced Treatment, analyzes existing data from Veterans'
      health records to identify those who are at a statistically elevated risk for suicide,
      hospitalization, illness, or other adverse outcomes. Once a Veteran is identified, his or her
      VA mental health or primary care provider reaches out to check on the Veteran's well-being
      and review their condition(s) and treatment plans to determine if enhanced care is needed.

      The goal of the proposed study is to evaluate the implementation of REACH VET in
      collaboration with the Partnered Evidence-based Policy Resource Center (PEPReC).

      The objectives of this evaluation are to:

        1. evaluate the implementation of REACH VET using virtual external facilitation, and

        2. collect preliminary data about the cost and cost offsets.

      The proposed evaluation will examine the impact of a virtual external facilitation strategy
      on the implementation of REACH VET in 28 medical facilities across 7 Veteran Integrated
      Service Networks (VISNs) in a stepped wedge design. Primary implementation outcomes include
      reach, adoption, and implementation fidelity. Qualitative interviews will be conducted with
      implementation facilitators, Suicide Prevention Coordinator(s), clinical leadership, and
      providers to identify barriers and facilitators to implementation of REACH VET and the
      experience of facilitation. Secondary data will be collected on the cost of the intervention
      and the cost of implementation strategy.
