      post-operative surgical and medical infective complications. Infective complications affect
      almost 24% of patients. Post-surgical disease recurrence afflicts 35-85% of CD patients in
      the first year after surgery. Immunonutrition has been successfully applied to surgical
      patients in several randomized trials, demonstrating a decreased rate of post-operative
      infective complications. The aim of the study is to compare the incidence of surgical and
      medical post-operative infective complications and six months endoscopic and clinical disease
      recurrence (DR) in CD patients receiving immunonutrition in the peri-operative setting
      compared to patients treated as for standard of care.
