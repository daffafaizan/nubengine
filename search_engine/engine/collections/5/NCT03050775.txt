      surgery. Prior to induction, patients in the control group were given inspiratory gas at
      ambient air temperature (20-22 degrees Celsius) and patients in the treatment group were
      given inspiratory gas at warmed temperatures (40-41 degrees Celsius). All patients were
      induced with general anesthesia in the supine position and repositioned prone following
      endotracheal intubation and placement of an esophageal stethoscope with a temperature sensor,
      as per usual hospital practice. Esophageal temperatures were recorded within 30 minutes of
      the baseline esophageal temperature and every 10 minutes thereafter for the first hour
      post-induction. All patients had a blanket and forced air warming applied to their lower
      extremities and upper back at 43 degrees Celsius after draping. All patients had esophageal
      temperature measurements recorded every 30 minutes until the patient was repositioned supine.
      Core temperatures were recorded four hours post-induction for those patients reaching that
      timeframe.
