surgical treatment of ventricular septal defect .the surgical technique of closure of ventricular septal defects in 80cases (37 cases of isolated defects and 43 cases of tetralogy of fallot)is discussed in the light of the follow-up results . the use of a patchfor closure has reduced the incidence of recurrence to 4 percent, com-pared with 18 percent when direct suture was performed . the incidenceof heart block also decreased from 15 percent, when direct suture wasused, to 4 percent with a patch . the transatrial approach is preferredfor isolated ventricular septal defects,. the ventricular approach ispreferred for cases with tetralogy of fallot . in cases combined withaortic insufficiency only small defects are closed through the aorta .larger defects are closed in the usual way at a first stage operation,and a total valve prosthesis is introduced at a second operation . therewas an operative mortality of 6 percent in isolated ventricular septaldefects, compared with 27 percent in cyanotic patients with tetralogy offallot .
