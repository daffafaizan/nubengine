      Primary

        -  Compare the event-free and overall survival of patients with newly diagnosed localized
           Ewing's sarcoma treated with doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, vincristine,
           etoposide, and ifosfamide with vs without topotecan hydrochloride.

        -  Compare the side effects of these regimens in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate initial tumor size as a prognostic factor for event-free survival of these
           patients.

        -  Evaluate histological response as a prognostic factor for event-free survival of these
           patients.

        -  Continue evaluation of biologic markers both as related to prognosis and as eventual
           therapeutic targets via encouraging concurrent enrollment on COG-AEWS02B1.

        -  Evaluate radiologic response by positron emission tomography as a prognostic factor for
           event-free survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to age (≤
      17 vs ≥ 18 years of age) and primary tumor site (pelvic vs nonpelvic [including extra-osseous
      Ewing's sarcoma]). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive vincristine IV over 1 minute once a week on day 1 in weeks 1-3,
           7-9, and 13-15; doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 2 in weeks 1,
           7, and 13; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on day 1 in weeks 1, 7, and 13; and
           ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 in weeks 4, 10, and
           16. Patients undergo local therapy comprising surgical resection in approximately week
           18 and/or radiotherapy beginning in approximately week 19. Patients then receive
           vincristine as above in weeks 19-21, 28-30, 34-36, 40-42, and 46-51; dexrazoxane
           hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1 and 2 and doxorubicin hydrochloride as above
           in weeks 19 and 28; cyclophosphamide as above in weeks 19, 28, 34, 40, 46, and 49; and
           ifosfamide and etoposide as above in weeks 22, 25, 31, 37, and 43.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive vincristine IV over 1 minute once a week on day 1 in weeks 1-3,
           7-9, and 13-16; topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and
           13; cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 1 and 13 and IV over 1 hour
           on day 1 in weeks 7 and 16; ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1 hour on
           days 1-5 in weeks 4 and 10; and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15 minutes on days 1
           and 2 in weeks 7 and 16. Patients undergo local therapy comprising surgical resection in
           approximately week 18 and/or radiotherapy beginning in approximately week 19. Patients
           then receive vincristine as above in weeks 19-21, 28-33, 37-42, and 46-48; topotecan
           hydrochloride as above in weeks 19, 31, and 40; cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes in
           weeks 19, 31, and 40 and IV over 1 hour in weeks 28, 37, and 46; ifosfamide and
           etoposide as above in weeks 22, 25, 34, 43, and 49; dexrazoxane hydrochloride IV over 15
           minutes on days 1 and 2 in weeks 37 and 46; and doxorubicin hydrochloride as above in
           weeks 28, 37, and 46.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 528 patients will be accrued for this study.
