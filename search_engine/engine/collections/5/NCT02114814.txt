      group and 83 in the attention control group.

      An intervention consisted of eight weekly interactive modules, for a total of 12 hours, and
      based on modules from National Standards for Diabetes Self-Management Education, and the
      National Diabetes Education Program. Data were collected at baseline, immediately
