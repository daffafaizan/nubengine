      the treatment of Wegener's granulomatosis and related vasculitides in patients who have
      contraindications to methotrexate or cyclophosphamide or have experienced disease relapse
      while on these agents. Mycophenolate mofetil is a novel immunosuppressive agent which has
      been approved by the FDA for renal transplantation. It is chemically similar to and has a
      potentially greater efficacy in preventing acute transplant rejection than azathioprine, a
      drug which has been previously used as an alternative treatment for vasculitis. In this
      study, patients who have had disease relapse or contraindications to methotrexate will
      initially receive cyclophosphamide and glucocorticoids and then switch from cyclophosphamide
      to mycophenolate mofetil upon disease remission. If at the end of two years of mycophenolate
      mofetil therapy there is continued evidence of disease remission, the drug will be tapered
      and discontinued. Patients with contraindications to both cyclophosphamide and methotrexate
      will be treated initially with prednisone and mycophenolate mofetil with mycophenolate
      mofetil being continued for two full years after disease remission and then tapered and
      discontinued. For patients who develop intolerance to methotrexate or cyclophosphamide while
      their disease is in remission, mycophenolate mofetil will be started and continued for two
      years after which time it will be tapered and discontinued. Patients will be prospectively
      monitored for evidence of disease activity and drug toxicity. Specific parameters that will
      be obtained include the time to disease remission, the rate and time of disease relapse, and
      the incidence of drug related adverse effects.
