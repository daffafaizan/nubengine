    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Determine the safety of high-dose cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and pegfilgrastim in
           patients with B-cell leukemia or low-grade or mantle cell lymphoma.

        -  Determine the molecular response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive rituximab IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 4, 8,11, 45, and 52,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 15-18, and pegfilgrastim subcutaneously on day 19 or
      20 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 32 patients will be accrued for this study.
