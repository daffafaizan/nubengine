      has been hypothesized that PRF might develop the outcomes obtained with coronally advanced
      flap (CAF)+connective tissue graft(CTG). Therefore, it was aimed to evaluate the
      effectiveness of CAF + CTG + PRF in Miller Class I and II recession defect treatment by
      comparing the outcomes with CAF + CTG in a preliminary, controlled, randomized clinical trial
      (RCT) with a 6-month follow-up. The study was conducted with 40 patients randomly grouped in
      half shares into indicated study groups. After phase I therapy, clinical variables including
      plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), vertical recession (VR), probing depth (PD),
      attachment level (AL), keratinized tissue width (KTW), horizontal recession (HR), MGJ
      localization (L-MGJ), tissue thickness (TT) were recorded. The surgical sites were prepared
      by using sulcular and adjacent vertical incisions and CTGs were harvested from the palatal
      regions. Different from CAF+CTG group, PRF was prepared by obtaining 10 ml venous blood,
      centrifugation and extraction of the gel containing highly concentrated platelet cells in
      CAF+CTG+PRF patients. Then the gel was placed over the exposed root surface in the same
      group. The CAF was primarily closed and postoperative instructions were given. After suture
      removal at second postoperative week, the patients were followed-up by monthly recall visits.
      Same periodontal clinical variables were recorded 3 and 6 months after surgery.
