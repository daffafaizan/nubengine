      [11C]AcAc/[18F]FDG, a proxy for acetoacetate (ketone body)/glucose metabolism in 3 study
      groups; 1) those without identifiable risk of Alzheimer's disease, 2) asymptomatic
      individuals with increased risk of Alzheimer's disease (such as pre diabetes),and 3) those
      with early Alzheimer's disease or MCI. Secondary objectives include determining the
      association between adipose tissue distribution/function and biomarkers of AD pathology.
