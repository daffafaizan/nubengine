      of which 20 eyes were high myopia (AL > 26mm) and 40 eyes were emmetropia (22 < AL < 25mm) as
      control group.High myopia eyes and 20 emmetropia eyes were implanted with the single-piece
      hydrophobic acrylic IOL (Acrysof IQ SN60WF, Alcon laboratories, Inc. IQ group). Another 20
      emmetropia eyes were implanted with the other single-piece hydrophilic acrylic IOL (Akreos
      Adapt, Bausch &Lomb, AO group).80 eyes implanted with the single-piece hydrophobic acrylic
      IOL were examined by SSOCT to build the 3-D model of anterior segment.

      Methods: 60 eyes were examined by custom-built UL-OCT at 4 hours, 1 day, 7 day, 14 day, 28
      day, 3 month, 6 month,12 month after surgery.30 eyes implanted with the single-piece
      hydrophobic acrylic IOL were recruited for evaluation of the SSOCT reliability.50 eyes were
      examined by SSOCT at 1 day, 7 day,1 month, 3 months,6 months,12 months after surgery.

      Measures: Contact of the anterior and posterior lens capsule with the IOL optic surface was
      evaluated. Types of capsular bend were described at the last follow-up. The incidence of
      posterior capsular opacity (PCO) was evaluated.
