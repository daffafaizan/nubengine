    
      This study is a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single- and
      multiple-dose study evaluating safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics, with an open label
      initial food effect and CYP3A drug-drug interaction study, of FTX-6058 in healthy adult
      subjects.

      This study will comprise 4 parts and will be conducted in healthy adult subjects.

      Part A will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose (SAD)
      study in up to 6 cohorts of healthy adult subjects. Part B will be a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in up to 4 cohorts of
      healthy adult subjects dosed once daily for 14 days. Part C will be an open label pilot food
      effect study in healthy adult subjects randomized to take FTX-6058 with and without a
      high-fat meal, and Part D will be an open label study to evaluate the potential of FTX-6058
      to induce CYP3A (using midazolam) in healthy adult subjects.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of FTX-6058 in
      healthy adult subjects as measured by the frequency of adverse events. Secondary endpoints
      include evaluation of the pharmacokinetics of single dose and multiple dose FTX-6058,
      assessing target engagement of FTX-6058, evaluation of the potential effect of food on
      FTX-6058, evaluating the potential for CYP3A induction by FTX-6058 in healthy adult subjects.
