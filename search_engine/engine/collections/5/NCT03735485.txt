    
      Aim of the study was to compare the effectiveness of Proprioceptive Neuromuscular
      Facilitation (PNF) exercises and Shoulder Mobilization (SM) on pain, range of motion (ROM),
      functionality, and muscle strength in patients with Subacromial Impingement Syndrome (SIS).
      Forty-four patients were divided into three groups as Group I: Conventional physiotherapy
      receiving group (control group; n=14), Group II: Conventional physiotherapy + PNF exercises
      receiving group (PNF group; n=15), and Group III: conventional physiotherapy + SM receiving
      group (SM group; n=15). Pain, ROM, muscle strength, and functionality were evaluated by using
      visual analog scale (VAS), goniometer, push-pull dynamometer, Constant-Murley score and The
      Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) Score respectively. Patients received 20
      sessions in total under supervision of a physiotherapist. Patients were evaluated at
      baseline, at week two, at week four, and at week sixteen.
