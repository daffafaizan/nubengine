        -  Human papillomavirus (HPV)+ oropharyngeal cancer is an increasingly common type of
           cancer that frequently affects young patients.

        -  Although the prognosis of early-stage cancer is favorable, the treatments can result in
           significant life-long morbidity.

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy is an active area of investigation. The goal of neoadjuvant therapy
           in this setting is to reduce the risk of disease recurrence and permit the study of de-
           intensified definitive treatment of early-stage disease.

        -  E7 TCR T cells have demonstrated safety and clinical activity in treatment-refractory
           metastatic HPV+ cancers.

      Objectives:

      - To determine the feasibility of intratumoral injection of E7 TCR T cells as neoadjuvant
      therapy for borderline resectable and unresectable stage I HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with borderline resectable or
      unresectable stage I HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer.

      Design:

        -  This is a phase II, single arm, feasibility study of neoadjuvant E7 TCR T cell therapy
           for borderline resectable and unresectable stage I HPV+ oropharyngeal cancer.

        -  Patients will receive intratumoral injection of E7 TCR T cells into the primary tumor
           and involved regional lymph nodes

        -  Patients will not receive a conditioning chemotherapy regimen or systemic aldesleukin

        -  Patients will be referred for definitive standard of care therapy following completion
           of protocol therapy
