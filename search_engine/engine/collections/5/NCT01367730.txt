      subjects will be imaged at Baseline and 12 months. Measures of bone micro-architecture in the
      tibia and radius using peripheral computed tomography, bone strength measures through finite
      element analysis will be obtained at all time points. DXA measures at the spine, femur and
      forearm will be obtained as reference measures. In addition whole body DXA scans will be
      performed for assessment of body composition.
