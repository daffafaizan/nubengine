      Cystourethrogram) procedures in order to rule out vesicourethral reflux. It is difficult to
      know exactly when a child will start voiding, so the child is intermittently imaged by
      fluoroscopy. Fluoroscopy involves radiation, and this we try to diminish as much as possible.
      We suggest application of small urinary sensor in the perineum of the patient, that will
      signal the beginning of urination, and only then fluoroscopy will begin. This urinary sensor
      should cut down substantially radiation dose to the patient.
