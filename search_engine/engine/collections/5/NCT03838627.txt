      identified from SJLIFE participants and contacted for potential participation via phone. If
      the SJLIFE participant expresses interest they will be e-mailed or faxed a copy of the
      consent form; the consent conference will occur via phone and e-mail or facsimile will be
      used to document informed consent. Once the consent signature page is received and the
      participant is enrolled on study, a WHOOP® wrist monitor and directions for wearing the
      device will be mailed to the participant. Feasibility will be assessed by evaluating how many
      participants wear and return the device with enough data for analysis. The investigator will
      consider the project feasible if 30 of 40 participants have 3 hours of usable data after
      removal of noise. Upon arrival at St. Jude for the St Jude LIFE study, the participant will
      undergo in-office measurement of HRV while also wearing the WHOOP® device. A standard
      10-minute electrocardiogram recording will be performed with the participant in a supine
      position, with a regular and calm breathing pattern in a quiet room. The standard deviation
      of normal RR intervals (SDNN, msec) will be derived from SphygmoCor HRV Software. SDNN during
      this 10-minute time period will be derived from WHOOP® HRV software. Agreement between
      measures of SDNN derived by the two techniques will be assessed. A mean discrepancy of <20
      msec for SDNN measured by the two methods will be considered acceptable agreement.
