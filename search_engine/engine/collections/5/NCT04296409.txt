      Deglutition Handicap Index among adult patients with swallowing disorders.The internal
      consistency, test-retest reliability, and criterion validity of the instrument will be
      investigated. The internal consistency will be assessed using Cronbach's alpha. Intraclass
      correlation coefficient (ICC) value with 95 % confidence intervals will be calculated for
      test-retest reliability. The criterion validity of the scale will be determined by assessing
      the correlation between The Turkish Deglutition Handicap Index and Turkish Eating Assessment
      Tool.
