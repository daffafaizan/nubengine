      for those patients enrolled on MCC-14178, by busulfan AUC level.

      All patients will receive daily doses of TAC beginning day -3 (day 0 being the day of
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT)) and will be given until day +60 when tapering will
      begin in the absence of GVHD. Provided no GVHD develops, TAC should be discontinued by day
      +180. Doses will be adjusted to maintain blood levels.

      In addition to TAC, patients will be randomized to one of the following additional anti-GVHD
      medications: MTX or MMF beginning day 0 at least 2 hours after the end of the HCT. In the
      absence of GVHD a tapering schedule will begin on day +240 and be completed on day +360.

      Study participants will be extensively monitored as inpatients and then weekly as
      outpatients. Some tests will be conducted at least twice weekly (blood tests, toxicity data,
      GVHD and physical exams) one-month post-transplant and during the tapering off periods for up
      to 2 years.
