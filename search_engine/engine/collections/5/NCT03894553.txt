      mesencephalotomy in 6 subjects with treatment-refractory pain from head and neck cancer.
      Primary safety assessments will be made throughout the study period of 6 months following the
      procedure. Primary efficacy outcome is determined by comparing the difference in baseline
      NPRS to 3 months post treatment. All subjects receiving treatment will be followed for the
      six month study period.
