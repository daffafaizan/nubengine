      are many surgical and nonsurgical minimal invasive treatment methods. Treatment methods are
      not satisfactory or invasive in some percent of the patients. Superior rectal artery
      embolization(SRAE) for hemorrhoids is an adapted technique derived from Doppler-guided
      hemorrhoidal artery ligation (DGHAL). In this technique, the distal branches of the superior
      rectal artery arising from the inferior mesenteric artery is occluded endovascularly with
      coils. Its feasibility and safety were supported by articles. Collateralization and
      recurrence was seen following coil embolization. To prevent this , tri-acryl gelatin
      microspheres in 500-700 and 700-900 micrometers in size will be used. Safety and efficacy of
      embolization and using different sized particles will be evaluated.
