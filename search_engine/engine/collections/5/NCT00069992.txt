    
      We expect that the patient's participation in this study will last approximately 18 months to
      2 years.

      Before treatment begins, they will be evaluated to confirm they meet the requirements of this
      study. The evaluation includes HIV testing, HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) is the virus
      that causes Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). If the patient is HIV positive, they
      will not be able to be treated on this protocol.

      The patient will need to have a central line. This is a thin plastic catheter or tube that is
      placed during surgery into one of the large veins in the chest or neck. Central lines are
      used to give medications IV (intravenous, by vein) or to take blood samples without having to
      endure frequent needle sticks.

      After admission to the hospital the subject will receive:

      Day -6: a single dose of total body irradiation

      Day -5 to Day -2 Chemotherapy: Fludarabine plus Campath 1H through a catheter inserted into a
      vein (IV)

      Day -2: FK506 given IV over a 24 hour period until the patient can take medication by mouth.
      When they can take oral medication they will take this medication by mouth every 12 hours.

      Day -1 : a day of rest

      Day 0: the stem cell transplant (infusion) will be given

      Day +7: G-CSF will be given by subcutaneous injection until your white blood cells
      (granulocytes) are greater than 1000/ul.

      After transplantation, they will be evaluated as follows. Routine history, physical
      examination, blood tests and radiology studies will be done as needed for clinical care. Bone
      marrow aspirate and biopsy will be done on or about day 30, 60 and 100, 180 and then yearly
      and as needed.
