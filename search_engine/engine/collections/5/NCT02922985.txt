    
      We are proposing a double-blinded, placebo controlled, randomized trial of patients
      undergoing elective cesarean delivery. Participants will be randomized to either a control
      group or study group. This is a double-blinded study, neither participants nor the obstetric
      or anesthesia team are aware of study assignment. The study group, aka multimodal group, will
      receive 1 g of IV acetaminophen (ofirmev) within 30 minutes before starting the surgery,
      regional anesthesia (spinal anesthesia only) with fentanyl, duramorph (morphine) and
      bupivacaine will be performed as per anesthesia team, the anticipated sight of skin incision
      will be infiltrated with 20 mL of bupivacaine 0.25% in the subcutaneous space prior to skin
      incision, and 60 mg of intramuscular (IM) ketorolac (toradol) will be given at the time of
      fascial closure. The control group will receive a placebo drip within 30 minutes before
      starting the surgery, regional anesthesia (spinal anesthesia only) with fentanyl, duramorph
      (morphine) and bupivacaine will be performed as per anesthesia team, the anticipated sight of
      skin incision will be infiltrated with 20 mL of normal saline in the subcutaneous space prior
      to skin incision, and an IM dose of placebo at the time of fascial closure. Post-operatively
      both groups will be managed similarly.

      Inclusion Criteria:

        -  Women who are 18 - 45 years of age at the time of cesarean delivery with the ability to
           give informed consent

        -  Gestational age â‰¥ 34 weeks

        -  Fluent in either English or Spanish

        -  Spinal anesthesia

      Exclusion Criteria:

      Urgent or emergent CD Active labor Epidural or Intrathecal regional anesthesia General
      anesthesia Patients with a contraindication for regional anesthesia Acute or chronic hepatic
      disease Acute or chronic renal disease Active asthma Gastrointestinal ulceration Inflammatory
      bowel disease Allergy to ketorolac, acetaminophen, hydrocodone, codeine, ibuprofen or
      bupivacaine Opioid dependence Non reassuring fetal or maternal status requiring immediate
      delivery Placenta previa or accreta Acute or chronic pain disorder Maternal weight <50
      kilograms Uncontrolled hypertension Ischemic cardiac disease Congestive heart failure
      Thrombocytopenia, platelet count <150,000/microliter Preeclampsia including Hemolysis
      Elevated Liver enzymes Low Platelets syndrome DIC or active hemorrhage before randomization
      Estimated blood loss > 2000 mL

      Primary Outcome: The primary outcome of the study is the total opioid (hydrocodone) use in
      milligrams in the first 48 hours after cesarean delivery.
