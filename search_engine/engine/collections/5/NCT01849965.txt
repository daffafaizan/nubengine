      healing less than 30% will be eligible for randomization providing all other criteria are
      met. Four weeks of "blinded" randomized treatment follows the screening period, and an
      observation period of six weeks follows the treatment period. If the ulcer closes during the
      treatment or observation period, the closure will be confirmed at a visit two weeks later,
      and at this time the subjects enters a durability assessment period of up to 12 weeks.

      All aspects of Standard of Care are followed throughout the study period.
