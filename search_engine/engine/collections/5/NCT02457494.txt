      renal stones episodes (any kind of stones) in HIV1 patients.

      Primary Objective :

        -  Finding the cause of renal stone in HIV patients defined as stone composition if stone
           is available or more probable pathophysiological mechanism

        -  Risk profile for stone recurrences estimated on risk indices in HIV1 patients

      Secondary Objective(s)

        -  Identify prevalence of recurrences and describe co-morbidities associated with stone
           disease

        -  Describe urological management for renal stones in HIV patients

        -  Describe the causes of drug induced renal stones
