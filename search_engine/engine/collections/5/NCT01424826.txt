      intermittently with rifampicin. The co-administration of rifampicin and antiretrovirals
      (ARVs) is both complicated and problematic due to the potent induction of metabolism by
      rifampicin. Rifampicin induces cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, which results in reduced plasma
      concentrations of two groups of ARVs, the protease inhibitors (PIs) and the non-nucleoside
      reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs). This pharmacokinetic interaction precludes the use
      of PIs and severely compromises the effectiveness of the NNRTI, nevirapine, as it potentially
      results in the loss of antiviral activity due to sub-therapeutic concentrations which will
      also lead to antiretroviral resistance.

      Rifampicin also induces phase II enzymes including UDP-glucuronosyl transferase. The HIV
      integrase inhibitor, raltegravir, is primarily metabolised by UGT1A1 and therefore, there is
      the potential for a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with rifampicin. In fact, previous
      studies have shown a decrease in raltegravir AUC, CMAX, and C12 when co-administered with
      daily rifampicin. During directly observed therapy (DOTs) for TB, rifampicin is often given
      intermittently (e.g. 3 times a week). Although several studies have examined the interaction
      between raltegravir and daily rifampicin, currently there are no data regarding the
      pharmacokinetics of raltegravir when rifampicin is co-administered intermittently.
