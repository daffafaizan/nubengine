    
      This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of melphalan and bortezomib followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive melphalan intravenously (IV) continuously on days -5 to -2 and bortezomib IV
      over 3-5 seconds on days -4 and -1. Patients also receive dexamethasone IV on day -1 prior to
      the second dose of bortezomib. Beginning two days after completion of melphalan infusion,
      patients undergo autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. Eligible patients may undergo
      a second transplant 2-4 months after completion of the first transplant.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for at least 1 year and
      then every 3-6 months thereafter.
