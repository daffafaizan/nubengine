      who will undergo the recanalization of the CTO. Before the procedure, myocardial viability,
      ischemia, functional parameters of the collateral donor blood vessels, echocardiography, and
      quality of life will be assessed. After the recanalization, these parameters will be assessed
      again 24h and 6 months after the procedure.
