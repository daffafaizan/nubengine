        2. ICD10: D41.0 - Neoplasm of uncertain or unknown behaviour: Kidney

      Interventions/Observational Groups Arm 1:

        1. Initial diagnostical examination of the renal mass.

        2. If any extended diagnostical examination for treatment planning.

        3. Day -29 to -1: Recruitment.

        4. Day -1: MRI of the kidney, Karnofsky, physical examination, blood chemistry,
           urosonography, if any renal scintigraphy, life quality assessment.

        5. Day 0: Percutaneous diagnostical biopsy with histopathological investigation and
           therapeutically, CT- and/or ultrasound-guided, ECG-synchronized irreversible
           electroporation (IRE) of the kidney tumor in endotracheal anaesthesia und muscle
           relaxation. Use of 1-6 IRE probes with 90-100 pulses of 1500-3000 volts und 20-50
           amperes each.

        6. Day 1-7: Postinterventional follow-up: MRI of the kidneys, Karnofsky, physical
           examination, blood chemistry, urosonography, life quality assessment.

        7. Day 27: Postinterventional follow-up: MRI of the kidneys, Karnofsky, physical
           examination, blood chemistry, urosonography, if any renal scintigraphy, life quality
           assessment.

        8. Day 28: Open surgery partial kidney resection or tumor nephrectomy of the IRE treated
           kidney resp. kidney tumor region with histopathological investigation.

        9. Day 29-37: Postoperative follow-up: physical examination, blood chemistry,
           urosonography, life quality assessment.

       10. Day 112: Study-Follow-up: MRI of the kidneys, Karnofsky, physical examination, blood
           chemistry, urosonography, if any renal scintigraphy, life quality assessment.
           Termination of the study.

       11. Study closed, Individual follow-up due to the European Association of Urology guideline.
