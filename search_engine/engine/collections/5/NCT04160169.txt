      on contraceptive knowledge and uptake during a three month pilot intervention. The
      intervention was conducted September-November 2018 in ten healthcare facilities located in
      the Iringa and Njombe regions of Tanzania. Data collection for the evaluation occurred
      November-December 2018 and included 471 client exit interviews, 26 healthcare provider
      interviews, and the extraction of monthly aggregate service statistics for 12 months prior to
      the intervention and three months of the intervention. Univariate and bivariate analyses were
      used to assess quantitative interview data. Thematic qualitative assessment was used to
      assess qualitative interview data from healthcare providers. Interrupted time series analysis
      was used to assess changes in the trend of monthly contraceptive uptake.
