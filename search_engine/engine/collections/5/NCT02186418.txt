      (CD34+ cells transduced with the gamma-globin lentiviral vector). Gene transfer will occur
      ex-vivo into CD34+ enriched human bone marrow or plerixafor-mobilized peripheral blood
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) collected from subjects with severe sickle cell disease (SCD).
      Subjects will undergo reduced intensity chemotherapy conditioning with single-dose melphalan
      to facilitate engraftment of ex-vivo ARU-1801 via IV infusion. Subjects will return to the
      study site at regular intervals for follow-up for 2 years after the ARU-1801 infusion. It is
      anticipated that a separate long-term follow-up (LTFU) clinical study will be initiated, in
      which all subjects completing the 2 year study visit will be asked to consent and enroll, and
      will followed for a further 13 years.
