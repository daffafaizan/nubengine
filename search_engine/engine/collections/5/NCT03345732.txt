    
      This is a prospective, observational study in patients undergoing head and neck surgery with
      reconstruction. Patients will be identified preoperatively by the participating surgeons.
      Eligible patients will be >18 years of age with head and neck oncologic or traumatic
      reconstructive needs requiring surgical reconstruction of the soft tissues or bony structures
      of the head and neck who consent to use of ICG and the SPY System intraoperatively. Defect
      types to be included in the study are any hypopharyngeal defect (i.e. Total laryngectomy,
      total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy), tracheal defects, oral cavity defects at risk
      for devascularized mucosa, or large skin defects requiring rotation-advancement flaps for
      closure. Donor types to be included are pedicled locoregional muscle flaps including
      pectoralis muscle flaps, cervicofacial skin advancement flaps, infrascapular and
      suprascapular flaps, and any free flap used to reconstruct the defects mentioned previously.
