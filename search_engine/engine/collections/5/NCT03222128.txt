    
      This study design consists of PIIS3i cohort.

      The PIIS3i cohort is a single arm non-randomized, historical-controlled study. Patients
      recruited to the treatment arm will receive an Edwards SAPIEN 3 THV with either transfemoral,
      transapical or transaortic delivery access.

      To assure that patients are of "intermediate" risk, an STS score of 4 - 8% has been selected.
