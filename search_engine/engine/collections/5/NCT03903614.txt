      referred to SBOT for remedial intervention. Among these children, 70% show mixed dominance in
      their hand and/or leg use, and a likely functional and structural interhemispherical
      asymmetry reduction. This would make them right-left symmetrical. Learning, thus, may be
      challenged, because people who are right-left balanced would not have a consistent reference
      point to process the learning materials regularly in any pre-determined directions. They are,
      thus, prone to suffer mirror invariance, fragmentary reversal errors, and handwriting
      difficulty, especially with the fast and accurate construction of asymmetrical letters from
      memory.

      To enhance right-left disparity, dispel mirror invariance, and facilitate the automatized
      handwriting, SML preferentially belabors one's right eye, ear, hand and leg in therapy, that
      would greater engage the left hemisphere for its acclaimed vantages over learning. This study
      investigates, whether SML, wielding such a rightward bias, profits handwriting greater than
      CON.
