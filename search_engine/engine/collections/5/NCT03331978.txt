      treatment education (TE) intervention for African Americans with HIV that targets cultural
      and social issues contributing to health disparities. TE facilitates patient navigation
      through the medical system and provides treatment education and client-centered counseling to
      improve adherence and retention in care. TE targets structural issues in healthcare and
      patients' lives by advocating to providers to improve patient-provider relationships,
      recommending changes in treatment and/or providers, and referring patients to mental health
      and social services.

      A total of 350 Black participants will be recruited through APLA Health and randomly assigned
      to the intervention or usual care control group (175 per group). Adherence will be
      electronically monitored daily (and downloaded bi-monthly) from baseline to 13-months
      post-baseline. Viral load will be assessed through venipuncture at baseline and 6- and
      13-months post-baseline. It is hypothesized that the intervention group will show better
      adherence and have a greater likelihood of suppressed viral load than the control group over
      time.
