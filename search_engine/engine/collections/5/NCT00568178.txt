      phase. Participants who completed or discontinued the initial 12-week phase of the study and
      who opted to participate in the open label extension phase were randomized to either losartan
      or enalapril at a dose of the investigator's choosing for the duration of the extension. The
      open label extension was designed to continue until the 100th participant completed 3 years
      of follow-up.
