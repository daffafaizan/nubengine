      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of imatinib mesylate
           when administered with capecitabine in patients with advanced malignant solid tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the non-dose-limiting toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the clinical activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics and pharmacogenetics of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine, preliminarily, the effect of this regimen on wound angiogenesis in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate pharmacokinetic parameters with clinical toxicity, clinical activity, or
           surrogate biomarker activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of imatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14 and oral imatinib mesylate once
      or twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of imatinib mesylate until the maximum tolerated
      dose is determined.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 42 patients will be accrued for this study.
