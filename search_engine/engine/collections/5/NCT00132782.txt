      Children born with one functional ventricle and who undergo a Fontan procedure, have a higher
      incidence of late complications than other congenital heart patients. While the Fontan
      procedure results in restoring near-normal systemic oxygen saturation, there are recognized
      problems and little information about the overall health status, functional status and
      ventricular performance in these children.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      This cross-sectional observational study included children 6-18 years of age who had
      undergone a Fontan procedure for a congenital cardiac defect. Prospective data collection for
      each patient occured within a 3 month time period and included cardiac MRI, echocardiography,
      serology and exercise testing. Historical clinical and surgical data, as well as parent and
      child self reports of health status, was collected.
