      will be asked to complete a questionnaire battery online (via REDCap) assessing sleep habits,
      daytime sleepiness, family routines, family functioning, and overall quality of life in the
      past six months. The relationship between subjective sleep ratings obtained from the parent
      craniopharyngioma study at St. Jude (RT2CR) at diagnosis and 3 months later (T1 and T2) and
      family functioning/routines at the follow-up study (T3) will be assessed. The researchers
      have permission to use data for all participants who consent to participate in this follow-up
      EMA study.

      Children will be sent electronic surveys two times per day (i.e., morning and evening) for
      seven days using Ilumivu software (https://ilumivu.com/mema-demo). Ilumivu is an established
      EMA tool that offers an in-mobile app for participants to respond to questionnaires in real
      time with limited burden. This application will send notifications to participants to remind
      them to complete surveys and record response times for each survey.
