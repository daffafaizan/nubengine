      communication and behavioral adaptation. In France, Autism Spectrum Disorderaffects about 1
      in 100 people according to international criteria and is diagnosed in early childhood.
      Currently, the diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder is based on a clinical examination that
      is performed classically during the first three years of life. The heterogeneity of the
      disorders occurring in autism make pathologies difficult to diagnose and manage.

      The overall goal of this project is the identification of metabolic biomarkers based on
      clinical profile (based on behavioral and cognitive markers). The best characterization of
      physiopathological pathways (from the molecular scale to the phenotypic scale) will
      ultimately allow the identification of subgroups of subjects and facilitate the development
      of targeted therapeutics.

      The proposed work aims to test the hypothesis of a disruption of tryptophan metabolism in
      Autism Spectrum Disorder via the gut microbiota.
