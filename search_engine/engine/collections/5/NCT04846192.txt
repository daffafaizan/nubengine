      require major hepatic resection associated with biliary reconstruction. These are complex
      procedures with a high morbidity and mortality, mainly due to postoperative hepatic failure
      and sepsis.

      These patients undergo optimization of liver function with portal embolization according to
      the volume of the future remaining liver and preoperative biliary drainage. On top of
      technical challenges of the surgery, the patients usually present a significant alteration of
      the general condition at the time of diagnosis, with denutrition that can be severe. The
      importance of evaluating the preoperative nutritional status in the context of oncological
      surgery is increasingly recognized in the literature. Different nutritional scores exist such
      as the CONUT score, PNI, or the evaluation of sarcopenia on imaging examinations and have
      shown an impact on morbi-mortality in liver surgery.
