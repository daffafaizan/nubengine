      dependent patients (target N=25) who are seeking treatment to reduce their drinking with 2)
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments that probe neural activity related
      to the utilization of copings skills taught in CBCST. The fMRI studies will be performed both
      before and after treatment with CBCST, with the goal of determining 1) the pattern of neural
      activity that is related to coping skills utilization prior to undergoing CBCST, with
      particular focus on neural systems known to play a role in emotion regulation; 2) how CBCST
      changes this pattern of neural activity; and 3) how these changes in neural activity predict
      changes in alcohol use during CBCST.
