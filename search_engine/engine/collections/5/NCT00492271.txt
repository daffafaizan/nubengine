      has created an urgent need for antibacterial agents with no known cross resistance to other
      antibiotics available for humans. Friulimicin B has been shown to be highly active against a
      range of bacteria including such important pathogens such as methicillin resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), drug resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and Glycopeptide
      resistant Enterococcus spp. These organisms are the causative agents in serious infections
      such as skin and soft tissue infections, pneumonia, bacteremia and endocarditis, complicated
      urinary tract infections, and osteomyelitis.

      This study is the first use of Friulimicin B in man and will examine its safety and a
      preliminary study will assess if Friulimicin B in the plasma of subjects has activity against
      bacteria.
