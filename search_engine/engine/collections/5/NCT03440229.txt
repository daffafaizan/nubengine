      on the stool microbiota composition, gene expression, and microbiota localization with
      respect to the epithelium. In addition, the investigators will assess the impact of CMC
      exposure in the diet on markers of metabolic syndrome including response to oral glucose
      tolerance testing and other plasma metabolite measurements.

      Sixteen healthy volunteers will be recruited for a 11-day in-patient study. All participants
      will receive 3 full days of freshly prepared emulsifier-free food to begin the study. This
      will be called the "washout period". Participants will then be randomized into an
      "emulsifier-free" arm and a "CMC" arm in a 1:1 ratio.

      Both arms will continue the same diet except that the "CMC" arm's brownie and sorbet will
      have CMC added to achieve a level of 15 gm per person per day consumption. Serial collection
      of fecal, plasma, urine and mucosal biopsy samples will be performed to investigate the
      extent to which CMC consumption by humans impacts the gut microbiota and its interaction with
      the host parameters related to inflammation and metabolism. Participants will have daily
      urine and stool collections. Sigmoidoscopies and glucose tolerance testing will be completed
      on day 1and 11. Blood samples are collected on days 1-4, 8, 10, and 11.
