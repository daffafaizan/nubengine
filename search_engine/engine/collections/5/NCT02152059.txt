    
      This study is being done to evaluate the effects of BIBF1120 in recurrent, platinum-sensitive
      small cell lung cancer patients.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To investigate the efficacy and safety of a novel VEGFR-2 and FGFR-1 targeting agent,
           BIBF1120, in previously treated, platinum-sensitive small cell lung cancer patients.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To correlate response to the apoptotic biomarkers, Bcl-XL/Bcl-2 and FDGR-1
           amplification.

        -  To correlate response with baseline FLT-PET SUV uptake and change in FLT-PET SUV uptake.

      All eligible patients will be treated with 200 mg bid of BIBF1120 daily and 21 days will be
      considered as one cycle
