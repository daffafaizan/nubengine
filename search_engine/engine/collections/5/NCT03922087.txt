      project jointly initiated by Huizhou First Maternity and Child Healthcare Hospital and School
      of Public Health, Sun Yat-sen University. The project plans to recruit 10,000 participants
      since early pregnancy and follow up for three years after birth in the first stage.
      Biological samples, data from questionnaires survey and clinical information will be
      collected for both mothers and infants. The study is aimed to investigate the effects of
      dietary factors and environmental exposures during pregnancy on infants' health as well as
      the prognosis of diseased mothers. The study will have essentially both clinical and public
      health implications to find effective strategies for prevention and management of a range of
      chronic disorders (above mentioned) during pregnancy and exploration of the possible impacts
      on offspring health. The cohort will provide scientific basic for improvement of mother and
      infant's health.
