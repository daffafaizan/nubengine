        -  Epidemiologic description of patients presenting to the ED with shortness of breath as

        -  Description of current management in the ED of patients presenting to the ED with
           shortness of breath as main complaint.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        -  Sub analysis of ED discharged patients versus admitted patients for characteristics,
           comparison to recommended care and re-ED visit.

        -  Determine clinical and/or biological criteria to distinguish between:

                and ICU)

        -  Prognostic prediction, using clinical and biochemical data

        -  To determine if ED patients treated for acute heart failure differ from those admitted
           to hospital.

        -  Comparison of European data characteristics, investigation, treatment and outcome to
           similar data in other part of the world.
