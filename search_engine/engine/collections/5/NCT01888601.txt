      as a driver of cancer progression and survival outcome. Understanding how tumour clonal
      heterogeneity impacts upon therapeutic outcome, however, is still an area of unmet clinical
      and scientific need. TRACERx (TRAcking non-small cell lung Cancer Evolution through therapy
      [Rx]), a prospective study of patients with primary non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), aims
      to define the evolutionary trajectories of lung cancer in both space and time through
      multiregion and longitudinal tumour sampling and genetic analysis. By following cancers from
      diagnosis to relapse, tracking the evolutionary trajectories of tumours in relation to
      therapeutic interventions, and determining the impact of clonal heterogeneity on clinical
      outcomes, TRACERx may help to identify novel therapeutic targets for NSCLC and may also serve
      as a model applicable to other cancer types.
