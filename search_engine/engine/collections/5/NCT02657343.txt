      investigational intervention and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the
      investigational intervention to use for further studies.

      Ribociclib is a drug that is designed to block certain proteins called Cyclin-Dependent
      Kinases (CDKs) that are required for cells to divide. These proteins may also control the
      ability of certain cancers to grow.

      In this research study, there will be 3 separate cohorts that are looking for the safe and
      tolerated dose of ribociclib that can be given in combination with other HER2 directed
      therapy. One cohort will be looking at the safety of ribociclib in combination with
      trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1). T-DM1 is a standard treatment for patients with HER2-positive
      breast cancer. One Cohort will be looking at the safety of ribociclib in combination with
      trastuzumab (Herceptin), which is a standard treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast
      cancer. The last cohort will be looking at the safety of ribociclib in combination with
      trastuzumab (Herceptin) and fulvestrant (Faslodex) for ER-positive and HER2-positive breast
      cancer. These are both standard treatments for this type of breast cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved Ribociclib as a treatment
      for any disease.
