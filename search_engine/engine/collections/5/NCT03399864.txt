      and cognitive functioning. For instance, to reduce depression, anxiety in psychiatric
      patients, to improve self-esteem and mood recognition in hospitalized adolescent patients
      diagnosed with "adjustment reaction to adolescence", to improve social skills of children
      with autism, to enhance reading skills and academic achievement in young poor readers, and to
      facilitate children's cognitive development. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of musical
      training in promoting psychological well-being, particularly to reduce their depressive
      symptoms and enhance self-esteem, and enhancing quality of life among the childhood brain
      tumour survivors is remain underexplored. It is of paramount importance to examine the
      effectiveness of musical training so as to ameliorate adverse disease- and treatment-related
      late effects, such as depression and low self-esteem, hence enhancing childhood brain tumour
      survivors' quality of life.
