      (MDR) as the absence of disease progression or toxicity, patients will complete nine 28-day
      cycles of MDR therapy, with the option of continuing treatment with lenalidomide as
      single-agent. Patients received up to nine cycles of treatment, with the option to continue
      on lenalidomide as a single agent if they responded to treatment.
