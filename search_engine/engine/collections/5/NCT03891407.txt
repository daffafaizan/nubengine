      focusing on networks of heterosexual men. The reasons for focusing on heterosexual men is
      because heterosexual contact is the primary mode of HIV transmission in Tanzania and data
      from our previous trial indicate that 97% of the male camp members are heterosexual. Moreover
      it will be the first intervention to engage male peer leaders to promote HIV self-testing in
      their social networks in Tanzania. We will build on previous work our research team has
      conducted to identify 'camps' or local venues where young men socialize with elected leaders
      and members pay membership dues. Our previous intervention has proven successful to recruit
      and train leaders from camps to serve as community health leaders in their respective camps,
      with the goal of changing social norms related to HIV and gender-based violence. A novel
      approach to the proposed research is that we will leverage the work we have conducted within
      camps with social networks of men to test the acceptability and feasibility of oral
      fluid-based HIV self-testing and confirmatory blood-based HIV testing within existing
      networks of men that we know we can access through stable social venues. We will recruit male
      camp leaders to train them about HIV self-testing and instruct them to return to their camps
      and engage their male peers by informing them about HIV self-testing for prior to our
      research team offering participants the opportunity to self-test.
