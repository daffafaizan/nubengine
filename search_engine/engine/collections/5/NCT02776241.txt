      ml/kg) for 1 hour. Before intervention and after intervention patients will have an MRI scan
      of the kidneys to measure the total kidney volume (TKV) (differentiated in cortex, medulla
      and cyst volume). The objective is to identify whether water restriction or high water load
      will change the TKV. Secondly investigators will analyze different biomarkers (aldosterone,
      renin, vasopressin/copeptin, urine- and blood-osmolarity) before and after the intervention.
