      as aortic aneurysm repair, carotid endarterectomy, lower limb surgical re-vascularisation and
      major lower limb amputation for end-stage vascular disease constitute a high-risk surgical
      cohort. Peri-operative complications such as myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident,
      renal failure and death are common [2,3]. Multiple potential mechanisms may result in these
      complications. For example, myocardial injury may result from systemic hypotension leading to
      reduced flow across a tight coronary artery stenosis or, alternatively, it may arise due to
      acute occlusion when an unstable plaque ruptures. Most strategies aimed at peri-operative
      risk reduction target a single potential mechanism. For example, beta-blockade may prevent
      myocardial injury due to overwork, but cannot prevent acute coronary occlusion. There is a
      requirement for a simple, effective intervention that protects tissues against injury via
      multiple different mechanisms. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) may be suitable.

      Ischemic preconditioning is a phenomenon whereby a brief period of non-lethal ischemia in a
      tissue renders it resistant to the effects of a subsequent much longer ischaemic insult. It
      was first described in the canine heart [4]. Subsequent clinical trials showed that ischemic
      preconditioning reduced heart muscle damage following coronary artery bypass grafting [5] and
      liver dysfunction following hepatic resection [6]. Following cardiac surgery, it is
      associated with a reduction in critical care stay, arrhythmias and inotrope use [7]. However,
      ischemic preconditioning requires direct interference with the target tissues' blood supply,
      limiting its clinical utility. Further experimental work suggested that brief ischemia in one
      tissue, such as the kidneys, could confer protection on distant organs such as the heart [8].
      A similar effect was observed after transient skeletal muscle ischemia [9-11]. This effect is
      referred to as 'preconditioning at a distance' or 'remote ischemic preconditioning' (RIPC).
