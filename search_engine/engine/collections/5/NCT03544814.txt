      mutations gradually progressed after initial EGFR tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment,
      continuing TKI therapy may be beneficial. We aimed to compare the efficacy of simultaneous
      EGFR-TKI and chemotherapy with that of sequential treatment after patients gradually
      progressed from first-line EGFR-TKI treatment.

      Patients who had gradual progression and EGFR-T790M mutation-negative were randomly divided
      into two groups: in concurrent group, patients were treated with pemetrexed plus cisplatin
      along with the same EGFR-TKI; in sequential group, patients continued with EGFR-TKI until the
      disease progressed again according to the RECIST criteria, and then switched to chemotherapy.
      We evaluated progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) time of patients. For
      sequential group, PFS was PFS1 (gradual progression to discontinue EGFR-TKI) plus PFS2
      (chemotherapy alone). Objective response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR), overall
      survival (OS), and safety were also evaluated.
