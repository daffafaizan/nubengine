      medications. A common treatment is the conventional transscleral cyclophotocoagulaion, but it
      has various side effects. This study specifically aims to compare the intraocular pressure
      (IOP) lowering effects and the incidence of complications such as hypotony, phthisis,
      sympathetic ophthalmia, surface conjunctival burns, bulbar conjunctival swelling,
      decompensation of corneal grafts, hyphema and vitreous hemorrhage, in conventional and the
      newer micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation.The hypothesis is that the micropulse
      transscleral cyclophotocoagulation will be as good or better than the conventional
      transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, with less complications.
