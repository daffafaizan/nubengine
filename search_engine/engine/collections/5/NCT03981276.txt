      Study (NHS) in HSPs and related disorders. Participants will be seen annually. At study
      visits a standardized clinical examination will be performed including application of
      clinical rating scales (selection of rating scales may vary depending on the individual
      phenotype and specific genotype); data will be entered into a clinical database (HSP
      Registry; https://www.hsp-registry.net). At all study visits, patients will be asked to
      donate biosamples; biomaterial collection is optional and participants can elect to
      participate in sampling of blood, urine, CSF, and/or a skin biopsy.

      Optionally, additional examinations may be performed including imaging, quantitative movement
      analysis, neuropsychological examinations, analysis of patient or observer reported outcomes
      and OMICS analysis to characterize molecular biomarkers.

      In participants without a genetic diagnosis, next generation sequencing may be performed.
