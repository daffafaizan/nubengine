      Participants will be tracked using metrics of A1c, time in glucose target range, number of
      days using CGM, blood glucose (BG) downloads, diabetes problem solving, diabetes distress,
      and technology attitudes. The investigators will examine whether ONBOARD leads to improved
      diabetes and psychosocial outcomes and sustained CGM use. At the end of this study, the
      investigators will have created and refined a comprehensive, multicomponent intervention
      package to promote increased and sustained uptake of CGM and increase readiness for closed
      loop adoption.
