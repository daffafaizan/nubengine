      patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate cancer. II. Describe the toxic effects
      of this treatment in this patient population. III. Determine the effect of treatment on pain,
      asthenia, and quality of life. IV. Determine the objective response rate after treatment
      among the patients with bidimensionally measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive estramustine orally twice a day on days 1-3 of each week for 6
      weeks. Patients also receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on day 2 of each week for 6 weeks.
      Courses repeat every 8 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression.
      Quality of life is assessed prior to treatment and at weeks 4, 8, 20, and 24. Patients are
      followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for years 2-5, and then annually
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 17-52 patients accrued into this study over 14 months.
