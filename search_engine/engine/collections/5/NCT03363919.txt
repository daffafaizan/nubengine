    
      Phase I is a double-blind, randomized, biomarker-stratified trial of 1 Hz vs. 10 Hz rTMS.
      Phase II is for participants who do not respond to Phase I treatment and is a biomarker
      guided, double-blind trial of continuous vs intermittent theta burst stimulation (TBS).
      Please note that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) biomarkers will be collected in this
      protocol during the course of the proposed interventions. Participants in Phase I will be
      offered enrollment in a separate protocol with baseline and posttreatment 7 Tesla Magnetic
      Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) scans
