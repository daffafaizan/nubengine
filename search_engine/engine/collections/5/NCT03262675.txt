      out in Tunisia at cardiology departments in hospitals and in liberal cardiology
      consultations. 100 cardiologists participate in the enrollment of the eligible patients as
      investigators. A Committee of Experts validates the protocol methodology and supervises the
      data-management. A Steering Committee helps investigators to monitor their patient
      inclusions, performs audit trails and prepares the statistical analysis plan for the study.

      Collected data are managed by the DACIMA Clinical SuiteÂ®, the electronic data capture
      platform which complies with the FDA 21 CFR part 11 requirements (Food and Drug
      Administration 21 Code of Federal Regulations part 11), the HIPAA specifications (Health
      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act), and the ICH standards (International
      Conference on Harmonisation).
