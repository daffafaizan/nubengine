      stress response and associated physiologic changes related to surgery. Over the past 20
      years, ERAS programs have been found to result in reduced lenght of stay and complications in
      adult patients. Data in pediatric population remains very scarce.Therefore this study was
      designed to compare the outcomes after scoliosis surgery before and after ERAS (enhanced
      recovery after surgery) program inplementation in children and teenager.
