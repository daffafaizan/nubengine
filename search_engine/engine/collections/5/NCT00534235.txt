    
      The primary objective of this post-approval study is to examine the long-term survivorship of
      the coflex®. The coflex® Interlaminar Technology is an interlaminar stabilization device
      indicated for use in one or two level lumbar stenosis from L1-L5 in skeletally mature
      patients with at least moderate impairment in function, who experience relief in flexion from
      their symptoms of leg/buttocks/groin pain, with or without back pain, and who have undergone
      at least 6 months of non-operative treatment. The coflex® is intended to be implanted midline
      between adjacent lamina of 1 or 2 contiguous lumbar motion segments. Interlaminar
      stabilization is performed after decompression of stenosis at the affected level(s).
