    
      This is a fixed-sequence, drug-drug interaction study of tucatinib conducted in 5 parts in
      healthy subjects. Part A will evaluate the effect of the strong CYP3A4 inhibitor itraconazole
      on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of tucatinib. Part B will evaluate the effect of rifampin, a
      strong inducer of CYP3A4 and CYP2C8, on the PK of tucatinib. Part C will evaluate the effect
      of the strong CYP2C8 inhibitor gemfibrozil on the PK of tucatinib. Part D will evaluate the
      effects of tucatinib on the PK of substrate probes of the metabolizing enzymes CYP2C8
      (repaglinide), CYP2C9 (tolbutamide), and CYP3A4 (midazolam). Part E will evaluate the effect
      of tucatinib on the PK of a substrate probe of the transporter P-gp (digoxin). Parts A, B, C,
      D, and E of the study are independent of one another and do not need to be conducted in a
      particular order.
