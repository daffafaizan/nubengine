      seriously deficient among clinicians and the surrogate decision makers for critically ill
      patients. To address this problem, we propose a randomized, controlled trial to determine if
      an innovative web-based decision aid compared to usual care control can improve the quality
      of decision making (defined as clinician-surrogate concordance for prognosis, quality of
      communication, and medical comprehension), reduce surrogates' psychological distress
      (depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress syndrome disorder (PTSD) symptoms), and
      reduce patients' health care costs over 6-month follow up. We will enroll 410 surrogate
      decision makers for 273 patients (expected average of 1.5 surrogates per patient). This study
      has the potential both to improve how clinicians and surrogates interact in intensive care
      units and to increase the likelihood that life support decisions are aligned with patients'
      values.
