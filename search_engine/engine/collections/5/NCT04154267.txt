      Clinics of Porto Alegre. In addition to the routine evaluation commonly carried-out at this
      post-transplant period, protocol biopsies will be performed at the 10th-week
      post-transplantation in high-risk transplant recipients. Biopsy fragments will be evaluated
      for tissue immune aggression (mainly cellular and antibody-mediated rejections) and other
      conditions such as infections, particularly polyomavirus and cytomegalovirus and medication
      toxicities. The presence of donor-specific antibodies and graft-damaging infectious agents
      will also be searched in the peripheral blood at the time of biopsy.One hundred patients will
      be randomized to a protocol biopsy and noninvasive assessment or only for noninvasive
      assessment. The hypothesis of the study is that biopsies will lead to treatments that may
      allow better outcomes of renal transplants, related to lowering the progression of
      subclinical aggressions, avoiding or delaying graft loss and preserving or decreasing the
      rate of loss of the glomerular filtration rate. Therefore, this strategy has the possibility
      of reaching clinical practice routine and thus contribute positively to the management of
      renal transplant patients.
