    
      This trial is a prospective, multicenter, open-label, non-controlled trial in postmenarcheal
      and premenopausal female subjects, including adolescents, between the ages of 15 and 45 who
      present to the clinic seeking contraception.

      At screening, informed consent will be obtained and the screening procedures will be
      performed. After confirmation of the subject's eligibility, the subject will be provided with
      the investigational product and trained in the use of an electronic diary. Afterwards, the
      subjects will attend visit the clinical site on Day 20±2 of the 1st, 3rd, 6th and 9th cycles
      and on Day 29+2 of the 13th cycle. The last clinical site visit will occur 10-14 days after
      the 13th cycle visit.

      The trial will include women who have never used hormonal contraceptives before consent
      (naïve users), women who have used hormonal contraceptives in the past but have had a
      contraceptive-free period before consent and a full menstrual cycle during the drug-free
      period (previous users) as well as women directly switching from another hormonal method
      (switchers).

      Adverse events and safety information will be collected throughout the study.
