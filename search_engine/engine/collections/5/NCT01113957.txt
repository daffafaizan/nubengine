    
      Safety assessments and tolerability will be assessed through electrocardiograms (ECG).
      clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, Adverse Event assessments, and physical exams.
      Baseline radiographic tumor assessments, including CT scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis
      will be obtained. Radiologic assessments and CA-125 measurements will also be performed every
      8 weeks during dosing and following completion of dosing until disease progression. Study
      visits will be conducted weekly for the first 2 cycles and on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle,
      at the Final Visit and 30 day Follow-up Visit. Study visits will include physical
      examination, complete blood count (CBC) and chemistries. A urinalysis tests will be performed
      at Screening and Final Visit. An ECG will be performed at Screening, Cycle 1 Day 1 and at the
      Final Study Visit. A left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) will be measured by
      Echocardiogram or Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan on all subjects at Screening.
      Subjects randomized to the PLD arm will have an echocardiogram or MUGA performed at the Final
      Study Visit and at the discretion of the Investigator throughout the study. Adverse events
      will be assessed at every visit.
