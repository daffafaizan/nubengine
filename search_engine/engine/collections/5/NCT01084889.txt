      performed to obtain post-marketing information on the TiLOOP® pelvic floor reconstruction
      meshes and in particular on the rate of rare erosions of the device under investigation as
      well as on the improvement of patients' quality of life. It is expected that the rate of
      erosions is equal or lower compared to competitor devices currently on the market. To verify
      this, it will be shown that within the first year the erosion rate found for the product
      under investigation is in the range of 7.9 ± 5.4 %, which is the mean erosion rate found in
      the recent literature. Erosion, in the sense of the hypothesis, is any erosion 1 requiring
      more than simply the cut off of a single short filament.

      It is also expected that the patient's quality of life is meliorated after implantation of a
      TiLOOP® Total 6 mesh. To verify this, it will be shown that by means of a validated
      questionnaire the subjective quality of life after 6 months is significantly better than
      before implantation.
