      be effective in chronic hepatitis B [Davis et al. 1989; Bisceclie et al, 1989]. Interferon
      alfa is also one of the approved treatments for chronic hepatitis B. Administration of IFN
      alfa-2b to adults leads to disappearance of HBV DNA with or without HBeAg seroconversion in
      30-50% of patients, which is two to three times above the rate of yearly spontaneous HBeAg
      seroconversion (10-15%). Normalization of serum ALT occurs in most cases. Loss of HBsAg is
      observed in 10-15% of Caucasian patients during the prolonged post-treatment follow-up
      period. Recently, studies suggested that a higher proportion of patients receiving pegylated
      IFN could achieve HBeAg seroconversion and control of HBV replication [Marcellin et al, 2004;
      Lau et al, 2004; Jensen et al, 2004].

      RBV is another antiviral nucleotide analogue with few adverse effects [Sidwell et al, 1972;
      Patterson et al, 1990]. RBV alone can modestly inhibit HDV or HBV replication [Choi et al,
      1989]. The beneficial effect of combined IFN plus RBV in the treatment of chronic hepatitis B
      has also been shown in previous studies [Cotonat et al, 2000]. Why RBV can greatly enhance
      the treatment efficacy is not clear. It had been shown that ribavirin could inhibit
      interleukin-4, an inhibitor of cytotoxic T lymphocyte activity, and preserves the
      interleukin-2 and gamma IFN activities. Other studies revealed that the enhanced efficacy was
      associated with HBV- or other virus-specific type 1 cytokine-mediated T helper cell responses
      [Cramp et al, 2000; Tam et al, 1999; Hultgren et al, 1998; Fang et al, 2002; Fang et al,
      2000; Rico et al, 2001]. Thus, the combination therapy may augment virus-specific cytotoxic T
      lymphocytes and non-specific immune response, and effectively shift the immune responses to
      the more potent antiviral type 1 T-helper profile [Hultgren et al, 1998].

      HDV, like HCV, is a RNA virus. Indeed, RBV had also been shown to be active against HDV
      replication in cell cultures [Choi et al, 1989]. The investigators therefore hypothesize that
      pegylated IFN alfa-2b in combination with RBV can yield an efficacy in chronic hepatitis D
      patients who are dually infected by HBV. The purpose of this protocol is to test this
      hypothesis. A previous study found that high-dose IFN may improve the efficacy for chronic
      hepatitis D patients. Another pilot study using IFN alfa plus RBV also demonstrated that the
      seroclearance of HCV RNA was not affected by HBV coinfection [Liu et al, 2003]. The
      investigators thus use pegylated IFN alfa-2b in combination with RBV for the treatment of
      patients with dual chronic HDV and HBV infection.

      The treatment choice for chronic hepatitis D was not clarified till now. In this proposal,
      the dosage and duration for the combination regimen are decided mainly by the experience from
      the treatment of chronic hepatitis B and chronic hepatitis C.

      The investigators recent study using ribavirin and interferon (IFN) combination therapy for
      dual chronic hepatitis B and C suggested that combining ribavirin 1,200 mg daily for 6
      months, together with 6 million units (MU) IFN-alpha 2a thrice weekly for 12 weeks and then 3
      MU for another 12 weeks was effective for the clearance of HCV RNA [Liu et al, 2003].
      Twenty-four patients with chronic hepatitis seropositive for both hepatitis B surface antigen
      and antibody to HCV received ribavirin 1,200 mg daily for 6 months, together with 6 million
      units (MU) IFN-alpha 2a thrice weekly for 12 weeks and then 3 MU for another 12 weeks. The
      serum HCV clearance rate was 43% 24 weeks posttreatment. The serum ALT normalization rate was
      43% 24 weeks posttreatment. In hepatitis B and C dually infected patients, combination IFN
      with ribavirin can achieve a sustained HCV clearance rate comparable with hepatitis C alone.
      Furthermore, a previous study revealed that a 12-week RBV therapy was not effective for
      patients with chronic hepatitis B [Kakumu et al, 1993]. Therefore, a 24-week course of
      combination therapy pegylated IFN+RBV will be used.

      Increased RBV dosage has been considered a contributory factor to the better efficacy in
      treating refractory genotype HCV. For example, recent studies suggested that using RBV 800 mg
      daily is adequate to treat HCV genotype non-1 while the standard dosage of RBV is required to
      treat HCV genotype 1 [NIH 2002]. The investigators thus propose to use RBV 1000-1200 mg daily
      according to the body weight of the patient.
