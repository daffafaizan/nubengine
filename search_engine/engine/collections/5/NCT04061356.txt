      within both ILD and lung cancer. Current tools for assessing inflammation and oxidative
      stress, such as fibre-optic bronchoscopy with bronchial wall biopsy and bronchial fluid
      lavage, are invasive procedures not suitable for regular repeat sampling. Sample analysis
      requires a series of laboratory measurements and results can take over 24 hours to become
      available.

      In contrast, measurement of Exhaled Breath Condensate Hydrogen Peroxide (EBC H2O2) is
      performed during normal tidal breathing, and is well tolerated even in patients with severe
      airways obstruction and those unable to perform a consistent controlled exhalation. It is
      also not limited to inflammatory cell specific inflammation.

      To date, the measurement of EBC H2O2 has been used as a research tool only, due to the
      complex multiple procedural steps required to deliver a result from the collected exhaled
      breath. Exhalation Technology Ltd. have now developed a novel, handheld device
      (Inflammacheck™) which can produce an immediate measurement of EBC H2O2 levels at the
      patient's side. By detecting EBC H2O2 levels immediately, Inflammacheck™ could tell
      clinicians and patients the current level of global airway inflammation in a simple, effort
      independent manner. This could be used by clinicians to diagnose ILD and even Lung Cancer.

      The 'Inflammacheck™' device now requires a study in a clinical setting to determine whether
      it can detect ILD and Lung Cancer. The acceptability and ease of use of the device also needs
      to be assessed for both patients and clinicians.
