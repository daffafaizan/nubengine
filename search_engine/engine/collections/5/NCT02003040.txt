      high despite different attempts to decrease them . Clinical indicators of volume congestion
      at time of discharge are associated with increased rates of readmission . Clinical evaluation
      of volume status remains the gold standard in determination of readiness and timing of
      hospital discharge, however identification of persistent congestion might prove difficult .

      Assessment of the right atrial pressure can be done non-invasively at the bedside; however,
      precision and accuracy of this method are variable . Echocardiography is a valuable tool in
      the estimation of elevated central pressure , this, however is time consuming and requires
      trained personnel. While invasive measurements provide accurate estimation of central venous
      pressure, it is an impractical approach in most patients, notwithstanding the risks
      associated with the insertion of a catheter into the central circulation .

      Since a significant proportion of readmitted patients return to hospital with congestive
      symptoms, attempts have been made to improve our ability to assess volume status . Current
      clinical evidence suggests that BNP-guided management of patients with congestive heart
      failure can decrease all-cause mortality and heart failure rehospitalization. However,
      biological variation for natriuretic peptides is high , and optimal targets are difficult to
      determine in individual patients.

      The Mespere Venus 1000 system is a non-invasive tool that has previously shown reliable
      correlation and accuracy with central venous pressure obtained invasively in the
      catheterization laboratory and good correlation with jugular venous pressure at the bedside.
