phospholipids of the sexual segment of the kidney of theindian house lizard, hemidactylusflaviviridis ruppellthe indian house lizard, hemidactylus flaviviridis breeds seas-onally.  in a sexually mature male lizard, from october tomay of the following year, the secondary and tertiary collectingtubules of the kidney are hypertrophied forming the sexual seg-ment.  the development of the sexual segment is synchronous withthe testicular cycle and maximum development occurs during theperiod when the testes are spermatogenically active.  the sex-ual segment is not developed in the females in any season of theyear; it is completely regressed in males during sexual quiescence(june and july).  injection of 4.0 mg of testosterone propionateover two weeks stimulated the regressed sexual segment to hyper-trophy in males during quiescence and also in females.  theapical portions of the cells of the sexual segment are loadedwith granular secretions which are stained with baker's acid hae-matein and phosphomolybdic acid-stannous chloride, indicating thepresence of choline - containing phospholipids.  the composi-tion of the phospholipids of the sexual segment, which is a uniquefeature of the lizards and snakes, is unknown.  this preliminarycommunication describes the isolation and quantitative estimationof phospholipids present in the sexual segment of the indian houselizard, hemidactylus flaviviridis ruppell.
