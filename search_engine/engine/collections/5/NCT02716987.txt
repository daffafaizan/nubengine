      potent inhibitor of DAO, a peroxisomal enzyme active towards neutral D-amino acids which
      potentially effects cerebellar dysfunction. This study will look at the relationship between
      TAK-831 plasma exposure and the extent and duration of brain DAO enzyme occupancy after
      single oral dosing of TAK-831 in healthy male participants using [18F]PGM299 radioactive
      tracer injection and PET imaging.

      The study will enroll up to 22 participants in two different sets. Up to 16 participants will
      be enrolled in Set A. Within that total, up to 5 dose levels of TAK-831 may be evaluated,
      with up to 6 participants per dose level, although typically, there will be 2 to 3
      participants per dose level. All participants in Set A will also receive up to 3 doses of
      [18F]PGM299. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled in Set B. All participants in Set B will
      be assigned to single treatment group to receive 2 doses of [18F]PGM299.

      All participants in Set A will be asked to take single oral dose of TAK-831 suspension on Day
      1. In Set A, each of the participant will receive a maximum of 3 PET scans with [18F]PGM299;
      1 at baseline 2 following a single oral dose of TAK-831 on Days 1 and 2. In Set B, each of
      the participant will receive 2 PET scans with [18F]PGM299 on Days 1 and 10. Set B will be
      conducted after the confirmation of blockade of [18F]PGM299 binding by TAK-831 in 2 to 4
      participants of Set A.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 62 days. Participants in Set A will make 4 visits to the clinic,
      and participants in Set B will make 3 visits to the clinic and all will be contacted by
      telephone on Day 15 (Set A) and Day 12 (Set B) of treatment period for a follow-up
      assessment.
