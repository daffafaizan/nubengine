alveolar lining cells and pulmonary reticuloendothelial system of therabbit .complete freund's adjuvant was injected intravenously into rabbits andthe cellular response in the lungs was investigated . the population ofcells within the alveolar spaces was contributed to by monocytes of thecirculation, mesenchymal cells of the alveolar walls and epitheliallining cells of the alveoli . the abnormal epithelial lining during theproliferative phase was the result of an increase in size and number ofthe cells that line the normal alveoli . as healing progressed, astructurally normal alveolar lining was found .
