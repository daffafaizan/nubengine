      histological response, in patients with oral premalignant lesions. II. Evaluate the safety of
      chronic multiple dosing of celecoxib in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to premalignant risk (early vs advanced). Patients in each stratum
      are randomized to 1 of 3 treatments arms. Arm I: Patients receive lower-dose oral celecoxib
      twice daily. Arm II: Patients receive higher-dose oral celecoxib twice daily. Arm III:
      Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. Treatment continues in all 3 arms for 12 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 18, 24,
      and 26 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 84 patients (42 per stratum, 14 per arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 6 months.
