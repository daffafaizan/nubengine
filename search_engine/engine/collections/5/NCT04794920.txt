    
      At the Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group (GHPSJ), a multidisciplinary working group was early
      involved in psychological support for staff.

      This group proposed the establishment of on-call duty entrusted to a psychological support
      unit, made up of a doctor, a nurse and a psychologist who volunteered to carry out patrols in
      the various departments of the hospital. These visits, sometimes organized at the request of
      the management of the services and sometimes improvised, aimed to identify the difficulties
      encountered in the field, and to discuss with the teams.

      Concomitantly and complementary, the staff bubble opened at the Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital
      on March 27, to offer a decompression space to all staff (caregivers or not) with proposals
      for hypnosis, physiotherapy, sophrology sessions. , psychotherapy, but also informal
      discussions or a break in a relaxing armchair.

      As a continuation of this approach, the multidisciplinary working group plans to search in
      July 2020 for symptoms present in certain mental illnesses (anxiety, depression,
      post-traumatic stress syndrome) in all the staff of the Paris Saint-Joseph Hospital Group. ,
      now that the crisis seems to be receding. This will make it possible to adapt the support
      offer for staff in the coming months. This inventory will be made on the basis of validated
      questionnaires: the Posttraumatic stress disorder CheckList-5 (PCL) questionnaire for
      post-traumatic stress and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) score for mental
      disorders (anxiety, depression) . A 3rd questionnaire will collect additional data and
      provide feedback on the frequentation of the bubble
