      similar to the screening done for islet transplantation including: history; physical; chest X
      rays; upper GI series if history of ulcer; abdominal and pelvic ultrasound with careful
      attention to liver parenchyma and gallbladder; EKG; stress echocardiography if older than 35,
      psychological evaluation; autonomic and sensorimotor evaluation. They will also have a
      tuberculosis skin test (PPD), and pre-transplant laboratory tests, including: serology (for
      hepatitis B and C, HTLV I and II, Herpesvirus 1 and 2, CMV, EBV, Parvovirus B19, RPR and
      HIV); first morning urine (albumin, protein and creatinine), GFR; urinalysis and urine
      culture; CBC, chemistry, PT, PTT, INR, C-peptide (basal and stimulated), HbA1c, , lipid
      profile, LFTs, thyroid profile, blood typing, PRA, MHC determination, auto-antibodies (GAD65,
      IA2 and insulin), and if male, prostate specific antigen (PSA). Severity of glucose lability
      and hypoglycemia unawareness is assessed with Clarke score, Lability index, Mage and
      hypoglycemia score.
