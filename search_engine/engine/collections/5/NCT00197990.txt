      satisfaction with total hip arthroplasty three to five years after surgery. Predictors that
      will be considered are variables that were obtained prospectively and systematically at the
      time of surgery, including demographic characteristics, functional status, expectations,
      perioperative complications, and comorbidity. At the follow-up functional status and patient
      satisfaction will be measured, as well as fulfillment of expectations and predispositional
      factors.
