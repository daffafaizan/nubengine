             -  Incidence and seriousness of all adverse events.

             -  Incidence of device or procedure-related adverse events.

        2. Secondary Endpoints:

             -  Evaluation of the separate and combined functions of the IVC filter and the central
                venous catheter device.

             -  Evaluate investigative site's ability to comprehend the procedural steps (Per the
                Insertion Procedure, the Repositioning Procedure, and the Removal Procedure)

             -  Evaluate operator challenges with device use (human factors).

             -  Evaluate success and challenges encountered in conducting a pivotal trial in
                critically ill patient population - including but not limited to Informed Consent
                and enrollment.

      ENROLLMENT AND SUBJECT SAMPLE SIZE

      The study is expected to enroll up to 20 subjects in up to 4 US investigational sites with a
      goal for 10 evaluable subjects in whom Angel® Catheter placement has been attempted.

      STUDY DURATION

      The device is designed to be deployed for less than 30 days. After enrollment and Angel®
      Catheter placement, subjects will be followed daily through the post-removal, seven (7) day
      follow up or until hospital discharge, whichever occurs first.
