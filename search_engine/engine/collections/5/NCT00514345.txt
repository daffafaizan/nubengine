    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the CYP3A5 genotype in young patients with cancer who have received
           ifosfamide.

        -  To document renal function and nephrotoxicity on one occasion between 1 month and 5
           years after completion of ifosfamide treatment.

        -  To determine the relationship between CYP3A5 genotype and ifosfamide nephrotoxicity.

      Secondary

        -  To compare the measured glomerular filtration rate (GFR) (using a radioisotope clearance
           method) with that calculated using the Cole (weight and creatinine) model.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Nephrotoxicity assessment is performed in patients who have not undergone prior assessment*.

      NOTE: *Nephrotoxicity assessment is performed once between 1 month and 5 years after
      completion of ifosfamide chemotherapy.

      All patients will undergo a single blood sample collection. DNA will be extracted from this
      sample and genotyped for the known functional polymorphisms in CYP3A5. The technique of
      restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) will be used to detect any single nucleotide
      polymorphisms in CYP3A5.

      DNA may be obtained from stored tumor samples from patients for whom the results of renal
      investigations are available, but for whom blood is not available for CYP3A5 genotyping.
