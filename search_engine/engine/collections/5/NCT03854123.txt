    
      75 to 77 years old MS patients whose disease began at 65 years old or earlier will be
      retrieved from the "Observatoire français de la sclérose en plaques" (OFSEP) which includes
      more than 50 000 MS patients in France. Accuracy of these patients' data from 65 to 75 years
      old will be thereafter checked and completed in 3 French MS centers: Lyon, Rennes and
      Bordeaux, participating to this database directly from the patients' clinical files. From
      these 3 MS centers around 150 MS patients from 75 to 77 years old are expected to be analysed
      on site.

      The data wich will be retrieved for these patients are: irreversible disability status scale
      progression, relapses, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) data, CSF data, Lublin classification
      of type of MS, McDonald 2005 and 2010 criteria, date and age at beginning of progression,
      characteristics and modality of relapses and clinical impairment at the beginning of the
      disease, treatments used, treatment failures and side effects, co morbidity, Barthel index,
      EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D), cognitive impairment (SDMT test), social life data and socio economic
      data. To the investigator's knowledge this will be the first systematic description of very
      old MS patients with data on long term natural history of MS and characteristics in this
      population of elderly MS patients.
