      Q1. Does the provision of palliative care to heart failure patients yield higher quality of
      life, increased symptom management, or reduced depression compared to heart failure patients
      not receiving palliative care?

      Q2. Does the provision of palliative care to heart failure patients result in differential
      use of medical services (lower hospital days and readmission) compared to heart failure
      patients not receiving systematic palliative care?
