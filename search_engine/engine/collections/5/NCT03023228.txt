      uncontrolled diabetes admitted to the Medicine Service of an urban tertiary teaching hospital
      were consented to participate in a pilot study which provided diabetes survival skills
      education. Based on knowledge deficits identified on a diabetes knowledge pre-test the
      patient was directed to view video content corresponding to those deficiencies and content on
      sick days and diabetes complications. Evaluation measures were diabetes knowledge, medication
      adherence, and hospital admissions plus emergency department visits at and/or 3months before
      baseline and at 2 weeks and 3 months post-discharge. There was improvement in diabetes
      knowledge and medication adherence, which was sustained to 3 months. A trend was observed
      toward reduction in emergency department and/or hospital admissions from 3 months
      pre-intervention to 3 months post-discharge for uncontrolled diabetes. This knowledge-based
      program successfully provided survival skills education to hospital patients with
      uncontrolled diabetes and demonstrated preliminary evidence of a positive impact on
      medication adherence and a trend toward reduction in hospital and emergency department
      admissions.
