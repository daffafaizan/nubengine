      tolerated medical therapy including acetazolamide tablets were enrolled in this clinical
      trial and were randomized to tight flap technique group (group A) and loose flap technique
      group(group B). Randomization assigned 40 patients to group A and 40 patients to do group B.
      A total of 80 patients were enrolled in the Study between 2012 and 2014.

      During trabeculectomy, Trabecular meshwork and scleral lamellae were excised made an opening
      with the kelly scleral punch 1.0 mm 3-5 bites. At 12 o'clock 10/0 nylon monofilament stitch
      was used to close the apex of triangular scleral flap tightly and two releasable stitches
      were used at the sides of triangular scleral flap in group A. Fig-1 At 12 o'clock 10/0 nylon
      monofilament stitch was used to secure the edges of the flap at the apex of and two-four
      releasable stitches were used at the sides of triangular scleral flap in group B. The
