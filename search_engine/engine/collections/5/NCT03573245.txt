      varies widely.

      A large number of studies comparing tranexamic acid to placebo, overall blood loss and
      transfusion requirements are both reduced by â‰ˆ30%. A well designed tranexamic acid trial will
      provide answers to the best regimen dosage for perioperative tranexamic acid use. It will
      benefit patients by reducing allogeneic transfusions and their associated risks and costs,
      thus adding value to the care delivered.
