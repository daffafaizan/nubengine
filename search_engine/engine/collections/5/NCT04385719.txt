    
      The study is designed as an open-label, randomized, fixed sequence, single intravenous dosing
      study to assess the effects of antiretrovirals on remdesivir pharmacokinetics.

      The selection of healthy volunteers, as opposed to patients with HIV, avoids the greatest
      possible extent confounding factors, such as enzyme or transporter activity alteration in
      inflammatory states, concomitant medications potentially impacting drug disposition and other
      factors which are commonly present in a population of patients and cannot be easily
      eliminated.

      Objectives:

      Primary objective

        1. To assess the safety and tolerability of single intravenous doses of remdesivir in adult
           healthy volunteers

        2. To evaluate the intracellular pharmacokinetics of single dose intravenous remdesivir
           with or without co-administration of oral fixed-dose combination tenofovir/lamivudine
           with patients serving as their own controls

      Secondary objectives

        1. To evaluate the difference in plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics of intravenous
           remdesivir among healthy volunteers receiving tenofovir/lamivudine versus healthy
           volunteers receiving tenofovir/lamivudine plus atazanavir/ritonavir tablets.

        2. To generate a population pharmacokinetic model to describe inter-individual variability
           in intracellular pharmacokinetics of remdesivir

      Exploratory objectives

      1. To describe polymorphic variants of relevant kinases that activate TFV and explore
      possible consequences on remdesivir PK.
