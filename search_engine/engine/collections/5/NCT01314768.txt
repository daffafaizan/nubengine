    
      123 cases in all included (75 in intervention/placebo control arms and 48 in non-intervention
      Control arms) 19 did not meet predefined inclusion criteria for the different arms (5 and 8
      in intervention arm and placebo arm respectively, 4 and 2 in chronic headache Control and
      population Control respectively)

      1 case was lost to follow up in each of the 4 Groups prior to first assessment. Thus 60 cases
      remained in intervention/placebo Control arms (24 in intervention and 36 in placebo Control)
      and 40 in non intervention Control arms (15 chronic headache Controls, 25 population
      Controls).
