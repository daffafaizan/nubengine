      analyses of the ultrasound data in 41 patients with type 2 diabetes either on dietary control
      or oral antidiabetic medication. After recruitment and informed consent, patients are
      randomized to two treatment arms matched for age and concomittant antidiabetic and
      cardiovascular medication In one treatment arm, the diet is based on the LOGI components: 25%
      low glycemic index carbohydrates, 30% protein, 45% fat, taken for 3 weeks combined with
      aerobic exercise, while in the other treatment arm, the isocaloric traditional low fat diet
      is based on 55% mixed glycemic index carbohydrates, 20 % protein and 25% fat taken for three
      weeks and combined with the same aerobic exercise protocoll but followed by a two weeks
      period with LOGI diet and maintained exercise. In both treatment arms, antidiabetic and
      antihypertensive medication are maintained and/or adapted as necessary and recorded.

      All patients receive life style instructions and are updated in their skills of measuring
      quantity of foods and designing diet plans based on food groups. Laboratory, clinical and
      ultrasound investigations are performed before and at the end of the three weeks programme
      and, in the cross over group, also at the end of the subsequent diet programme.
