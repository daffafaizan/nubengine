      target vessel revascularisation compared with bare metal stents. Although this applies to the
      vast majority of patients, intimal hyperplasia and in-stent restenosis have not been
      completely eliminated and remain to occur in certain high risk subgroups. Thus there is
      ongoing research for new, potentially more effective and safe drug-eluting stent systems.

      One direction of extensive research is the search of new polymers such as biodegradable
      polymers which allow a controlled drug-release and disappear with time, reducing the
      probability of polymer-induced chronic inflammation on the vessel wall.

      Another direction is finding new drugs to suppress neointimal hyperplasia. Promising
      preclinical and clinical results suggest that the Everolimus eluting stent platform might
      provide potential improvements over prior generations of drug-eluting stents.
