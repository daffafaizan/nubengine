      may cause restrictions that might be related to disorders in the lower back.

      The diaphragm and the lumbar segment of the spine are connected through the diaphgramathic
      pillars that connect the central tendon and the vertebrae of L2 (left side) and L3/L4 (right
      side). Consequently, the contraction of the pillars may be related to the fixation of the
      lumbar spine.

      Proper function of the diaphragm is related to better parameters of static balance. It is
      also possible to conclude that a change in the proper function of the diaphragm is associated
      with changes in the center of gravity in healthy individuals.

      This theme lacks scientific evidence, since no studies were found that focus on the analysis
      of diaphragmatic treatment only. In this way, the investigators intend to collaborate to
      increase knowledge in this area, determining the effects of the intervention plan on the
      diaphragm in relation to the range of motion and center of gravity in the lumbar spine
      (static and dynamic) in healthy individuals.
