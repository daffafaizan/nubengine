      rates are very high with a median recurrence-free survival (RFS) time of 18 months with
      adjuvant chemotherapy. Bintrafusp alfa is a bifunctional fusion protein targeting TGF-Î² and
      PD-L1 that has shown promising activity in a second-line phase I BTC study. The neoadjuvant
      treatment approach is not a current standard in biliary tract cancer, but it is an accepted
      and frequently applied treatment strategy in other resectable and borderline-resectable
      cancers such as lung, gastric and rectal cancer. The hypothesis is that Bintrafusp alfa leads
      to a major pathological response in 30% of resectable BTC patients.
