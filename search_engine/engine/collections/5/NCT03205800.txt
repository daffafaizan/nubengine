      preservation following tooth extraction with a split mouth design. The study will evaluate
      clinical and radiographic outcomes following transcortical screw placements at extraction
      sites compared to non-treated extraction sites.

      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the clinical outcomes between the treated sites with a
      transcortical screw (the experimental group) and the non-treated sites (the control group)
      Null Hypothesis: There will be no differences in clinical parameters between the two groups.

      Approach: The investigators will conduct a prospective split-mouth design clinical study. The
      investigators will compare the clinical changes in vertical bone height and horizontal bone
      width at 4 months and 8 months from baseline (tooth extraction).

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the radiographic outcome between the experimental group and the
      control group Null Hypothesis: There will be no difference in alveolar ridge height and width
      between the two groups.

      Approach: The study will measure ridge height and width using cone beam computed tomography
      (CBCT) at baseline and 8 months.
