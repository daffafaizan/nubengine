      factorial-designed intervention trial. The pharmacological intervention for
      prednisolone/prednisolone-placebo is 14 days and for sitagliptin/sitagliptin-placebo 28 days.
      Subjects fulfilling the IDF criteria26 for the metabolic syndrome (aged 35-65; n=60) will be
      randomized to one of four groups: I) prednisolone 30 mg and sitagliptin 100 mg daily; II)
      prednisolone 30 mg and sitagliptin-placebo daily; III) prednisolone-placebo and sitagliptin
      100 mg daily; IV) prednisolone-placebo and sitagliptin-placebo daily. Before and at day 14 of
      treatment subjects will undergo a standardized mixed-meal test in order to assess glucose
      disposal and beta-cell function (by modeling analysis). During these meal tests, plasma
      concentrations of (total and active) GLP-1, GIP, glucagon and additional biomarkers will be
      assessed. A combined hyperglycemic-euglycemic clamp will be performed at baseline and at day
      13 of treatment to assess insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion. During the euglycemic
      clamp adipose tissue and muscle biopsies will be obtained, both in fasting and under
      hyperinsulinemic conditions. At baseline and at day 28 of treatment, a 7-point OGTT will be
      performed to assess time to restoration of glycemic control. Body composition, body fat
      distribution and liver fat content, measured by respectively bio-impedance analysis and
      magnetic resonance imaging/spectroscopy (MRI/MRS), will be assessed at baseline and after 28
      days of treatment. Blood pressure will be assessed at baseline and after two weeks of
      treatment. Microvascular function will be assessed with capillary videomicroscopy both at
      baseline and after two weeks of treatment.
