      included joint tenderness, fatigue, muscle weakness, impaired balance and disease activity.

      Musculoskeletal ultrasound is a bed side radiographic tool that gained much attention in the
      last decade.It can detect stuctural chnges in the musculoskeletal system even before beeing
      detected by the x ray.

      Nowadays, musculoskeletal ultrasound is a very useful tool in examining rheumatoid patients.

      No previous study was done to investigate the role of musculoskeletal ultrasound as a
      predicting factor of fall risk in rheumatoid patients.

      Predicting the fall risk in such disease could help setting preventing measures to prevent
      falls with its sequels.
