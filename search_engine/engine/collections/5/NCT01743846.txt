      variables achieved by a PICCO monitor.

      Hypothesis: Low cardiac output and volume status but not high vascular resistance affect the
      accuracy of CNAP. Body mass index and age may have impact on the accuracy of PPV measured
      non-invasively on the basis of volume-clamp technique.
