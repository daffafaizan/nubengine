      undergoing cardiac operations with cardiopulmonary bypass and modified ultrafiltration will
      be enrolled. Parents will be consented before surgery.

      After weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass and before starting modified ultrafiltration, a TEG
      sample will be taken. The components studied are Reaction time (R), Coagulation time (K),
      Angle, Maximum Amplitude (MA) and whole blood clot lysis index at 30 minutes (LY30). Another
      TEG sample will be taken after finishing modified ultrafiltration and before protamine is
      given. The different components will be compared pre and after modified ultrafiltration. The
      Primary end points are the changes of the different TEG components after modified
      ultrafiltration. The secondary end points are the utilization of different blood products
      (packed red cells, fresh frozen plasma and platelets transfusion) during and after surgery.
