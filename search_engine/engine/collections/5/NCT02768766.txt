    
      Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in adults, and arises
      from melanocytes within the choroid plexus of the eye. The development of metastasis is
      common and occurs in approximately 50% of patients with posterior UM within 15 years of
      initial diagnosis and treatment. As no effective systemic therapy has yet been identified for
      this disease, outcomes for metastatic UM are poor with a median survival of 12 months.

      There is no FDA approved therapy for patients with advanced UM. Studies have shown that
      inhibition of the Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway with the MEK inhibitor
      selumetinib (hyd-sulfate AZD6244) is an effective therapy for uveal melanoma but despite this
      treatment, cures are not achieved. Although drugs such as selumetinib have been studied when
      patients take the treatment every day, research has shown that in some cases, it may be
      better to use the treatment on an intermittent schedule. Such a strategy may reduce the side
      effects, allow higher doses of the drug to be used, more completely block the MAPK pathway,
      and prevent the development of drug resistance mechanisms within the tumor.
