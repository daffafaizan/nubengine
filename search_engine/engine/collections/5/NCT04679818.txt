      anesthesia.6 Presumably, titrating opioids to NOL will therefore provide individual guidance
      so that patients will be given about the right amount. Patient given the right amount will
      presumably awaken quickly when anesthesia is done, and have good initial pain control in the
      PACU. To the extent that NOL titration facilitates optimal opioid dosing, patients are likely
      to have better PACU experiences - which would be an important outcome that clinicians and
      regulators are likely to take seriously.
