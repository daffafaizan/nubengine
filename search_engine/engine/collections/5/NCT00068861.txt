      fundamental pathophysiologic defect is unknown, but PCOS is characterized by insulin
      resistance and compensatory hyperinsulinemia. Improvements in insulin sensitivity in PCOS
      women, either through lifestyle changes or through pharmaceutical intervention, have
      consistently resulted in a marked improvement in the reproductive and metabolic abnormalities
      in PCOS. Resumption of ovulation occurs in up to 70% of women treated for PCOS. This study
      will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of clomiphene citrate and metformin XR in
      achieving a successful pregnancy in infertile PCOS women.

      Women with PCOS who are seeking pregnancy will be enrolled in this study. Women will be
      randomized to one of three different treatment arms: A) metformin XR 1000 mg twice/day; B)
      clomiphene citrate 50 mg every day for 5 days (day 3-7 of cycle); or C) metformin XR 1000 mg
      twice/day with clomiphene citrate 50 mg/day for 5 days (day 3-7 of cycle). Women will
      continue on study medications for 30 weeks, 6 treatment cycles, or until they become
      pregnant. Progesterone levels will be drawn weekly to monitor ovulation.
