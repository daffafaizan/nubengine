      that small percentage of patients who may experience unpleasant sensations during caries
      removal. Laser analgesia is a non-invasive, non-thermogenic bio-modulation of the dental pulp
      reactivity aiming for reduction of impulse formation of the pulpal nociceptors. It is based
      on the idea that parallel with the ablative high-energy level laser action, simultaneous low
      level laser therapy (LLLT) may occur. We hypothesize that when operating at pulse energies
      below the Er:YAG laser ablation threshold of tooth structure, the laser energy leads to loss
      of impulse conduction of type A-delta nerve fibers in the dental pulp, leading to an
      analgesic effect.
