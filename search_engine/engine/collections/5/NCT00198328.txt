    
      Recurrent tumors in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma usually have a poor prognosis. In
      patients suitable for salvage surgery of their recurrent disease, the success rate for local
      control has been reported to be 40-50%. The surgical treatment of H&N SCC frequently results
      in significant loss of organ function (e.g., inability to swallow, speak, etc.) and/or
      permanent disfigurement. There is a compelling and unmet medical need for a local therapy
      that destroys tumors while preserving function status and appearance in patients with
      primary, recurrent, or metastatic H&N SCC.

      Comparison: To compare function status at 4 months after treatment with bleomycin-EPT or
      surgery in patients with locally recurrent or second primary SCC of the base of the tongue,
      posterior lateral pharyngeal wall, hypopharynx or larynx that have failed primary curative
      therapy and in whom surgical resection is seen as an option for disease control.
