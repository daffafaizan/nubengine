        2. Study design

             -  screening (1-week), dose titration (1-3 weeks) and 4-weeks of treatment period

             -  open-label dose-titration periods of up to 3 wk; the patients' optimum oral
                desmopressin dose (0.1, 0.2 and 0.4 mg) was determined as the dose that decreased
                the number of nocturnal voids by ≥50% and NUV decreased by ≥20% without
                hyponatremia.

             -  If the patients did not meet the above criteria during dose titration period, they
                received the maximum tolerable dose instead of the optimum dose. -- 4-weeks of
                treatment period; Eligible patients were treated with the determined optimum
                desmopressin dose for 4-weeks.

        3. Measurements

             -  3-day frequency-volume charts

             -  sleep questionnaire

             -  body weight, blood and urine analysis,serum sodium monitoring

             -  adverse event
