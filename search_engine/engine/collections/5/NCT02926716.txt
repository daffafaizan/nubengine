           After specimen delivery from the abdomen, frozen biopsy is performed before checking
           tumor margin. After inspection with NBI, the tumor margin is marked with
           electrocauterization. The tumor size and the lengths of both resection margins are
           evaluated using a ruler.

        2. Pathologic examination:

      The specimen is sliced as 4mm interval paralleled to the markings. Tumor size, the status of
      both resection margins, and microvessel density are evaluated under the 200 magnified view.
