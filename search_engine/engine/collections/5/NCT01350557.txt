      problems that usually results in costly hospital stays and lengthy rehabilitation procedures.
      With this increase in the aging population, hip fracture represents a major and a fast
      growing health care problem in Taiwan. Currently, the incidence rate of hip fractures is 10
      times of the incidence rate for the general population. Despite the use of advanced
      treatment, the one-year mortality rate (15.4%) remains significant, and many of the patients
      never recover completely in terms of activities of daily living functions. Many studies in
      the United States have proved that elderly patients with hip fracture can benefit from
      post-operative rehabilitation, early discharge planning programs, or transitional care
      programs. However, little is known about what intervention should be attempted for these
      patients and their families in Taiwan.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the costs and effectiveness of three care models-
      acute/sub-acute, comprehensive, and routine care models for hip fractured elders in Taiwan.
