      escalation (3+3) is used in study of LVGN6051-201. The traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation
      algorithm to identify the MTD and/or RDE and RP2D of LVGN6051 as a single agent (monotherapy)
      and in combination with pembrolizumab. The first stage of the study is the single agent dose
      escalation and expansion phase (Part A). The second stage of the study is the combination
      dose escalation and expansion phase (Part B). Patients will be considered evaluable for
      safety and tolerability if they receive at least one dose of LVGN6051 or pembrolizumab at the
      specified cohort dose. Patients in all parts of the trial will remain on therapy until
      confirmed disease progression or for 2 years, whichever occurs first. However, patients who
      are clinically unstable will discontinue following the initial assessment of disease
      progression
