    
      This is a Phase Ib/II study assessing the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs), recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and efficacy of L-NMMA when combined with
      docetaxel in refractory locally advanced or metastatic triple negative breast cancer
      patients. The Phase Ib portion of the study is designed to investigate the combination at two
      dose levels of docetaxel (75 and 100 mg/m2) and 7 dose levels of L-NMMA (5, 7.5, 10, 12.5,
      15, 17.5, and 20 mg/kg). The starting dose of L-NMMA will be 7.5 mg/kg. L-NMMA dose will
      escalate/de-escalate based on DLT occurrence. For the 5, 7.5, 10, 12.5, and 15 mg/kg L-NMMA
      doses, docetaxel will be administered at 75 mg/m2. For the 17.5 and 20 mg/kg L-NMMA doses,
      docetaxel will be administered at 100 mg/m2. In the Phase II portion of the study, the
      starting dose will be the RP2D determined in the Phase Ib portion of the study. In the phase
      II portion of the study, patients will be treated with L-NMMA and taxane (docetaxel,
      paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel) per physician's choice. Patients will be treated with L-NMMA
      and taxane chemotherapy (docetaxel, paclitaxel, or nab-paclitaxel) per physician's choice.
      L-NMMA will be administered on Days 1-5 and taxane chemotherapy on Day 1 Q3W or Day 1 Q1W.
      L-NMMA and docetaxel will be administered at the RP2D determined in the phase Ib portion of
      the study. Paclitaxel at 175 mg/m2 will be IV infused over 3 hours or 80 mg/m2 will be IV
      infused over 1 hour, and nab-paclitaxel at 260 mg/m2 will be IV infused over 30 minutes. For
      L-NMMA-induced hypertension, amlodipine (10 mg) and enteric-coated low-dose aspirin (81 mg)
      will be orally administered. Amlodipine will be administered for 6 days at each cycle,
      starting 24 hours before the first dose of L-NMMA. Enteric-coated low-dose aspirin will be
      administered once daily during the 6 21-day cycles. For docetaxel-induced leukopenia,
      pegfilgrastim (6 mg) will be administered via subcutaneous injection approximately 24 hours
      after every dose of docetaxel.
