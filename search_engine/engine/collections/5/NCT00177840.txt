      questionnaires. Participants will receive either true acupuncture or sham acupuncture twice
      per week for the six weeks of radiation therapy. She will have a short questionnaire at three
      weeks into her radiation, and she will complete questionnaires again at the end of her
      radiation and four weeks later.
