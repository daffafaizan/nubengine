      considered a social or health problem. While it is a psychologically distressing and socially
      disruptive, UI is believed to be an under reported and under diagnosed medical condition.
      This is a Multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study
      with 1 week of single-blinded placebo run-in. Patients will be randomized to 6 weeks
      double-blind treatment with oxybutynin or placebo. The primary hypothesis to be tested in
      this study is that the treatment difference in the change in incontinence episodes per week
      after 6 weeks of treatment in the double-blind phase between individual oxybutynin-treated
      group and combined placebo group is equal to zero.

      The patients will receive oral OROSÂ® containing oxybutynin, immediate release oral oxybutynin
      (1.7 or 2.5 mg) or TTS oxybutynin (60 cm2) daily for 7 weeks.
