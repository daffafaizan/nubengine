      (bupivacaine) at the time of mid-urethral sling placement will improve patients' reported
      post operative pain and decrease the use of narcotic pain medication. This study will include
      all female patients age 18 and older who will undergo a mid-urethral sling with or without
      anterior repair for the treatment of urinary stress incontinence by a member of the Division
      of Urogynecology and Reconstructive Pelvic Surgery who consent to be in the study.

      Once patients have consented to participate in the study they will be randomized into two
      groups. One group will have the mid-urethral sling placed in the usual fashion with no
      injection of local anesthetic. The other group will have the mid-urethral sling placed after
      the retropubic space has been infiltrated with local anesthetic as previously described in
      the literature. Pain will be assessed with the use of a Visual Analog Scale during the
      hospitalization and the use of narcotic pain medication will be assessed during recovery and
      overnight in the hospital. Patients will be asked to record how often and what type of pain
      medication they use. Patients will also be asked to keep a log of their urination if they are
      discharged home with self catheterization. They will be asked to mail in their pain
      medication log and voiding diary (if needed) at a two-week post-operative. Outcomes will then
      be compared.
