      induced once by realisation of an acute exercise set at moderate intensity and once by a
      dietary restriction imposed at lunch (compared with a control condition). 18 adolescents with
      obesity will be asked to randomly complete three experimental sessions: i) one control
      session (CON); ii) one session with an exercise-induced energy deficit (Def-EX); iii) one
      session with an energy restriction-induced energy deficit (Def-EI).

      Their ad libitum energy intake will be assessed during dinner time. Appetite feelings will be
      assessed at regular intervals and their food reward in response to the lunch will also be
      assessed.
