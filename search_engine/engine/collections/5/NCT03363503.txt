      50/500 mcg Inhalation Powder treatment administered via Capsair twice daily and original
      product Seretide Diskus 500 mcg Inhalation Powder treatment twice daily in patients with
      moderate-severe COPD.

      Patients who met all the inclusion criteria will enter a 1-week run-in period with the length
      determine by the specific medication, during which their usual treatment will be stopped and
      they will receive salbutamol as required.

      Following run-in period, patients will be randomly assigned to receive Salmeterol/Fluticasone
      50/500 mcg as dry powder capsule for inhalation by Capsair or Salmeterol/Fluticasone 50/500
      mcg as dry powder for inhalation by Diskus twice daily for 8-weeks treatment period.

      Patients will be evaluated at 6 consecutive visits: baseline (enrollment), screening,
      treatment (treatment initiation, after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment) and after treatment (will
      carry out by telephone two weeks following the last dose of study medication).

      Spirometric measurements will be performed at 12 different time points at pre-treatment and
      post-treatment (5. min, 15. min, 30. min, 1. hr, 2. hr, 3.hr, 4.hr, 6.hr, 8.hr, 10.hr and
      12.hr) during the treatment visits of 11-weeks study period.

      Safety will be assessed through vital signs, adverse events, serious adverse events and all
      cause mortality.
