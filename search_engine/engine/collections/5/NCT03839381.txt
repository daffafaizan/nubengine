      multifaceted assessment. Therefore, the treatment of postural control problems should be
      planned after a multifaceted assessment.

      Balance Evaluation Systems Test (BESTest) comprises 27 items and evaluate all components of
      postural control. MiniBESTest is a shortened version of BESTest with 14 tasks. MiniBESTest
      still addresses almost all components of postural control and can be performed 15 min.
      MiniBESTest is one of the most common methods which practiced on adult patients.

      The aim of this study is to present the Turkish version of miniBESTest which evaluates the
      reasons of balance deficit and postural control. Accordingly, a practice of validity and
      reliability on adult participants with sensoriomotor impairments will be performed by
      utilizing the Turkish version of miniBESTest in this study.
