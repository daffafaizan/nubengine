    
      This will be a multi-center, randomized, cross-over study utilizing the expertise of three
      Canadian academic centers (University of Saskatchewan, McMaster University, Laval University)
      that have been performing allergen inhalation challenges and other bronchoprovocation studies
      for more than forty years.

      Each participant will be required to attend the research lab on five occasions (Visits 1-5).
      At Visit 1, study staff will provide an overview of the study purpose and procedure and
      answer any questions the participant may have. The individual will then provide consent if
      they wish to participate (i.e. sign the consent form). Skin prick testing to determine
      relevant allergen sensitivities and to determine which allergen extract will be used for the
      skin test endpoint (STE) and allergen inhalation challenge will then be performed. The
      participant will be randomized with respect to which nebulizer (SoloÂ® or Wright) will be used
      first. The choice of nebulizer for the first participant will be via blinded draw. Subsequent
      nebulizer assignments will alternate. Participants will undergo the STE procedure and
      methacholine challenge testing (MCT) at visit 2; an allergen challenge will be done the next
      day at Visit 3 using the same nebulizer as was used for the MCT at Visit 2. Visits 4 and 5
      will also be performed on consecutive days and will involve methacholine and allergen
      challenge testing, respectively, using the nebulizer that was not used at Visits 2 and 3. A
      minimum of two weeks must separate Visits 3 and 4.
