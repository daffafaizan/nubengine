      (one group of patients), multicenter, prospective, interventional study in Chinese patients.
      In a prospective, interventional study, the patients identified receive a treatment during
      the course of the research study and are followed forward in time for the outcome of the
      study. In China, there is still insufficient information about effectiveness, tolerability,
      and dosage strategy for directly switching from previous oral antipsychotics (drugs that are
      helpful in the treatment of psychosis and have a capacity to ameliorate thought disorders) in
      patients with acute symptoms. Acute symptoms are quick and severe form of illness in its
      early stage. In addition, there is also lack of information about bridging acute phase to
      long-term treatment. In this study, patients with multiple types of acute schizophrenia will
      be recruited and will receive Sustenna (paliperidone palmitate) treatments for 13 weeks.
      After the acute treatment, the patients will continue to receive the prescribed medication
      and will be followed up for an additional 52 weeks to assess the outcomes related to
      long-term treatment.
