    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Identification of the maximal feasible dose of NK cells that can be infused one week after
      nonmyeloablative, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplant
      (HCT). (Phase I)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Once the maximal feasible dose has been identified, accrual will be limited to the cohort
      containing this cell dose to determine:

      I. Incidence of relapse. (Phase II)

      II. Incidence of grades III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). (Phase II)

      III. Incidence of non-relapse mortality. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of donor NK cell therapy followed by a
      phase II study.

      CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -6 to
      -2 and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -6 and -5. Patients undergo total-body
      irradiation on day -1.

      DONOR BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo donor bone marrow transplantation on day
      0.

      POST-TRANSPLANTATION IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on
      day 3 and mycophenolate mofetil orally (PO) thrice daily (TID) on days 4 to 40, followed by a
      taper until day 84 in the absence of GVHD. Patients also receive tacrolimus IV continuously
      or IV once daily (QD) over 1-2 hours or PO twice daily (BID) on days 4 to 84, followed by a
      taper until day 180 in the absence of GVHD.

      DONOR NK CELL INFUSION: Patients undergo donor lymphocyte infusion of NK cells on day 7.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years,
      and then every year thereafter.
