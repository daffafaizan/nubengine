      insulin resistance and lipid levels prior to the addition of pegylated interferon and
      ribavirin for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). If improvement is seen in insulin resistance
      patients may then be in a position to respond more favorably to current antiviral therapy
      consisting of pegylated interferon and ribavirin.

      This study could demonstrate the value of pretreating and continuing treatment for insulin
      resistance with pioglitazone in CHC, genotype 1 patients who have previously not responded or
      relapsed to prior pegylated interferon and ribavirin treatment. Changes in lipids are not a
      primary or secondary endpoint in this study.
