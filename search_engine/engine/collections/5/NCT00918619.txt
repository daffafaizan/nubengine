      to diffuse bleeding because of its extreme vascularity. Locally applicable agents
      (haemostats) are in use in order to achieve control over parenchymatic diffuse bleeding from
      the resection surface and to prevent intraperitoneal complications attributed to bleeding.
      These haemostats include bone wax, gelatine, collagen, oxidized regenerated cellulose, fibrin
      sealant glues, and synthetic glues. A composite product with well documented efficacy is
      Tachosil®. It consists of a collagen fleece carrying the fibrin glue components human
      fibrinogen and human thrombin. It was shown in a RCT to be superior in obtaining
      intraoperative haemostasis over argon beamer in liver resection. A new haemostat product is
      Sangustop®. It is indicated for local haemostasis of capillary bleeding and bleeding of
      parenchymal organs. Sangustop® is composed of native absorbable collagen fibrils without any
      blood serum products or any pharmaceutical activity. The felt structure being rich in surface
      gives a framework for the adhesion of blood platelets, thus provides an additional impetus to
      clotting. The aim of this study is to show that the new microfibrillar collagen hemostat
      Sangustop® is not inferior to the carrier-bound fibrin sealant Tachosil® with regards to
      haemostatic efficacy.
