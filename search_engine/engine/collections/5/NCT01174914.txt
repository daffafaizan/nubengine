      sponsored by The Ojai Foundation in California-USA is a clinical research study endorsed and
      approved by the Malian Government. Naltrexone hydrochloride is a generic, FDA-approved since
      1998 drug, an opioid antagonist that has clinically shown immune enhancing/modulating
      qualities in very low dosage and may offer an alternative to ARV drugs that is effective,
      non-toxic, easily available, inexpensive, with simple once-daily at bedtime administration.
      LDN capsules must be created by compounding pharmacists to get these ultra-small doses. Due
      to toxicity of current ARV drugs and need for special medical management young HIV infected
      children are largely neglected particularly in developing countries; LDN can also be made
      available in a transdermal cream for infants and children who are HIV infected.
