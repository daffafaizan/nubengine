    
      This is a cross-sectional, population-based study. No randomization procedure will be
      executed in this study. Approximately 1000 subjects over a 36-month period. The aim of this
      screening study is to identify the Fabry disease as the cause in patients with young stroke.

      To measure the level of Î±-Gal A activity, male subjects will initially provide a DBS sample
      and female subjects will start with a test by whole blood sample.

      The prevalence of Fabry disease among patients with young stroke will be estimated by a
      confirmative diagnosis in gene testing.
