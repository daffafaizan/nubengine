      analgesic non-inferiority versus a single 60 mg IM dose for the treatment of acute MSK pain
      in a military ED that services Department of Defense (DoD), Department of Veteran Affairs
      (VA), and foreign military beneficiaries. The authors chose to evaluate 15 mg rather than the
      previously identified 10 mg dose for ease of administration as ketorolac is manufactured in
      15 mg/mL, 30 mg/mL, and 60 mg/2mL vials in the U.S. The dose of ketorolac served as the
      primary independent variable for the study and the change in Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score
      served as the dependent variable. Prescribing the minimally effective doses of NSAIDs is
      pertinent to prevent and reduce the number of adverse events. Thus, the secondary outcome
      assessed for the dose-dependence of subjective and objective adverse events with ketorolac.
