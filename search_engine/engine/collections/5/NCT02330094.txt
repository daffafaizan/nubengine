      for neuropathic pain, which is also an alpha-2-delta (A2DR) receptor analogue to reduce the
      pain and decrease the need for narcotics in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage
      (aSAH). GBP has been shown to decrease neuropathic and non-neuropathic pain in a variety of
      perioperative and postoperative conditions. A2DR affinity also has some neuroprotective
      effect in animal data. The investigators plan to conduct a prospective, double-blinded,
      randomized trial to further assess GBP-associated reductions in narcotic use and pain scores
      compared to the non-GBP (placebo) arm. To accomplish this aim, the investigators plan to
      randomize 20 aSAH patients with headache to either GBP and standard of care pain treatment
      versus placebo and standard of care treatment.
