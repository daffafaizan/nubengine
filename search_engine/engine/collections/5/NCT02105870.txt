      function, correlates with clinical outcomes in patients with stable angina and ST elevation
      myocardial infarction. The glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor inhibitor, abciximab, improves
      coronary microvascular function and reduces major cardiac adverse events in patients with
      acute coronary syndromes. This study will investigate whether an intracoronary bolus of
      abciximab in patients with non-ST elevation myocardial infarction decreases IMR and improves
      microvascular function.
