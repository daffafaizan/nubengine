      the following results: a) The decrease in plasma Glu, by peritoneal dialysis (PD), reduces
      the size of the brain infarct in a model of focal cerebral ischemia in rats; b) PD is
      effective in reducing plasma Glu levels in patients with chronic renal failure; c) PD is a
      safe and well tolerated procedure in patients with ischemic stroke in the acute phase,
      however, it was not a viable procedure in our conditions, due to the malfunction of the
      automatic system that made it difficult for the inclusion sessions and dialysate extraction
      and the difficulty for the collaboration of this type of patient with the procedure; d). The
      increase in the median concentration of Glu after cerebral infarction was reduced to 46%
      after PD.

      Based on our previous results, the investigators believe that hemodialysis may have fewer
      technical problems than PD and serve as a neuroprotection technique by lowering the levels of
      Glu and proinflammatory cytokines in blood. To do this, the investigators establish the
      following objectives: a) To evaluate the feasibility and safety of a hemodialysis procedure
      in patients with acute ischemic stroke compared to a control group; b) To analyze the
      clinical benefit of hemodialysis estimated by the volume of the infarction and the
      neurological and functional situation of the patients; and c) To measure the levels of
      glutamate and proinflammatory cytokines in plasma and dialysate samples. For this, a
      single-center, randomized, open-label, controlled study has been designed with a group of
      patients with ischemic stroke who receive conventional treatment (N=10) or conventional
      treatment + 2 hemodialysis sessions (N=10) in the acute phase of the stroke (Phase IIa
      clinical trial with medical device).
