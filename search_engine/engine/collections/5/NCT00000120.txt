      require some eye treatment at birth to prevent gonorrheal eye infections. Approximately 3 to
      4 million Americans acquire a genital chlamydial infection each year, and more than 150,000
      infants are born to mothers with chlamydial infections. These infants are at high risk of
      developing conjunctivitis and pneumonia.

      In the State of Washington, one of three treatments is presently required by law to help
      prevent gonorrheal eye infection in newborn babies: 1 percent silver nitrate drops,
      erythromycin ointment, or tetracycline ointment. Although all three treatments appear to
      prevent eye infections from gonorrhea, silver nitrate and erythromycin may also partially
      prevent chlamydial conjunctivitis. However, silver nitrate may irritate and damage the eyes
      of newborns.

      If it is not known whether the mother is infected, it may be better not to give the drugs
      routinely. It could not be clearly established from the medical literature whether the risk
      to infants from no treatment was higher or lower than the risk from receiving a prophylactic
      agent. Many parents at low risk for gonorrhea prefer that no prophylaxis be given to their
      newborns. Moreover, Great Britain, which used no eye prophylactic agents for newborns for the
      25 years preceding the study, has rates of neonatal conjunctivitis similar to those in the
      United States. For these reasons, the Washington State Board of Health granted this study an
      exemption from the State law to allow the investigators to evaluate scientifically the risks
      and benefits of no treatment.

      The study was a randomized, double-masked clinical trials planned to include 1,200 infants
      born over 3 years. The trial compared the efficacy of two treatment regimens (silver nitrate
      and erythromycin) in two treatment groups to the outcomes in a control group receiving no
      prophylaxis. (Erythromycin was chosen over tetracycline as the antibiotic in this study
      because it is more commonly used in the United States for ocular prophylaxis.)

      Women were recruited from the University of Washington Medical Center-associated obstetric
      units. Among the 2,577 women eligible for possible participation, 758 enrolled. Of these
      participants, 89 were not randomized. Among the 669 randomized women, 39 were not available
      for personal observation. These 39 were equally distributed among the three prophylaxis
      groups. In the final participant group, the infants of 630 women were evaluable.

      The infants were randomly assigned to one of these three groups in the delivery room. Infants
      without conjunctivitis were monitored for 2 months after delivery. Infants who developed
      conjunctivitis were monitored for 2 months after successful treatment of their infection. The
      study included extensive efforts to determine the etiology of the conjunctivitis and to find
      nasolacrimal duct obstruction.
