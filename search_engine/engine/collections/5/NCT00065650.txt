      into a single, comprehensive, natural approach to health care. The objectives of this phase
      II pilot trial are to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and safety of implementing a
      multi-modality MVM intervention for newly diagnosed type 2 diabetics, and to measure the
      impact of such a protocol on overall glycemic control.
