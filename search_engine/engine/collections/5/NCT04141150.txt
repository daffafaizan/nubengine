    
      The overall objective of this study is to compare the overall pattern of [18F]APN-1607 uptake
      in subjects with MDAD, subjects with AD dementia, and healthy subjects.

      The specific objectives are:

        -  To expand the safety and tolerability profile for the administration of [18F]APN-1607
           and PET scanning.

        -  To assess regional patterns of [18F]APN-1607 uptake.

        -  To determine the Braak stage equivalent reflected by [18F]APN-1607 uptake patterns.

        -  To evaluate the relationship between regional measures of [18F]APN-1607 uptake and
           demographic characteristics, eg, age and gender; biological characteristics, eg,
           apolipoprotein E epsilon 4 (APOE4) carrier status and measures of AÎ² burden; and
           clinical characteristics, eg, measurements of AD disease severity, such as National
           Institute on Aging and Alzheimer's Association (NIA-AA) diagnosis, Mini-mental Status
           Exam (MMSE) score, and Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale
           (ADAScog).
