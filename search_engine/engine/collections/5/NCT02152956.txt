    
      Open-label, multi-dose, single-arm, multi-center, Phase 1/2 study conducted in three
      segments: the Single Patient Dose Escalation Segment (complete), followed by the
      Multi-Patient Dose Escalation Segment (complete) and the Maximum Tolerated Dose and Schedule
      (MTDS) Expansion Cohort Segment (ongoing). Having characterized safety and determined the
      maximum tolerated dose and schedule, the primary objective of this study now is to assess the
      anti-neoplastic activity of flotetuzumab in patients with PIF/ER AML, as determined by the
      proportion of patients who achieve CR or CRh. Starting with Cycle 2, patients who are
      benefiting from flotetuzumab may receive up to a maximum of 8 cycles of treatment.
