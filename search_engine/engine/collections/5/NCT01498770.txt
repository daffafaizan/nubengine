    
      The data source for this study will be the Clinical Practice Research Database (CPRD) in the
      UK. New users of asenapine during the period following the UK marketing launch of asenapine
      will be identified in the CPRD. Use in Bipolar Disorder and other indications, as well as
      baseline demographic and physical characteristics, including prior health status,
      comorbidities, concomitant medications and healthcare resource utilization, will be described
      for the asenapine cohort, for participants aged 18 or greater. Use of asenapine in the
      general practice setting among pediatric participants will be described.

      The primary comparison cohort will be aripiprazole. Participants in the aripiprazole cohort
      will be matched to participants treated with asenapine based on respective time after market
      entry. In addition, non-matched cohorts will be used to describe utilization of aripiprazole
      and other comparators.
