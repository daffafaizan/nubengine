      impaired muscle function and fatigue are the most common complications among patients with
      GCC undergoing treatment with chemotherapy. Although exercise is widely recommended,
      information about physiopathological effects of cancer therapy in skeletal muscle is very
      limited. Our aim is to evaluate the effects of an individualized exercise program with
      aerobic training in water running on cancer-related fatigue.

      Methods/Design: The present study is a randomized controlled trial comparing an
      individualized program of muscular strength and endurance with aerobic training compared to a
      control group. The investigators will conduct this trial in patients undergoing chemotherapy,
      recruited by the Departament of Oncology of Virgen de la Victoria Hospital (MÃ¡laga). Patients
      will be included and evaluated before the first cycle of chemotherapy and assigned
      experimental or control group randomly. All variables will be measured at the beginning and
      at the end of a 8-week intervention by the same evaluator, who will hide the disposition of
      participants to each group. Besides, it will be monitoring during de following 6 months (24
      weeks) after training for all outcome variables.
