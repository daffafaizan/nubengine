      tolerability compared to bolus 5-FU/LV. However, capecitabine has a higher incidence of
      hand-foot syndrome (HFS). HFS is characterized by erythema, dysesthesia and/or paresthesia of
      the palms of the hands or soles of feet. In advanced stage, desquamation, ulceration and
      blistering can occur. Although HFS is not life threatening, it can cause significant
      discomfort and impairment of function, especially in elderly patients. This adverse event is
      becoming particularly relevant since many patients may require the administration of
      capecitabine over prolonged periods of time.

      S-1 (TeysunoÂ®) is an oral fluoropyrimidine that has shown comparable efficacy to 5FU and
      capecitabine in gastrointestinal cancers but is associated with a much lower incidence of
      HFS. Studies on S-1 have mainly been performed in Asian patients,which population has known
      differences in tumour biology and toxicity compared to Western population. S-1 has shown
      comparable efficacy to other fluoropyrimidines as monotherapy or in combination chemotherapy
      schedules in several gastrointestinal tumors. However, given the lack of data from
      prospective studies on S-1 as monochemotherapy in metastatic colorectal cancer in Western
      patients, this study is designed to compare S-1 and capecitabine monotherapy in terms of
      safety, with particular interest in HFS, in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.
