      and post-operative assessments of the depth of the caries lesion being treated; (2) quantify
      the prevalence of dental material types used to restore the first restoration in a permanent
      tooth surface; and (3) test the hypothesis that DPBRN practitioner investigators in the
      "Assessment of caries diagnosis and caries treatment" study who stated that they wait until
      the caries lesions reach dentin before they place the first restoration are in fact more
      likely in this study to do restoration in teeth that have caries reaching into dentin.

      The aims were met by enrolling 230 DPBRN practitioner-investigators in the "Reasons for
      placing the first restoration on permanent tooth surfaces" study, each of whom recorded
      information about approximately 50 consecutive restorations that they placed on unrestored
      surfaces. This study about restorative treatment received by patients provided the
      opportunity to record the variations in the treatment provided, and also provided a basis for
      subsequent future studies to investigate how defects on fillings develop over time. These
      results will also be related to the findings from "Assessment of caries diagnosis and caries
      treatment" study where practitioners outlined how they detected dental decay, the stage at
      which the decay was treated by placing fillings, and how they rely on preventive measures to
      stop the decay process without placing fillings.
