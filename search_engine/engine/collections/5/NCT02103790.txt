      ventilation mode and initial parameters, and to choose the best adapted interface.

      Then, the patient is discharged from hospital and parameters adaptation is continued at home
      during the following five days by the hospital medical staff, using telemedicine. An ASV
      Sant√© employee visits the patient at home everyday during 5 days to ensure follow-up.
