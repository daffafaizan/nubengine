      or NESP), to assess what dose of NESP is required to treat anemia in prostate cancer
      patients, what the side effects of NESP are, and whether NESP will affect the patients'
      quality of life. NESP is approved by the FDA for the treatment of anemia in patients with
      chronic kidney failure and for the treatment of anemia in cancer patients who are receiving
      chemotherapy. It is considered experimental for the treatment of anemia in prostate cancer
      patients.
