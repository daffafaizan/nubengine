      who meet all the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria are going to be enrolled into
      the study. Phase IA (approx. 24 male and female volunteers) is to evaluate safety and
      tolerability after single oral administration of the Investigational Medicinal Produkt (IMP)
      to healthy volunteers. Additional cohort (approx 12 healthy volunteers) is going to be
      included in the phase IA of the study to assess the food effect on CPL409116 compound's
      bioavailability after one dose of single oral IMP administration. There are to be two
      treatments periods for this cohort: fasted and fed. Phase IB (approx. 32 male and female
      volunteers) is to evaluate safety and tolerability after two weeks of oral administration of
      IMP to healthy volunteers.
