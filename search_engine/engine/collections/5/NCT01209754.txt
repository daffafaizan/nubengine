    
      The Prevention Agent Pregnancy Exposure Registry, also known as EMBRACE (Evaluation of
      Maternal and Baby Outcome Registry After Chemoprophylactic Exposure) is a prospective
      observational cohort study of maternal exposures to investigational HIV prevention agents.
      Approximately 550 pregnant participants and 400 live infants will be offered enrollment. The
      study population will consist of current or recent female participants identified as becoming
      pregnant during microbicide or PrEP trials, or who have had planned exposures in pregnancy
      safety studies. This study will also include infants resulting from those pregnancies. This
      protocol will monitor for adverse pregnancy and delivery outcomes, monitor the prevalence of
      major malformations, evaluate growth parameters of infants during the first year of life, and
      evaluate the prevalence and persistence of HIV drug resistance mutations in a cohort of
      infants who were either exposed to active study agents or not exposed to active study agents
      while in utero.
