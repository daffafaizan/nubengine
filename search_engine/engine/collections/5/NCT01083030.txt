      the need for repeat target lesion revascularization compared to conventional uncoated balloon
      catheters. The aim of the study is correlating efficacy of the treatment to the proportion of
      paclitaxel-dose supplied by the catheter. To this end paclitaxel loss of catheters in the
      introductory sheaths and residual paclitaxel on used balloons will be determined and
      correlated to individual data indicating inhibition of neointimal proliferation. According to
      the study protocol 45 patients each will be treated by paclitaxel-coated or uncoated
      conventional balloon catheters in randomized order in 3 study centers. Main inclusion
      criteria are Rutherford class 2 - 5, â‰¥70% stenosis or occlusion in the superficial femoral or
      popliteal artery, 3 to 30 cm of length; beyond common contraindications against PTA main
      exclusion criteria are related to the use of paclitaxel and the need for follow-up
      examinations. Patients will be blinded against treatment. Blinding of investigators after
      assignment of a patient to a treatment is not possible due to differences in the appearance
      of coated and uncoated catheters. Either clinical or angiographic follow-up examinations are
      planned 6, 12 and 24 months following the intervention. Primary endpoint is 6-month
      angiographic late lumen loss evaluated by a blinded independent core lab. Secondary endpoints
      are interventional success rate, restenosis rates, minimal lumen diameter, target lesion
      revascularization, change in Rutherford class, change in ankle-brachial-index, major
      amputations, a composite safety endpoint (defined as MAE =death of any cause, target limb
      amputation, clinically / DUS driven TLR) and all kinds of serious adverse events possibly
      related to the treatment.
