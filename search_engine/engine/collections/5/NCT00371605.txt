      in this study. We propose a single-center, observational study in 15 liver transplant
      patients who are admitted to the ICU and receiving voriconazole prophylaxis as part of
      standard care. Each patient will undergo blood sampling (27 mL) on one occasion
      (Pharmacokinetic Study I), while receiving oral voriconazole. A small portion of blood (1 mL)
      collected during this blood sampling period will be retained for genotyping (specific aim
      III).

      Voriconazole prophylaxis is most often administered to liver transplant patients via the oral
      route (200 mg twice daily). However, circumstances may arise necessitating the administration
      of intravenous doses of voriconazole for a subset of patients, as part of their standard
      care. . Thus, these patients will undergo blood sampling on a maximum two additional
      occasions: 1) surrounding an intravenous dose dose (27 mL) 2) surrounding an oral dose (27
      mL) .

      The amount of voriconazole present in the blood samples will be measured via high pressure
      liquid chromatography. Individual plasma concentration time profiles will be determined
      following oral and intravenous dosing, respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameter estimates will
      be derived via population and individual pharmacokinetic data analysis.

      The use, dose, and frequency of the medication voriconazole is up to the clinical staff. We
      will not be altering the delivery, dose or use of the drug. Therefore we cannot provide you
      with the requested information because it will all depend on the clinical team. We are not
      intervening to enroll subjects. Subjects will only be enrolled if they are placed on
      voriconazole and they agreed to participate.
