      Centre on one individual day. Before gait analyses the following characteristics were
      measured; height, weight, BMI, knee and ankle width (measured between the two condyles of the
      knee and the measured between the two malleoli of the ankle) and leg length . All
      measurements are performed by researchers who was trained in the examination of the foot. At
      least one static trial was performed with all 42 markers, with the subjects in stance phase
      in an anatomic neutral position. After calibrating the markers and calculating the
      subject-specific joint axes in the static trial, 6 markers were removed, according to the OFM
      protocol. After that the subjects were asked to walk barefoot in normal speed after a number
      of practice trials. For this speed at least 8 proper recordings were made during walking. The
      healthy subjects were also asked to walk in slow speed and 8 proper recordings were made
      during this slow-speed walking. One whole step was considered complete from heel landing
      (initial contact) to toe-off. A force plate was used to determine the heel-strike and toe-off
      phase during walking. Corrections in the axes of the knee and ankle were made if necessary
      and tiles were saved for further data output.
