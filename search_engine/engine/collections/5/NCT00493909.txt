      pre-existing lung disease such as lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pain
      after thoracotomy is considered the most intense acute postoperative pain, adversely
      affecting the ability to cough, deep breathing, and lung function, resulting in respiratory
      complications and delayed recovery. The adverse effects can be further aggravated by
      occurrence of chronic post-thoracotomy pain.

      Thoracic epidural analgesia is often recommended as the gold standard for the relief of acute
      post-thoracotomy pain. Thoracic paravertebral blockade or intrathecal opioid analgesia has
      also been shown to be efficacious for pain relief. Since there is no ideal single regional
      technique for pain relief after thoracotomy an alternative method maybe the combination of
      low-dose intrathecal morphine and sufentanil plus continuous thoracic paravertebral analgesia
      with local anesthetics.

      We therefore hypothesized that combining intrathecal sufentanil and morphine with thoracic
      paravertebral applicated ropivacaine would provide equal analgesia compared to thoracic
      epidural analgesia with ropivacaine and sufentanil. We further speculate that this new
      regimen would have a lower incidence of typical side effects due to TEA, such as block
      failure, hypotension or urinary retention.
