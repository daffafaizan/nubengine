      receive individual consultations with a physiotherapist. The aim of the meetings will be to
      motivate and support participants on an individual basis, with the goal of increasing weekly
      physical activity. The second group, the control group, will continue with their current
      management strategies. All participants will be assessed at baseline, post-intervention
      (after twelve weeks) and after a three month follow-up period. The primary outcome measure
      will be free-living physical activity over one week.
