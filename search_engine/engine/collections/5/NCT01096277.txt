    
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of a therapy with the DPP-4-inhibitor
      sitagliptin on the prognostic relevant endothelial function and endothelial progenitor cells
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      Primary endpoint: Endothelium-dependent vasodilation before and after treatment of patients
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus with the DPP-4-inhibitor Sitagliptin and placebo treatment
      respectively.

      Secondary endpoint: effect of sitagliptin on mobilization, NO-production and in vivo
      regenerative capacity of human endothelial progenitor cells before and after treatment of
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus with the DPP-4-inhibitor sitagliptin and placebo
      treatment respectively
