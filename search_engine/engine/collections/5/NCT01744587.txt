    
      Patients with pathologically proven NPC, stage II-IVB and finishing curative RT ≧70 Gy within
      6 months (± induction/concurrent/adjuvant chemotherapy) will be candidates for this study.
      Before entry, 8 CC venous blood will be obtained for EBV DNA and antibody screen tests after
      patient's consent. Those who have undetectable plasma EBV DNA (0 copy/ml) and fulfilled with
      all inclusion and exclusion criteria will be registered.

      Routine re-staging work-ups after RT should show no active lesion in nasopharynx, neck and
      distant organs. Re-staging survey should include nasopharyngoscope, pEBV DNA assay, CBC,
      platelet count, renal and liver function tests, CXR, abdominal sonography or CT scan, whole
      body bone scan, MRI or CT scan of the head and neck region.

      Within one week after finishing registration, EGCG or placebo should be started. A blood
      sample before taking EGCG/placebo will be collected for antibodies test and pEBV DNA assay.
