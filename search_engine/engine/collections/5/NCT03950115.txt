      undergo four treatment sessions in total, which are two weeks apart. Group 1 will undergo two
      sessions of intense pulsed light therapy with meibomian gland expression, as well as two
      sessions of intense pulsed light alone. Group 2 will receive two sessions of intense pulsed
      light therapy alone, and two sessions of intense pulsed light therapy with meibomian gland
      expression. The following parameters will be measured at baseline, 2 weeks after the second
      treatment session, and 2 weeks after the fourth treatment session: tearfilm break-up time,
      Oxford grade for corneal staining, meibomian gland expressibility, meibum quality, and ocular
      surface disease index.
