      transplantation (LTx), and a special subset of chronic graft dysfunction. The overall rate is
      approximately 20% per recipient. Even though disobliteration (laser, argon-coagulation,
      cryotherapy) or balloon dilatation (bronchoplasty) are performed there is a high rate of
      recurrence. Self expandable metallic stents (SEMS) is one suggested treatment option after
      failed initial therapy but have a high rate of re-stenosis (50-60%). Morbidity, the risk for
      e.g. infection and atelectasis and lower long-term survival are often consequences in pts.
      treated with SEMS. No surgical options aside from re-do-transplantation are available. OAC
      are developing mostly in the time 3 - 6 months post Tx. The idea is a permanent but temporary
      therapy with replacement character of the stenosis which is given in degradable bronchial
      stents.

      Hypothesis: New biodegradable bronchial stents are a successful treatment of benign bronchial
      stenosis after lung transplantation. After stent placement is further disobliteration is less
      frequently used during the next 6 months.
