      chemotherapy, and previous studies have only provided a link between the gut and breast
      cancer.At present, studies on the interaction mechanism between intestinal flora and breast
      cancer mainly focus on two aspects: first, intestinal flora affects the occurrence and
      progress of breast cancer by affecting estrogen metabolism;Second, intestinal flora can
      influence the occurrence and treatment of breast cancer by affecting the regulation of the
      immune system.However, the specific types (or groups) of bacteria that promote the
      occurrence, development and mechanism of breast cancer still need to be further studied.In
      addition, since most of the current clinical studies on microorganisms and breast cancer are
      small sample studies, the accuracy of their conclusions remains to be studied.
