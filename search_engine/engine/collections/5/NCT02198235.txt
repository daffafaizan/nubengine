      for Special Surgery (HSS) usually uses nerve blocks (injections of local anesthetic near
      nerves supplying the lower leg) to help manage pain after this type of surgery. Patients also
      receive additional pain pills, including narcotics as needed. This study looks at addition of
      medications to the local anesthetic for the nerve blockade. The investigators hope that these
      medications (dexamethasone and buprenorphine) will prolong the pain relief from the nerve
      block. There are 3 groups in the study. One group is a control, and receives usual therapy:
      nerve block + pain pills. This is typically what the patient would receive as standard care
      if they were not in the study. One group uses a nerve block with additives (+ pain pills).
      One group gets a nerve block (local anesthetic only) + pain pills + intravenous buprenorphine
      - this is meant to see if the buprenorphine acts directly on the nerve that was blocked, or
      indirectly acts on the brain.

      Patients will be followed while in the hospital, and contacted by telephone and/or email
      after discharge for 2-3 days. Patients will be asked about their pain levels and the duration
      of their block. The investigators will enroll 90 patients.
