      inflammatory pain. However, all NSAID have the potential to raise blood pressure (BP), cause
      the development of new hypertension or exacerbate preexisting hypertension. Strategies to
      mitigating that risk short of withholding the analgesic are missing. In this proposal, the
      investigators wish to determine whether timed administration of low dose aspirin can be
      developed as a low cost intervention with well-defined risk profile to mitigate the blood
      pressure raise associated with the COX-2 selective NSAID celecoxib. Low dose aspirin
      administered in the evening, but not in the morning, normalizes the mean arterial BP in
      clinical studies of prehypertension, mild essential hypertension and preeclampsia. The
      investigators will address this in an interventional study in healthy volunteers who
      displayed a blood pressure increase during celecoxib treatment in an ongoing study. Since
      individuals have varying chronotypes and work/social rhythms, parameter measuring day/night
      patterns, the chronobiome, will be part of this study.
