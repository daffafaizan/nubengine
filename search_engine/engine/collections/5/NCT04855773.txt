    
      This is a clinic-based, multi-site, randomized, two-arm study to compare the effectiveness of
      two mobile technologies designed to support PrEP adherence and continuation in cisgender and
      transgender men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW). All study
      participants will receive PrEP per standard of care at each of the study sites.

      Participants randomized to PrEPmate will receive an interactive bidirectional text-messaging
      intervention that supports PrEP use through personalized communication between patients and
      providers. Key components include (1) weekly short message service (SMS) check-ins and a
      bidirectional SMS messaging platform; (2) customized daily SMS pill-taking reminders; (3)
      link to online PrEP Basics and videos and testimonials.

      Participants randomized to Dot Diary will receive a mobile app that promotes self-management
      of PrEP use and sexual health. Key components include (1) a digital pill-taking and sexual
      diary, with pill-taking reminders; (2) sex-positive badges earned via app use; and (3)
      real-time feedback on protection levels afforded by PrEP. Each participant will be followed
      for approximately 12 months. Staff at the participating clinics will also participate in
      in-depth interviews to give feedback on implementation challenges and experiences in the
      clinic-setting, and experience working with patients using the mobile technologies.
