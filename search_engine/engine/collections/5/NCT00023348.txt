      patients will be asked to undergo measurements of isoniazid (if receiving), rifabutin and
      25-OH desacetyl rifabutin levels at a time point in the study when steady state rifabutin
      levels are expected to have been achieved (at least two weeks following the start of
      rifabutin).
