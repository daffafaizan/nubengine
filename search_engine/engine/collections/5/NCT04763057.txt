      no signs and symptoms of pulp deterioration. In this treatment, the deepest layer of the
      remaining carious dentine (affected dentin) is covered with biocompatible material followed
      by an airtight restoration to achieve a good seal against microleakage, without the need to
      reencounter for the removal of remaining caries.

      Calcium hydroxide has served as a gold standard for IPT over the years. However, the
      introduction of newer bioactive materials such as mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and
      Biodentine helped surpass the demerits of calcium hydroxide such as internal resorption,
      nonadherence to dentin, degradation over time, tunnel defects, and poor sealing ability.
