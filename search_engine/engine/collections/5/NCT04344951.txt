      since December 2019, causing the disease known as COVID-19. As of March 23, 2020, there have
      been 382,341 documented episodes of infection worldwide, of which 16,567 have died. An
      important limitation in the treatment of the disease is the absence of drugs with known
      antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Recent data suggest that chloroquine has sufficient in
      vitro activity against the SARS-CoV-2 virus by inhibiting virus entry into cells. It has
      recently been described that hydroxychloroquine significantly reduces the percentage of
      patients who have positive sputum in the SARS-CoV-2 virus within 6 days. However, the
      clinical efficacy of the drug has not been described and it has significant side effects,
      including more than 10% anorexia, headache, blurred vision, diarrhea or vomiting, and
      myocardiotoxicity. The frequency of adverse effects of chloroquine in combination with the
      well-known in vitro activity of chloroquine have led to the design of clinical trials around
      the world to document the benefits of its use. The present study will evaluate the activity
      of chloroquine phosphate in patients with SARS-CoV-2 virus infection.
