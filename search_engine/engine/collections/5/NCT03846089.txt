      antegrade liver reperfusions versus patients that had retrograde liver perfusion. Antegrade
      Reperfusion(ATR) group: after completing the caval replacement or piggy-back, for IVC
      anastomosis, Portal vein (PV) anastomosis was done with a running suture as normal fashion,
      then it was followed by the removal the clamps, starting by the supra hepatic VC, followed by
      the PV clamp and finally the infrahepatic VC. It was followed by arterial anastomosis and the
      biliary anastomosis (duct-to-duct if possible). Retrograde group (RETR): after completing the
      piggyback the IVC was declamped immediately and retrograde low pressure reperfusion of the
      graft with low oxygenated venous blood was established. Central venous pressure was intended
      to be higher than in 8 mmHg to enable appropriate retrograde reperfusion in the transplanted
      liver. Significant venous backflow via portal vein appears immediately after declamping.
      Venous bleeding from the liver except portal backflow was stopped immediately after
      declamping the venous anastomosis, as appropriate. Portal vein anastomosis was performed
      using running suture. It was followed by arterial anastomosis and the biliary anastomosis
      (duct-to-duct if possible). The endpoints are patient survival and graft survival at 1, 3,5,
      10 years post liver transplantation in both groups. To adjust for a selection bias, we will
      perform a propensity score analysis.
