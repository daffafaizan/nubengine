      one-time, in person services at the time of the baseline/enrollment ED visit including
      referrals to homelessness prevention and substance use services, with a final six-month
      follow-up survey. Interim contacts at 7-10 days, 3 months, and 5 months will be used to
      assure intervention components were received and to confirm participant contact information.
