    
      Lichen sclerosus (LS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that usually involves the
      anogenital area where it causes itching and burning pain, pain during sexual intercourse, and
      anal or genital bleeding due to fissuring of the damaged tissue. In this study a treatment
      with dual laser application combining thermal non-ablative Nd:YAG with ablative Er:YAG laser
      is used to reduce the symptoms of LS. Results will be compared to the standard therapy with
      topical steroid cream.
