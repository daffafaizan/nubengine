      placebo-controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to receive either placebo or
      citicoline.

      Throughout the study, participants will be asked about their alcohol use and any withdrawal
      or craving symptoms. Depressive symptoms will be measured as well. Cognition and memory will
      be measured as well with a neurocognitive battery. Blood will be drawn at study start and
      week 12 to measure liver enzyme levels.

      Appointments will be weekly for the entire study. Participants will have a physician
      follow-up at every study appointment.
