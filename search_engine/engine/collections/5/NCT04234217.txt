      glucose metabolism, however, metabolic mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear.
      This mechanistic study will determine systemic and cellular metabolic pathways that
      contribute to impaired glucose metabolism in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Understanding of
      how obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) affects glucose metabolism may help identify novel targets
      for risk prediction and/or treatment of metabolic impairments beyond continuous positive
      airway pressure (CPAP). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) patients with prediabetes will be
      studied under three in-laboratory conditions in a randomized cross-over design: untreated
      condition (obstructive sleep apnea), treated condition (continuous positive airway pressure),
      untreated but pharmacologically suppressed lipolysis condition (Niacin). The investigator
      will perform whole body and cellular assessments under each study condition.
