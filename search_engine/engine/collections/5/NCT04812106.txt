    
      The online LC-FAOD DMP is a non-interventional, prospective, observational disease-monitoring
      program conducted through a mobile/web-based application developed by the Sponsor.
      Participant data will be captured via the mobile/web-based application and entered into the
      database designed and maintained by the Sponsor and/or its designee. Additional objectives of
      the study are to benefit the LC-FAOD community by developing a comprehensive database for use
      by the LC-FAOD community to characterize patient experience, inform disease management, and
      enable further research, utilize the digital platform to notify patients, caregivers, and
      relevant patient advocacy groups of research studies and clinical trials and share aggregated
      and de-identified outputs to facilitate the exchange of information with patients and/or
      caregivers.

      Participants can be on any treatment in order to participate. Medical management of the
      disease should continue as directed by the patient's physician(s). Specifically, no
      treatments, investigational agents, or experimental interventions will be provided as part of
      this online LC-FAOD DMP.
