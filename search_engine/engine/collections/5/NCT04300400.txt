      Urology Association and International Consultation on Incontinence) are comparable but remain
      vague mainly on the level between conservative and major surgery. They do not specify
      combinations of medications and do not distinguish between intradetrusor botulinum toxin
      injections (BTX) and sacral neuromodulation (SNM) because of lack of evidence.

      To reduce the variability in the treatment management of OAB, standardization is needed.

      By use of a Delphi technique, the current perception of Belgian urologists towards the most
      appropriate treatment approach for idiopathic OAB (iOAB) was explored.

      Based on these results a practical treatment algorithm for its use in daily clinical practice
      could be developed.
