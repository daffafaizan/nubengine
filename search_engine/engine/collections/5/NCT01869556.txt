      and intramuscular carboprost, when administered with oxytocin infusion, prophylactically to
      decrease blood loss at Cesarean section for labor arrest. Desensitization of the oxytocin
      receptors has been recently demonstrated in cultured human myometrial cells after continuous
      and prolonged exposure to oxytocin in-vitro. This could be also the reason for a greater risk
      of uterine atony and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) seen in women requiring induction and
      augmentation of labor. Therefore, addition of a different uterotonic agent, involving a
      different mechanism of action, to oxytocin infusion is likely to be beneficial, especially in
      women undergoing CS following failure to progress in labor, who are at a greater risk for
      PPH.
