      bromelain and L-carnosine (Uricemin®) can reduce uric acid levels in subjects with values
      between ≥ 6 and < 7 mg/dl after 3 months of therapy.

      Patients will be randomized to Uricemin® or placebo for three months. We will evaluate body
      weight, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), lipid profile, uricemia (UA), high-sensitivity
      C-reactive protein (Hs-CRP) at baseline and after 3 months since the study start. Treatment
      tolerability will be assessed evaluating transaminases, and creatinine, and all adverse
      events will be recorded.
