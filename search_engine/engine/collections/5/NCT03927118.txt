      irreversible loss of vision if untreated. Dexamethasone implant implant is used to treat
      macular edema due to diabetes. It stay in the vitreous for 6 months after intravitreal
      administration.

      Dexamethasone implant can lead to retinal nerve fiber layer and optic nerve damage by both
      increasing intraocular pressure and its direct effect on neural tissue during the effective
      6-month period.
