    
      The study comprises 3 periods:

        -  An up to 14-week screening period, which includes an up to 2-week screening phase and a
           12-week run-in phase with introduction and titration of insulin glargine on top of
           metformin +/-TZDs.

        -  At the end of the run-in phase, patients whose HbA1c (centralized assay) is greater than
           or equal to (>=) 7% and less than or equal to (<=) 9% and whose mean fasting
           self-monitored plasma glucose (SMPG) calculated from the self measurements for the 7
           days prior to Visit 12 (Week -1) is <=140 milligram per deciliter (mg/dL) (7.8 millimole
           per liter [mmol/L]), would enter a 24-week double-blind randomized treatment period
           comparing lixisenatide to placebo (on top of insulin glargine + metformin +/- TZDs).

        -  A 3-day safety follow up period.

      Maximum duration is of 39 weeks +/- 7 days.
