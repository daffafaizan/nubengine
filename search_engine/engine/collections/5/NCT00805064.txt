      21/26; mean age: 66.6 years) with ischemic central RVO (CRVO) (n = 15), non-ischemic CRVO (n
      = 7), or branch RVO (BRVO) (n = 25). A core pars plana vitrectomy with aspiration of 1.5 ml
      vitreous and infusion of balanced salt solution (BSS; 1 ml), 8 mg (0.4 ml) triamcinolone, and
      1.25 mg (0.1 ml) bevacizumab was performed with a single sutureless sclerotomy and a 23 gauge
      probe tip. At baseline and follow-up, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA; 6 m Snellen),
      and intraocular pressure (IOP; Goldmann tonometry), and central macular thickness (optical
      coherence tomography) were determined. In addition, the need for further treatment and
      adverse events were monitored.
