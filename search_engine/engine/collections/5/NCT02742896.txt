      According to recent reports, maintenance of sinus rhythm increase systemic perfusion which
      leads to improve renal function. Therefore, we hypothesized that sinus conversion of patients
      with atrial fibrillation will increase systemic perfusion which might improve the erectile
      dysfunction and cognitive dysfunction.
