        1. To examine individual-level and structural-level barriers to HIV care after release from
           jail, using formative semi-structured interviews with ex-inmates, case managers, and HIV
           care providers; and to use the information we obtain to inform the adaptation and
           tailoring of an intervention designed to improve linkage with and retention to HIV care
           for HIV+ ex-inmates (Complete);

        2. Using a two-group experimental RCT design, to test the adapted peer navigation
           intervention condition for HIV+ inmates upon release from jail compared to a usual care
           condition, and to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness at improving linkage with
           and retention in HIV care, self-reported ART adherence, and HIV RNA viral load
           suppression;

      The intervention is hypothesized to result in greater linkage to care, a greater proportion
      completing at least three HIV care visits per year, increased self-reported ART adherence,
      and decreased levels of HIV RNA viral load compared to the usual care control group.

      Secondary Aims of the study include assessing the potential moderating effects of substance
      abuse, the potential mediating effects of substance abuse treatment, and the program's
      effects on recidivism, and costs.

      Active substance abuse is hypothesized to moderate the effect of the intervention, such that
      the intervention will be less effective among participants who report substance use.
