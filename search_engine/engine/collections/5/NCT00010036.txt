        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of carboplatin and irinotecan in patients
           with glioblastoma multiforme. (Phase I closed to accrual as of 6/24/02)

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the objective response in patients treated with the established MTD of this
           regimen.

        -  Determine time to tumor progression and survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients in the phase II portion of the study are
      stratified according to age (under 60 vs 60 and over), ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2),
      and extent of resection (total vs subtotal). (Phase I closed to accrual as of 6/24/02)

      Within 4 weeks of surgery, patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes followed by
      irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a maximum of 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin and irinotecan until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, additional patients are accrued to receive carboplatin and irinotecan at the
      recommended phase II dose. (Phase I closed to accrual as of 6/24/02)

      After chemotherapy, all patients undergo radiotherapy.

      Patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-107 patients (3-54 for phase I and 21-53 for phase II) will
      be accrued for this study. (Phase I closed to accrual as of 6/24/02)
