      study. This will be a prospective controlled study. After written informed consent, 20
      subjects with symmetric thick plaque psoriasis lesions on the extremities and/or trunk will
      be enrolled and randomized to receive one activated iontophoresis patch containing
      dexamethasone sodium phosphate and another inactive control iontophoresis patch containing
      dexamethasone sodium phosphate on each limb containing a thick psoriatic plaque. Members of
      the research team will apply the patches. After application of the patch, subjects will be
      asked to return to the clinic in 1 week and 2 weeks. Efficacy will be measured at the 1-week
      and 2-week follow-up visit using a scale for erythema, scale, and thickness called the static
      Physician Global Assessment (sPGA) and subject satisfaction to treatment will be measured at
      the 2 week-follow-up using the PsoSat Questionnaire.
