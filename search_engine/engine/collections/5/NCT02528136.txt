      several RCTs. Circulatory adverse events leading to death has been reported after intravenous
      injection of oxytocin. Some studies indicate that oxytocin may lead to dose dependent
      ischemic ECG changes, prolongation of QT time and liberation of biomarkers of myocardial cell
      death. Previously we have demonstrated comparable vasodilatory effects of oxytocin and
      carbetocin. There is no clinical study comparing the specific myocardial effects of oxytocin
      with carbetocin. It may have great impact on the choice of standard medication if the
      cardiotoxicity of carbetocin is lower compared with oxytocin. The study of potential
      cardiotoxicity has to be performed in healthy women. Knowing that millions of laboring women
      have had uneventful injections of oxytocin and carbetocin after delivery, there is probably
      no reason to fear long lasting negative effects of either drug. If there are differences in
      cardiotoxicity, this new information should be taken into consideration when planning
      delivery in pregnant women with heart disease.

      The aims of this study are to compare 0h (before C-section), 4h, 12h, 24h, and 48h plasma
      concentrations of Troponin I, Troponin T, proBNP, CK, and other relevant myocardial markers
      in elective healthy C-section patients randomized to oxytocin 2.5 U or carbetocin 100 Âµg, 1
      minute injection immediately after delivery.
