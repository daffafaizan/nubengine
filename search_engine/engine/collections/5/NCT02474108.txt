      substantially reduce the number of excellent and good results of the operation in the
      long-term period, causing circulatory insufficiency, increased pulmonary hypertension,
      increasing the risk of thromboembolic events and stroke.

      Significant predictors of AF after surgery are the initial size of the left atrium more than
      6.0 cm, stenotic lesions and rheumatic genesis of mitral defect. 80% of patients in this
      group had AF during the first year after operation.
