      measure of flow-mediated dilation (reactive hyperemia-peripheral artery tone index). The
      pulmonary function will be assessed by the measures of the forced expiratory volume at one
      second (FEV1), the forced vital capacity (FVC) and the total lung capacity (TLC) and the
      diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide (DLCO). The dyspnea will be assessed with
      the New York Heart Association (NYHA) score. The exercise capacity will be assessed by the
      6-min walk test. Pulmonary arterial pressure will be recorded through cardiac echography or
      catheterization.
