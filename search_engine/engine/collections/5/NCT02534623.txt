      Society of Anesthesiologists) physical status class I-III scheduled for TURB will be randomly
      assigned to either spinal anesthesia or general anesthesia. Spinal anesthesia will be
      performed with 12.5 mg of bupivacaine mixed with 25 mcg of fentanyl. General anesthesia will
      be performed with propofol and fentanyl and maintained with sevoflurane, without use of
      neuromuscular blocking agents. Quality of Recovery 40 questionnaire (QoR-40) administered
      before and 24 hours after surgery will be used for assessment of postoperative recovery.
