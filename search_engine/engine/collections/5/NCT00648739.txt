      or MM. The study was planned to be conducted in 2 parts: Part A and Part B. Both parts were
      to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), and efficacy (to the extent
      possible) of samalizumab in the target participant population. Part A was designed as the
      open-label, intravenous (IV) single dose-escalation portion of the study to determine the MTD
      and to assess the overall safety of different dose levels of up to 4 IV doses of samalizumab
      in participants with either refractory or relapsing B-CLL or MM. Initially, at least 3
      participants would be enrolled into a cohort until a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) was
      reached. If any 1 of the initial 3 participants in the cohort experienced a DLT, the cohort
      would be expanded to at least 6 participants.

      After determination of the MTD in Part A, the Sponsor was to review the safety, PK, and
      relevant PD data to determine the dosing administration schedule for Part B. However, no
      participants were enrolled for Part B, as the study was terminated by the Sponsor for
      administrative reasons.

      Participant enrollment in Cohort 7 (600 milligrams per square meter [mg/m^2] dose level),
      Part A, was halted after enrollment of the first participant. The study was terminated by the
      Sponsor for administrative reasons and not due to any safety concerns. Participants who were
      on study at the time of study termination were allowed to continue until the expiry date of
      the drug lot being used and then were followed for 30 (Â±1) days per protocol. The study was
      terminated by the Sponsor at that time. Part B of the study was not conducted.
