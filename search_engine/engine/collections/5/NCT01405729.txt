      treatment for recurrent patellar instability, There has been some concern in the literature
      about the accuracy of femoral tunnel placement and the effect that it might have on patient
      outcomes.

      The investigators evaluated the accuracy of MPFL placement using an intraopetative
      fluoroscopy technique and to assess subsequent patient outcomes.

      All patients undergoing MPFL reconstruction using an intraoperative fluoroscopically guided
      technique between 2005 and 2010 were identified. A retrospective review of their charts and
      radiographs were performed and the subjects were brought back for a follow up exam,
      radiographic series, and Kujala questionaire.
