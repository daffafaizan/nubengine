      the Noddle switch to enable the patients to access the nurse call system and a speech
      generating device. Patients who cannot access the standard nurse call and who may not be able
      to speak due to mechanical ventilation will be recruited to the study and provided the
      opportunity to use the Noddle switch as long as they want while they are hospitalized at
      UIHC. Prior to their discharge or when they no longer need or want to use the Noddle switch,
      they along with their nurses and family members (if present) will be asked to complete a
      survey to assess their ability to effectively communicate. The data from the study
      participants will be compared to data from two groups of patients from a previous study who
      were either able to or unable to access the nurse call system and communicate with
      caregivers.
