      marrow derived stem cells into the somniferous tubules or interstitial spaces of male testis
      with Azospermia. Sixty men with Azoospermia will be recruited in this study after a written
      informed consent.

      The diagnosis of Azoospermia will be established on the basis of two semen analysis
      evaluations done at separate occasions; this will be followed by detailed history taking,
      physical examination and investigations. History taking will include general health, sexual
      health, past fertility, libido, sexual activity and previous exposure to surgery, drugs,
      mumps infection and irradiation. Physical examination includes genital and local examination
      for detection of signs of Klinefelter syndrome, testicular atrophy, absence of vas.
      Investigations include serum FSH, LH, karyotyping and testosterone levels, and may include
      testicular biopsy or transrectal ultrasound if indicated (Low levels of LH and FSH with low
      or normal testosterone levels are indicative of pretesticular problems, while high levels of
      gonadotropins indicate testicular problems. However, often this distinction is not clear and
      the differentiation between obstructive versus non-obstructive Azoospermia may require a
      testicular biopsy).

      Subjects will be enrolled based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and evaluated at
      regular post transplant intervals. Human adult bone marrow derived stem cells will be
      transplanted by an andrological surgeon through a standard surgical approach. Subjects will
      be monitored frequently for a total of one year after adult bone marrow stem cells cell
      injection. For safety of participants, Bone Marrow Stem cells will be injected in one testis
      only and the other testis will be spared.
