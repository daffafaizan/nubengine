      produced by an oral ibuprofen pharmacological treatment and the lack of treatment in subjects
      diagnosed with carpal tunnel syndrome. Effects over the functionality of the affected upper
      limb will be evaluated and compared. Subjects will be invited to participate and randomly
      allocated to 2 different groups.
