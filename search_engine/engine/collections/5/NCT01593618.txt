    
      Individuals randomly assigned to the control group will receive standard of care for the
      duration of their participation. This means they will continue to receive information
      regarding their diagnosis, treatments and ongoing health needs from their provider (no access
      to website).

      Individuals randomly assigned to the treatment group will receive access to UMFollowUp, a
      secure, HIPAA-compliant website.

      All participants will be asked to complete paper-and-pencil surveys at baseline and 9 months
      later to determine the impact of the web-based intervention.
