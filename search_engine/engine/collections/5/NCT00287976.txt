    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the biological activity of irinotecan hydrochloride, when given on a prolonged
           schedule, in terms of response rate and rate of early progression, in young patients
           with refractory or recurrent hepatoblastoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of response in patients showing stable disease or an objective
           response (partial or complete response) to this drug.

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           drug.

        -  Determine the rate of resectability in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 8-12. Treatment repeats every 21
      days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo evaluation for tumor resectability after courses 2, 3, or 4. Patients whose
      disease is considered resectable at any of these time points proceed to surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
