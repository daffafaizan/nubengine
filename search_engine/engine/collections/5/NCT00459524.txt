      to complete certain tasks that require the use of your hands, eyes, and ears. The
      neurocognitive testing will take about 30 minutes.

      You will answer some questionnaires about disease symptoms and your quality of life. It will
      take about 30 minutes to complete the questionnaires.

      You will participate in these neurocognitive tests and fill out the questionnaires before you
      begin cancer therapy. Your interval testing will coincide with your clinic visit evaluations,
      which will be approximately at 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. If you do not receive
      therapy, you will be asked to complete the neurocognitive tests at baseline and then again on
      your follow up clinic visit evaluations, which will be approximately at 3 months and at 6
      months. You may be asked to continue your participation in these neurocognitive tests and
      fill out questionnaires approximately every 3 months thereafter.

      This is an investigational study. About 306 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at UTMDACC.
