2701. the role of certain additional factors in the development of amyloidosis,and its prophylaxis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)in patients with chronic fibrocavernoustuberculosis of the lungs, any toxic-aller-gic side reactions to antibacterial therapy,chronic foci or infection and diseaseswith an allergic component can contributeto the development of amyloidosis.  theearly detection and clearing of chronicfoci of infection and effective measuresagainst even mildly pronounced toxic-allergicside reactions are of prime impor-tance in the prevention of amyloidosis.  theunsystematic and prolonged administra-tion of antibacterial preparations, along withtheir toxic side effects, tends to in-crease the incidence of amyloidosis in patientswith chronic fibrocavernous pulmon-ary tb.  individual constitutional factors areof great importance in the developmentof side effects.  side reactions to chemopreparations,in cases of hypofunction ofthe liver and kidneys and autonomicdysfunction promote the development of dys-trophic processes, as is confirmedby the high frequency of toxic-allergic reac-tions in patients with fibrocavernouspulmonary tb who later develop amyloidosis.the administration of desensitizing drugsto patients showing side reactions there-fore helps to prevent amyloidosis in casesof chronic fibrocavernous tb, and chemo-therapy should be automatically combinedwith the administration of desensitizingand stimulatory drugs in this class of case.
