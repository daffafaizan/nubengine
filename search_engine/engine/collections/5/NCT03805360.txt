      significant risk in terms of patient morbidity and mortality. Pulmonary complications
      resulting from these injuries include severe atelectasis with hypoxemia, pneumonia, pleural
      effusions, respiratory distress syndrome, need for mechanical ventilation and ICU admission,
      and prolonged hospital stay. Many institutions have tried to develop protocols to risk
      stratify and appropriately treat these patients, with the goal of predicting those with
      higher likelihood of pulmonary complications in order to minimize additional morbidity.
      Studies have demonstrated critical spirometry values which correlate to worse patient
      outcomes; specifically, vital capacity less than 50% predicted, or less than 2L.
      Subsequently, there have been numerous attempts to identify the best treatment interventions
      for these high risk patients. In addition to multi-modal pain management, the most commonly
      used procedures include thoracic epidurals, continuous or single shot paravertebral blocks,
      and intercostal blocks. However, all of the above interventions carry significant risk, and
      the frequent use lovenox thromboprophylaxis drastically limit their use. Recently, a novel
      peripheral nerve block technique has been developed, an erector spinae plane block (ESP),
      which may provide similar or greater efficacy to the above, with significantly less risk to
      the patient.
