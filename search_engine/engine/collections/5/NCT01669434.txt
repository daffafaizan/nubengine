      converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is necessary prior to non-cardiac, non-vascular surgery.
      ACEIs have been associated with intraoperative hypotension during vascular and cardiac
      surgeries. Patients presenting to the University of Nebraska Medical Center Pre-Anesthesia
      Screening (PAS) Clinic who are on chronic ACEI therapy will be eligible for enrollment.
      Subjects will be randomized to either omit or continue their ACEI preoperatively. The outcome
      of interest is intraoperative hypotension defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 80
      mmHg. Blood pressure will be followed not only throughout surgery, but also during recovery
      and the remainder of hospitalization. Renal function will be assessed with creatinine
      measurements in the PAS clinic and on the first postoperative day. No follow-up is planned
      beyond discharge from the hospital.
