      tonsillectomy. Once the decision to proceed with tonsillectomy is made, the patient will be
      given the information on the study, provided time to review the information and interested
      patients will be consented.

      There will be two stages in the study. The first will be the operative stage, which includes
      the injection during the operation. The second stage is the patient participation stage.
      During this stage, the patient records the amount of oral pain medication usage, oral intake
      after their procedure, in addition to their pain scores. These scores are recorded and
      brought back (or mailed in) to the clinic for collection during the follow up visit,
      approximately 1 month later (patients will keep records for two weeks). The patients will be
      freed from participation in the study after the one month visit.
