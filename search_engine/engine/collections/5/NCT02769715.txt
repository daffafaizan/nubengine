      were asked to participate in the study. Patients were treated by undergraduate students under
      the supervision of expert prosthodontists. Both the dentists treating the case and the
      patients were blinded to the type of RPD used. The Principal investigator was responsible for
      preparing the laboratory prescriptions and sending the final impressions to the dental lab in
      order to assure blinding of the patient and the treating dentists.

      Patients were treated according to standardized clinical procedures. Both dentures were
      fabricated from one master cast to ensure standardization. The cast was scanned digitally to
      fabricate the laser-sintered dentures, and then was used to fabricate the cast dentures
      traditionally using lost-wax casting technique. For each patient, two dentures were
      fabricated from one final impression; one by casting technique and the other by
      laser-sintering. Patients were given randomly one denture first and followed-up for 1, 2 and
      4 weeks. Then, they were given the second denture and followed-up again. At each follow-up
      visit, patients filled McGill Denture Satisfaction Instrument. At the end of the study
      patients were asked which denture they prefer to keep.
