      right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD) is a familial hetergenous clinical and molecular disease
      characterized by dilatation and dysfunction of the right ventricle and ventricular
      arrhythmias. The ventricular arrhythmias are heart rate and catecholamine dependent. Not
      infrequently, there is involvement of the left ventricle. The diagnosis of ARVC is critical
      as therapy including implantable defibrillators may prevent sudden death. However,
      identification of affected family members remains a major challenge due to limitation of
      current imaging and diagnostic techniques. We propose (1) to establish the sensitivity and
      specificity of the isoproterenol challenge test for ARVC by testing both patients with known
      ARVC and healthy volunteers; (2) to estimate the proportion of family members who present
      with incomplete criteria for ARVC but are subsequently diagnosed with the condition by an
      isoproterenol challenge test; and, (3) to study the inheritance of ARVC and the potential
      role of occult infection in its development.
