      disease extent and timing of therapy, making early diagnosis crucial. Mortality in the
      pre-antiviral era was 90% for disseminated disease and 50% for central nervous system (CNS)
      disease. Institution of high-dose (60 mg/kg/day) antiviral therapy with acyclovir has reduced
      mortality to 31% for disseminated disease and 6% for CNS disease.1 Although acyclovir has
      reduced mortality dramatically, morbidity remains high.

      Study population: Infants < 45 days postnatal age, suspected to have a systemic infection
      divided into groups by gestational and postnatal age:

      Group-1: 23-29 weeks gestational age, <14 days postnatal age Group-2: 23-29 weeks gestational
      age, 14-44 days postnatal age Group-3: 30-34 weeks gestational age, <45 days postnatal age

      Intravenous acyclovir will be administered for 3 days.

      Timing of PK sample collection will be with respect to the end of each IV infusion. Timed PK
      sampling will be drawn at doses 1, and doses 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.

      Dose 1:

      0-15 minutes after completion of the 1st dose; Within 30 minutes prior to administration of
      2nd dose

      Steady state [doses 5 or 6 (groups 1 and 2), doses 8 or 9 (group 3)]:

      Within 30 minutes prior to dose; 0-15 minutes after completion of the dose; 2-3 hours after
      completion of the dose; Within 30 minutes prior to administration of the next dose

      Last dose:

      6-7 hours after the last dose (groups 1 and 2)and 10-11 hours after the last dose (group 3)
