      racial/ethnic minority populations. This will advance research being conducted at EMIC by
      providing "controls" or comparisons to differentiate between images from patients with cancer
      versus healthy people of the same racial/ethnic ancestry. In addition, blood samples from
      participants to this study will be utilized for quantitative, genetics-based estimates of
      ancestry (e.g., African, Chinese, Colombian, Western European, Mexican, Vietnamese, etc.),
      which is especially valuable in the case of admixed individuals.
