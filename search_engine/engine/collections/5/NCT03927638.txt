      to acute bouts of computer work while sitting and standing. Cardiovascular measurements were
      made using continuous non-invasive blood pressure monitoring and metabolic measurements were
      made using indirect calorimetry. Subjects will be grouped and analyzed based upon the weight
      status of the subject. All subjects will complete a seated condition and a standing condition
      in a counterbalanced manner. Investigators hypothesize that metabolic and cardiovascular
      responses will be elevated in the standing condition compared to sitting.
