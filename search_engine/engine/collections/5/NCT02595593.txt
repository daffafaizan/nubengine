      rib trauma: those who have their ribs plated versus those who are managed by modern critical
      care and pain control. A study nurse (project) coordinator will identify subjects based on
      inclusion and exclusion criteria, then obtain consent for each of these patients prior to
      randomization. Randomization will be decided by a web-based computer program, accessible to
      the project coordinator. Although this randomization occurs, the study itself is purely
      observational, as the intervention is currently standard of care. None of the subjects or
      study group members will be blinded since it is not possible to disguise the intervention.
      Patients will be evaluated and a survey will be administered at set post-intervention
      intervals to determine endpoints and quality of life when data analysis will also take place.
