      Primary:

      To determine the activity of bevacizumab in patients with epithelial ovarian, primary
      peritoneal serous, papillary serous endometrial or fallopian tube cancer who relapse after
      achieving an initial complete response to first-line therapy that included at least 6 month
      bevacizumab maintenance as defined by: 1) clinical response rate OR 2) clinical benefit
      response

      Secondary:

        -  To assess duration of progression free survival (PFS)

        -  To assess the safety

        -  To correlate response with the Avastin-free interval

      STATISTICAL DESIGN:

      This study used a two-stage design to evaluate efficacy of bevacizumab based on a patient
      achieving either clinical response or clinical benefit response. The null and alternative
      response rates were 10% and 30%. If two or more patients enrolled in the stage one cohort
      (n=10 patients) achieved response than accrual would proceed to stage two (n=19 patients). If
      response was achieved by at least 6 patients in the final set of 29 evaluable patients then
      bevacizumab would be deemed worthy for further study. This design had 80% power given
      one-sided 0.05 significance level.
