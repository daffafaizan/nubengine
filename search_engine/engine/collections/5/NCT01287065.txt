      study in patients with persistent bronchial asthma to compare the effect of AM and PM dosing
      with fluticasone furoate (FF)/Vilanterol (VI) inhalation powder(100/25mcg) on lung function.
      Twenty-four male and female patients will be enrolled in this study to ensure twenty
      evaluable subjects. After the screening there will be a run-in period of 14 days prior to
      first dose. Subjects will be dosed for 14 days (Â± 2 days) in each of the 3 treatment periods,
      with serial forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) measurements taken over a 24 hour
      period following the Day 14 PM dose in order to determine FEV1 weighted mean (0-24 hours).
      Peak expiratory flow (PEF) will also be monitored throughout the study, from the start of the
      run-in period until the end of the third treatment period. Between treatment periods there
      will be a washout period of 14-21 days. Safety assessments will include vital signs,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), adverse event (AE) monitoring and laboratory safety tests,
      however, with the exception of AEs these will not constitute study endpoints. The results of
      the study will provide supporting information to understand the implications of time of day
      of dosing on the therapeutic response to the FF/VI Inhalation Powder.
