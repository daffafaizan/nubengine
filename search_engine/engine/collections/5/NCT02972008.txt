      aortic stenosis referred for a TAVI procedure to the cardiology departments of the university
      hospitals of Lille, Caen, Amiens and the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital (APHP) are analyzed for
      inclusion in this prospective study. The cases are selected after a discussion between the
      members of the local TAVI "Heart Team" (cardiologists, cardiac surgeons, anesthetists), as
      recommended by the guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology. Written consent is
      obtained in accordance with international recommendations for clinical research (Helsinki
      Declaration). Participation in the study is proposed to patients during preoperative
      consultation.

      The collection of clinical data, including postoperative cerebral MRI, is collected
      prospectively during hospitalization and during the clinical visit to each institution at one
      year. An evaluation of cognitive function is performed by a mini-mental state (MMS) the day
      before the TAVI intervention and then at 1 year. The study ends after the last evaluation. A
      cerebral MRI is performed within 1-3 days after the TAVI procedure to detect new cerebral
      ischemic lesions (emboli).

      Blood samples will be taken during the patient's stay: the day before TAVI, during the
      procedure and after the TAVI procedure at day 1 and day 4.

      The follow-up visit to 1 year will be conducted by cardiologists or cardiac surgeons with an
      evaluation of the cognitive function by the mini-mental state (MMS).
