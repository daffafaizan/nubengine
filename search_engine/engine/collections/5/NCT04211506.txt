      sleep conditions. Subjects will be randomly assigned to each condition group. During their
      time in the laboratory, biological samples (e.g., blood) will be collected for genetic and
      other analyses, and sleep quantity and quality will be monitored. Additionally responses on
      neurobehavioral tests and surveys will be monitored for differences among the groups.
