    
      The Study Drugs:

      Everolimus is designed to stop cancer cells from multiplying. It may also stop the growth of
      new blood vessels that help tumor growth, which may cause the tumor cells to die.

      Letrozole is designed to block chemical pathways that are necessary for tumor growth.

      Study Drug Administration:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take 2 pills of
      everolimus by mouth 1 time every day. You should not open everolimus until you are about to
      take it because it absorbs moisture and is sensitive to light. You will also take 1 pill of
      letrozole by mouth 1 time every day. You should take letrozole at the same time as
      everolimus.

      Everolimus should be taken the same time every day on an empty stomach (fasting state) or
      after no more than a light, fat-free meal. You should wait at least 6 hours after a eating a
      regular (not fat-free meal) before taking everolimus. You should not eat fatty foods for at
      least 1 hour after taking everolimus.

      If you cannot swallow the tablets, the tablets should be dissolved in a glass of about 2
      tablespoons of water just before being taken. The tablets should then be stirred gently (for
      a maximum of 7 minutes) until the tablets are dissolved. The contents should then be drunk.
      If you vomit after taking the study drug, you should not take another tablet that day. If you
      forgot to take the drug one day, you should not take an extra dose the next day but instead
      contact your doctor for advice.

      You will be given a diary where you will record the pills you take each day. You must bring
      this diary to each visit.

      While you are on study, you should avoid grapefruit, grapefruit juice, and other products
      containing grapefruit. There are also certain drugs you cannot take during this study. You
      should not take any drugs during the study without asking the study doctor first.

      Study Visits:

      Every 4 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs
           (blood pressure, heart rate, breathing rate, and temperature).

        -  Your performance status will be recorded.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, including checking your
           liver and kidneys and measuring the levels of sugar in your blood, and levels of fat in
           your blood.

        -  You will asked about any side effects you have experienced.

        -  If the disease is in the pelvis, you will have a pelvic exam.

        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for hepatitis
           testing.

        -  Your pills will be counted.

      At Week 8, the following tests and procedures will be performed:

        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam.

        -  You will have a CT and/or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other areas will
           be scanned if the doctor thinks it is needed.

        -  Any tumors will be measured. The doctor will either feel the tumor or a CT, x-ray,
           and/or MRI will be used.

        -  If the disease is in your chest, you will have chest CT and/or MRI scan to check the
           status of the disease.

        -  You will asked about any side effects you have experienced.

      After the Week 8 Visit, you will have the following tests and procedures. (If the disease has
      partially or completely responded to the study drugs, these tests will be done around Week
      12. If the disease is stable, these tests will be done around Week 16.)

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  You will have a CT and/or MRI scan of your chest, abdomen, and pelvis. Other areas will
           be scanned if the doctor thinks it is needed.

        -  Any tumors will be measured. The doctor will either feel the tumor or a CT scan, x-ray,
           and/or MRI will be used.

        -  If the disease is in your chest, you will have a chest CT and/or MRI scan to check the
           status of the disease.

      After the Week 12 or 16 visit, every 12 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be
      performed:

        -  You will have a pelvic exam.

      This is an investigational study. Everolimus is not FDA approved or commercially available.
      At this time, everolimus is only being used in research. Letrozole is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the treatment of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The combination
      of everolimus and letrozole in this study for the treatment of endometrial cancer is also
      investigational. Up to 42 patients will take part in the multicenter study. Up to 42 will be
      enrolled at MD Anderson.
