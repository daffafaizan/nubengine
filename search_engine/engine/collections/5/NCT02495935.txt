      refractive error with glasses and in the absence of any ophthalmoscopically visible lesion of
      the retina, especially of the macular region. Amblyopia is associated with histologic and
      electrophysiologic abnormalities in the visual pathways.

      Transcorneal electrical stimulation (TES), through neural stimulation, works by
      non-invasively stimulating the retina via passage of electrical current directly to the
      retina, bypassing the usual light activation pathway, resulting in the activation of the same
      areas of the brain as would be activated with a light stimulus alone. Electrical stimulation
      with TES has shown potential in recent reports as an efficacious treatment modality to
      improve visual function.

      The success of electrical stimulation in neurodegenerative disorders provides a reasonable
      rationale and significant precedent to investigate its potential for use in disorders of the
      visual processing system, which functions via an integration of biochemical and electrical
      interactions transmitted from the retina.
