        -  Determine the response, time to progression, disease free survival, and overall survival
           of patients with recurrent and/or metastatic cancer of the cervix treated with a
           combination of topotecan and paclitaxel.

        -  Determine the feasibility and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30
      minutes on days 1-5. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered on days 6-14. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
