      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with palbociclib with advanced solid tumors (including central
      nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor
      activating genetic alterations in cell cycle genes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with palbociclib
      with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic
      disorders that harbor activating genetic alterations in alterations in cell cycle genes.

      II. To obtain information about the tolerability of palbociclib in children and adolescents
      with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive palbociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 28
      days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
