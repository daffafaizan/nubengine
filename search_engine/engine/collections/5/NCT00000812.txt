      patients with HIV infection and may cause the body to produce more virus. In vitro studies
      have demonstrated that thalidomide reduces TNF-alpha levels and inhibits production of HIV.
      However, more information on the pharmacological and immunological aspects of thalidomide is
      needed.

      Patients are randomized to receive oral thalidomide or matching placebo (3:1) at one of three
      dose levels daily for 8 weeks. All 12 patients at a dose level must receive treatment for at
      least 2 weeks before dose escalation in subsequent patients occurs. The MTD is defined as the
      dose level immediately below that at which 3 or more of 9 patients receiving thalidomide
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for a total of 16 weeks.

      PER 6/20/95 AMENDMENT: Patients in cohort 1 should discontinue the previous 50 mg formulation
      of thalidomide once the new formulation is available. Those patients may either wash out for
      4 weeks and recommence the study or discontinue the study.
