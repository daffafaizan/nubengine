    
      This project is aimed at developing an improved multilevel care process model for the
      management of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) disease activity by implementing systematic
      self-monitoring of flare experiences by RA patients, combined with continuous
      patient-tailored adjustments of treatment modalities by a coordinated team of rheumatology
      health care providers (RHCPs).
