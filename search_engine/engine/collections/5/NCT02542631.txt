      agents (AHAs)) will be randomized 1:1 to either Finesse or pen to initiate bolus insulin
      dosing and followed for a 44-week intervention period. Patients will have both basal and
      bolus doses of insulin adjusted throughout the trial, as is clinically indicated, based on an
      easy to follow insulin dosing algorithm. After the final endpoint evaluation at week 44,
      patients will crossover to the alternate bolus insulin delivery device for 4 weeks and
      complete a patient preference survey at week 48.
