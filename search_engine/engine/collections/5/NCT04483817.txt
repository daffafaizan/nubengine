      urge incontinence, usually with frequency and nocturia in the absence of urinary infection or
      other pathologies. OAB affect considerably the quality of life of the subject who suffer.

      The first line of treatment is a conservative management as behavioral interventions,
      followed by pharmacological management as antimuscarinic or antimuscarinic drugs.

      Percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS) is present as another alternative of treatment.
      Previous studies have shown the positive effects of PTNS in a reduction on OAB symptoms.

      The PTNS was described by Stoller in 1999. It's a electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve,
      inserting a 34 gauge needle at a 60º angle, 5 cm cephalad to the malleolus and 1 cm posterior
      of the tibia, to stimulation of the sacral segments S2 and S3, where the spinal centre of
      bladder is located. The parameters used are 20Hz and 200 µs, 12 sessions, two weekly, 30 min
      treatment.

      The PTNS is a minimal invasive technique, but can be utilized surface electrodes instead of
      needle to minimize the discomfort of prick.

      The main aim of this study, is compare the effectiveness of transcutaneous posterior tibial
      nerve stimulation versus percutaneous posterior nerve stimulation in patients with overactive
      bladder.
