    
      The subjects will attend a screening visit (Visit 1) in order to assess their eligibility. If
      found eligible, the subjects will return at Visit 2 within approximately 4 weeks, after Visit
      1, with an up-titration with metformin 1 g BID or the maximal tolerated dosage of metformin
      (Run-in period).

      At Visit 2 patients will be tested for;

        -  Heart function at rest and during an exercise ECG Stress Test with tissue Doppler
           echocardiography

        -  24-hour blood pressure

        -  Anthropometric assessment

        -  Symptoms of dyspnea or fatigue (scoring system, classified as NYHA).

        -  Quality of life (SF 36)

        -  Blood test (venipuncture)

      Subsequently thereafter, subjects will during visit 2 be randomized to receive either
      liraglutide 1.8 mg s.c. (initial dose of 0.6 mg with an up-titration of 0.6 mg every week,
      final dose 1.8 mg QD) or glimepiride 4 mg p.o (initial dose of 2 mg, with an up-titration of
      1 mg every week, final dose 4 mg QD).

      At Visit 2, subjects will be supplied with a glucose meter (Abbot Contour) and instruction on
      use of the device including regular calibration according to the manufacturer's instruction.
      Subjects will be instructed on how to record the results of the self measured plasma glucose
      (SMPG) values in the meter. Subjects will then ask to monitor a 7 point profile glucose curve
      consecutively in three days before visit 3, at visit 4 and at the end of treatment (visit 5).
      SMBG values will be transferred via a computerized system (DiasendÂ®).

      Visit 3. Telephone visit. Self-reporting glucose measurements.

      Visit 4. Telephone visit. Self-reporting glucose measurements.

      At week 18 (Visit 5), subjects will be re-tested for:

        -  Heart function at rest and during an exercise ECG Stress Test with tissue Doppler
           echocardiography

        -  24-hour blood pressure

        -  Anthropometric assessment

        -  Symptoms of dyspnea or fatigue (scoring system, classified as NYHA).

        -  Quality of life (SF 36)

        -  Blood test (venipuncture)
