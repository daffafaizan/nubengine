      increase sustained virological response (SVR) rates in HCV non-responders to a standard
      interferon/ribavirin combination.

      The aim of this study is to determine if the addition of amantadine to PEG-IFN/ribavirin
      enhances SVR.

      This study is a double blind, comparative, prospective multicenter, randomized study.
      Patients are recruited from 23 hepatology centers in France. The protocol was approved by the
      French ethical committee and all patients provided written informed consent. Eligible
      subjects are randomly assigned to the two treatment groups in equal proportions. The
      randomization process is generated by the Department of Biostatistics, Hospices Civils de
      Lyon, Lyon, France.

      Main inclusion criteria are: elevated ALT, detectable HCV RNA, Metavir score over or equal to
      A1F1 and below or equal to F3. Patients received PEG-IFN 1.5Âµg/kg/week, ribavirin
      800-1200mg/day and amantadine 200mg/day or placebo during 48 weeks.

      The primary endpoint is a sustained virological response, defined as an undetectable HCV-RNA
      24 weeks after treatment discontinuation (week 72). Secondary endpoints are the biochemical
      response at week 72 defined as ALT normalization; histological benefit; tolerance; and
      virological and biochemical responses during therapy at weeks 12, 24 and 48.
