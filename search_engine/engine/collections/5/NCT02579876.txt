    
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial to study the efficacy and safety
      of Viaskin® Milk, an allergen extract of milk administered epicutaneously using the Viaskin®
      epicutaneous delivery system (EPIT) in subjects from 4 to 17 years old with a milk induced
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis. Subjects will be randomized in a 3:1 ratio into two different
      treatment groups, to receive EPIT with Viaskin® Milk (500 µg of milk proteins) or placebo.

      Subjects who complete the double-blind treatment period (approximately 11 months), will
      automatically rollover into an open label treatment period (additional 11 months). All
      subjects will receive the 500 µg (micrograms) Viaskin Milk patch.
