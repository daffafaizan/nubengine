      training + aerobic training intervention, vs. either alone or none to improve cognitive
      function in older adults with cognitive impairment. The investigators will also obtain
      estimates of effect sizes (and confidence intervals) on cognitive function. Preliminary
      analyses will be conducted to explore the mediating role of changes in aerobic capacity,
      physical activity, vascular risk factors, and mindfulness skills. Assessments will be
      conducted at baseline, 3-, and 6- months since baseline.
