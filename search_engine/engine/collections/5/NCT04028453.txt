      first trimester, are associated to common chromosomal abnormalities. It's therefore necessary
      to make amniocentesis and to analyze karyotyping and Genomic microarrays, also known as
      chromosomal microarrays (CMA). In euploid foetus, increased NT is also associated with
      structural defects or genetic syndromes. Additionally, the overall long-term growth of
      euploid children with increased NT is not much known. The majority (98%) of euploid children
      with a normal second trimester ultrasound is apparently healthy in the short run. The
      investigator's objective is to evaluate in a retrospective way, different events (structural
      defects, chromosomal or genetic abnormalities) during these pregnancies. In a prospective
      way, the neurodevelopmental disorders in euploid children will be investigated.
