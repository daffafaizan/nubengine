      undergo a thorough physical examination. Routine admission lab tests (including a 2-h 75g
      OGTT) and body composition measurements will be obtained. A standardized dinner will be
      served at ~ 6PM. The next (Day 2) after an overnight fast, IV lines will be placed (arms will
      be wrapped with a heating blanket and kept at 70ºF to arterialize venous blood).

      The following studies will be performed.

      Thirty-two healthy volunteers will undergo euglycemic - hyperinsulinemic clamping without
      radioactive isotopes and with (n=16) and without (n=16) lipid/heparin co-infusion for 8
      hours.

      Serial (at 0, 1, 2 and 4 h) muscle and fat biopsies and serial blood samples (q' 1 h) will be
      obtained. The following measurements will be obtained in muscle biopsies and T-cell extracts:
      PKC-βI and II and PKC-δ, IKK, IκB-α, NFκB, IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation, IRS-1 associated
      PI3- kinase, ICAM, VCAM and e-selectin mRNAs.
