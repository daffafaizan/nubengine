      with non-severe acute hemoptysis of mild-to-moderate abundance, related to a systemic
      bronchial or non-bronchial hypervascularization, and comparing the bronchial artery
      embolization combined with medical measures and the medical measures alone in this field.

      The primary aim of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of BAE combined with medical
      measures in the treatment of non-severe acute hemoptysis of mild-to-moderate abundance, as
      compared with that of medical measures alone, by assessing the percentage of recurrence of
      hemoptysis at one month. Bleeding recurrence is defined as a volume of blood expectorated of
      at least 50 ml.

      The second objectives of the study are to compare the efficacy of the two strategies at 3
      months and to assess the safety of both strategies during hospitalization and follow-up.

      Based on a previous study of our group (Reference 8), the number of patients in each group is
      105, assuming a one-month bleeding recurrence rate of 11% in the group receiving BAE, as
      compared with 26% in the group assisted medically (a=.05; Î²=0.8).
