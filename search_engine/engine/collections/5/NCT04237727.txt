      patients. The study has been preceded by a trial period in an effort to solve any logistic
      and technical problems.

      The study will be a prospective descriptive multicenter study where measurement of
      ventilation data will be sampled during CPR by EMS treating patients with OHCA. Any results
      from standard laboratory tests related to ventilation quality will be retracted from the
      patient medical journal systems. In addition to ventilatory variables measured as endpoints,
      secondary endpoints will also be outcome measures as any ROSC, survival and neurological
      outcome (mRS, GOS-E) measured at 30 days and at 6 months.
