    
      This trial is designed to study the efficacy and safety of a novel oral platinum analog,
      satraplatin, in combination with another chemotherapy drug, paclitaxel, for the first line of
      treatment (patients who have not received chemotherapy for disease that has metastasized) of
      patients with advanced NSCLC.

      WHAT IS SATRAPLATIN:

      Satraplatin is a member of the platinum-based class of chemotherapy drugs. Platinum-based
      drugs have been clinically proven to be one of the most effective classes of anticancer
      therapies. Unlike the currently marketed platinum-based drugs, satraplatin can be given
      orally.
