      surface antigen or e antigen seroconversion and anti-tumor occurrence in chronic hepatitis b
      patients. We design this study to compare the effectiveness and safety between the
      combination therapy of TDF and peg-IFN with TDF alone in NAs experienced patients with HBV
      related liver fibrosis. Especially the improvement of liver fibrosis and the occurrence of
      long-term end-stage liver disease such as cirrhosis, liver cancer, etc.

      Main purpose: Comparing the improvement rate of liver fibrosis. Secondary purpose: Comparing
      the incidence of adverse events. Comparing the incidence of cirrhosis, hepatocellular
      carcinoma, and liver failure.

      Comparing the rates of HBsAg and HBeAg serological conversion.
