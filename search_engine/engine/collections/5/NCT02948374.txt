      dysfunction, and may develop impaired cognitive function 3 and 12 months following their ICU
      stay.

      In this study the aim is to try to elucidate the pathophysiology behind delirium in the ICU
      comparing patients with and without delirium and possible development of cognitive
      dysfunction in ICU survivors. Neuroinflammatory markers and markers of structural damage in
      cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) will be analysed in patients with and without delirium assessed
      with the CAM-ICU (Confusion Assessment Method) test in the ICU. CSF samples will also be
      taken in ICU-survivors, 3 and 12 months after the ICU-stay. For comparison CSF will be
      obtained in healthy age- and sexmatched controls undergoing surgery in spinal anesthesia.
