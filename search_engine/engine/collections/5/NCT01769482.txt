      and lessening ischemia in women with microvascular angina, perfusion defect in cardiac MRI,
      and normal coronary arteries.

      The UMPIRE trial is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, placebo controlled trial,
      designed to evaluate the effect of udenafil in improvement of myocardial stress perfusion
      defect in cardiac MRI, in women patients with microvascular angina. A total of 70 patients
      will be randomized to udenafil(100 mg q d) or placebo treatment. The primary end point of the
      study is Change of perfusion defect over 25% of baseline defect in adenosine-stress cardiac
      MRI after 3-month treatment. The secondary endpoints of this study are change of perfusion
      defect less than 25% of baseline defect in adenosine-stress cardiac MRI after 3-month
      treatment, decrement of frequency of chest pain, improvement of ST-depression in stress test,
      improvement of duke score in stress test, improvement of QoL assessment by SF-36
      questionnaire, improvement of sexual dysfunction assessment by BISF-W self-questionnaire and
      improvement of biomarkers foe endothelial function.
