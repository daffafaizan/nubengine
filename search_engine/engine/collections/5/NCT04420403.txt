    
      Neck pain is defined as pain and/or stiffness localized to the dorsal area of the area
      between the condyle of the occiput and the third thoracic vertebra. Chronic neck pain (CNP),
      defined as persistent pain lasting three or more mounts, causes disability and a reduction in
      life quality. Balance disorders or postural instability, a deficit in proprioception, changes
      in muscle recruitment, a decrease in dimension of deep cervical muscle, and an increase in
      stiffness of superficial neck muscle may lead to pain in patients with CNP. Both manual
      therapy and exercise have favorable effects on management with CNP. According to our
      knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of manual therapy plus cervical
      stabilization exercise on balance, proprioception, and neck muscle morphology in CNP, yet.
