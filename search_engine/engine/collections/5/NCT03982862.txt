      hypertrophic scars and keloids might happen to some patients, both of which are often
      pruritic and erythematous. Besides, the markedly elevated tumor-like appearance usually
      brings much concern to patients. Moreover, significant pain or discomfort could happen to
      keloids. Various treatment strategies were mentioned but without a solid solution to all of
      the scars. Investigators hope to evaluate the differences of scar volume, appearance and
      symptoms (itching and pain) in participants receiving simultaneous intralesional injection of
      Botulinum toxin type A and/or steroids. Besides, side effects would also be recorded.
      Investigators hope to establish a more effective intralesional injection therapy for
      participatns suffering from hypertrophic scars and keloids.
