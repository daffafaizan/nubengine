      those with existing chronic disease, shows that insufficient sleep can significantly
      contribute to ill health (including diabetes, heart disease and obesity). These findings have
      also been accompanied by credible explanatory mechanisms emphasising the role of sleep in
      regulating appetite, satiety, glucose and daytime stamina. Sleep extension, therefore, is a
      largely unexplored pathway for improving individual health, and reducing an existing risk of
      diabetes. If successful, increased sleep duration and quality could be adopted as an
      achievable public health intervention.

      The study aims to recruit a total of 20 men, overweight, presenting traditional risks of
      developing diabetes, who are habitually short sleepers. Participants are then randomized,
      stratified by weight status, to a sleep extension group, or a control sleep monitoring group.
      Baseline measures include sleep actigraphy, continuous glucose monitoring, blood pressure,
      and a mixed-meal tolerance test; after the 6-week intervention, the same measures are
      repeated.
