      with a pulse oximeter continuously during 3 nights. In-hospital complications will be
      recorded prospectively in all patients, especially the occurrence of delirium with the CAM
      scale. The hypoxia vs non-hypoxia (more than 20% of the time spent with SpO2<90%) groups will
      be analyzed for clinical characteristics, comorbidities and medication use.

      The statistical association between severe post-operative nocturnal hypoxemia and occurrence
      of delirium will be assessed. The dependance between this association and daytime SpO2 will
      also be assessed. The potential confirmation of an association between post-operative
      nocturnal hypoxemia in patients with HFS and the occurrence of delirium will lead the
      reflection on a clinical trial testing the benefit of oxygen therapy in the prevention of
      post-operative delirium, to improve the medical care of orthogeriatric patients.
