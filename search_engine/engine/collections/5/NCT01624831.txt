      deficits in social cognition (i.e., the cognitive skills needed to successfully navigate
      social interactions). However, to date, there have been few attempts to measure multiple
      components of social cognition within the same population of individuals with psychosis.
      Thus, the interrelationships between various aspects of social cognition remain unclear. In
      the current study, the investigators propose to measure the five domains of social cognition
      identified by NIMH as relevant to individuals with psychosis (i.e., theory of mind,
      attribution style, emotion recognition, social perception, and social knowledge). The
      investigators will also explore the association between different domains of social cognition
      and outcomes relevant to psychotic disorder (e.g., symptomatology, social functioning, and
      vocational functioning).
