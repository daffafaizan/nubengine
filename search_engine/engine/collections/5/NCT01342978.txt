      and their partners or spouses. The study focuses on oropharyngeal cancer patients and
      includes patients with HPV-associated and HPV-unassociated disease. A comparison group of
      people without cancer (controls) are also being enrolled. Couples are followed longitudinally
      and there is a repository of study samples. It is hoped that this research will help us
      understand risk factors for oral HPV infection, persistence and transmission as well as
      researching biomarkers for HPV-associated oral cancer and survival.

      The study is led by Dr Amber D'Souza (Johns Hopkins) and laboratory testing for the study is
      performed in the laboratory of study co-investigator Dr Maura Gillison (Ohio University). The
      study biorepository is led by Dr karen Anderson (Arizona State). Participants are being
      enrolled at four sites across the United States including: Mt Sinai (site PI Dr Marshall
      Posner), Johns Hopkins (site PI Dr Sara Pai), Dana Farber Cancer Institute (site PI Dr Robert
      Haddad) and Oregon Health and Science University (site PI Dr Neil Gross).
