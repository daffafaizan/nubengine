      leukotriene receptor-1 or CysLT1 inhibitor) in very low birth weight (VLBW) infants between
      500 - 1500g birth weight at risk for developing bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Montelukast
      (Singulair) is a FDA approved specific CysLT1 antagonist widely used clinically in the
      prophylaxis of asthma in children older than 12 months of age and blocks leukotriene
      signaling in the lung. BPD shares some pathogenic mechanisms with asthma, however Cysteinyl
      LT receptor blockade has not been studied in preterm infants. Montelukast is metabolized by
      the cytochrome P450 system which is immature in the preterm infant and hence the need for
      this study. The investigators' long-term hypothesis is that inhibition of leukotriene
      signaling in the VLBW preterm lung will decrease inflammation, remodeling and the incidence
      of BPD. The data will be used to design future efficacy trials of Montelukast in the
      prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.
