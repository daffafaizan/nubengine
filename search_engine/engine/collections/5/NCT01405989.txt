      the effect of multiple once daily doses of ketoconazole on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of
      darexaban and metabolites after a single dose of darexaban. In addition, safety and
      tolerability of darexaban administered alone and in combination with ketoconazole, is
      evaluated. Eligible subjects are admitted to the clinical unit in the morning of Day -1. The
      subjects are randomized to receive either first darexaban plus ketaconazole and then
      darexaban alone, or first darexaban alone followed by darexaban plus ketoconazole.
