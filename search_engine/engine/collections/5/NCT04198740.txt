        -  Test and perfect a tear sample analysis technique by mass spectrometry with samples
           collected by Schirmer strips;

        -  Obtain the lacrimal fingerprint for various pathologies of the ocular surface, notably
           different forms of dry eye syndrome, infectious keratitis/conjunctivitis, mucous
           membrane pemphigoid and allergic conjunctivitis, and establish a normative base for each
           of them.

      During regular clinics at the cornea service of the ophthalmology department of the CHUM
      (Centre Hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal), the investigators aim to recruit a few
      hundred patients with various pathologies of the ocular surface, notably different forms of
      dry eye syndrome, infectious keratitis/conjunctivitis, mucous membrane pemphigoid and
      allergic conjunctivitis, and collect a sample of their tears via Schirmer strip. A case
      report form will be completed for each patient, noting known ocular diagnoses and active
      topical ophthalmic medication. Schirmer strips will be sent in sterile tubes to UQAM
      (Université du Québec à Montréal)'s department of chemistry for analysis by mass
      spectrometry.
