      than other groups because of reduced nutritional reserves, prolonged hospital stay and
      increased demands of repeated ill-health. Stroke may compound these problems because of
      physical and mental incapacity, problems with perception and communication, and swallowing
      disorders. The full extent of undernutrition and its independent contribution to stroke
      outcome is not presently known. It is also not known whether it can be corrected, and whether
      doing so would improve the outcome. The aim of this study is therefore to describe the
      efficacy of Intensive Nutritional Supplement in Patient with Stroke.
