      AF-related stroke. Current United Kingdom (UK) guidelines for anticoagulation state that
      "delay for an arbitrary 2-week period is recommended" for "disabling" stroke and that
      anticoagulation can be started "no later than 14 days" for other strokes, at the prescriber's
      discretion.

      OPTIMAS will investigate whether early initiation of DOAC treatment, within 4 days (96hrs) of
      onset, in patients with acute ischaemic stroke and AF is as effective as, or better than,
      standard initiation of DOAC treatment, no sooner than day 7 (>144hrs) and no later than day
      14 (<336hrs) after onset, in preventing recurrent ischaemic stroke, systemic embolism and
      symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage (sICH)? Participants will be randomised 1:1 to the
      intervention or control. The exact timing of initiating treatment within each group is at the
      discretion of the treating clinician.
