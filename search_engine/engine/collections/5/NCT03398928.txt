      standard care as compared to standard care only for the treatment of delirium in hospitalized
      older persons.

      Patients aged 65 and older, hospitalized in the internal medicine departments of Bnai Zion
      Medical Center and diagnosed with delirium or subsyndromal delirium will be randomized to
      either true acupuncture with usual care, or usual care only. Daily treatments and outcomes'
      follow-up will be conducted up to one week from recruitment or until resolution of delirium
      or subsyndromal delirium for 48 hours. The primary outcome will be delirium resolution
      evaluated as time-to-first delirium remission (over 7 days) and the number of days spent
      delirium-free.Side effects will be monitored daily.
