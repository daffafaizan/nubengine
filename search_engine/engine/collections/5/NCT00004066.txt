        -  Evaluate the activity of gemcitabine plus docetaxel administered with filgrastim (G-CSF)
           support, in terms of disease response, in patients with recurrent or persistent
           unresectable leiomyosarcoma or other soft tissue sarcoma.

        -  Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate response with tumor expression of the apoptosis-regulating proteins bax,
           bcl-2, and survivin in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior radiotherapy to the pelvis (yes vs no).

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by docetaxel IV over
      1 hour on day 8 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 9-15. Treatment repeats every 3
      weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients
      with a partial response may receive 2 additional courses of therapy.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 38-82 patients (19-43 with uterine leiomyosarcoma and 19-39
      with other soft tissue sarcoma) will be accrued for this study.
