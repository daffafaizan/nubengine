      care across the world rapidly and radically as increasingly large waves of patients fill
      clinics, hospital wards, and intensive care units (ICUs). Patients with comparable illnesses
      have high rates of persistent psychological distress symptoms including depression, anxiety,
      and PTSD. Currently there are few easily accessible therapies available for this distress in
      this time of deep fear and worry, social distancing, cancelled clinics, isolation and
      quarantine practices, and understaffed hospitals.

      Lift, a novel mobile app-based mindfulness intervention, may be able to address COVID-19
      patients' distress and access to care issues. Lift was piloted successfully in the intensive
      care unit (ICU; R34 AT00819) and is currently in the midst of a multicenter factorial
      experimental clinical trial designed to determine which of 8 versions is optimized for
      symptom relief, cost, and scalability (parent U01 AT009974).

      This 2-arm, parallel group randomized clinical trial seeks to expand the scope of the parent
      U01 project to test the clinical impact of a psychological distress intervention rapidly
      deployed during a pandemic. This trial will include 300 patients who were hospitalized due to
      COVID-19; collect data at 1, 3, and 6 months post-discharge; and address 3 specific aims: (1)
      Compare the clinical impact of Lift vs. usual care control and (2) Compare long-term
      (6-month) outcomes of RCT patients both by treatment arm as well to the entire BLUE CORAL
      cohort, and (3) Explore participant-reported barriers and facilitators to intervention
      deployment, uptake, and engagement in a pandemic.
