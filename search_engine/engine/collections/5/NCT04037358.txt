      contains an oligometastatic state where metastases are limited in number and location. The
      importance of local consolidation of all tumor deposits in oligometastatic disease to
      forestall further metastatic dissemination is now backed by small randomized studies. Our
      previous Baltimore ORIOLE randomized trial of stereotactic ablative radiation (SABR) alone,
      highly focused, high-dose radiation, versus observation in oligometastatic PCa final data
      demonstrate a progression-free survival (PFS) benefit of SABR alone. The patterns of failure
      from our ORIOLE trial in combination with prior data suggest one dominant mode of failure is
      from microscopic disease particularly those with bone-tropic biology. These are important
      early clinical data suggesting the existence of an oligometastatic state and the importance
      of local therapies in the management of these patients. Radiopharmaceutical therapy (RPT)
      approaches have not been applied in the oligometastatic space and thus the opportunity to
      target micrometastatic disease in conjunction with local consolidation of macroscopic disease
      with SABR has the potential to provide a curative paradigm for patients with oligometastatic
      PCa. We introduce the successor trial to ORIOLE called RAVENS that is a phase II randomized
      trial of SABR +/- the bone metastasis seeking RPT Xofigo in men with oligometastatic PCa. We
      hypothesize macroscopic prostate tumors support the growth of and help nurture future distant
      metastases and this process can be impacted most by total, macro- and microscopic, tumor
      consolidation. In addition, we hypothesize that circulating biomarkers can identify men with
      oligometastasis that benefit the most from SABR and RPT.
