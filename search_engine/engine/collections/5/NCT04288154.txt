    
      All subjects in both groups who enroll into this study will undergo an assessment of
      peripheral endothelial function with reactive hyperemia-peripheral arterial tonometry
      (RH-PAT) testing using EndoPAT; an assessment of vital signs including heart rate, blood
      pressure, weight, height and body mass index; laboratory blood work; cardiorespiratory
      testing using treadmill testing to determine VO2 max and maximal tolerated heart rate;
      maximal strength and maximal power testing on chest press and leg press testing; and percent
      body fat and fat distribution testing at baseline, and at 16-weeks follow-up (immediately
      after completing a 16-week training program using whole body-EMS). Baseline cardiovascular
      risk factors will be assessed by subject questionnaire and verified by chart review. In
      addition, subjects will complete an angina/chest pain symptom questionnaire (Rose
      Questionnaire), quality of life questionnaire (LASA Questionnaire), depression questionnaire
      (Patient Health Questionaire-9) and perceived stress questionnaire (Perceived Stress Scale)
      to assess for psychosocial wellness at each point in the study.
