      intratumoral injections of HF10 at 1x10^7 TCID50/mL in combination with intravenous infusions
      of 3mg/kg ipilimumab. This is a single arm, open label Phase II trial, to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of HF10 treatment in combination with administration of the
      immunologic checkpoint inhibitor, ipilimumab (anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibody). The study
      population will include patients with Stage IIIB, IIIC or IV unresectable or metastatic
      malignant melanoma who are ipilimumab-eligible.

      Patients will receive the dose of 1 x 10^7 TCID50/mL HF10 (for a total of 6 injections; the
      first 4 injections at 1-week intervals; the remaining 2 injections at 3-week intervals) +
      ipilimumab at 3 mg/kg ipilimumab (for a total of 4 intravenous infusions, each administered
      at 3-week intervals).

      Following combination therapy, patients may continue to receive the same dose level of HF10
      (1 x 10^7 TCID50/mL) alone for up to an additional 13 injections (total of 19 injections = 1
      year) if they have tolerated the study treatment, are responding, have stable disease, or
      have progressive disease that is not clinically significant in the judgment of the
      Investigator.
