      conducted to identify the pediatric dose providing sugammadex exposure comparable to the next
      oldest age cohort. For Part B participants, the efficacy of sugammadex (i.e. neuromuscular
      recovery / time to extubation) will be assessed. Further, safety analyses will be conducted
      in both Parts A and B. Following completion of Part A, an interim analysis (IA) of the PK and
      safety data will be performed. Once the appropriate doses are confirmed and safety data is
      assessed for the 2 doses of sugammadex, then Part B will commence.
