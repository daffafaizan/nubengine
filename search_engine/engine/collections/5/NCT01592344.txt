    
      Ninety (minimum) up to one hundred twenty-six (126) adult (â‰¥ 22 years) subjects who have
      severe intractable chronic pain of peripheral nerve origin associated with post
      traumatic/post surgical neuralgia persisting for 3 months or longer and an average chronic
      pain level of at least 5 on a 0-10 numeric rating scale, where such pain is attributable to a
      lesion or disease of the somatosensory nervous system, will be recruited from U.S. outpatient
      physical medicine and rehabilitation clinics.

      After screening, subjects who were confirmed to be eligible for the study and provided
      informed consent will have a pain level assessment period for approximately one week then
      come back for the Baseline/Implantation visit. Subjects will be trained on and required to
      complete a patient diary of pain intensity level for at least 7 consecutive days prior to
      baseline. The randomization and programming will take place approximately two weeks after
      implantation. Subjects in the treatment group will receive electrical stimulation and pain
      medication. In contrast, subjects in the parallel control group will receive control
      stimulation and pain medication.

      The plan is to have the parallel portion of the study run for approximately 12 weeks (or 3
      months) after randomization for efficacy analysis. Subjects in the control group will be
      allowed to cross over to the treatment group for nine months of electrical stimulation; the
      subjects in the treatment group will have nine additional months of stimulation treatment
      such that safety data will be collected throughout a full twelve month period on all
      available subjects. While the end of the study is approximately 12 months after
      randomization, as previously stated, the efficacy analyses will be based on the data
      collected at the end of the 3-month follow-up evaluation.
