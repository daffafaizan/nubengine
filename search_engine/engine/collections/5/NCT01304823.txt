      also operate in the gut. It is suggested that open-type enteroendocrine cells directly sense
      nutrient via alpha-gustducin coupled taste receptors to modulate the secretion of glucagon
      like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). Several nutrient responsive G-protein coupled
      receptors have been identified in the human gut, including the sweet taste responsive
      T1R2/T1R3 heterodimer, the amino acid/umami responsive T1R1/T1R3 as well as GPR120 for
      unsaturated long-chain free fatty acids.The functional significance of sweet taste receptors
      in the secretion of GLP-1 and PYY will be determined by intraduodenal perfusion of glucose
      (I) or a mixed liquid meal (II) with or without lactisole (450 ppm) in a double blind, 5-way
      crossover trial including 10 healthy subjects.
