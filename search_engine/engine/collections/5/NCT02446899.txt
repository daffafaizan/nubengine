    
      This is a Phase 3, multicentre, multinational, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an intravenous treatment regimen of anifrolumab
      versus placebo in participants with moderately to severely active, autoantibody-positive
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) while receiving standard of care (SOC) treatment.
      Participants must be taking either 1 or any combination of the following: oral
      corticosteroids (OCS), antimalarial, and/or immunosuppressants. The study will be performed
      in adult participants aged 18 to 70 years of age.

      Approximately 360 participants receiving SOC treatment will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive a fixed intravenous dose of anifrolumab 300 mg or placebo every 4 weeks for a total
      of 13 doses (Week 0 to Week 48), with the primary endpoint evaluated at the Week 52 visit.
      Investigational product will be administered as an intravenous infusion (IV) via an infusion
      pump over a minimum of 30 minutes, every 4 weeks.
