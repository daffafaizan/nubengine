      epithelial overexpression of VEGF, suggesting a potential role for VEGF in ARDS. In addition,
      we found that preventing VEGF from reaching its target receptor(s) by overexpressing a
      soluble form of a VEGF receptor protein prevents edema formation.

      These observations heighten the plausibility of VEGF playing an important role in the
      development of increased pulmonary capillary permeability during acute lung injury.
      Understanding this role VEGF plays in ARDS consequently provides an ideal opportunity to
      discover new therapies for ARDS.
