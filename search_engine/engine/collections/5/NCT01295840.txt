    
      This is a prospective, non-randomised, multi-centre, national, interventional clinical trial
      of a medical device.

      This trial involves two visits: one at the beginning of the study, which will be undertaken
      in the seven days following implant, and another visit at 6 months after enrollment. It is
      recommended that the enrollment visit is undertaken as soon as possible after implantation,
      although the time window allows the timing to be adapted to each centre's standard practice.
      Resynchronization therapy in those patients suitable for participation in this trial is
      expected to begin once this enrollment visit has been completed.

      Once data collection at enrollment visit has been completed, final device programming will be
      based on each investigator's criteria and will be undertaken following the standard practice
      of each centre.
