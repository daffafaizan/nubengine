      whose inflammatory markers were measured at baseline and after 6 weeks of dietary
      intervention. The subjects were monitored in a general practice outpatient setting (GP) and
      nutritional advice was offered remotely via two telephone sessions with a nutritionist. The
      researchers investigated the variation of two specific cytokines, B-cell activating factor
      (BAFF) and platelet-activating factor (PAF), the levels of food-specific IgG and the symptom
      severity, using Irritable Bowel Syndrome - Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS).

      Data monitoring was ensured by an external monitor (Hippocrates Research, Genova, Italy).

      All data entry was in accordance with GCP protocol, and AE were classified using CTCAE 4.0
