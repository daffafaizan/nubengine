      changes in response to additional zinc consumption, as provided by zinc-fortified
      cereal-based complementary foods fed to young children. The following specific steps will be
      completed:

        1. Zinc-fortified complementary foods and breads prepared from zinc-fortified cereal flours
           will be developed with assistance from experts in food technology.

        2. A two-week feeding trial will be implemented to assess the change in plasma zinc
           concentration among young children who receive: a) the zinc-fortified cereal porridge
           and a liquid vitamin preparation between meals; b) a non-zinc-fortified cereal porridge
           and a liquid vitamin preparation between meals [negative control group]; or c) a
           non-zinc-fortified cereal porridge and a zinc-containing liquid vitamin preparation
           between meals [positive control group].
