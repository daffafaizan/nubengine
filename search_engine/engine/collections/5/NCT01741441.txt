      development of combined 24-h esophageal pH and multichannel intraluminal impedance (MII)
      monitoring.

      Combined esophageal MII and pH-monitoring allow for the timed correlation of esophageal pH
      changes with reflux events and achieve high sensitivity for the detection of acid (pH <4),
      weakly acidic (pH 4-7) and weakly alkaline (pH >7) reflux episodes. Use of this technology is
      bringing into focus the potential role of weakly acidic and weakly alkaline reflux in
      symptoms that persist despite acid suppressive therapy or anti-reflux surgery.
