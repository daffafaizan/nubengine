      specialties (such as colon cancer and orthopaedic joint surgeries) for several years in
      hospitals worldwide. The principles of Enhanced Recovery Protocols are those of early
      mobilization and restoration of normal function as soon as possible after surgery. These
      principles are achieved by use of alternate pain control regimens and removing invasive lines
      and drains as soon as possible. The benefits of ERPs are improved patient experience, earlier
      return to normal function and reduced length of stay. Enhanced recovery protocols for cardiac
      surgery have been published by the Enhanced Recovery After Cardiac Surgery Society. These
      protocols have been demonstrated as safe, though have yet to make it into mainstream practice
      in the UK. The use of ERPs in Cardiac Surgery has the potential to greatly improve the
      patient journey and hospital efficiency.

      What? The current study will investigate whether it is possible to utilise ERP bundles in the
      population of cardiac surgery patients at James Cook Hospital, with a view to rolling out a
      full ERP service. Secondary study outcomes will be patient-centred, including; pain scores,
      nausea and vomiting rates and time taken to return to normal function.

      Who? All adult patients over the age of 18 years and listed for cardiac surgery will be
      considered for inclusion in this study.

      Where? The study population will be comprised of patients undergoing cardiac surgery at the
      James Cook University Hospital in Middlesbrough.

      How? Study duration will be 6 months, with 80 patients (comprising a control and intervention
      group)
