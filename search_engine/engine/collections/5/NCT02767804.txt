    
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of X-396 (ensartinib) vs. crizotinib in patients with
      ALK-positive NSCLC that have received up to 1 prior chemotherapy regimen and no prior ALK
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), to obtain additional pharmacokinetic (PK) data from sparse
      PK sampling, to compare the quality of life (QoL) in patients receiving X-396 vs. crizotinib,
      to evaluate the status of exploratory biomarkers and correlate with clinical outcome, and to
      obtain germline DNA samples for possible pharmacogenetic analysis in the event that outliers
      with respect to efficacy, tolerability/safety, or exposure are identified.
