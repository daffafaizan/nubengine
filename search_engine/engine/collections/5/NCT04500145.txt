      prescription dose was 60Gy/2Gy/30f，and in the SIB arm ，60Gy was given to the field of the
      tumor and metastatic lymph nodes，50Gy was given to CR lesion and high-risk prevention. The
      physical advantages of SIB-IMRT are to reduce the radiation dose of organs that are at risk
      in the lungs, esophagus, and heart ensuring the adequate dose for tumor area at the same
      time. The investigators are carrying out this trial to compare the efficacy, safety, side
      effects, and type of failure of the two radiotherapy techniques, which will provide a new
      choice and reliable basis for the future dose-segmentation study of limited-stage small-cell
      lung cancer.
