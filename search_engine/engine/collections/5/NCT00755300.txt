      monitor patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty for thromboembolic events. Video
      recording (without any patient identifiers) of the TEE loops before and after tourniquet
      release, offline analysis to quantify the extent of thromboembolism and the two surgical
      techniques will be compared. Patients are assigned to a particular technique according to
      some non-rigid criteria. This study has no impact on their selection into one group or the
      other. Participation in this study does not influence the choice/selection. We will simply
      record and analyze the echo loops in twenty patients already assigned to each surgical
      technique.
