      completing an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved informed consent process. Baseline
      evaluation included a medical and psychiatric history, structured diagnostic interview using
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM)-IV criteria, mood assessment with the Inventory of
      Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (IDS-SR), Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and
      cognitive assessment with the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Alternate but
      equivalent versions of the RAVLT were used to minimize practice effects with repeated
      administration. Cocaine use was assessed at each biweekly visit with urine drug screens.
      Citicoline or placebo was given beginning at one tablet (500 mg)/day with an increase to two
      tablets (1000 mg/day) at week 2, three tablets (1500 mg/day) at week 4, and four tablets
      (2000 mg/day) at week 6. Doses were decreased, if needed, due to side effects.
