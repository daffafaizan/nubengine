      I. To determine the feasibility of having patients self-administer meditation recordings
      using a portable, computer-based program during a 2-week period.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the effect of self-administered meditation on anxiety, depression and other
      symptoms that are part of the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS) questionnaire.

      II. Evaluate participant satisfaction with the meditation delivery and tracking program.

      III. Examine the association between the frequency of practice (number of sessions a day) and
      choice of length of practice (5, 10, or 15 minute sessions) and anxiety, depression and other
      patient reported outcomes.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I (MEDITATION): Patients watch a pre-recorded instructional meditation video via an
      iPod meditation app. Patients then complete meditation exercises using the meditation app
      over 5-15 minutes once daily (QD) for up to 2 weeks. Patients also complete questionnaires
      before and after meditation sessions and participate in an interview over 10 minutes.

      GROUP II (WAITLIST CONTROL): Patients receive supportive care, such as access to social
      workers, support groups, spiritual care, or other patient services for up to 2 weeks.
      Patients also complete questionnaires over 15-20 minutes and participate in an interview over
      10 minutes.
