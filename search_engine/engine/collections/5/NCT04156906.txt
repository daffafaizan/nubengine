      (SCD). A major problem is the high rate of alloimmunization (antibody formation against
      transfused red cells) that occurs in patients with SCD. Recent studies performed by
      Investigators and others demonstrate RH genetic variants in patients and donors is a major
      risk factor leading to Rh alloimmunization. Anti-D formation in D+ patients occurs
      frequently, and once identified, providing D- cells for all subsequent transfusions can be
      challenging. These anti-D antibodies in D+ patients suggest exposure to different or variant
      D protein on donor cells. Investigators will test whether transfusion of patients with anti-D
      with RHD genotyped matched red cells is feasible, safe and can decrease D- donor unit demand.
