    
      The method includes the use of a national prospective observational cohort, involving 444
      general practitioners From april to december 2014, health data of any adult patient
      consulting a general practitioner and receiving an oral anticoagulant treatment has been
      entered in a database. Each patient received an information for agreement to participate to
      the study (agreement for stastical analysis of their health data during one year follow up).

      In March 2015, half of those patients will be chosen (stratification), using a matched
      stratification process, and will be followed up over one year. Every three months, data
      regarding the occurrence of therapeutics changes, episodes of excessive bleeding, and
      thromboembolic events will be collected by general practitioners.

      The data will be analysed by: - describing the characteristics of patients receiving oral
      anticoagulant treatment; - describing the changes of medications over the year ; - comparing
      the occurrence of episodes of excessive bleeding ; - comparing the occurrence of
      thromboembolic events in patients using VKA versus patients using NOAC.
