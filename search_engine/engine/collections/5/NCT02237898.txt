        1. To develop through a 15-month pilot study, a novel smartphone-based system, Momba
           Smoking, that can be used in further relapse prevention trials for postpartum smokers.

        2. To determine, through a pilot randomized controlled trial, the potential feasibility,
           acceptability, and methodological parameters that are necessary to design a subsequent,
           appropriately powered, randomized controlled trial of the Momba Smoking smartphone-based
           system.

        3. To advance discovery and understanding on the use of technology to translate smoking
           cessation interventions from clinical to community settings through the training of the
           next generation of scientists.
