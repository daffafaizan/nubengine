        -  Quantify the magnitude and distribution of inter- and intrafraction anatomic variations,
           including the temporal stability of the tumor/respiration signal correlation.

        -  Improve the acquisition and reconstruction of 4D CT scan images by advancing the 4D CT
           scan data collection process and evaluating 4D CT scan image reconstruction using
           different respiratory inputs.

        -  Quantify the uncertainty of deformable image-registration algorithms.

        -  Develop and investigate the efficacy of inter- and intrafraction probabilistic
           planning-based 4D image-guided adaptive radiotherapy (IGART) strategies for clinical
           application.

        -  Determine the expected geometric, dosimetric, and radiobiological improvements from the
           4D IGART system.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo insertion of â‰¥ 1 small radio-opaque marker into (or in the vicinity
      of) the primary lesion or suspect lymph nodes via bronchoscopy. X-rays are performed to
      document the position of the markers.

      Patients undergo 4D CT scan before each radiotherapy session and once a week after a
      radiotherapy session. Patients also undergo x-ray imaging before and during radiotherapy,
      optical and internal marker motion recording before and after radiotherapy, and audiovisual
      feedback during radiotherapy.

      Patients undergo image-guided adapted radiotherapy based on these data.
