      registered dietitian or patient self-reports, mucosal healing, assessed by a small bowel
      biopsy or CD serological screening tests showing decreasing levels of antibodies. However,
      none of these methods offer an accurate measure of dietary compliance. A novel method to
      monitor the adherence to the GFD by detection of immune-dominant gluten peptides in human
      faeces or urine using the anti-α -gliadin G12 antibody was described recently in the
      literature. Gluten peptides, in particular peptides equivalent to the immunogenic - α
      -gliadin-33-mer peptide, are resistant to gastrointestinal digestion and that ensures a
      significant amount of the ingested gluten is excreted in faeces. Consequently, recovery of
      detectable amounts of the immunogenic fraction in faeces or urine indicates that gluten has
      passed through the digestive tract, and in the case of urine was absorbed, and, therefore,
      that gluten has been consumed .
