    
      β-Mhyalines is a prospective multicentric non interventional study. One hundred fifty
      pregnant women at risk of premature delivery, in the framework of Hyaline Membrane Disease of
      the neonate, will receive 2 intramuscular injections of Celesten (betamethasone) at 24 hours
      interval. Plasma samples will be collected: 2 in the mother before delivery, one maternal and
      one cord samples at delivery. Concentrations will be measured and analyzed using a population
      approach. A ratio between neonatal and maternal exposure will be calculated to represent
      placental transfer. The effect of covariates (genetic polymorphism for CYP3A4, CYP3A5,
      P-glycoprotein…, and others variables as gestational age, bodyweight at birth, apgar score,
      co-medication, maternal disease) will be tested to explain the variability of placental
      transfer. The relationship between placental transfer and the occurrence and severity of the
      Hyaline Membrane Disease will then be study, in order to target betamethasone maternal
      concentration and thus to optimize the antenatal dose to administer to the mother in the
      framework of Hyaline Membrane Disease.
