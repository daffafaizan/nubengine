    
      The purpose is to assess feasibility of activity monitoring armbands for continuous
      measurement of physical activity level in patents with Myalgic Encephalopathy/ Chronic
      Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS), during 6 months follow-up.

      The investigators will assess which physical activity parameters that best seem to reflect
      the participant's own perception of activity level, such as mean number of steps per 24
      hours.

      The investigators will assess the agreement between continuous activity measurements by
      activity armbands, and self-reported questionnaires for health-related quality of life (SF-36
      ver.2) and for ME/CFS symptoms (DSQ-SF).

      The investigators will assess the agreement between activity monitoring by armbands, and
      previously validated activity monitoring bracelets for 5-7 consecutive days, at baseline, at
      3 months and at 6 months follow-up.
