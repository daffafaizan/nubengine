      rate is still low. PD1/PDL1 inhibitor are widely used to treat various of cancers in China
      now. The neck arterial chemotherapy infusion for advanced HNC, through the "first pass
      effect" of drug treatment, can significantly increase the local drug concentration of the
      tumor, improve the efficacy, and reduce systemic adverse reactions.

      To the investigator's knowledge, no studies have been developed on the survival benefit of
      neck artery infusion of immunotherapeutic agents in patients with advanced HNC. This phase
      III clinical trial was designed to compare the effects of PD1/PDL1 inhibitor via IA and IV on
      the survival benefit of patients with advanced HNC, including ORR, DCR, median survival time,
      and safety.
