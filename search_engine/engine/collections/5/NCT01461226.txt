      proper diet change, for childhood and adolescent obesity on vascular health are poorly
      understood. The overall objective of this research project is to investigate the underlying
      pathophysiological mechanisms that mediate these beneficial effects.

      Particularly, the following aims are set forth:

        1. To establish the effect of a combined lifestyle intervention, i.e. an individualized
           exercise training and caloric restriction program, on vascular function (primary
           endpoint) and structure in a substantial population of obese adolescents.

        2. To characterize causal pathways between obesity and endothelial dysfunction with focus
           on classical risk factors, oxidative and inflammatory stress, metabolic adaptations,
           bone marrow derived progenitor cells, and blood microparticles.

      This research knowledge will be instrumental for risk stratification and clinical management
      aimed to improve endothelial function by limiting damage and reinforcing regenerative
      mechanisms in obese adolescents.
