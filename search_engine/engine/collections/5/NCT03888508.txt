    
      -  Study will be started after obtaining ethical clearance and registration with Clinical
           trials registry of India

        -  Hindi translation of SPCQ-2(Sensory profile caregiver questionnaire 2) by subject expert
           by forward and independent backward translation .

        -  Consecutive children of either sexes between 3-12 years with a clinical diagnosis of
           spastic cerebral palsy will be examined by the investigator and those having sensory
           abnormalities as screened by Sensory profile caregiver questionnaire 2 will be included
           in the study group.

        -  Those children who screen positive for sensory abnormalities fulfilling the inclusion
           criteria would be enrolled in the study after obtaining informed consent from the
           parents or guardian.

        -  Once enrolled children would be randomized into 2 groups , using a computer generated
           random number sequence, an interventional group receiving sensory integration therapy
           along with standard therapy and a group receiving standard therapy alone.

        -  Concealment of the random allocation would be ensured by placing the allocation sequence
           in serially numbered, tamper proof, opaque and sealed envelopes(by a person other than
           primary investigator to ensure blinding and further observation bias)

        -  Post - enrollment - Baseline clinical and demographic data will be recorded along with
           associated co morbidities (maladaptive behavior, sensory deficits and motor problems).

        -  Pre-intervention a baseline motor skill will be obtained using Gross Motor Function
           Measure -88 and behavioral assessment would be done using Child Behaviour Checklist
           within 7 days of starting therapy in both arms (by pediatric neurologist ,child
           psychologist respectively and who is unaware of the randomization and allocation to both
           arms to prevent observer bias).

        -  Pre-intervention investigator would also interact with the parents or the primary care
           giver and record parent's assessment of severity of sensory abnormalities in 5 main
           domains - auditory , visual, tactile, proprioceptive and vestibular senses on a 10 item
           Likert scale and also assess Quality of life using Pediatric Quality of life using
           Pediatric Quality of life scale

        -  All children would be followed at set intervals from initiation of therapy as noted
           below ;

        -  Weekly for 2 weeks then fortnightly for next 10 weeks to ensure proper technique and
           compliance.

        -  At 3 months the blinded outcome assessor and child psychologist will re evaluate the
           enrolled candidate to determine for any change by using Gross Motor Function Measure -88
           , 10 item parent rated Likert scale, Child Behaviour Checklist and Pediatric Quality of
           life as compared to baseline within 7 days of completion of therapy in both arms

      The first visit would be primarily aimed at reinforcing the techniques of therapy and
      clarifying parent's doubts. At 3 month visit child would be evaluated and re-assessed using
      the scores- 10 item Likert scale rated by parents, Gross Motor Function Measure -88 and
      Pediatric Quality of life scale . Parents would be encouraged to bring one random home video
      of child doing activity-based therapy at 2 weeks wherever feasible . The video would be used
      for ,

        -  Assessing the correct technique

        -  Suggesting modifications in the activity schedule if required

        -  Helps in ensuring adherence to technique

      Compliance would be ensured by the

        -  Activity log

        -  Telephonic re-enforcement from the primary investigator weekly
