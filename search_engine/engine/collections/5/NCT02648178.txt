      cigarettes as measured by the degree to which patients succeed in reducing their cigarette
      consumption over the 9 weeks they are supplied with product, along with their consumption of
      e-cigarettes. We will measure past use of e-cigarettes and cigarettes at baseline, 3, 6, 9,
      and 12 weeks. We will also assess the effect of e-cigarette substitution on toxicity by
      measuring expired carbon monoxide and urine NNAL
      (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanol) , a carcinogenic metabolite of cigarette
      smoke.
