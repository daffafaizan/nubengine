      cognitive functioning and sleep in patients with Parkinson's disease and sleep apnea. It is
      designed as a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of CPAP. As a comparison
      group, half the patients will first be randomly assigned to three weeks of shamCPAP, followed
      by three weeks of therapeutic CPAP treatment. Sleep, functional outcome and mood
      questionnaires and a repeatable neuropsychological test battery, chosen to be sensitive to
      the type of changes we expect to find in memory and cognitive function, will be administered
      before the start of treatment, after three weeks, and after six weeks of treatment.
