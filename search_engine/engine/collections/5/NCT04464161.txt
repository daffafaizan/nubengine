      will affect blood markers of nutritional status (albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin,
      electrolytes). All patients 55 years and older who are undergoing lumbar spine surgery at our
      institution by a single surgeon and meet all inclusion criteria will be added to this study.
      Patients will be randomized into one of two arms; the interventional group will be provide
      with daily Ensure protein drinks for two weeks pre-operatively and four weeks
      post-operatively, while the control group will be instructed to continue their current diet
      plans. Four weeks post-operatively, blood markers (serum albumin, pre-albumin, transferrin,
      electrolyes) will be obtained to assess objective differences in nutritional status.
