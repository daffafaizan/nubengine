      be collected from an antecubital vein to assess serum/plasma aliquots of 200 μl each (frozen
      at -80°C until required for quantitation) for evaluation of biochemical parameters (fasting
      glucose, HbA1c, lipid profile, serum creatinine, uric acid, electrolytes, liver function
      enzymes, albumin).

      A mid-stream first urine in the morning sample will be collected into a sterile container. 50
      ml of urine will be immediately transferred into a sterile falcon and centrifugated at 4500
      rpm for 10 min. After removal of the supernatant and addition of 10 ml of PBS or sterile
      physiological solution, the sample will be further centrifugated at 4500 rpm for 10 min. The
      supernatant will be removed and the pellet stored in a falcon at -80°C.

      Genomic DNA will be extracted throw Qiamp DNA mini kit (QIAGEN) and quantified using
      spectrophotometric assay.
