    
      AXER-204 is a human fusion protein that acts as a soluble decoy/trap for the
      myelin-associated inhibitors of axonal growth known as Nogo-A, MAG, and OMgp. AXER-204 and a
      surrogate protein used in early preclinical studies have been found to promote axon growth
      and recovery of function in animal models of spinal cord injury.

      Part 1 of the trial is a multicenter, open-label, single ascending dose study in participants
      with chronic cervical spinal cord injury. Four cohorts of 6 participants each are planned,
      with participants within each cohort expected to receive the same dose of AXER-204.

      Part 2 is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, repeat dose study in
      chronic cervical spinal cord injury participants. Approximately 32 participants will be
      randomized (ratio 1:1) to receive repeated doses of AXER-204 or placebo (a phosphate buffered
      saline formulation). The dose level and dose frequency will be dependent upon outcomes from
      Part 1.
