      typically manifests as a painful burning sensation in the upper abdomen or in the chest.
      Usually it is caused by the regurgitation of gastric acid into the esophagus. The prevalence
      of heartburn is 10-20% worldwide and is increasing. Typically, heartburn symptoms are treated
      with over-the-counter (OTC) medications which may come with side effects.

      Gastro-AD® is a commercially available food supplement produced by fermentation of soy by a
      specific strain of Lactobacillus. There is suggestive evidence, in vivo as well as in vitro
      studies, of the efficacy of fermented soy (Gastro-AD®) for the heartburn symptom relief. The
      aim of the study is to evaluate the effect of a fermented soy on heartburn symptom relief and
      time to onset. It is hypothesized that the consumption of 1-3 g of fermented soy will relieve
      the heartburn symptom severity.
