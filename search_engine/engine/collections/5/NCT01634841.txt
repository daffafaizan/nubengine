      antioxidants and B-vitamins may protect against age related cognitive decline. Small human
      studies have shown beneficial effects of polyphenol rich foods on cognition and age related
      macular degeneration. Walnuts are a rich source of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acid,
      alpha-linolenic acid, antioxidants, polyphenols and other bioactive compounds. A 2-year
      intervention will be conducted with healthy, elderly subjects to investigate the role of
      walnuts in preventing or slowing age related cognitive decline and age related macular
      degeneration.

      350 subjects, age 63 to 79 years, will be recruited at each of 2 sites, Loma Linda University
      in California and Hospital Clinic in Barcelona. Participants will be randomly assigned to one
      of two groups: walnut group (habitual diet with 1 or 2 oz/d walnut supplement) or control
      group (habitual diet only). At baseline and yearly, cardiometabolic risk factors, red blood
      cell membrane fatty acids, urinary polyphenols and biomarkers of inflammation and oxidation
      will be measured. Eye exam, blood pressure and cognitive function tests will be measured at
      the beginning and end of 2 years. At the Barcelona site only, participants will be given a
      brain MRI and carotid ultrasound.

      Descriptive results will be reported as mean plus/minus standard deviation. Primary analysis
      will be carried out on the basis of groups as randomly assigned. Results will be presented as
      appropriate effect sizes with a measure of precision (95% CI). Analysis of covariates gender,
      age, educational status will be conducted.
