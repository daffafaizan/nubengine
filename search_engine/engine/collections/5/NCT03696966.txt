    
      The purpose of this study is to provide evidence for the feasibility of an alternative weight
      control strategy by comparing two diets to see how intermittent calorie restriction compares
      to continuous or daily calorie restriction for weight loss in 35 adults with overweight or
      obesity. These diets will be incorporated into a comprehensive and intensive weight
      management program involving weekly health education meetings, regular diet and physical
      activity tracking, and feedback from a registered dietitian.

      Each intervention includes 3 months of weight loss and 3 months of weight maintenance.

      Group 1: Follow a low-calorie diet every day (1,200 - 1,500 calories daily)

      Group 2: Follow an intermittent very-low calorie diet (500-800 calories). Participants in
      this group will alternate between days of 500-800 calories and days of structured eating
      using healthy eating principles.
