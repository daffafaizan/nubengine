      (better bioavailability and absorption) making a proper antihyperglycemic power without
      increasing the frequency of adverse effects. The drug has been tested in preclinical test
      with animals, in healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes; which showed that it
      has adequate antihyperglycemic effect. Now, its important to compare metformin glycinate and
      metformin hydrochloride for evaluate the relative antihyperglicemic power. In addition, a
      study with a larger number of patients improve the statistical power of the test to
      investigate the effects of these drugs on possible weight loss and lipid profile improve.
      Additionally, it will also explore the relative power of the two medications tested to modify
      inflammatory response mediators and oxidative stress have been associated with the incidence
      of cardiovascular disease in diabetes. This project was designed with the intent to answer
      the next question: What are the efficacy and safety of metformin glycinate dose of 2101.2
      mg/day (equivalent to 1700 mg/day metformin hydrochloride), compared with metformin
      hydrochloride in doses of 1700 mg/day for 12 months of treatment in patients with Type 2
      diabetes.
