      care encounters that include discussions about a patient s body weight. We are particularly
      interested in how encounters impact patients health-related and weight-related attitudes and
      beliefs. Furthermore, this project aims to determine how a physician s approach to the health
      care encounter impacts its outcome.

      The current study is a controlled experiment in which participants will be participate in a
      weight counseling encounter with a virtual reality-based doctor. The virtual doctor will
      present weight etiology information. Participants will fill out a self-report questionnaire
      online, prior to this encounter. They will then come in to the Immersive Virtual Environment
      Testing Area in the NIH Clinical Center for a visit. During this visit, they will engage in
      the interaction with the virtual doctor and then fill out a post-test questionnaire.
      Participants in the main trial will include approximately 222 healthy adult females between
      20-50 years of age who have a BMI of greater than or equal to 25 and are dissatisfied with
      their current weight.
