      and pain impact short forms in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Patients will
      complete assessments at two points: baseline and 6 months post-baseline. The responsiveness
      of six PROMIS static forms (physical function [HAQ, PF-10, 10 and 20 item short forms],
      fatigue, and pain impact) will be evaluated for change over the 6-month period. Physical
      function change scores will be contrasted with established Legacy physical function
      instruments. The test of "responsiveness" is defined as the ability of the instrument to
      detect change after major treatment intensification, self-reported improvement in
      functioning, or positive changes in patient global scores. The order of presentation of forms
      will be randomly assigned to eliminate questionnaire fatigue or other order effects as
      factors. We will also evaluate the test-retest reliability of four PROMIS static forms (HAQ
      and PF-10 physical function, fatigue, and pain impact) in a random subsample of patients at
      1-week post-baseline. In addition, we will evaluate convergent validity of PROMIS measures of
      physical function by comparing self-report with observation of performance of physical
      function tasks in a subsample of patients randomly selected from the local geographic region.
