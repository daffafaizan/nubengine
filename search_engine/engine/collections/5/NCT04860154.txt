      for about 70% of the malignant tumors of the bile duct system. Patients have no obvious
      clinical symptoms in the early stage. After late diagnosis, the effective treatment is
      surgical resection and & or liver transplantation, and chemotherapy is only used as adjuvant
      or palliative treatment. Some types of cholangiocarcinomas, such as hilar
      cholangiocarcinomas, are difficult to achieve radical resection due to their anatomical
      location, early invasions and are prone to recurrence with a poor long-term efficacy after
      surgery. Therefore, the comprehensive treatment of cholangiocarcinoma by multiple means
      urgently needs to be explored. In recent years, photodynamic therapy (PDT), as a new local
      treatment method, has attracted increasing attention.

      This study investigates the bile duct patency and effectiveness of photodynamic therapy
      compare with ordinary ERCP treatment for cholangiocarcinoma including the median survival,
      overall survival, and other indicators of side effects.
