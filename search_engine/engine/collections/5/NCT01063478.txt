      studies with single agent RAD001 as well as phase Ib and II studies of RAD001 in combination
      with other chemotherapeutic and molecular targeted agents, including paclitaxel, gemcitabine,
      and erlotinib among others. More recently, a phase III trial of single agent RAD001 in
      patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who had failed therapy with VEGF tyrosine
      kinase inhibitors was completed. Clinical experience for indications other than oncology
      comes from single dose studies in healthy volunteers, and studies in solid organ transplant
      patients, where RAD001 was administered with other immunosuppressive agents.
