      double-blind placebo-controlled study, followed by a 6-month open-label extension study to
      evaluate the effect of Topiramate on abdominal visceral fat accumulation, a clinical
      surrogate known to be associated with the complications of obesity such as increased
      incidence of Type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, and their associated
      morbidities. Patients will be randomized to receive either daily Topiramate or placebo.
      Effectiveness will be measured by multiple parameters such as abdominal visceral fat
      (assessed by computed tomography), total and subcutaneous abdominal fat, body composition,
      body weight, body mass index, glucose tolerance, lipid profile, blood pressure, Topiramate
      plasma concentration, or 24 hours energy expenditure (selected patients). Safety evaluation
      (adverse events, vital signs, 12-lead ECG, clinical laboratory tests) will be conducted
      throughout the study. The study hypothesis is that Topiramate is effective in reducing
      abdominal visceral fat in male patients and well tolerated. After the initial 12-week
      titration phase, patients will receive either Topiramate (200mg twice daily or the maximum
      dose tolerated) or placebo by mouth for 6-months. Then, patients will receive Topiramate
      (200mg twice daily or the maximum tolerated dose) for 6-months during the open-label phase.
