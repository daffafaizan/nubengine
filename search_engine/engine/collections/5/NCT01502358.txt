      against all four dengue serotypes has never been greater. Currently, several different
      approaches are being taken to develop a protective tetravalent dengue vaccine. These include
      live-attenuated vaccines derived by serial passage in tissue culture, live chimeric vaccines,
      recombinant protein vaccines and DNA vaccines. While live attenuated and live chimeric
      vaccines have shown promise in clinical trials, viral competition with suspected immune
      interference resulting in imbalanced immune responses and reactogenicity with the occurrence
      of dengue like symptoms remains a concern. It is imperative that any candidate vaccine
      produce solid immunity against each of the four dengue virus serotypes. Failure to do so may
      place the recipient of the vaccine at risk for developing severe dengue disease (dengue
      hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome) following exposure to the virus serotype to which
      there was incomplete protective immunity, resulting in antibody dependent enhancement due to
      the presence of non-neutralizing anti-dengue antibodies.
