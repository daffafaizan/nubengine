      has been associated with several problems including graft injury, implant osteolysis, implant
      migration and soft tissue irritation. Implantless ACL surgery offers additional benefits
      involving lower cost, improved graft incorporation and ease of revision surgery. The
      investigators aimed to compare the functional outcome of implantless bone-patellar tendon
      autograft using press-fit fixation technique and hamstring autografts using implant.

      Materials and Methods: A prospective cohort study design was used. Between March 2013 and
      March 2014, 12 patients underwent implantless ACL reconstruction using press-fit femoral
      technique, while 24 patients underwent implant ACL reconstruction. Objective functional
      outcome were measured using rolimeter, and subjective functional outcome were measured
      according to IKDC, Tegner-Lysholm and KOOS.
