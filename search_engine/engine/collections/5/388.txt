2716. y-angiocardiographyrecordings were made, simultaneously withthe y-cardiogram, of a pulmonary an-giogram by means of a collimator placed inthe left scapular region and of carotidangiogram by a collimator centered on the axisof the external auditory canal.  the3 curves yielded very interesting information onthe chronology of the various car-diac cycles.  the pattern of the pulmonary andcarotid y-angiograms was valuablein several pathologic conditions.  it is more logicalto measure the cardiac outputon the carotid curve than on the y-cardiogram,especially if there are shunts.  thepulmonary curve allows rectification of the timeconstant of emptying of the leftcavities of the heart.  as regards chronologicinformation on cardiac cycles, atten-tion is drawn to the fact that in the pulmonarycirculation long and short circuitscan be demonstrated.  the characteristic timescan be measured.  between the timethat the radioactive material appears in the leftcavities and the time that it leavesthe carotid, there is an interval of 3-4 systoles,which represents the time neces-sary for left circular filling.  the validity ofcalculation of the cardiac output withthe stewart-hamilton formula is discussed.this is valid if the collimator coversa small volume of the principal channel.  it remainsto be shown if such a calculationis valid for larger cavities, or for 2 cavities, throughwhich the radioactive materialpasses successively, and which have different c (t)functions as well as for all tissue'seen' by the collimator, some of which are not yetirrigated with the radioactiveblood, while in other areas recirculation has alreadystarted.  these aspects, andtheir application to the pulmonary angiogram, arediscussed in detail.  with theauthors' technique, y-angiogram isespecially valuable, as correc-tion for the time constant of the decrease of the leftpeak is based on the lengtheningof this curve.  this again serves as a basis fordetermining the left ventricularvolume.
