      etoposide and dexamethasone. In vitro data demonstrates potentiation of the killing of
      lymphoma cells when GCS-100 is combined with dexamethasone or etoposide (Linda Baum,
      unpublished data; Finbarr Cotter et al, Annals of Oncology, vol 16, 205, Suppl 5.) GCS-100
      will be administered in increasing doses to define a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in
      combination with these chemotherapeutic agents. When the MTD is defined, the cohort will be
      expanded to characterize the efficacy of this combination.
