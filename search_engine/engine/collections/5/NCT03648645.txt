    
      The objective of this study is to show the interest of self-measurement with teletransmission
      for long-term follow-up of hypertensive pregnant women (at high risk of preeclampsia) by
      avoiding repeated, prolonged visits or hospitalizations and to optimize the intervention of
      health professionals by providing them with reliable data.

      A multicenter, randomized, controlled study will be conducted in women presenting with mild
      to moderate hypertension without preeclampsia followed throughout their pregnancy by either
      self-measurement with teletransmission or by conventional follow-up in hospital consultation.
