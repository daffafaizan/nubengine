      cocaine treatment trials, one of the principal outcome measures will be time to cocaine
      relapse. We hypothesize that maintenance on PROG will increase the time to cocaine relapse
      compared to maintenance on placebo (PBO). Another cocaine-related efficacy endpoint will be
      the proportion of patients who achieve at least 2 consecutive weeks of cocaine abstinence
      (based on urine toxicology results) during the double-blind treatment phase. Lastly, the
      proportion of cocaine-negative urines collected throughout the treatment trial will be
      measured. We hypothesize that women in the PROG group will show a greater reduction in
      cocaine use compared to those in the PBO group.

      Secondary Aims: 1) Determine if response to laboratory stressors will predict treatment
      outcome. We hypothesize that those women with the greatest stress response will do worse in
      treatment and that maintenance on PROG will reduce stress/anxiety and thereby improve
      treatment outcome. 2) Determine if treatment retention is better in the PROG group compared
      to the PBO group and determine if maintenance on PROG improves overall functioning compared
      to maintenance on PBO based on the Clinical Global Inventory (CGI). We hypothesize that women
      in the PROG group will have better treatment retention and improvement in CGI scores compared
      to women in the PBO group.

      Tertiary Aims: To conduct exploratory analyses to determine whether 1) trauma history is
      related to treatment outcomes and 2) improvements in treatment outcome measures are related
      to decreases in HIV high-risk behaviors.
