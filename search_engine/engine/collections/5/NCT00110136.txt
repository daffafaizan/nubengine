      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) in alleviating hot
           flashes, in terms of hot flash frequency, score, and duration and disruption of daily
           activities caused by hot flashes, in postmenopausal women with non-metastatic breast
           cancer.

        -  Determine hot flash changes over 4 weeks in patients treated with this drug.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the effect of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) on serum tamoxifen levels
           in women receiving tamoxifen therapy.

        -  Determine the effect of Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) on general health-related
           quality of life and mood at 2 and 4 weeks relative to baseline, and during the 2 week
           post-treatment phase in these patients.

        -  To evaluate changes in average weekly hot flush scores and duration over course of
           study.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) three times daily for 4 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients complete a daily diary of the frequency, severity, and duration of their hot
      flashes, and complete quality of life and mood assessments every 2 weeks during study
      treatment and continuing weekly for 2 weeks after completion of study treatment.

      Patients receiving tamoxifen will have blood tests to measure serum tamoxifen levels at
      baseline, 2, 4, and 6 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 39 patients will be accrued for this study.
