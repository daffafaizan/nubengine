    
      children who arrive at the emergency unit with a stable both-bone midshaft forearm fracture
      will be asked to join the trial.

      If the fracture will be stable during reposition in the operating room, a randomization
      between 2 kinds of plaster treatment will be done.

      Outpatient clinic visits till a follow-up of 6 months. During these visits we will
      investigate: consolidation and dislocation on X-ray, function of both arms, complains in
      daily living and complications.
