      chronic pain management application, Managing My Pain Program (MMP) that incorporates
      validated questionnaires can be used to enhance communication between providers and patients
      and promote self-management to evaluate the extent of patient engagement with the app when
      used in clinical settings.

      The main objectives for this project is to evaluate the engagement in patients using MMP, and
      to assess improvements in clinical outcomes directly relevant for pain management, as
      measured by clinically-validated tools.
