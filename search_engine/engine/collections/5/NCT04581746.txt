      Thus, the non-essential and non-urgent follow-up consultations of patients living with HIV
      were postponed or transformed into "teleconsultation" or exchanges of e-mails between
      practitioners and patients. This change in care can have an impact on follow-up and access to
      treatment for PVVIH. In addition, the epidemic itself may have consequences: PVVIH may be at
      greater risk because of their immunosuppression and associated co-morbidities.
