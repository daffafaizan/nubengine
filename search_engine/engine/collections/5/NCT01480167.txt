    
      This is a multi-center, prospective, randomized, post marketing clinical trial designed to
      evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a minimally invasive procedure,
      Radiofrequency-Targeted Vertebral Augmentation (RF-TVA), compared to Non Operative Management
      (NOM) for the treatment of appropriately diagnosed, acute (â‰¤ 8 weeks), painful, osteoporotic
      vertebral compression fractures. Eligible subjects will be randomly allocated to receive
      either RF-TVA or NOM in a 1:1 randomization ratio. Subjects will be followed for 12 months
      post procedure. Primary effectiveness will be determined by comparing the Visual Analogue
      Scale for each treatment group for back pain from the baseline to the 1-month post procedure
      visit and between treatment groups at 1-month.

      Up to 15 sites will participate in this trial.
