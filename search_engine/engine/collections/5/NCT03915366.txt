      A significant number of undiagnosed or poorly treated HIV-infected children present to health
      services with severe pneumonia. World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines to treat severe
      pneumonia in HIV-infected infants include empirical treatment against common bacteria plus
      Pneumocystis jirovecii. Although this approach has contributed to reducing overall case
      fatality rates, mortality in this particularly vulnerable group remains unacceptably high.
      Autopsy studies in Africa have shown that cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and tuberculosis
      (TB) are important underdiagnosed and undertreated causes of deaths. Our objective is to
      evaluate whether empirical treatment against cytomegalovirus and tuberculosis improves
      survival of HIV-infected infants with severe pneumonia. A randomized factorial clinical trial
      will be conducted in six sub-Saharan African countries to evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      empirical treatment against cytomegalovirus and tuberculosis in HIV-infected infants aged 28
      days to 365 days admitted to hospital with severe pneumonia. The primary outcome is
      mortality. All HIV-infected infants will receive standard of care (SoC) pneumonia treatment,
      including antibiotics, cotrimoxazole, and prednisolone. A group of patients will receive SoC,
      another group will receive valganciclovir plus SoC, another group will receive tuberculosis
      treatment plus SoC, and another group will receive valganciclovir, tuberculosis treatment,
      and SoC.
