    
      This study aims to use a clinically validated metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS)
      assay to provide a demonstration of precision medicine for diagnosis of acute infectious
      disease in hospitalized patients, with the goal of directly impacting clinical care and
      improving patient mortality. This diagnostic test has been previously validated in a Clinical
      Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory, the University of California,
      San Francisco Clinical Microbiology Laboratory. From June 2016 to June 2017, investigators
      will prospectively enroll 200 patients from multiple hospitals in California (University of
      California, San Francisco; University of California, Los Angeles; University of California,
      Davis; Children's Hospital Los Angeles) and outside California (Children's National Medical
      Center, Children's Hospital Colorado, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital) for mNGS
      testing, and evaluate the impact on the assay on diagnostic yield, hospital costs and
      clinical outcomes.
