      • Collected data from COVID-19 patients at admission will include:

        -  Descriptive general demographic data

        -  Previous pathologies and thrombosis risk factors

        -  Routine biological data (the blood routinely collected will also be used for SARS-Cov-2
           specific RT-PCR exam)

      Complete thrombophilic profile testing by multiplex PCR and reverse hybridization of DNA to
      assess the presence of prothrombotic genotypes:

        -  Factor V Leiden

        -  Factor V 4070 A G (Hr2)

        -  Factor II G20210A

        -  Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T

        -  MTHFR A1298C

        -  Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) 844ins68

        -  PAI-1 4G/5G

        -  Glycoprotein IIIa T1565C (HPA-1a/b)

        -  ACE-DEL/INS

        -  Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)

        -  AGT M235T

        -  Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ATR-1) A1166C

        -  Fibrinogen - 455 G A

        -  Factor XIII Val34Leu SpO2, respiratory rate, PaO2/FiO2 RAAS components

             -  Imagistic procedures (chest X-ray or CT)

                  -  All patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test will be included

                  -  Patients will be divided into three groups depending on disease severity and
                     the presence of thrombotic state:

             -  1st group includes COVID-19 patients with proved

        -  venous thrombosis (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or venous thrombosis
           occurring in more atypical places such as in the veins of the brain, liver, kidney,
           mesenteric vein and the veins of the arms)

        -  or arterial thrombosis (heart attacks, strokes)

             -  2nd group encompasses asymptomatic patients and those with mild or moderate
                disease, according to current guidelines, without thrombosis: no symptoms or
                evidence of lower respiratory disease by clinical assessment or imaging and a SpO2
                ≥ 94%

             -  3rd group includes severe disease, according to current guidelines, without
                thrombosis: respiratory frequency > 30 breaths per minute, SpO2 < 94%, PaO2/FiO2 <
                300 mmHg, or lung infiltrates >50%

                  -  Statistical methods will be employed to check for significant differences
                     between prothrombotic mutations frequency and RAAS components levels for the
                     three groups
