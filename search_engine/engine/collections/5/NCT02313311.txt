      blastocyst stage and observed by TLI. The association of embryo cleavage patterns/timing
      parameters and good-quality blastocyst rates are evaluated by logistic regression and to
      establish a hierarchical embryo selection. The value of the selection process is assess by
      single embryo transfer (SET) on Day 3.
