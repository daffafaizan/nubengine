      schizophrenia. It is not well confirmed that a combination of two antipsychotic drugs lead to
      therapeutic benefit in contrast to monotherapy. However there is a highly frequent practice
      of combining atypical non-clozapine treatment that could be due to potential benefits when
      seeking alternatives to a high rate of non-response in acute phase. Therefore there is a need
      for further trials of sufficient power to address efficacy and safety issues of this regimen.
      Combining two selected atypical drugs in a complementary way may minimize side-effects and
      enhance efficacy. In order to specify these advantages it is intend to examine approaches to
      combination treatment: Amisulpride and olanzapine show complementing receptor binding
      profiles and have shown to have efficacy and good tolerability when administered in
      combination in retrospective studies. The object of this trial is to study whether acutely
      ill patients with combination of amisulpride and olanzapine are more frequently in
      symptomatic remission after 8 weeks than those with olanzapine or amisulpride monotherapy.
