      selenoproteins. The most abundant selenoprotein in the plasma is selenoprotein P, which is
      largely synthesized in the liver. Patients with liver disease often have less than half the
      selenoprotein P levels of normal individuals. This suggests that people with liver disease
      are not meeting their selenium requirements and may benefit from additional selenium.

      We proposed to compare the effects of two different forms of supplemental selenium on plasma
      selenium levels among patients with severe liver cirrhosis and healthy individuals
      (controls). Patients and controls were randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups: 200 µg
      selenium per day as selenate, 200 µg selenium per day as selenomethionine, or a placebo. The
      intervention lasted 8 weeks. Blood was measured initially and after 2 and 4 weeks of
      supplementation. Selenium, selenoprotein P and glutathione peroxidase were measured in the
      plasma. We compared changes in selenium and selenoprotein levels between liver cirrhosis
      patients and healthy controls.
