    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Test the hypothesis that a single dose of Zevalin (yttrium Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan)
      rituximab immunotherapy (RIT) will increase the complete remission (CR) rate over that
      achieved with standard rituximab in patients with untreated asymptomatic follicular lymphoma
      (FL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test the hypothesis that Zevalin RIT will improve progression-free survival. II. Test the
      hypothesis that Zevalin RIT will improve time to next (any) therapy and time to next
      chemotherapy.

      CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. Study the incidence of exon 2 B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 2 protein (bcl2) mutations in
      patients with asymptomatic follicular lymphoma (AFL).

      II. Measure regulatory T cells (Tregs) and tissue monocytes in on-study FL tumor tissue.

      III. Measure serum cytokines and vitamin D at on study and month 6. IV. Evaluate beta-2
      microglobulin plus lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) score as a prognostic factor.

      V. Measure absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), absolute monocyte count (AMC), and ALC/AMC ratio
      at on study and after treatment.

      VI. Compare quality of life as measured by the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
      (FACT)-Lymphoma (Lym) between arms.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.

      ARM B: Patients receive rituximab IV on days 1 and 8 and yttrium Y-90 ibritumomab tiuxetan
      over 10 minutes on day 8.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36,
      48, and 60 months and then every 12 months for 5 years.
