    
      This is a study to assess the antitumor activity of zolbetuximab, an Immunoglobulin (IgG1)
      chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against CLDN18.2, in subjects with recurrent locally
      advanced or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma whose tumors have
      high or intermediate CLDN18.2 expression. For each cohort, the study consists of the
      following periods: pre-screening; screening; treatment; and follow-up for disease
      progression. In addition, there will be a survival follow-up period for Cohort 1A and Cohort
      3B participants only. Tolerability of zolbetuximab in combination with pembrolizumab in
      Japanese participant(s) will be evaluated in Cohort 3B, if Japanese subjects are not enrolled
      in the Cohort 3A DLT assessment.
