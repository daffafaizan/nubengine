      doses of rosuvastatin in patients with acute coronary syndrome post drug-eluting stents
      implantation. In total, the investigators plan to recruit 80 patients with acute coronary
      syndrome (but no acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) participating in the
      study. After signing informed consent form, the patients will be randomly assigned into high
      dose rosuvastatin and low dose rosuvastatin groups (40 cases in each group) by a computer
      generated random sequence table on a ratio of 1:1. Patients in the high-dose group will be
      prescribed rosuvastatin calcium of 20mg/d at least 6 months post index procedure, while
      patients in low dose group will have rosuvastatin calcium of 10mg/d, also at least 6 months.
      Additionally, all patients will receive dual antiplatelet therapy (oral aspirin 100mg qd,
      clopidogrel 75mg qd or ticagrelor 90 mg bid). Clinical follow up (telephone or out-patient
      follow-up) will be scheduled at 30 days, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years and 3 years. Optical
      coherence tomography examinations will be performed at 6 months. Neointimal hyperplasia,
      stent strut coverage and thin cap fibroatheroma are primary observational parameters.
      Multi-slices CT are optional pre-/post-procedure and at 3 years follow-up. All clinical data
      will be collected and managed by statistical center, clinical endpoint adjudication
      committee. All imaging modalities data will be collected and analysed by an independent
      imaging core laboratory.
