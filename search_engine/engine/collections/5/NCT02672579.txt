      study aims to validate an age appropriate pediatric version of the ItchyQoL, a
      pruritus-specific quality of life instrument, and the ItchyQuant, a self-reported itch
      severity scale, to better understand how pruritus affects the pediatric population. These
      instruments will comprehensively capture the severity and impact of pruritus in children. The
      physicians want to explore the opportunity to integrate patient-reported outcome measures
      (PROM) as a patient-reported tool in the ambulatory setting.
