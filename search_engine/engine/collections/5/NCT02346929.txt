      involve injecting lidocaine directly into the fracture line for analgesia. The physician
      aspirates blood prior to injection to confirm placement in the hematoma created by the
      fracture. However, the procedure can be technically difficult if the fracture line is
      difficult to palpate, for example, due to significant swelling or body habitus. Ultrasound
      has been shown to improve efficacy in other analgesic procedures such as peripheral nerve
      blocks5 and also in identifying fracture lines6. There have been case reports and case series
      which have shown the feasibility and effectiveness of ultrasound guided hematoma blocks for
      analgesia in patients undergoing reduction for distal radius fractures7,8. To our knowledge
      there are no randomized controlled trials comparing the use of ultrasound guided hematoma
      blocks versus traditional hematoma blocks in achieving analgesia for distal radius fracture
      reduction.

      In this study, we will determine if ultrasound improves the efficacy of analgesia when
      performing hematoma blocks for reduction of distal radius fractures.
