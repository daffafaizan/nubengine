      study health facilities. The rapid assessment includes a facility audit, and the
      cross-verification of Mother-baby pair service records, and scheduled appointments. Following
      the baseline rapid assessment, the research team implements the proposed intervention package
      in health facilities randomly assigned to the intervention arm of the study. Data collectors
      conduct monthly visits to study facilities in order to extract appointment attendance
      information from PMTCT, ART, pharmacy, HIV exposed infants (HEI), and early infant diagnoses
      (EID) service registers.
