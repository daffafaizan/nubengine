      telescope, although rare, causes the development of a trocar site hernia. Investigators
      thought that the incidence of trocar site hernia would decrease by using a 5 mm trocar, and
      investigators planned a study.

      Elective laparoscopic with a diagnosis of symptomatic cholelithiasis Patients hospitalized in
      Mogadishu-Somalia Recep Tayyip ErdoÄŸan Training and Research Hospital and Konya Training and
      Research Hospital General Surgery clinic for cholecystectomy operation will be included in
      the study and randomized into two groups. In the first group, a 10 mm telescope will be used,
      and in the second group, a 5 mm telescope will be used. Patients will be followed up for a
      total of 3 years in 6-month periods for the development of trocar site hernia.
