    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  Obtain laboratory identification and confirmation of research results for gene mutations
           in participants previously enrolled in NCI-99-C-0053 who have von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)
           syndrome or who are at risk for VHL syndrome.

        -  Determine genotype status in these participants.

      OUTLINE: Participants submit a blood or buccal sample for genetic mutation analysis.
      Participants may receive genetic counseling and/or the results of genetic testing, if
      desired.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 260 participants will be accrued for this study.
