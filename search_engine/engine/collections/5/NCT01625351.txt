      days of hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) mobilization followed by two apheresis collections.
      Each apheresis collection will be processed by the CliniMACS system.

      DONORS: A mobilization regimen of granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) will be used
      to obtain a peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) product from the donor. Apheresis will be
      performed for a minimum of two consecutive days, including one day for each cell product
      delivered.

      STUDY PARTICIPANTS: Participants will undergo a two-stage haploidentical cell infusion
      following myeloablative conditioning. The first cell infusion will be a CD3-depleted product
      and the second infusion will be a CD45RA-depleted product.

      Primary Objective:

        -  To determine the feasibility of haploidentical HSCT using two infusions engineered by
           negative selection on the Miltenyi CliniMACS system- the first by selective depletion of
           CD3+ cells, followed by a second depleted of CD45RA+ cells, in children with relapsed or
           refractory solid tumors or lymphomas.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To estimate hematopoietic cell recovery and engraftment rates for the patients.

        -  To estimate infection rates and complications.

        -  To estimate the one-year overall survival (OS) and event-free survival (EFS) for the
           study patients.
