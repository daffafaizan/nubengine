      Previous studies have shown a positive association between the frequency of debridement and
      healing rates in chronic wounds. However, the effect of debridement on acute, post-surgical
      wounds is not well-described in the literature.

      This randomized controlled trial is designed to determine whether aggressive and frequent
      debridement of an acute post-surgical wound shortens healing time.
