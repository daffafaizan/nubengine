      response in patients with bipolar disorders. These studies, however, do not include
      lithium-refractory subgroups, such as bipolar II disorder patients. When the wide spectrum of
      bipolar disorders is considered, the lithium response rate decreases significantly. More
      broadly effective regimens are needed.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either lithium plus
      divalproex or lithium, divalproex, and lamotrigine for 7 months. Symptoms of depression and
      mania will be assessed with scales and patient questionnaires.
