    
      Selection of Study Population: The study will enroll 60 adult subjects with transfusion
      dependent thalassemia receiving deferasirox iron chelation therapy. All eligible subjects
      will be asked to provide informed consent before participating in the study.

      Randomization: Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either continuation of their DFX
      (control arm) or a combination of DFX plus amlodipine (amlodipine arm).

      Treatment: Subjects randomized to the amlodipine arm will receive open label medication
      (amlodipine) starting at 2.5mg/day and up-titrated by 2.5mg every 7-14 days with the goal of
      reaching 10mg/day. DFX dose in either arm will not be adjusted unless it was deemed unsafe to
      remain on the same dose of DFX by the treating physician (significant side effects, lack of
      efficacy or over-chelation) or T2* drops below 8 ms.

      Safety Assessment: Weekly or fortnightly amlodipine titration will be conducted by the
      research physician in-clinic, based on blood pressure, tolerability, and presence or absence
      of side-effects.

      Adverse Events will be assessed at every visit after the first dose through to the last
      subject visit.

      Efficacy Assessment: the efficacy of amlodipine combined to standard chelation therapy will
      be assessed by cardiac T2*MRI, done at baseline and 12 months post treatment.
