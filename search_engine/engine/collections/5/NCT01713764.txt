    
      Approximately 40 individuals with Type II diabetes or prediabetes will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to treatment groups. Groups will meet for 12 weekly sessions, then approximately
      biweekly for 3 sessions, for a total of 15 1.5-2 hour sessions over 4.5 months. Participants
      will be evaluated at 0, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months. Our outcome of interest is HbA1c
      (glycated hemoglobin, a measure indicative of blood glucose levels and tied to diabetes
      severity).
