      of a control screen, one 1.52 m gutter with 32 diodes placed on it linearly, and a response
      button. The screen has a digital display, with commands that permit the operator to control
      the stimulus propagation speed and the preparatory interval speed. Once activated, the screen
      exhibits an alert signal, and, after the preparatory interval, it initiates the propagation
      of a luminous stimulus, lighting the 32 diodes successively. The task required participants
      to press the response button simultaneously with the illumination of the last diode. The
      digital display showed the error measure (em): that is, the difference between the
      illumination of the last diode and the response.
