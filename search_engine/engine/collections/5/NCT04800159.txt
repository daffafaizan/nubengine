      affects the antiretroviral therapy (ART) that treats HIV is not well known. Cannabis can
      inhibit the activity of enzymes that metabolize and eliminate ART drugs from the body, which
      could result in higher concentrations of ART drugs in the body. Cannabis may also affect the
      distribution of ART drugs into the brain, which could have both beneficial (e.g., better HIV
      control) and detrimental (e.g., toxicity) effects. The effects of cannabis may are likely
      influenced by factors like how much is used (e.g., light vs. heavy use) and the route of use
      (e.g., smoked vs. ingested). This study will address whether cannabis affects ART
      concentrations in blood and cerebrospinal fluid as well as mood, and thinking. The project
      will have two phases. Phase 1 is an observational study, in which 120 people will be assessed
      once to evaluate the effects of chronic cannabis use on ART drug concentrations, mood, and
      thinking. In Phase 2, the study will administer cannabis (or placebo) to 40 people to examine
      its acute effects on ART drug concentrations.
