      specially formulated celery-banana bread.

      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of apigenin supplementation.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients consume one serving of lower dose apigenin celery-banana bread daily on days 1-7,
      and then consume one serving of higher dose apigenin celery-banana bread on days 8-14.
      Patients undergo blood sample collection on day 1 prior to and 6 hours after bread ingestion,
      on day 8 prior to and 6 hours after ingestion of bread, and on day 15 (or endpoint). Patients
      also provide a baseline urine sample and then 24-hour urine samples on days 1, 7, 8, and 14.
