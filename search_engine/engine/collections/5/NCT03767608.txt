    
      Mexican children and adolescents previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus according
      to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) criteria were recruited and compared to healthy
      controls.

      The participants will undergo:

        -  vital signs measurement (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory
           rate)

        -  anthropometric variables measurement (BMI, weight, waist circumference, hip
           circumference, body fat %)

        -  laboratory studies: glucose, triglycerides, HDL-c, C reactive protein, irisin

      After statistical analyses the investigators will compare the relationship of irisin and the
      inflammatory profile and the anthropometric parameters of diabetic patients versus lean
      controls.
