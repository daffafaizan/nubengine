        -  Measure the incidence of p16^INK4a germline mutations in patients with squamous cell
           carcinoma of the head and neck and a family history of cancer.

        -  Determine biologic activity of identified p16^INK4a germline mutations.

      OUTLINE: DNA specimens are collected for genetic and mutation analysis and examined by PCR
      and flow cytometry. The activity of cells with p16 mutations is determined by cell cycle
      arrest functional assay.
