      with technetium-99m single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in patients that are
      unable to exercise adequately. We would like to study Regadenoson in conjunction with
      Exercise Rubidium-82 positron emission tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (PET MPI).
      Regadenoson is not approved by FDA for use with Rubidium-82 PET MPI. Also, we would like to
      study a novel stress protocol of Regadenoson combined with symptom limited exercise stress
      (not FDA approved).

      The objectives of this study are to assess the tolerability and safety of combined symptom
      limited exercise stress test with Lexiscan (Lexercise PET) compared to Lexiscan alone
      (Lexiscan PET), to assess image quality of Lexercise compared to Lexiscan PET and to compare
      relative and absolute myocardial perfusion imaging with Lexercise compared to Lexiscan PET to
      identify CAD.
