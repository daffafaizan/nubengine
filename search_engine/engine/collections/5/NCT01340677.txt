    
      This is an open-label study where healthy volunteers will know the name and dose of assigned
      treatment and will be randomly assigned to take a single oral (by mouth) dose of
      canagliflozin sequentially in each of 3 treament periods where the dose in each treatment
      period will be different (referred to as a 3-period crossover study) to evaluate the
      pharmacokinetics (blood levels) of 3 dose levels of canagliflozin. Healthy volunteers will
      take a single oral tablet of canagliflozin 50 mg (Treatment A), 100 mg (Treatment B), and 300
      mg (Treatment C) during the study; a different dose will be taken in each treatment period.
      Study drug will be taken in the a.m. on Day 1 of Treatment Periods 1, 2, and 3, with a 10- to
      14-day washout period between Day 1 of each treatment period. Volunteers will fast (go
      without food) for at least 10 hours before and up to at least 4 hours after taking study
      drug.
