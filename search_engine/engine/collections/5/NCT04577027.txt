      highlighted darkening of iris, and eyelashes and periocular hyperpigmentation induced by
      prostaglandin F2Î± analogues used for the treatment of glaucoma (as travoprost). Extrapolating
      these findings in the treatment of vitiligo.

      The beneficial effect of fractional CO2 laser on vitiligo is postulated to come from the
      release of cytokines and growth factors that act as mitogens for melanogenesis . The
      preceding laser also alters the skin barrier, which results in increased penetration of
      topical drugs and ultraviolet (UV) radiation.

      308 nm excimer laser is a monochromatic, target type treatment and allows the delivery of
      higher fluences to the lesions and avoids damage to the surrounding normal skin resulting in
      a faster and more effective pigmentation with minimal side effects.
