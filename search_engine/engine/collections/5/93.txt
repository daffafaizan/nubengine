propagation of lactic dehydrogenase-elevating virus in cell culture .primary cultures of adult mouse lung, spleen, and liver and of mouseembryo support the multiplication of the lactic dehydrogenase-elevatingvirus . such cultures produced virus continuously until they had beensubcultured 2-3 times . this corresponded to 20 weeks in the case oflung and spleen and to 2-3 weeks with cultures of embryo . viralmultiplication was not accompanied by cytologic alterations in the cellsor by changes in their rate of synthesis of nucleic acids or protein .infection did not cause detectable changes in either the production ofldh or in its release from cells .
