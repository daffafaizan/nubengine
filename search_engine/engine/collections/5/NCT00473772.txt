      5 and 35% after bare metal stenting and is as high as 19% after the implantation of a
      drug-eluting stent in patients at moderate risk. Restenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia is
      a slow process, suggesting that therapeutic local drug administration would need to be
      prolonged to be beneficial. Stent-based local drug delivery provides sustained drug release
      using special release technologies like polymer coating. However, cell culture experiments
      indicate that even brief contact between vascular smooth muscle cells and lipophilic taxane
      compounds can inhibit vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation for a long period. In
      experiments in swine, intracoronary delivery of paclitaxel by contrast media or by a
      drug-coated balloon catheter was found to result in vascular tissue concentrations capable of
      producing antiproliferative effects, thus leading to a significant reduction in neointimal
      proliferation. In these animal studies, the most pronounced reduction of neointimal formation
      was seen with paclitaxel-coated balloon catheters.
