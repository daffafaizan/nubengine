    
      The study design is a cluster randomized controlled trial. Twenty-four elderly centers as
      clusters will be randomly selected and assigned to be intervention (n=20) or control groups
      (n=4) in two study phases. A total of 8-10 older adults (age â‰¥ 60) from each cluster (total
      subjects = 228) will be invited to be study participants. Each intervention cluster will
      receive either an integrated training format or one out of three combinations of two training
      modes. Each intervention training mode will last for 2-month of 16 sessions in total, 2
      sessions per week and 60 min per session, hence, the total intervention will last for 4
      months for two training modes or an integrated training format. Assessments will be conducted
      at pre-test, two post-training tests, and a 2-month follow-up test after completion of all
      training.
