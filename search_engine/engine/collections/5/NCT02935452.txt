      National Health Service) Trust by building social capacity to support self-management. The
      GENIE tool will be introduced into the COPD service to improve options for social groups and
      exercise when leaving a pulmonary rehabilitation group, or when clinically unable to
      participate in exercise. The implementation of the GENIE tool aims;

        -  to build social networking awareness and the importance of utilising existing social
           resources in the professional and voluntary members of the COPD service

        -  to use social network mapping techniques and preference elicitation to engage COPD
           patients in reflecting on their support preferences and needs, help them access further
           resources and knowledge

        -  Evaluate the success of the social mapping techniques (GENIE) in the COPD patient
           population

        -  Evaluate the cost benefit to the health service of the GENIE in the COPD patient
           population
