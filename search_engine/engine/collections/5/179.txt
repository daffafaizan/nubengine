bacteriophages that lyse mycobacteria and corynebacteria, and showcytopathogenic effect on tissue cultures of renal cells of cercopithecusaethiops.. a preliminary communication .bacteriophages isolated from sputum and resection specimens of pa-tients suffering from carcinoma of the lung were found to lyse coryne-bacteria and mycobacteria, and to produce a cytopathogenic effect oncertain cells in tissue cultures . from the same and other patients withneoplastic disease, bacteria were isolated and described as coryne-my-cobacteria because of bacteriological features they shared with bothspecies . these bacteria, which either were sensitive to mycobacterio-phages and corynebacteriophages or were phage-immune lysogenic bacteria,could be induced to produce lytic particles with phagolytic activity oncorynebacteria and mycobacteria and a cytopathogenic effect on helacells and on the renal cells of cercopithecus .
