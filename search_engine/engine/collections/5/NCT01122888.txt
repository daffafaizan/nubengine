    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of cilengitide on changes in serum VEGFR2, a pharmacodynamic
      biomarker of sunitinib malate effects on endothelial function, during the withdrawal phase of
      a course of sunitinib malate in patients with advanced solid tumors or glioblastoma
      multiforme.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of cilengitide exposure on changes in VEGFR2 over the 14-day interval
      from the end of sunitinib malate administration to the end of course 1 in these patients.

      II. Test the safety and efficacy of this regimen in these patients. III. Develop serum
      collagen c-telopeptide crosslinks (CTx) as a pharmacodynamic marker for cilengitide.

      OUTLINE:

      COURSE I: Patients receive oral sunitinib malate on days 1-14 (weeks 1-2). Patients are then
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cilengitide IV over 1 hour twice in weeks 3 and 4.

      ARM II: Patients do not receive treatment in weeks 3 and 4.

      COURSE II: Patients in both arms then receive oral sunitinib malate on days 1-14 and
      cilengitide IV over 1 hour twice in weeks 3 and 4. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up periodically.
