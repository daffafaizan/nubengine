    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether women with preexisting T1DM who
      showed a decline in insulin requirement, defined as a decrease in insulin requirement of 25%
      or more, or a decrease deemed to be clinically significant by the investigator, with no other
      medically determined reason, or who had detectable C-peptide during a previous pregnancy will
      show a change in stimulated C peptide response when not pregnant and treated with exogenous
      pregnancy-related hormones and growth factors (Estradiol, medroxyprogesterone,
      hydrocortisone, GH) for 6 weeks.

      The secondary objectives of this study are as follows:

        -  Determine whether the study treatment leads to a change in T1DM autoantibodies between
           Baseline and Week 6

        -  Determine the percentage of subjects experiencing a clinically significant decline in
           total daily insulin requirement at Week 6, defined as a 25% decrease from Baseline

        -  Descriptively evaluate the association between serum levels of growth hormone, cortisol,
           and prolactin and changes in C-peptide levels

        -  Evaluate the safety of administration of the study treatments compared with placebo, as
           measured by blood pressure, pulse, weight change, blood glucose, and adverse events
