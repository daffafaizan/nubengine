      study will be conducted in two parts: part 1 will involve dose escalation using a 3 + 3
      design, and part 2 will involve the expansion of the MTD or HTD to further evaluate the
      safety of haNK. In part 1, 3 to 6 subjects will be sequentially enrolled starting at dose
      cohort 1, and subjects will be assessed for DLTs.

        -  Cohort 1: 2 x 10^9 cells per infusion.

        -  Cohort 2: 4 x 10^9 cells per infusion.

        -  If needed, subjects will be enrolled into a dose de-escalation cohort (cohort -1): 1 x
           10^9 cells per infusion.

      In part 2, dose expansion will occur when the MTD or HTD has been determined. An additional 4
      subjects may be enrolled in part 2, for a total of up to 10 subjects at the MTD or HTD.
