      maintain healthy weights. We will be following participants in these programs over a two year
      period. These two groups will be compared with an observational comparison group of employees
      who meet eligibility criteria but do not take part in the randomized controlled trial. We
      will assess whether the two programs decrease obesity-related injuries in the workplace and
      estimate the net costs of the two programs relative to their effectiveness more broadly.

      In the additional follow-up, we will be assessing factors that may be related to program
      success. This will include a survey as well as some focus group data.
