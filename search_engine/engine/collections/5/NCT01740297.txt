      receive talimogene laherparepvec in combination with ipilimumab.

      The phase 2 part of the study is an open-label, multicenter, randomized study to further
      assess the safety and to evaluate the efficacy of talimogene laherparepvec in combination
      with ipilimumab. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive talimogene laherparepvec plus
      ipilimumab or ipilimumab alone.

      Participants randomized before amendment 2 will be stratified by stage of disease (stage
      IIIB/C, IVM1a, and stage IVM1b vs IVM1c) and v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1
      (BRAF) V600E (a mutation resulting in a substitution of glutamic acid for valine at codon
      600) (mutation vs mutation not present). Participants randomized after amendment 2 will be
      stratified by stage of disease (stage IIIB/C and IVM1a vs stage IVM1b and IVM1c) and prior
      therapy (treatment na√Øve vs previously treated with systemic anticancer immunotherapy vs
      previously treated with systemic anticancer treatment other than immunotherapy).
