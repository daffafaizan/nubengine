      Clinic of Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University Training and Research Hospital, who were diagnosed
      with chronic non-specific low back pain and who comply with the study criteria.

      The sample size has been calculated that 80% power can be obtained at 95% confidence level.
      It was found that at least 21 cases, a total of 44 cases, were required for each group.

      Volunteers will be divided into 2 groups by randomization. Conventional physiotherapy
      applications will be applied to the control group. In addition to conventional physiotherapy
      methods, kinesiotape (KT) will be applied to the study group. Patients in both groups will be
      treated 5 days a week for a total of 10 sessions for 2 weeks. KT will be renewed in each
      session on weekdays.
