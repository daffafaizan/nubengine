      benefit from prior anthracycline containing therapy was never investigated in a prospective
      study.

      Due to the very promising effect of olaratumab and doxorubicin in anthracycline-na√Øve
      patients and further taking into consideration the results of the retrospective anthracycline
      rechallenge study, there is a clear rationale to evaluate the effects of olaratumab and
      doxorubicin also in anthracycline pretreated patients by conducting a prospective clinical
      trial.
