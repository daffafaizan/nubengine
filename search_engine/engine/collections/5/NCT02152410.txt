    
      acute onset pain is a frequent cause for consulting the ED (2/3 of patients). renal colics
      are a common cause for severe acute onset pain, we think approximatively 20% of patients
      consulting the ED for severe (VAS > 70) acute onset pain have renal colics (RC).

      the guidelines for the treatment of severe RC recommend the association of two drugs: a
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAI) typically the Ketoprofen and an antalgic
      typically opioid (Morphine).

      but this one face many critics regarding its safety and tolerance, that's why we investigated
      other pain relief strategies such as acupuncture.

      acupuncture is one of the five branches of the traditional chinese medicine, it has proven
      its efficacity and safety in many conditions and in RC.

      the aim of these study is to assess the feasibility, the safety, and the tolerance of an
      acupuncture pain-relief strategy compared to the conventional one (intravenous opioids) in
      the treatment of severe acute onset RC in emergency departement settings.
