      Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) for treatment of an acute traumatic spine injury.

      Promising preclinical data demonstrates that the oxygenation and hemodynamic measures of our
      Near Infra-Red Spectroscopy (NIRS) system closely match the invasive intraparenchymal
      measures obtained within the injured spinal cord. Further, the NIRS sensor is responsive and
      reflective of systemic hemodynamic changes. This clinical protocol represents the first
      application of this novel NIRS sensor in human SCI. Following operative decompression of the
      spinal cord via a posterior approach, the NIRS sensor will be placed over the dura for 7 days
      to monitor spinal cord oxygenation and tissue hemodynamics. Patients will be followed for 6
      months and data collection for safety, feasibly and efficacy of the NIRS System.

      The specific aims of this project are to:

        1. Establish the safety, feasibility, and efficacy of our NIRS system in monitoring tissue
           oxygenation and hemodynamics of the injured spinal cord in human participants.

        2. Complete the technical refinement of the NIRS system utilizing an iterative process
           guided by participant recruitment and data accrual during the trial.
