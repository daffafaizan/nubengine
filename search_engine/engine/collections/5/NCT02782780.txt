      is associated with significant medical and psychiatric morbidity. Cognitive Behavioral
      Therapy for Insomnia (CBTi) is a multicomponent treatment that seeks not only to teach
      patients about sleep and factors affecting sleep (e.g., circadian rhythm, age, social and
      work schedule) but the therapist will also to work with the patient toward minimizing
      unwanted arousal at bedtime and altering sleep habits to increase sleep propensity and
      regularity.

      Because many Veterans with GWI suffer from a profound loss of physical and functional status
      that may prevent them from participating in treatments that require regular clinic visits,
      the proposed study will deliver CBTi by telephone to extend this effective form of behavioral
      sleep medicine to Veterans who have chronic illnesses and disabilities and/or who live in
      rural areas with limited access to trained CBTi providers. Recent studies suggest that
      telephone-delivered CBTi is as effective as CBTi delivered in-person.

      The proposed trial will examine the efficacy of telephone-delivered CBTi for alleviating
      sleep and non-sleep GWI symptoms in a two-arm randomized controlled trial. Veterans who have
      GWI and persistent insomnia disorder will be randomized to a group that will receive CBTi
      right away or to a group that will receive treatment-as-usual (i.e., the control group).
      Veterans randomized to the control group will have the option of receiving
      telephone-delivered CBTi upon completion of post-treatment assessments. The primary outcomes
      will be effect sizes base on within-group comparisons of pre-to-post-treatment change and
      maintenance of treatment effects at 6 months in the CBTi group.
