      equivalent statin. It is observational because the patients were all on atorvastatin, had
      been informed by their prescription drug plan that it would not be covered, and that if
      agreed they would be changed to an equivalent that is covered by their plan. The patients
      were either converted with the help of pharmacist by collaborative practice agreement (CPA)or
      upon contacting their physician requesting a different medication. We are comparing the
      percentage first converted to the equivalent dose in each group and whether patients
      continued to be at hyperlipidemia treatment goal after the interchange.
