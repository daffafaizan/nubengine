      be associated with the Tcog. Patients diagnosed in mild to moderate AD will be randomized
      into four groups: G1, aETCC before TCog; G2, aETCC during TCog; G3 aETCC after TCog and G4:
      simulated aETCC during TCog. Groups G1, G2 and G3 will receive the active current, while G4
      will receive the simulated current. In each condition, an initial baseline assessment (T0)
      will be performed after 12 sessions (T1) and three weeks after the end of interventions (T2).
      The outcomes evaluated will be: cognition, executive function, functionality,
      neuropsychiatric symptoms and occupational performance. For all analyzes, SPSS (Statistical
      Package for Social Sciences - SPSS Inc, Chicago IL, USA) for Windows, Version 20.0, will be
      used and considered as significant, an alpha value of 5% (p <0.05 ).
