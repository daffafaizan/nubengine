      I. Determine the response rate, time to progression, and survival of patients with recurrent
      advanced ovarian epithelial or primary peritoneal cavity cancer treated with gemcitabine
      hydrochloride and 17-N-allylamino-17-demethoxygeldanamycin (17-AAG) (tanespimycin).

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Correlate the effect of
      17-AAG alone on chaperone and client proteins in tumor samples and peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells with response, time to progression, and survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to gemcitabine
      hydrochloride therapy (gemcitabine hydrochloride-naive/no prior exposure to gemcitabine
      hydrochloride vs gemcitabine hydrochloride-resistant/prior exposure to gemcitabine
      hydrochloride as a single agent with disease progression while on treatment). Patients
      receive tanespimycin intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1 and 8 during course 1 and days
      2 and 9 during subsequent courses and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on day 7
      during course 1 and days 1 and 8 during subsequent courses. Courses repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3
      months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up to 5 years.
