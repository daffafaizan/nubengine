        -  Determine the objective response rate in women with metastatic breast cancer treated
           with doxorubicin HCl liposome and gemcitabine.

        -  Determine the duration of response, time to disease progression, and duration of
           survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the quantitative toxicity of this regimen, in terms of incidence, type, and
           severity, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete response (CR) receive 2 courses
      beyond documentation of CR.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of each course, and then at the end of
      study.

      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients will be accrued for this study.
