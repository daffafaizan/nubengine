      Stability of the DRUJ is primarily provided by both the bony anatomy of the sigmoid notch of
      the radius and ulnar head and the soft tissues surrounding the joint. The interosseous
      membrane plays an important role in DRUJ stability but the TFCC is the major soft tissue
      stabilizer of the DRUJ. The Central Band works as a restraint on the radius from proximal
      migration in cooperation with the radial head and the TFCC and also works as a load
      transmitter between the radius and ulnar to redistribute load. Some investigators suggested
      that the distal membranous portion and DOB stabilizes the DRUJ when TFCC is disrupted.
      Watanabe et al. (2005) insisted on the importance of DOB, which constrained volar and dorsal
      instability of the radius at the DRUJ in all forearm rotation positions. The purpose of this
      anatomical and biomechanical study was to define and measure DRUJ dislocation in the
      simulation of a Galeazzi fracture.
