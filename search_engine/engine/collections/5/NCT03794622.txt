      standard treatments. Its primary goal is to develop an osseous bridge between adjacent motion
      segments to prevent motion, relieve pain, and facilitate bone union. Delayed union or
      nonunion is common in femoral shaft fracture. Risk factors include comminuted fracture, open
      fracture, smoking, diabetes and open reduction of fracture fixation. Mesenchymal stem cells
      are pluripotent cells that can differentiate into multiple mesenchymal tissues, including
      tenocytes, chondrocytes and osteoblasts, as well as being a source of multiple growth factors
      to establish an environment conducive to soft and hard tissue regeneration. As bone marrow
      concentration has high concentration of mesenchymal stem cells, some studies have shown that
      autologous bone marrow concentration can improve bone healing. Therefore, the goal of this
      study was to evaluate the effect of bone marrow concentration on union of femoral shaft
      fracture.
