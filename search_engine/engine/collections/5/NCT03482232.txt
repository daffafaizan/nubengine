      clinical benefit and over-cost. The Less is More Medicine movement has led to the
      identification of Do not do in different specialties, also in primary care.

      Objective: To analyze the impact of errors (overuse rates based in Do not do recommendations)
      in clinical practice.

      Method: Retrospective observational study in a random selection of 5% of digital records
      active between 2014 and 2017 to quantify the frequency of Do not do primary care
      recommendations, calculating the over-cost related to them. Retrospective study reviewing a
      random selection of cases previously identified to determine whether patient suffered adverse
      events and their over-cost.

      Setting. Primary care in Andalucía, Aragón, Castilla La Mancha, Comunidad Valenciana, Madrid,
      Murcia, Navarra y País Vasco, eight autonomous communities in Spain.
