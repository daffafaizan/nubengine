      effect on outcomes in TJA. These include metabolic diseases such as diabetes mellitus,
      obesity, and smoking status. However, nutritional status has not been as thoroughly
      investigated; to date, no prospective randomized control study has assessed the effect of
      oral nutritional supplementation for malnourished patients. This study will be a novel
      investigation into the role for routine serum screening for malnutrition as well as oral
      nutritional supplementation in TJA patients. This study could serve as a stepping stone
      towards creating a new pathway to highlight at-risk patients and pre-operatively optimizing
      their outcomes after TJA.
