      investigated for it's ability to lyse the adhesions associated with the shoulder capsule in
      adhesive capsulitis (frozen shoulder).

      Treatment success may obviate the need for extensive physical therapy and/or shoulder
      arthroscopy (surgery) to correct this condition and restore normal and pain free shoulder
      motion.
