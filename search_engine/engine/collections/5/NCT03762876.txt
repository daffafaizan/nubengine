      increases long term survival. Improvements in patient selection criteria, surgical methods,
      and postoperative care have increased the indications for major and extended hepatectomy
      (EH). Post-hepatectomy liver failure (PHLF) is a major complication following EH and is
      called small for size and flow syndrome (SFSF). SFSF significantly increases morbidity and
      mortality. The current SFSF treatments are not effective because tissue damage following SFSF
      is irreversible and the liver parenchyma loses the ability to regenerate. The best approach
      to improve patient survival is to predict SFSF and perform adequate preventive procedures
      during liver resection. SFSF is caused by changes in trans-hepatic flow and a low future
      liver remnant volume. Portal vein flow (PVF), hepatic artery flow (HAF), and portal vein
      pressure (PVP) are the main criteria for SFSF development. Following EH, the ratio of HAF to
      the remnant liver weight (HAF/100gr) decreases, while the PVF/100gr and the PVP increase.
      This has various pathologic consequences, which lead to SFSF. Troisi et al. suggested an
      upper limit of 250 ml/min/100g for PVF to prevent SFSF after living donor liver
      transplantation. A vascular modulation that decreases the PVF/100gr and PVP and increases the
      HAF/100gr may prevent SFSF. The mechanisms that alter trans-hepatic flow after hepatectomy
      and living donor transplantation are similar, but the effect of these changes on SFSF has not
      been studied following liver resection. Exploring the changes in trans-hepatic flow after
      major and extended hepatectomy and determining the factors that influence these changes would
      allow us to modulate hepatic inflow during hepatectomy to prevent PHLF.
