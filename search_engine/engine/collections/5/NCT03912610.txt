      The degree of pain is evaluated via visual analogue pain scale (VAS). The emotional state is
      evaluated by Hamilton anxiety scale (HAMA) or Hamilton depression scale (HAMD). The patients
      and healthy volunteers who meet the include criteria are include in the research. Then the
      spontaneous brain electrical activity is collected by multimodal brain magnetic resonance
      imaging technology. The spontaneous brain electrical activity is analyzed to find the
      differences between knee osteoarthritis patients and healthy volunteers. Further analysis of
      resting brain functional connectivity and information exchange changes in multifunctional
      areas, in order to elaborate the central mechanism of pain and emotion modulation.
