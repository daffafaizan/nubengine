      detection of prostate cancer using the PSA blood test can detect cancer a decade or more
      before it would have been found on a prostate examination. Men who are diagnosed at an older
      age (>75) may not benefit from aggressive treatment because many will not live long enough
      for the prostate cancer to kill them. Men who are diagnosed at a young age will be more
      likely to benefit from treatment from prostate cancer but they will have a very long time to
      live with some of the side effects of treatment.

      Patients with low-risk prostate cancer, which is located in only one area or on one side of
      the prostate, may benefit from treatment of that one area instead of treating the entire
      prostate. This is similar to the lumpectomy of breast cancer which removes only the tumor
      instead of removing the entire breast.

      This study will look at the short-term side-effects and the long-term success of performing
      focal treatment of prostate cancer.

      Patients who are newly diagnosed with prostate cancer or who are already diagnosed and on an
      active surveillance protocol will be considered eligible for consideration of focal therapy.
      Patients deemed eligible will be offered inclusion in the study. There will only be a
      treatment group, no controls or placebo.
