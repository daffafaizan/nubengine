      measuring accuracy of the Wristband for registration of ECG RR intervals for one hand,
      SenceBand in real-world condition during 24-hours of routine duties in comparison to a
      predicate device (Holter monitor). For monitoring HRV each subject will put heart rate
      monitor SenceBand in the randomly assigned wrist and Holter monitor electrodes will be placed
      in standard configurations places. Data will be collected during routine duties. SenceBand
      will collect data from 5-minutes intervals each 30 minutes, Holter will collect data
      continuously over 24 hours.
