      in end-stage renal disease population. Hypertension and left ventricle hypertrophy occur in
      more than 70% of patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis therapy, and both contributes to
      mortality and morbidity.Recent clinical trials in chronic heart failure and post miocardial
      infarct heart failure patients have demonstrated a beneficial effect of a mineralocorticoid
      receptor blocker spironolactone, in adittion to standard therapy (RALES AND EPHESUS studies).
      The aim of the present study is to evaluate spironolactone treatment in hemodialysis
      patients.
