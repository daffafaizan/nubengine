      intravaginal culture using INVOcell vs. traditional IVF to generate day 5 embryos Pilot: 40
      couples (80 patients), randomized to receive either intravaginal culture (n=20) using the
      INVOcell or traditional IVF (n=20) Primary Endpoints: Blastocyst generation rate: number of
      day 5 embryos of "good quality" defined as 2BB or greater (expansion of embryo 2,3,4,5 or 6
      and inner cell mass and outer cell mass grades of A or B) or higher using the Gardner Grading
      System divided by the number of eggs incubated Patient acceptability of INVOcell and
      intravaginal culture.

      Secondary Endpoints: Live birth rate: number of cycles with a live birth divided by the
      number of cycles with embryo transfers.

      Clinical pregnancy rate: number of cycles with fetal heartbeat at week 7 divided by the
      number of cycles with embryo transfers.

      Fertilization rate: Number of embryos obtained after incubation divided by the number of
      oocytes placed in the device.

      Embryo transfer rate: Number of cycles initiated divided by the number of cycles with embryo
      transfers Miscarriage rate: Number of miscarriages divided by the number of cycles with
      embryo transfers Multiple rate: Number cycles with twins or triplets divided by the number of
      cycles with embryo transfers Miscarriage rate per clinical pregnancy: Number of miscarriages
      divided by the number of cycles with clinical pregnancy
