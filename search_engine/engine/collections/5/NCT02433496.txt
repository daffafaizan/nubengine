      healthcare by pilot-testing an innovative implementation strategy. The implementation
      strategy aims primarily to reduce variation in opioid prescribing practices for chronic pain
      in primary care settings.

      The standard approach to improving medical practice involves groups of clinical experts
      reviewing the literature to produce clinical guidelines based on scientific evidence, and
      disseminating those guidelines by publishing them in medical journals. A clinical guideline
      has been developed for opioid prescribing for chronic non-cancer pain using this type of
      approach. The implementation strategy for promoting uptake of the guideline in primary care
      settings tested in this study consists of three innovations: (1) a process for translating
      clinical guidelines into a checklist-based implementation guide for clinicians, (2) a
      physician peer coaching model, and (3) implementation support using tools from systems
      engineering. This project teams the experts who developed the guideline for opioid
      prescribing with experts in implementation science and primary care to translate the
      guideline into an actionable, checklist-based implementation guide. If the implementation
      strategy is effective in this pilot test, it will be used in a larger cluster-randomized
      trial to test it against other approaches to evidence-based practice adoption.The long-term
      goal of this research is to improve the adoption of evidence-based practices in primary care
      by producing a generalizable model of change.
