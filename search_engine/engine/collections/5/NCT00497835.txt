      will transmit continuous data to a laptop. Seizures' data (tonic or clonic) will be analyzed
      and transformed into an algorithm (up-graded existing preliminary algorithm).

      In the second phase the algorithm will need to identify seizure events within one minute of
      the onset.

      Both specificity ("false positive") and sensitivity ("false negative) will be than
      calculated.
