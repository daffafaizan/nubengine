      I. To comprehensively detect genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic aberrations in tissue
      samples from patients with osteosarcoma that may play a role in chemoresistance and
      metastasis using high-resolution genome-wide technologies.

      II. To identify recurrent genetic mutations involved in the pathogenesis of osteosarcoma,
      especially for the development of chemoresistance and metastatic tumors.

      III. To identify and validate these biomarkers for new therapeutic targets for patients with
      osteosarcoma, especially those with metastatic disease and whose tumors are resistant to
      standard chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Archived tumor tissue and peripheral blood DNA
      specimens are analyzed for DNA copy number profiling, gene expression profiling, DNA
      methylation profiling, microRNA profiling, and genomic resequencing. Clinical data including
      demographics; date of diagnosis, surgery, chemotherapy, recurrence, progression, and death;
      imaging; toxicity; and pathologic data elements associated with the specimens are also
      collected and analyzed.
