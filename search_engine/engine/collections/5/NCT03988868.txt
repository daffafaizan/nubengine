      electrocardiography, non-invasive blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry, and ETCO2
      monitoring.

      The ONSD will be measured at three different ETCO2 levels (35mmHg, 40mmHg, and 45mmHg). Each
      ETCO2 levels will be maintained within +-2mmHg for 3 minutes.

      A high frequency linear probe will be used to get the images of optic nerve sheath and the
      diameter (ONSD) will be measured at 3 mm from the papillary segment in the transverse plane.
      Mean arterial pressure and heart rate will be recorded during ONSD measurements. The open or
      closure of Fontanelle will be examined after ONSD measurements.

      The ONSD and OND measurements will be performed by two independent researchers who do not
      participate in ultrasound examination using stored images.
