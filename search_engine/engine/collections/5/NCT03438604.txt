    
      2-Way Crossover study

      Approximately 24 healthy, adult male and female subjects will be enrolled.

      Subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences prior to the first TDS application
      in treatment period 1.

      For each treatment period, subjects will have one 7-day TDS applied on their back. Depending
      on which sequence a subject is randomized to, the healthy subject will either be exposed to
      heat or not during the TDS wear time.

      Blood samples for Donepezil PK will be collected pre-dose until the end of each treatment
      period.

      Adhesion will be monitored throughout the TDS wear time, and skin irritation will be
      monitored after TDS removal.

      Subjects who complete the 2-way crossover study may be eligible to participate in the
      optional Study Extension Period. In the Study Extension Period, subjects will have their skin
      surface temperature monitored under the patch and adjacent to the TDS.

      Blood samples for Donepezil PK will not be collected, and adhesion will not be monitored for
      the Study Extension TDS wear period.

      Safety will be monitored throughout the study by adverse event reporting and repeated
      clinical and laboratory evaluations.
