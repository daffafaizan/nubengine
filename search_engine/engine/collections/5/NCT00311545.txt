      Primary

        -  Assess the probability of response (confirmed complete and partial responses) in
           patients with unresectable or metastatic renal cell cancer treated with CNTO 328.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the 6-month progression-free survival probability and median overall survival in
           these patients.

        -  Evaluate the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this treatment.

        -  Investigate, in a preliminary manner, the association of tumor response with potential
           markers of anti-interleukin-6 activity.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive CNTO 328 IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving
      complete or partial response after 6 courses of therapy may receive an additional 6 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
