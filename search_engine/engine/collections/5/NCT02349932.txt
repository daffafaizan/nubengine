      prick and 2-3 milliliters of saliva from you. Using these samples, we will determine your
      blood type (defined by your expression of specific sugars on your red blood cells) and your
      expression pattern of these sugars in body secretions (e.g., saliva). You will provide us
      with a fecal sample collected the day of your appointment. The fecal sample should be
      collected in a pre-provided collection container and should be collected within 12 hours of
      drop-off. Using your fecal sample, we will determine the types of bacteria present in your
      normal gut flora and whether they express the same sugars expressed on your blood cells.
      Tests will be done only for research purposes and will not be evaluated or used to diagnose
      or treat any of your medical problems. Sample collection may need to be repeated if required
      for your medical care in the future.
