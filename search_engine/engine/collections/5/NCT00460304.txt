      means. As such, when patients requiring insulin treatment are treated with pramlintide, the
      bolus insulin does must be reduced. Current recommendations suggest a 50% reduction but in
      our experience and that of a recent study this appears excessive. By using continuous glucose
      monitoring(CGM) to guide pre-meal insulin treatment, we will determine the percentage
      reduction in meal time insulin bolus comparing pre-pramlintide to maximum pramlintide
      treatment. We anticipate that the reduction in bolus dosage will be about 25%. In addition,
      the secondary aim of this study is to determine which bolus pattern, standard, square or dual
      wave, provides the best post-meal glucose control with pramlintide therapy.
