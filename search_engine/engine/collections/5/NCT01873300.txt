      surgical procedure (esophageal myotomy) to treat Achalasia.

      Achalasia is a disease of the esophagus, where the lower esophageal sphincter fails to relax,
      causing difficulty in swallowing.

      Esophageal myotomy (Heller myotomy) is surgically cutting the muscle fibers of the esophageal
      sphincter to allow passage of food into the stomach.

      Esophageal myotomy is routinely done either by laparoscopic or open surgery. Laparoscopic
      surgery requires several (about 4 to 5) small incisions in the abdomen to allow the camera
      and surgical instruments to be introduced into the abdominal cavity to perform the myotomy.
      In open surgery, a 6- to 8-inch abdominal incision is made to gain access to the abdominal
      cavity to perform the myotomy.

      Endoscopic Esophageal Myotomy (POEM), the research procedure, splits the lower esophageal
      sphincter muscle fibers from the inside of the esophagus, avoiding several abdominal
      incisions.

      The researchers are investigating how safe Endoscopic Esophageal Myotomy is and how well it
      works. Additionally, the researchers will assess the level of pain and the amount of scarring
      subjects has after this surgery.
