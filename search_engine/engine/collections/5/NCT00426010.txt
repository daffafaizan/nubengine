      controversy regarding their effectiveness and mechanisms of action.

      The results of the study are expected to further our understanding of a widely used medical
      intervention, i.e., placebo, and of how to maximize its potential beneficial effect. It will
      also help assess the appropriateness of measuring the placebo effect by elimination, which
      has important ethical implications in relation to the design of randomized clinical trials.

      Comparison: caffeine vs placebo. Dependent variables:4 hours area under the curve (AUC) of
      pharmacodynamics endpoints as well as pharmacokinetics endpoints in a subgroup.
