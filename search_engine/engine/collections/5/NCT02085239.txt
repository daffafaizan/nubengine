      (ropivacaine) in providing an extended period of pain relief for patients undergoing
      ultrasound guided core biopsy of the breast. One group of patients will receive lidocaine
      alone for local anesthesia. A second group of patients will similarly receive lidocaine prior
      to tissue sampling, followed by infiltration of the biopsy area with ropivacaine.

      Our hypothesis is that patients who receive a long acting anesthetic (ropivacaine) along with
      the popular short acting anesthetic (lidocaine), will be pain free after the breast biopsy
      procedure for a longer period of time than the patients who only receive lidocaine (the short
      acting anesthetic). This will lessen the emotional and physical trauma associated with the
      procedure and give patients a better experience thereby improving patient care.
