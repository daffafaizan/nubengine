    
      After procedural sedation for fracture or joint dislocation reduction using propofol, adult
      patients recall will be assessed with a standardised form. This recall assessment will be
      realised 2 hours (+/- 15 minutes) after the procedural sedation and the day after.

      The primary outcome measure will be the recall incidence 2 hours (+/- 15 minutes) after a
      procedural sedation. A secondary outcome will be the recall incidence one day after the
      procedural sedation.

      The recall will be defined by a positive answer to the third question of the Sandin form
      (Lancet. 2000;355(9205):707-11).
