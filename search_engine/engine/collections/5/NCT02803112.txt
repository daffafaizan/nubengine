    
      Despite the high incidence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and the high numbers of emergent
      craniotomies for TBI performed worldwide, publications reporting on temporal delays in these
      patients are very scarce. To the best of the investigators' knowledge, there are only 3
      publications providing data on the intra-hospital delay and no publications on pre-hospital
      delay specifically for TBI patients undergoing emergent craniotomies.

      The aim of the present study is to retrospectively map delays between the emergency call of
      the national emergency telephone dispatch to the hospital's medical emergency service (EC)
      and the surgical skin incision in emergent TBI craniotomies in the investigators' level 1
      trauma center and to propose possible measures to improve performance.
