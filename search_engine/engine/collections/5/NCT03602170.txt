      pressure values that are classified as prehypertension. This slight elevation in blood
      pressure has been shown to result in an increased risk for developing hypertension and
      cardiovascular disease. The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention,
      Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC7) recommends lifestyle
      modifications for individuals classified as prehypertensive. One lifestyle modification
      suggested by JNC7 is regular physical activity. Aerobic exercise, like moderate-intensity
      continuous training (MCT), has been shown to improve blood pressure, blood vessel function,
      and arterial stiffness in those with prehypertension. However, a major barrier to exercise
      adherence is the time commitment required. High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT), which
      requires individuals to work at higher intensities for shorter durations, may offer an
      alternative training design that would reduce the time commitment. Previous studies have
      shown HIIT to be equal to or better at improving cardiorespiratory fitness and blood vessel
      function in multiple populations. Limited information is present on HIIT training in those
      with prehypertension. In this study, participants will be randomized into one of the two
      training program designs mentioned above (MCT or HIIT). Both programs will be completed over
      an 8-week period (3 sessions per week) and each training session will be supervised.
      Participants will complete testing visits before and after the training program to collect
      measures of cardiovascular health (exercise capacity, blood pressure, blood vessel function,
      and blood pressure reactivity). The goal is to compare the effects of the training programs
      on these measures of cardiovascular health.
