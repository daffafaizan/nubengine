    
      The proposed study will be a single centre, prospective trial comparing the sensitivity and
      specificity of using Gadofosveset Trisodium (Gdfos, Ablavar) as the MRI contrast agent as
      compared to gadobutrol (EcGd, Gadovist).

      The study population will include cancer patient's referred for an MRI study of the liver to
      rule out metastases. Those who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will their routine
      (clinical) MRI of the liver with EcGd. They will also receive an additional MRI with Gdfos
      within 4 weeks of the original study.

      The patient data will be anonymized and the imaging will be read by radiologists and
      radiology residents and comparison will be made between the diagnostic accuracy of the
      EcGd-enhanced study and the Gdfos-enhanced study.
