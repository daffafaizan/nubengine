      group (n=35) or the intravenous (V) group (n=36) by using a random number table: the test
      group were treated with local analgesia infusion pump of 0.33% ropivacaine through the wound
      for postoperative analgesia, while the control group were treated with intravenous analgesia
      pump infusion of flurbiprofen axetil,palonosetron, pentazocine. At 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, 36, 48
      hours after operation, postoperative pain visual analogue scale(VAS) scores and sedation
      Ramsay scores were used to evaluate the level of pain and sedation, and investigators
      documented the comprehensive evaluation of patients with pain control system, and the
      incidence of adverse reactions. At 24, 48 hours investigators observed the wound whether
      inflammation and exudation or not, and the removal of penetration catheter sent to clinical
      laboratory for bacterial culture. Investigators also recorded the length of time to discharge
      and called to ask pain conditions at the first 3 months.
