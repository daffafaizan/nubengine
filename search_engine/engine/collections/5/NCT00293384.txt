      Primary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of the addition of aprepitant in controlling acute vomiting with
           the standard prophylactic anti-emetic combination of granisetron hydrochloride and
           dexamethasone in patients receiving therapy comprising high-dose cyclophosphamide to
           mobilize stem cells prior to leukapheresis for autologous stem cell transplantation.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of the addition of aprepitant in controlling delayed vomiting in
           these patients.

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of the addition of aprepitant in controlling overall nausea in
           these patients.

        -  Identify side effects of the addition of aprepitant to this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive granisetron hydrochloride orally or IV and oral dexamethasone,
      followed 1 hour later by cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day 1. Patients also receive
      oral aprepitant once daily on days 1-3. Treatment continues in absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
