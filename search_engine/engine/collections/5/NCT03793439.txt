      Objective 1: Test the hypothesis that the addition of tofacitinib will allow patients with
      sarcoidosis to have 50% or greater reduction in their corticosteroid requirement without a
      significant decrease in pulmonary function testing, and with a similar quality of life as
      measured by a validated questionnaire (1).

      Objective 2: Test the hypothesis that the addition of tofacitinib will result in
      significantly decreased expression of signal transducer and activator of transcription
      (STAT)-1 dependent gene expression.

      Outline:

      This is a 16-week open-label, interventional, proof of concept, hypothesis-generating study.
      All subjects will receive Tofacitinib 5mg twice daily for 16 weeks. After four weeks on
      Tofacitinib, the corticosteroid will be tapered per a pre-defined protocol; once a reduction
      of 50% has been achieved, any further taper will be per physician discretion. After 16 weeks,
      subjects who meet the primary end-point will be permitted an optional one year open-label
      extension.
