      operating at a wavelength of 577 nm will improve therapeutic outcome as compared to a pulsed
      dye laser operating at 595 nm.

      The researcher can treat port wine stain treated using a pulsed dye laser operating at a
      wavelength of 577 nm and the other half at a wavelength of 595 nm. The researcher can
      determine that the 577 nm pulsed dye laser improved port wine stain blanching responses more
      than the areas treated with 595 nm.

      The degree of port wine stain blanching which will determine by visible reflectance
      spectroscopy skin imaging device measurements. Post-treatment blanching responses can compare
      with pre-treatment measurements of port wine stain fractional blood volume.
