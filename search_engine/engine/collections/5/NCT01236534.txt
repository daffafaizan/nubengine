      nervous system. Normally, nerve fibers carry electrical impulses through the spinal cord,
      providing communication between the brain and the bowel. In people with MS, the covering
      around the nerve fibers deteriorates, causing nerve impulses to be slowed or stopped. as a
      result, patients with MS may experiences constipation.
