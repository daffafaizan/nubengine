      studies and systematic reviews failed to demonstrate the superiority of either general or
      regional anesthesia. However, continuous spinal anesthesia has been shown to preserve
      hemodynamics better than general and single shoot spinal anesthesia. However, hypotension
      still occurs with continuous spinal anesthesia.

      Unilateral spinal anesthesia may be achieved by hypobaric bupivacaine when patients are in
      the lateral position. Unilateral spinal anesthesia is more effective in preserving
      hemodynamics by limiting the spread of the sympathetic blockade to the operated side.

      Our goal is to show that the use of hypobaric rather than isobaric bupivacaine in continuous
      spinal anesthesia for surgical repair of hip fracture reduces incidence of hypotension.
