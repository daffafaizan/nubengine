        -  Group 1: participants in this group will engage in weekly psycho-educational sessions
           with an HIV therapist for four weeks prior to starting their regimens. The sessions will
           cover topics such as becoming active in treatment care, improving coping abilities and
           developing skills for treatment adherence. They will also involve questionnaires and
           readings.

        -  Group 2 (the control group):participants in this group will simply receive their regular
           treatment regimens.
