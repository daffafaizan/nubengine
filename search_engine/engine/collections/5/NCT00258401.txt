        -  Compare the nutritional status, Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) score, and fecal
           incontinence quality of life (FI-QOL) in patients with uterine, cervical, or prostate
           cancer who are undergoing pelvic radiotherapy receiving a low-residue diet vs no dietary
           intervention.

        -  Compare changes in the CTC score and FI-QOL in patients receiving a low-residue diet vs
           no dietary intervention.

        -  Compare the efficacy, in terms of a lower CTC score or higher perceived FI-QOL, of a
           low-residue diet vs no dietary intervention in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a parallel, randomized, controlled, pilot study. Patients are stratified
      according to cancer type. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      All patients are interviewed to obtain a baseline grade of diarrhea (according to NCI's
      Common Toxicity Criteria [CTC] scale) and dietary history and measure Fecal Incontinence
      Quality of Life (FI-QOL).

        -  Arm I (intervention): At the onset of diarrhea symptoms, patients are instructed to eat
           a low-residue diet. Patients continue on this diet for 2-4 weeks. They are interviewed
           weekly for up to 6 weeks to monitor dietary intake, bowel symptoms, diarrhea events,
           FI-QOL, and changes in CTC scores.

        -  Arm II (control): Patients undergo no dietary intervention but are interviewed as in arm
           I.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
