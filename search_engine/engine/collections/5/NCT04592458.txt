      cells will be collected and modified with LentiHBBT87Q system to restore the β-globin
      expression. After conditioning, the β-globin restored autologous hematopoietic stem cells
      will be infused back to patients, and a 2 years follow up visit will be conducted and the
      data will be collected. Participants in this study will be also asked to participant in a
      subsequent follow up study that will monitor the long-term safety and efficacy of the
      treatment for up to 13 years post-transplantation.
