    
      This is an experimental clinical trial in double-blinded randomized controlled design on 50
      children aged 10 months to 21 months who underwent general anesthesia with sevoflurane for
      labioplasty surgery. Fifteen minutes before inhalation anesthetics were discontinued, the
      subjects were randomly given a placebo or a single dose of diphenhydramine 0, 5 mg / kg
      intravenously. Subjects were extubated and observed in the recovered space conscious for any
      agitation or emergence delirium and feasability to return to the ward. Agitation or emergence
      delirium was assessed by the Pediatric Emergence Agitation and Delirium Score (PAEDS) whereas
      feasability to return to the ward scored with the Steward score. When PAEDS> 10 patients were
      assessed to be agitated or having emergence delirium and administeres rescue tranquilizer
      ketamine 0.1 mg / kg. Total rescue tranquilizers and clinically significant adverse effects
      of drugs also recorded.
