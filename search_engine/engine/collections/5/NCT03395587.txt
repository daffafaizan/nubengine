    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, phase 2 study, integrating vaccination with
      tumorlysate-loaded mature dendritic cells into standard radio/temozolomide-chemotherapy of
      newly diagnosed glioblastoma patients with near-complete resection after fluorescence-guided
      resection. Only patients with confirmed gross-total resection and a residual tumor volume
      below 5 ml will be eligible for the trial. Vaccination will be performed after radio- and
      concomitant temozolomide chemotherapy and during the first three cycles of adjuvant TMZ.
