      Impaired breathing often leads to tracheotomy, deterioration of the voice leads to
      communication problems with others and swallowing problems are often present, as well The
      main causes of laryngotracheal stenosis are post intubation and post tracheostomy conditions,
      inflammatory process (often autoimmune), tumors (mainly squamous cell carcinoma and
      chondroma) and trauma. Within the last years there is substantial shift in the treatment
      strategy from open surgery to endoscopic techniques. However, surgical treatment is often
      difficult due to demanding exposure of tumor and problematic margins control.

      In recent years there has been a development of particular techniques of endoscopic resection
      of tumors and non-malignant laryngeal glottic and subglottic stenosis using a carbon dioxide
      (CO2) laser with promising improvement of treatment results.

      However, CO2 laser has some limitations, particularly in the treatment of tumors spreading
      into anterior commissure, because CO2 laser beam cannot get "around the corner". Moreover,
      subglottic area is also difficult to be reached by CO2 laser beam. Therefore, contact laser
      with adjustable manipulators with possibility to bend tip of manipulator according to the
      actual need seems to be of some advantage.
