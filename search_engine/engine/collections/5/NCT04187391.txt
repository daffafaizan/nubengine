    
      45 patients with avPPA, will be recruited from IRCCS Istituto Centro San Giovanni di Dio
      Brescia, Italy and ASST Spedali Civili Brescia, Italy .

      Inclusion criteria will be a diagnosis avPPA according to the current clinical criteria
      (Gorno-Tempini et al., 2011) and a FTD Clinical Dementia Rating score >0.5 and <2. Exclusion
      criteria will be the presence of any medical or psychiatric illness that could interfere in
      completing assessments and the presence of any medical condition that represents a
      contraindication to tDCS. All the patients will undergo five consecutive days a week for two
      weeks of treatment sessions:

      15 patients will receive Active tDCS over DLPFC while performing a language training; 15
      patients will receive placebo tDCS during language training; 15 patients will receive Active
      tDCS over DLPFC during unstructured cognitive training.

      Two trained neuropsychologists will administer the neuropsychological testing in two
      sessions. At baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1) and 3-months (T2) follow-up assessments were
      conducted by the same assessor. Blood sample withdrawal at baseline (T0) and after the
      DLPFC-tDCS intervention (T1) will be assessed.

      To elucidate the mechanisms underlying tDCS effects, structural imaging, functional
      connectivity (fMRI) alterations and concentration changes of hemoglobin (fNIRS) will be
      collected off-line. Each avPPA patient will undergo an MRI scan at the ASST Spedali Civili
      Brescia, Italy at T0 and T1 and a fNIRS acquisition at the IRCCS Istituto Centro San Giovanni
      di Dio Brescia, Italy at T0, T1 and T2.
