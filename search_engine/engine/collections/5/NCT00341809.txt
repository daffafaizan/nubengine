      (KIR) in the natural history of psoriasis vulgaris. Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory
      disease of the skin with features of an autoimmune disease, and previous studies have
      revealed an association with certain HLA class I alleles, notably HLA-Cw*0602. Natural Killer
      (NK) cells are a unique group of lymphocytes involved in surveillance of killing of foreign
      or infected cells through a mechanism involving recognition of HLA class I molecules by an
      extremely diverse set of receptors on the NK cell surface. A major group of these receptors
      are the KIRs. Thus, a relationship between KIR/HLA genotype and psoriasis is biologically
      plausible, and indeed previous data from our laboratory have shown a strong association with
      the activating genes KIR2DS1 and KIR2DS2 and development of psoriatic arthritis, a
      well-recognized complication of psoriasis.

      Dr. James Elder and colleagues at the University of Michigan have identified a cohort of more
      than 560 families through the dermatology services of the University of Michigan Medical
      Center, the University of Kiel, Henry Ford Hospital, and the National Psoriasis Foundation
      Tissue Bank. Individuals have been well characterized clinically, and information on race,
      ethnicity, age at onset, current age, and history of inflammatory bowel disease and/or other
      autoimmune disorders has been obtained. The large size of the cohort will provide substantial
      statistical power, which is of major importance in any KIR/HLA association study.
