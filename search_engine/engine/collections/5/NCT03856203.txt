      protein-restricted diet (protein intake less than the RDA for protein based on weight (0.8
      g/kg/day) with or without a PKU medical food) within 90 days of starting pegvaliase
      (baseline) and 9 and 15 months later. The investigators will collect laboratory measures of
      nutrition status, anthropometrics, Dual-Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DXA) to measure body
      composition and bone mineral density (BMD), and indirect calorimetry to measure resting
      energy expenditure (REE). In addition, three-day food records will be obtained to assess
      protein intake and overall diet quality.
