      contact lens wear and 33 normal control subjects will be involved in study. One experienced
      ophthalmologist will evaluate the DED symptoms and signs, which include ocular surface
      disease index(OSDI), tear film breakup time(TBUT), Schirmer Ⅰ test, corneal fluorescein
      staining, lissamine green staining and meibomian gland dropout rate. After evaluating,
      corneal sensitivity are measured using a Cochet-Bonnet aesthesiometer. Corneal nerve
      morphology will be assessed in the right eye using in vivo confocal microscopy(IVCM). Fifteen
      to twenty minutes after IVCM, 20μL of basal tears will be collected from the inferior
      meniscus of each participant to test tear neuropeptides. Then investigators analyse the
      correlation of corneal nerve changes and DED symptoms and signs.
