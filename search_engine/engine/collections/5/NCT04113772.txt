      The specific aim is to conduct a randomized, single dose, three-period crossover
      bioequivalence study in at least 18 healthy male and female subjects at a single study center
      to evaluate the in vivo performance of two formulations of Nitisinone 10 mg and the reference
      product Orfadin under fasting.

      A total of 4 healthy female and male volunteers (age 18 to 55 years old) will be entered into
      the study. Volunteers will be determined to be free of significant medical conditions as
      assessed by medical history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Volunteers will
      be randomly allocated to a treatment sequence, before administration of investigational
      nitinosine

      Determination of succinylacetone (SA) in blood (serum/plasma) and/or urine will be performed.
      Results from samples analyzed at the central laboratory, including determination of
      nitisinone, will be used in the evaluation of pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety during
      the two treatment periods.
