      remission without medication must be maintained at full acute-treatment dose. To compare the
      efficacy of full-dose vs half-dose nortriptyline (NT) in preventing recurrences of major
      depression in the elderly. To determine whether those patients who experience a recurrence
      while in a maintenance placebo condition (Study I) require 100 percent of their
      acute-treatment dose of NT to prevent subsequent recurrences or can be successfully
      maintained on 50 percent of their acute-treatment dose (Study II).

      Investigators expect a pool of 60 patients from Study I to become eligible for Study II (the
      full-dose/half-dose maintenance trial). After treatment of the recurrence and following 16
      weeks of stabilization therapy, patients are randomized to 1 of 2 maintenance therapy cells:
      full-dose NT or half-dose NT. Maintenance lasts 2 years or until recurrence of major
      depression. The following are assessed: differences in recurrence rates and time to
      recurrence under full-dose vs half-dose conditions; differences in symptomatic ratings of
      depression, suicidal ideation, social adjustment, and side effects; and differences in
      compliance rates as determined by variability in level-to-dose (L/D) ratios. Exploratory data
      analyses are used to generate a hypothetical profile of elderly patients who can remain well
      on half-dose maintenance nortriptyline.
