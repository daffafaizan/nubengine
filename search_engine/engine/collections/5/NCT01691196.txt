      example, chronic exposure of the peritoneal cavity to PD solution leads to induction of
      cytokines and other inflammatory mediators, generating peritoneal membrane inflammation which
      results in functional decline of ultrafiltration. Obesity is characterized by a state of
      chronic low-grade systemic inflammation stemming from expanded adipose tissue mass. Animal
      studies from our group and others suggest that obesity is associated with exacerbated
      prolonged inflammatory responses in the peritoneal cavity. The shifting demographic
      characteristics of the ESRD population, with a rise in elderly patients and those with
      obesity, is as a significant challenge for management of dialysis patients. Specifically, a
      2-fold increase in the percentage of obese patients in the ESRD population has been reported.
      The caloric burden of PD glucose-containing solutions adds an additional risk for development
      or exacerbation of obesity and diabetes in patients using this dialysis modality. Few studies
      have directly evaluated the association between degree of adiposity and inflammation in PD
      patients. Data obtained from the proposed experiments will help clarify the connection
      between obesity and risk factors for cardiovascular and infectious diseases in the PD
      population. These data will also further our knowledge of the basic pathophysiology of both
      obesity and ESRD and enhance our understanding of factors involved in successful delivery of
      PD. Results may lead to enhanced nutritional recommendations for PD patients and/or the use
      of low-glucose or non-glucose alternatives, with a resultant reduction in local and/or
      systemic inflammation and CVD and other risk factors.
