      device relative to topical lidocaine in treating dyspareunia among breast cancer survivors.
      The large and growing population of breast cancer survivors experience a significant burden
      of urogenital symptoms including dyspareunia. Several studies have evaluated the feasibility
      and effectiveness of CO2 lasers for the treatment of symptomatic vulvovaginal atrophy in
      postmenopausal women suggesting improvements in atrophy symptoms with favorable histological
      and microscopic changes. There is little know about the effectiveness of CO2 laser therapy in
      breast cancer survivors.

      Patients who are breast cancer survivors experiencing dyspareunia and desiring intervention
      will be randomized to two cohorts: (1) Treatment with the CO2RE laser or (2) application of
      4% aqueous lidocaine applied to the vulvar vestibule for 3 minutes before vaginal
      penetration. The primary outcome will be the overall as well as lubrication, satisfaction,
      and pain domain scores on the Female Sexual Function Index instrument. Secondary outcomes
      will be according to other validated pain and pelvic floor symptom instruments.

      Following initiation of treatment, both groups will follow up at one-week, 1-month, 3-months,
      and 6-months. At the 3-month assessment, subjects in the lidocaine arm will be given the
      option to undergo CO2RE laser therapy. A combination of validated and non-validated physical
      exam and survey instruments will be utilized at each visit in order to assess pelvic floor
      function, bowel and bladder function, and sexual function before and after treatment.
