      increased by 15%, with about 90,000 people under duress making France one of the European
      countries where practice most under stress. Being homeless, from a visible ethnic minority,
      combined with the lack of alternatives in the territory are well-documented risk factors for
      being hospitalized under duress. A review of the 2015 literature has shown that
      out-of-hospital crisis sites achieve results equivalent to those of conventional
      hospitalization in terms of reduced symptomatology and would have better outcomes in terms of
      increase in remission and recovery times of professional activity and social inclusion, with
      greater efficiency. In Marseille, an experimental device has shown its capacity to propose an
      alternative to hospitalization, for this type of population.Running the lessons of this
      experiment and inspired by the experimentation Parachute, a new device experimental, called
      "Place of respite", This place proposes a model of resolution of the psychotic crisis where
      the person decides the type of care that she wish to receive. It is a device that is
      therefore an alternative to conventional psychiatric care under duress. The investigators
      formulate the hypothesis that alternative support to the resolution of the crisis by using
      the skills of people with disorders severe psychiatric conditions in the experimental
      "Respite site" decreases in the short term the number of hospitalizations and their duration,
      as well as the experience of the constraint in the course of care of these people, compared
      to the subjects who did not benefit from this device and could represent a model of crisis
      management / psychiatric emergency efficient with regard to the current offer.
