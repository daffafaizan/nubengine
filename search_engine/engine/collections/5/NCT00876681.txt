    
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the relationship between perineural catheter placement technique
      (ultrasound-guidance and electrical stimulation) and quality of postoperative analgesia
      during continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks following moderate-to-severely painful
      orthopedic surgery.

      Hypothesis 1: When inserting a perineural catheter for a continuous peripheral nerve block,
      the use of electrical stimulation, as compared with ultrasound-guidance, is associated with
      decreased pain the morning following moderate-to-severely painful orthopedic surgery as
      measured with a numeric rating scale.

      Specific Aim 2: To determine the relationship between perineural catheter placement technique
      (ultrasound-guidance and electrical stimulation) and degree of sensory deficit during
      continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks following moderate-to-severely painful orthopedic
      surgery.

      Hypothesis 2: When inserting a perineural catheter for a continuous peripheral nerve block,
      the use of electrical stimulation, as compared with ultrasound-guidance, is associated with
      increased sensory deficit the day following moderate-to-severely painful orthopedic surgery
      as measured with a simple 0-10 scale (0=no numbness; 10=completely insensate) of the part of
      the foot with the greatest sensory deficit at the time of the data-collection phone call.
