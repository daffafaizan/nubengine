      trial (C-RCT) study that primarily aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of MyBFF@school
      program on overweight and obese school childrens' BMI for age (BMI z-score) and body fat
      percentage at 3 and 6 months post intervention. Primary and secondary schools in the central
      region of Peninsular Malaysia were randomised to either intervention or control school via
      systematic random sampling method. The selected intervention schools underwent MyBFF@school
      programme that consisted of physical activity, nutrition and psychology modules, whereas the
      control schools followed the standard national school curriculum.
