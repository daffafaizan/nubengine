      treatment of Asian subjects with locally advanced and/or metastatic renal cell carcinoma
      (RCC) enrolled from selected Far-East Asian countries. The primary objective is to evaluate
      the primary endpoint progression free survival in the enrolled Asian subjects treated with
      pazopanib versus those treated with sunitinib. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the
      following secondary endpoints in each treatment arm: objective response rate, duration of
      response, time to response, overall survival and safety. Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1
      ratio to receive either 800mg pazopanib to be administered once daily orally continuous
      dosing or 50mg sunitinib to be administered in 6-week cycles: 50mg orally daily for 4 weeks
      followed by 2 weeks off treatment. Subjects are permitted to receive supportive care
      throughout the study including transfusion of blood and blood products, treatment with
      antibiotics, anti-emetics, anti-diarrheal agents, analgesics, erythropoietin, or
      bisphosphonates, when appropriate. The study treatment will continue until subjects
      experience disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdraw consent, or death.
