    
      This is an international, prospective, open-label, multicenter, single arm, two-stage Simon
      Design phase II clinical trial, with the primary objective of assessing the efficacy of
      nal-IRI single agent in a cohort of HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients
      with CNS involvement.

      Eligible patients will have histologically proven diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the breast,
      they must have progressed to at least one prior chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic
      setting and must have been progressed in CNS to previous local treatment (Surgery and/or WBRT
      and/or SRS) showing at least one measurable lesion in the CNS (symptomatic meningeal
      carcinomatosis is not permitted). Eligible patients must have been previously received at
      least treatment with taxanes (either in the neo/adjuvant or in the metastatic scenario).
      Patients could not be eligible if they are candidates for a local treatment with a radical
      intention.

      Patients will be accrued in a two-stage design. Considering a drop-out rate of 10%, the
      accrual goal will be a total of 63 patients in both stages (first stage will include 23
      evaluable patients and the second stage will include 33 more evaluable patients).
