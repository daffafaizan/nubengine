      Lidocaine infusion during and after abdominal surgery decreases postoperative pain and
      reduces ileus duration, reducing patient´s hospital stay and opioid consumption. Intravenous
      lidocaine´s effect on other intravenous anesthetics is unclear, and there are no present
      studies evaluating its interaction on hypnotic anesthetic requirements when using a BIS
      (Bispectral Index) monitor to maintain an adequate depth of anesthesia. We therefore decided
      to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the interaction of systemic lidocaine
      infusion, initiated and maintained during surgery, on propofol requirements and anesthetic
      depth as measured by BIS.
