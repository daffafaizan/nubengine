      evidence on the health benefits of air pollution interventions, the objectives of this study
      are: 1) quantify the relationship between low-level exposures to combustion-derived PM air
      pollution and subclinical indicators of cardiovascular disease risk; and 2) compare the
      relative impact of HEPA filtration for two major PM sources (traffic and residential wood
      combustion) on these indicators.

      The use of HEPA filters may help to mitigate cardiovascular risks factors caused by
      combustion-derived air pollution (CDAP), (specifically woodstove and traffic emissions). We
      hypothesize that HEPA filter use and improved woodstove technology will help decrease indoor
      occurrences of CDAP. This project will help address knowledge gaps in CDAP-related health
      risks and benefits of interventions. Specific objectives include establishing a relationship
      between exposure to CDAP and biomarkers of cardiovascular risk and evaluating the impact of
      HEPA filter use towards improved indoor air quality and health indicators.
