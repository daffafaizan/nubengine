      women embodies the transition of role from a known situation to an unknown one. Being a
      special period in which women hold the role of motherhood together with the birth of the
      child; try to adapt the new role and reform relationship with the family members at the same
      time, transition to motherhood is a progressive period experienced by many women. Transition
      of woman to motherhood in a healthy manner will positively affect developing trust, achieving
      healthy communication with the infant, adapting to new lifestyle and fulfilling her
      responsibilities. Thus, transition to motherhood is quite significant both for mother and
      other family members and the new-born infant and needs to be discussed.
