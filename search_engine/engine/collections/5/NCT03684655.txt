    
      The PET radiofluorinated imaging agent, [18F]F-AraG
      (2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro-9-Î²-D-arabinofuranosylguanine; trade name VisAcT) localizes to sites of
      immune activation and is predominantly accumulated in proliferative T cells. As a result,
      there is interest in imaging residual immune activation in the setting of both treated and
      untreated HIV-1 infection, a disease in which chronic immune activation and inflammation may
      lead to significant morbidity, despite the use of otherwise suppressive ART.

      The primary endpoint is to determine the anatomical distribution of [18F]F-AraG in
      HIV-infected individuals taking or not taking antiretroviral therapy.

      Secondary objectives are to determine if [18F]F-AraG PET-MRI is able to detect differences in
      T cell activation between patients with early versus late treated HIV infection and to
      determine if [18F]F-AraG uptake correlates with direct blood and tissue measures of HIV
      reservoir size and activity in the above cohorts/studies.
