      professionals (HCPs) and these in turn can result in patients receiving sub-optimal care out
      of step with current guidelines (NICE, 2016). Darlow et al (2012) found that healthcare
      professionals management techniques did not reflect recognised treatment guidelines and this
      was associated with their biomedical view of chronic pain.

      Pain education/training sessions for health care staff may be an important step towards
      improving patient care for chronic pain. Keen et al (2017) found that there was improvement
      in nurses' knowledge after 2 different pain education sessions delivered to nurses however
      there was no long term follow up. Furthermore, no studies have targeted all members of staff
      at a GP surgery who will interact with the patient, and thus impact upon the care they
      receive.

      Pain Neuroscience education (PNE) is an approach to pain education which uses pain science
      information to shift the belief system of the receiver away from a biomedical understanding
      of pain to a more biopsychosocial understanding of pain.

      A number of studies have shown that this education can decrease biomedical attitudes in
      health care students (Colleary et al. 2017; Maguire et al, 2018). Thus, it may be that this
      education could produce similar positive effects in GP practice staff that could have
      positive implications for the care of patients with chronic pain.

      Thus this study aims to assess the impact on attitudes and beliefs of pain education upon
      staff at a GP surgery in Middlesbrough. Attitudes and beliefs will be assessed before and
      after the delivery of education. In addition participants will be invited to attend one of
      two focus groups to further discuss their findings or thoughts about the lecture.
