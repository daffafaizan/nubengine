      Cambodian mothers and thiamine levels will be measured in their blood and breast milk before
      and after supplementation. Their infant's blood thiamine levels will also be measured. A
      control arm of American breast feeding mothers taking prenatal vitamins will also be
      enrolled, to allow comparison of maternal blood and breast milk levels between Cambodian and
      American mothers. Ethics committee approval was obtained in Cambodia (National Ethics
      Committee for Health Research #208, 2011) and in the United States (Mayo Clinic Rochester IRB
      #12-004047)for the Cambodian and American portions of the protocol, respectively.
