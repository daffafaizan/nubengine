    
      Primary objectives

      Phase I:

      To determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of
      increasing doses of IV Acadesine administered on D1, D3, D5, D8, D10 and D12 of 28 to 56
      day-courses

      Phase II:

      To confirm safety and hematological toxicity in 18 additional patients

      Secondary objectives:

      Phase I:

        -  To determine response rates, as defined by the 2006 modified IWG criteria,

        -  To evaluate response duration, time to IPSS progression, and loss of RBC transfusion
           independence in these patients.

        -  To evaluate hospitalization duration, rates of rehospitalization for non-hematological
           toxicities, severe bleeding or febrile neutropenia.

      Phase II:

      To determine

        -  response rate as defined by the 2006 modified IWG criteria

        -  toxicity profile and safety

        -  response duration

        -  rate of progression to AML

        -  overall survival
