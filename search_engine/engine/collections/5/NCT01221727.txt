    
      Approximately 27 subjects (Group A: 18; Group B: 9) will receive a 2 mg oral dose of
      midazolam on day 1 followed by a 24 hour PK collection. Subjects randomized to Group A will
      receive a single 60 mg subcutaneous (SC) dose of denosumab on day 2 administered in the
      abdomen. On study day 16, another 2 mg oral dose of midazolam will be administered to all
      subjects (Groups A and B) followed by a 24 hour PK collection. The primary analysis to
      determine the effect of denosumab on the PK of midazolam will be based on data from subjects
      in Group A only.
