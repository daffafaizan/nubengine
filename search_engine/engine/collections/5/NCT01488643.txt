      asthma is high.

      Problems from the respiratory system increase the morbidity, as they are a significant part
      of perioperative complications.

      The frequency and the severity of bronchospasm have not been studied. Any data concerning the
      bronchospasm will lead to better perioperative management.

      In this study the investigators study any sign of bronchospasm during surgery in obese
      patients.
