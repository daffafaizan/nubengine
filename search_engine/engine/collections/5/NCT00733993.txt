      Aim 1. To characterize the behavioral and subjective effects of acute caffeine administration
      in cocaine-dependent subjects, using laboratory measures of impulse control, drug
      discrimination (with d-amphetamine as the training dose), and subjective effects.

      Hypotheses related to Aim 1:

        1. Subjects will show decreases in impulsivity (delay to reward and response inhibition)
           after acute oral doses of caffeine compared to placebo.

        2. Subjects will show some stimulant-like subjective effects following acute oral doses of
           caffeine, but not the euphoric effects that would predict abuse potential.
