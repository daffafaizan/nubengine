    
      Urinary determination of [TIMP-2] x [IGFBP7] in patients with ACS undergoing cardiac
      catheterization would allow early identification of those patients vulnerable to IC-induced
      toxicity and adjustment of both appropriate preventive measures.

      A prospective, descriptive observational study will be carried out to determine sensitivity
      and specificity of the urinary determination of TIMP2-IGFBP7 and predictive values in the
      early diagnosis of contrast-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) in patients admitted to the
      Coronary Care Unit (CCU) in a spanish hospital.

      OBJECTIVES

        -  PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: To determine the operational characteristics (sensitivity,
           specificity) of the TIMP2-IGFBP7 biomarker in routine clinical practice, in the early
           diagnosis of contrast-induced AKI (acute renal injury) in patients admitted to the CCU,
           exposed to iodinated contrasts. The established renal failure is defined as KDIGO
           (Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes) stage ≥ 2 in the 24 to 72 hours after the
           administration of contrasts.

        -  SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

      Evaluate these parameters according to the patient's initial risk level:

        -  Estimated renal function upon admission

        -  Initial severity estimated by GRACE score

        -  Sex

        -  Age

        -  Contrast media type and volume

        -  Patient weight

        -  Dose of contrast

        -  Diabetes

      A single determination (10 ml of fresh urine) should be collected in a sterile container and
      the laboratory should centrifuge them within the time of collection. Neither the attending
      physicians nor the investigators will know the results, and the treatment will not be
      influenced.

      The result is reported as a single value which is the concentration of TIMP-2 (ng / mL)
      multiplied by the concentration of IGFBP7 (ng / mL) divided by 1000. The result is reported
      without any unit or concentrations of individual biomarkers. As previously reported, a value
      of> 0.3 identifies patients with a high probability of presenting a moderate to severe AKI
      (acute kidney injury) in 12 hours, while a value of ≤ 0.3 identifies patients with a low risk
      of developing a moderate to serious AKI

      An aliquot of urine will be stored at -80 ° C in the Clinical Analysis Department
