      countries. Patients with TCP often have malabsorption leading to nutritional deficiencies. We
      have noted that vitamin D deficiency is common in patients with TCP. The ideal regimen for
      supplementing vitamin D3 in chronic pancreatitis remains unclear and there are no previous
      studies available. High dose oral vitamin D2 has been shown to be ineffective in normalizing
      vitamin D levels in patients with pancreatic insufficiency due to cystic fibrosis.

      Intramuscular (IM) vitamin D3 supplementation in chronic pancreatitis has certain advantages.
      Firstly, decreased and inconsistent absorption from the intestine is avoided. Secondly, IM
      vitamin D3 has a long duration of action (6-12 months). The safety of high-dose IM vitamin D3
      has been proven in previous studies in healthy individuals. Finally, the injection form is
      considerably less expensive as compared to oral vitamin D3.

      The aim of the current prospective double blind study is to compare 2 regimens of high dose
      IM vitamin D3 replenishment with oral vitamin D3 in standard recommended doses in normalizing
      serum vitamin D3 levels in patients with TCP.
