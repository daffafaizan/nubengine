      Giant-cell arteritis (GCA) is an immune-mediated disease that mostly affects people older
      than 50 years of age. Glucocorticoid (GC) treatment dramatically alters the symptoms and
      course of GCA, reducing the likelihood of vascular complications that could lead e.g. to
      blindness. However, relapses usually occur when GC dosages are tapered, resulting in frequent
      re-treatment with high cumulative dosages of GC over time with substantial toxicity and
      morbidity (e.g. diabetes mellitus, infections, enhanced cardiovascular risk, osteoporotic
      fractures, cataracts).

      Therefore, novel therapies are needed that effectively reduce the dose and duration of GC
      treatment and provide more durable remissions of GCA.

      Tocilizumab (TCZ) is a humanized monoclonal antibody directed against the human interleukin-6
      receptor (IL-6R). Elevated tissue and serum levels of IL-6 have been implicated in giant cell
      arteritis. Inhibition of IL-6 and/or its receptor therefore represents a new and novel
      approach for the treatment of RA.

      Objective

      The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients that have achieved complete remission of
      disease (normal ESR and CRP + absence of signs and symptoms) at Week 12 at a GC dose of 0.1
      mg/kg/d of prednisone.

      Methods

      2-arm (Tocilizumab + Glucocorticoids (GCs) vs. Placebo + GCs), randomized,
      placebo-controlled, double blind, monocentric trial in patients with newly onset or relapsing
      giant cell arteritis (GCA), satisfying ACR criteria AND an elevated sedimentation rate above
      40 mm/h and a CRP > 20 mg/L AND a biopsy proven GCA OR a large vessel vasculitis assessed by
      MR Angiography (MRA).
