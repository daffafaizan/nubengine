      performed by Dr. Assadi for congenital hydronephrosis and by outpatient problem lists with
      congenital hydronephrosis of Dr. Assadi's existing patients. Once identified, the patient's
      grade of hydronephrosis will be recorded from initial ultrasound based on Society of Fetal
      Urology (SFU) classification. If no initial SFU classification was assigned to the
      hydronephrosis a pediatric radiologist will review the initial ultrasound images and classify
      the grade of hydronephrosis based upon SFU criteria. The patients ensuing evaluation of their
      hydronephrosis that took place will then be recorded and de-identified. Data to be collected
      will include: Ultrasound evaluations of the abdomen, retroperitoneum, or renal system,
      Voiding Cysto-Urethrogram (VCUGs), nuclear studies: diuretic enhanced technetium-99m
      dietylene triamine penta-acetic acid renogram (DTPA) or technetium-99m
      Mercapto-acetyl-triglycine renogram (MAG3), referral to pediatric urology for pyeloplasty,
      serum electrolytes, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine, urinalysis, urinary tract
      infections, and placement on long-term antibiotic prophylaxis.

      The follow up evaluation that took place for each patient will then be compared to our
      proposed algorithm for congenital hydronephrosis evaluation and treatment. This algorithm
      will be designed based on clinical experience of expert opinion and literature review of each
      step in the evaluation and treatment. Primary outcomes will be progressive renal function
      decline and progression to referral to a pediatric urologist for pyeloplasty. Secondary
      outcomes will be incidence of urinary tract infections and placement on long term antibiotic
      prophylaxis for urinary tract infection prophylaxis.
