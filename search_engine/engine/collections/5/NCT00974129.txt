      size and growth rate. In addition to the initial visit, patients will return to our clinic
      for evaluation at two weeks, one month, two months, six months, and one year. At each visit,
      patients' hemangiomas will be measured and photographed. At one point over the course of
      evaluation, a blood sample will be taken from each patient for evaluation of C/T polymorphism
      at CTCF binding site six.
