      being treated with bevacizumab. Bevacizumab is a drug that your doctor believes is the best
      treatment option available to subjects at this time for this type of tumor. Bevacizumab
      affects the growth of blood vessels by tumors such as glioblastoma, thus effectively starving
      the tumor of oxygen and food.

      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a test done by a machine in the radiology department that
      takes pictures of your body using special magnets, rather than X-rays. With a new MRI scan
      technique the investigators can take very, very detailed images of the vessel and tumor
      structure. This project will allow us to compare the images of vessel and tumor structure to
      the effectiveness of Bevacizumab as a treatment option. With this project the investigators
      will hopefully develop an accurate way to predict whether or not Bevacizumab will be an
      effective treatment option for patients.
