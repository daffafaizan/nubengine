      study in subjects with mild to moderate dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Only the subject
      and their caregiver will be blinded to the study treatment. The study will consist of two
      cohorts of subjects (20 subjects per cohort), randomized in a 1:1 allocation to receive
      active study drug or placebo. Cohort 1 will receive a single intravenous dose of hMSCs of 1.5
      million cells per kilogram body weight on their Study Day 1, and Cohort 2 will receive equal
      volume of Lactated Ringer's Solution on their Study Day 1. At the six-month time point for
      each subject after their first infusion, Cohort 1 will receive a single intravenous dose of
      Lactated Ringer's Solution and Cohort 2 will receive a single intravenous dose of hMSCs at
      1.5 million cells per kilogram of the subject's body weight. Approximately 40 subjects will
      be enrolled in this study. An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board will conduct
      periodic safety reviews.
