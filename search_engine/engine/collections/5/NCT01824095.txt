    
      Specific Aim 1: to compare the short-term (6 week) effect of chiropractic care combined with
      a specific nutritional supplement regimen to chiropractic care with a placebo nutritional
      supplement for patients with ankle sprains, in terms of speed and amount of improvement in
      physical function and pain. Our hypothesis is that chiropractic care plus nutritional
      supplements designed to supply necessary nutrients for ligament healing will have improved
      outcomes in pain and disability, compared to chiropractic care plus placebo. We will use the
      Foot and Ankle Ability Measure Activities of Daily Living Subscale (FAAM ADLS) to measure
      outcomes.

      Specific aim 2: to compare the long-term (6 month) effect of chiropractic care combined with
      a specific nutritional supplement regimen to chiropractic care with a placebo nutritional
      supplement for patients with ankle sprains, in terms of speed and amount of improvement in
      physical function and pain. Our hypothesis is that chiropractic care plus nutritional
      supplements designed to supply necessary nutrients for ligament healing will have improved
      outcomes as measured by the FAAM ADLS, compared to chiropractic care plus placebo.

      Specific aim 3: to explore any changes in the attitude, knowledge and behavior of
      chiropractic interns and practitioners of the role of nutrition in treating musculoskeletal
      injuries, pre- and post-intervention. We will also compare their responses to those of a
      population of students and practitioners who did not participate in the project, as a
      comparison group.
