      development has stagnated in recent years to a graft failure rate of 9-15 % within the first
      year and approximately 20-30 % at 5 years [1]. The primary goal is to improve the outcome
      after liver transplantation.

      The impact of donor specific antibodies (DSA) on all-cause mortality and re-transplantation,
      early allograft dysfunction, acute and chronic rejection, vascular and biliary complications
      and fibrosis will be investigated.

      Objectives:

        1. The primary objective is to investigate if DSA both pre-formed, persistent, and de novo
           affect survival and allograft loss. For patients diagnosed with HLA antibodies a
           standard Luminex single antigen IgG analysis, a Luminex C1q and an IgG3 single antigen
           assay will be performed.

        2. The secondary objective is to investigate if donor specific antibodies, both pre-formed,
           persistent, and de novo increase the risk of early allograft dysfunction, acute and
           chronic rejection, fibrosis, de novo autoimmune hepatitis (pediatric patients only),
           vascular and biliary complications. All liver biopsies will be stained by C4d and a DSA
           analysis will be undertaken.

        3. Continuous measurements will be used to establish the kinetics of both preformed og de
           novo DSA after liver transplantation.

      Pediatric patients will be analyzed separately.
