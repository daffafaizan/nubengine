      vestibularis schwannomas (VS) in children and young adults. The aim is to gain insight into
      the complete genome of the NF2 associated VS compared to sporadic VS (control group). These
      data are to be correlated with the clinic, ie the auditory function (audiogram, acoustically
      evoked potentials) and the clinical picture as well as the tumor growth rate and general data
      such as sex, age, side, etc.

      The analysis of genetic changes should provide a better insight into the oncogenesis of these
      tumors. The distinct genetic characteristics between NF2-associated and sporadic VS suggest a
      different oncogenesis of these tumors.

      The correlation of the genetic characteristics with the partly very different clinical
      appearance and a very different dynamics of the disease, in particular the tumor volume in
      the course, identifies the underlying modifiers of the disease course.

      Based on these genetic modifiers, patients can be stratified and individual clinical therapy
      decisions can be made.

      By demonstrating these genetic profiles in the peripheral blood, prospective conclusions can
      be drawn about expected disease progression before intervention as well as for therapy
      monitoring
