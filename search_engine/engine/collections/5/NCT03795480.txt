      "MOOD" in a sample of individuals with depressive symptoms. It is tested whether depressive
      symptomatology decreases in the intervention group compared to a wait-list control group.
      Secondary aims are to ascertain changes in self-worth and quality of life, to assess
      subjective evaluation of the program and to examine whether expectations of the program's
      helpfulness would predict symptom reduction. During the intervention period of six weeks,
      participants of the intervention group have access to the online program MOOD. Prior and
      following this period both groups complete a pre- and post-assessment. Participants of the
      wait-list control group receive access to MOOD following the post-assessment.
