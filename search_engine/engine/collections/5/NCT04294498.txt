      such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab have gain approval as salvage therapy for advanced HCC.
      The investigators will enroll 43 patients with active (defined as serum viral load > 2000
      IU/mL) chronic HBV infection (defined as positive serum HBV surface antigen). All patients
      would receive entecavir within 7 days of initiation of durvalumab treatment. Durvalumab 1500
      mg would be given intravenously every 4 weeks until confirmed disease progression,
      intolerable side effects, or completion of 24 treatment. Tumor assessment will be performed
      every 8-12 weeks. HBV viral load will be monitored at least once per month. Entecavir
      treatment will be continued at least 6 months after discontinuation of durvalumab treatment.
