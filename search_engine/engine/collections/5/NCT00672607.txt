    
      Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a common disorder in women and consists of somatic and/or
      behavioral/mood symptoms, which can impair a woman's social and work-related functioning.
      Some clinical studies with preparations containing Vitex agnus castus have demonstrated a
      positive effect on PMS with good tolerability. The aim of this clinical trial is to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of Agnucaston tablets for the therapy of PMS.
