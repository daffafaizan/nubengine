      minor offense, including physical or verbal assaults or theft, and who were referred by the
      police to participate in an anti-bullying intervention. The program consisted of 8 sessions
      over 4 weeks and was conducted by a board-certified psychiatrist and a therapist with
      previous training in psychosocial treatments. The intervention was based on CBT principles
      and addressed various factors that have been associated with perpetrators of school bullying,
      including impulse control, perspective taking (empathy), and the enhancement of communication
      skills.

      All participants completed the Korean Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and
      Schizophrenia-Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL) administered by board-certified child
      and adolescent psychiatrists. The validity and reliability of the original and Korean
      versions of the K-SADS-PL have been established. Intelligence quotient (IQ) was measured
      using the Korean Educational Developmental Institute's Wechsler Intelligence Scale for
      Children.

      Prior to and after participation in the program, all participants underwent brain magnetic
      resonance imaging (structural and functional) and completed neurocognitive tests that
      included the continuous performance test (CPT), the Stroop Word and Color Test, and the
      Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST). The parents of the participants completed questionnaires
      including the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Written informed consent was obtained from the
      parents and the participants after sufficient explanation of the study. The study protocol
      was approved by the institutional review board of the Seoul National University Hospital.
