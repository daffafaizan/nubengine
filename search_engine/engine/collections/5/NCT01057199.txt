    
      OBJECTIVES:

        -  To determine the significance of regulation of microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 by C/EBPα
           during granulopoiesis in patients with acute myeloid leukemia with CEBPA mutations.

        -  To determine whether overexpression of micro RNA-34a and microRNA-194 in myeloid
           progenitors with C/EBPα mutations leads to granulocytic differentiation.

        -  To examine how microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 downregulate E2F3 during granulopoiesis.

        -  To determine the role of microRNA-34a and microRNA-194 in myeloid cell proliferation.

      OUTLINE: Cryopreserved cell samples are collected for laboratory analysis, including mutation
      analysis, gene expression analysis, RNA analysis, and fluorescence-activated cell sorting
      (FACS) analysis.
