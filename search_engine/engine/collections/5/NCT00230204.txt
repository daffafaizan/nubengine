    
      The purpose of this investigation is to assess the prevalence of infectious disease
      seropositivity (toxoplasmosis, rubella, cytomegalovirus [CMV]), herpes simplex virus type 1
      (HSV-1) and herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), syphilis, Epstein-Barr virus and H. pylori
      in a group of patients presenting with specific autoimmune diseases (RA, UCTD, Sjogren,
      antiphospholipid syndrome - APS, vasculitides, SLE, polymyositis, Hashimoto, multiple
      sclerosis, PBC, etc.), using the BioPlex 2200 and complementary EIA kits as compared to
      matched controls (by age, sex and ethnicity).

      We will assess in our Center 100 patients with multiple sclerosis for the antibody profile of
      different infectious agents. Comparative assessments will be performed with normal matched
      subjects.
