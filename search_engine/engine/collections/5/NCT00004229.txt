      I. Determine the optimal biologic dose of endostatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.

      II. Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine
      the extent, frequency, and duration of tumor response in these patients on this regimen.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile and interpatient pharmacologic variability of this
      regimen in these patients.

      V. Determine the recommended phase II dose and schedule of this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.

      Patients undergo a biopsy during prestudy and after the second course of treatment. Patients
      receive endostatin IV daily for 4 weeks. Patients on dose level 1-6 receive endostatin over
      20 minutes. Patients on dose level 7 receive endostatin over 40 minutes, with no treatment on
      day 2 of the first course only. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of
      endostatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed for 1 month.
