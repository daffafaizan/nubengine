      to a low reside breakfast and lunch for patients prior to undergoing bowel preparation with
      MoviPrep® and its effect on preparation quality for colonoscopy. MoviPrep® is a commercially
      available 2 liter bowel purgative for use before colonoscopy in adults 18 years of age or
      older that is comprised of polyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution (PEG-ELS) plus sodium
      sulfate, sodium ascorbate, and ascorbic acid.
