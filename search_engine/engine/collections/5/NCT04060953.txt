      SPADE cluster and scores on each of its five component scales. The recently released Federal
      Pain Research Strategy states that pain cannot be measured in isolation, but rather should be
      assessed in conjunction with other outcome measures in 'non-pain domains,' such as quality of
      life. It recognizes that pain may be affected by, and affect, such patient attributes as
      sleep, mood, cognition, function, and quality of life. Further, the report states that
      improvement in pain without concomitant improvement in other domains may not constitute a
      clinically meaningful outcome. This study aims to assess the utility of a health-related
      quality of life report in improving quality of life, back pain intensity, and back-related
      disability in participants with chronic low back pain.
