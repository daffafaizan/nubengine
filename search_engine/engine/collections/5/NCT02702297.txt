      and adverse neonatal outcome. Between 24 0/7 and 34 0/7 weeks of gestation the prolongation
      of pregnancy is the recommended course of action to reduce the risks of prematurity in most
      countries. An intra-amniotic infection resulting in fetal inflammatory response syndrome
      (FIRS) or early onset neonatal sepsis (EOS) is often associated with high morbidity and
      mortality.

      Standard monitoring includes the maternal response to inflammation (i.e. maternal serum
      parameters) as well as fetal signs of acute FIRS (i.e. fetal tachycardia, high cytokine level
      in amniotic fluid obtained by amniocentesis). Changes of fetal ECG-parameters are also a sign
      of an acute FIRS.

      Currently, there is no adequate parameter for the surveillance of a possible ongoing
      intra-amniotic infection. Other studies have reported a correlation between vaginal fluid
      interleukine 6 (IL6) collected noninvasively and the risk of FIRS and EOS. Information
      obtained by computerized fetal ECG analysis might be suitable to detect early signs of fetal
      infection before the manifestation of FIRS.

      With the implementation of a vaginal fluid collector it is possible to detect the vaginal
      fluid cytokine in clinical everyday routine. With the improvement of fetal ECG monitoring it
      is possible to record the fetal ECG daily. This study examines the correlation between these
      new parameters and the onset of fetal infection before the manifestation of a severe systemic
      fetal inflammation.
