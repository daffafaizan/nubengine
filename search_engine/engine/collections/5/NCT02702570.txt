      neuroscience and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). The rationale for the study is that
      the cortico-cortical network linking the prefrontal cortex with the mesial temporal lobe is
      susceptible to the wear and tear of day to day life such as stress and emotional distress.
      The investigators hypothesize that the CASA intervention will promote emotional and cognitive
      health by targeting this network.
