      ameliorate the progressive health decline and overall feeling of well-being in patients with
      atrial fibrillation. Recent Standards for the Provision of Cardiac Rehabilitation of Ontario
      are calling for the consideration for referral and enrollment of patients with atrial
      fibrillation in cardiovascular rehabilitation - evidence is needed to support and confirm
      these efforts. The main purpose of this project is to evaluate the effects of high-intensity
      interval training (HIIT) compared to moderate-intensity continuous exercise training (MICE)
      and standard care on exercise capacity and quality of life in patients with persistent or
      permanent atrial fibrillation. Positive results from this study will identify a new
      intervention that: produces important improvements in patient-rated clinical, behavioural and
      exercise outcomes; provides mechanistic insight into the role of exercise training in the
      management of atrial fibrillation; requires minimal equipment; and, is appealing to patients
      with atrial fibrillation.
