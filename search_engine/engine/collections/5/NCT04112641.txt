      cancer with either taxane or platinum-based compounds and who have persistent neuropathy will
      be randomized to receive either placebo or NIAGEN capsules daily for 84 days. On enrollment,
      subjects will complete several questionnaires characterizing the type and severity of their
      neuropathy. The sensitivity of their cornea to light touch will be determined, their fifth
      finger will be scanned to determine the density of sensory afferents in the skin, and a skin
      biopsy will be taken above the ankle for histological analysis of nerve fiber density. Blood
      samples will be drawn for baseline measures of NAD+ levels, and clinical chemistries and
      indices of liver and kidney function. Subjects will be asked to return every two weeks to
      complete the questionnaires, and blood will be drawn to measure biomarkers of NIAGEN
      consumption. Blood will be drawn at visits on days 28, 56, and 84 for clinical chemistries
      and measures of liver and kidney function. At visits on day 42 and 84, additional measures of
      corneal sensitivity, and density of nerve fibers in the hand and leg will be made. The last
      treatment day will be day 84, at which time all measures will be redetermined. A follow-up
      period of 3 months is planned at which time all measures will be conducted once again to
      determine if any alleviation of the chemotherapy has persisted after treatment ended.
      Patients enrolled in this study will receive standard of care treatment by their oncologists,
      which includes computed tomography, magnetic resonance or ultrasound scans every three months
      as surveillance for cancer re-occurrence.
