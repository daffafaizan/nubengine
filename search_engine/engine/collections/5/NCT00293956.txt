      of TSH, in preterm infants has been associated with increased severity of illness and adverse
      outcomes. Effects of thyroid function in term infants is less well studied. Previous research
      in the Special Care Nursery at Christiana Hospital has indicated that transient
      hypothyroxinemia in intubated term infants was associated with increased severity of illness
      and the need for more intensive rescue therapies. However, free T4, the biologically active
      substance was not measured in our previous study.

      Infants who meet criteria for the study will begin participation after parental informed
      consent is obtained. Infants who are enrolled will have serial measurements of thyroid
      stimulating hormone (TSH), T4, free T4, free T3, and cortisol. These measurements will be
      obtained at four specific time intervals throughout the first week of the infant's life. The
      medical team will be blinded to the results of the hormone testing. The results will be
      reviewed by an unblinded study investigator and an endocrinologist will be consulted if
      abnormal results are reported.

      These hormone levels will be compared with severity of illness and level of respiratory
      support needed in order to establish an association between thyroid function and illness
      severity. Illness severity will be quantified by using the Score for Neonatal Acute
      Physiology (SNAP). SNAP scores require collecting data from vital signs and results of labs
      that are considered standard of care.
