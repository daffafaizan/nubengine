      indicate that the commensal intestinal flora (microbiome) plays a key role in the development
      of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). An unfavourable composition of the microbiome can
      trigger disease development and progression. On the other hand, recent data show that
      modulation of the microbiome through diet, such as a high-fibre diet, can prevent the
      developement of a NASH. It has been shown that the uptake of fibre-rich oats reduces LDL and
      total cholesterol without altering the HDL cholesterol level. Indeed, the results of several
      human intervention studies suggest that a regular intake of oat flakes with prebiotic food
      supplements is sufficient to lower LDL and total cholesterol levels. In a small clinical
      trial it was also shown that an intake of oat bran with prebiotic food supplements in two
      servings per day was associated with a significant reduction in ALT and AST activity in the
      serum of overweight individuals with signs of altered liver function. In addition, the use of
      oat bran to influence postprandial glucose and insulin response and satiety was discussed.

      However, the mechanisms underlying the positive effects of treatments with pro-, pre- or
      synbiotics are not yet fully understood and generally accepted therapeutic strategies are
      still lacking. The exact influence of a fibre-rich diet on intestinal microbiom and bile acid
      composition is not yet known. In the research project described, the effect of oat bran with
      prebiotic food supplements on NASH will be investigated and mechanisms of interaction between
      diet, microbiome, bile acids and liver will be uncovered. A better understanding of this
      interaction could form the basis for new preventive therapies of NASH.
