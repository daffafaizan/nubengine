      Researchers at University of California Irvine at Beckman Laser Institute Medical Clinic can
      use Photodynamic therapy, another treatment option for Port wine stains. Photodynamic therapy
      involves light activation of a photosensitizer (a drug that is responsive to light or radiant
      energy). Because the photosensitizer can be localized to a desired portion of the Port wine
      stain, Photodynamic therapy creates an opportunity for targeted destruction of Port wine
      stains.

      Researchers will use a photosensitizer medication called Talaporfin sodium, an intravenously
      administered investigational photosensitizer, being evaluated for multiple clinical
      indications. Photodynamic therapy with talaporfin sodium has been investigated for many
      different conditions, and can be used for treatment for Port wine stains. Photosensitivity
      precaution instructions will be provided, including appropriate photo protective clothing,
      protective hat and sunglasses that wrap around the temples to help minimize lateral sun light
      exposure when traveling home following discharge from the study site.

      For efficacy, evaluated study variable will be Port wine stain blanching, and the researchers
      can use diffuse reflectance imaging chromametry, Laser Speckle Imaging and Spatial Frequency
      Domain Imaging to measure the change of Port wine stain blanching. The maximum power of the
      Laser Speckle Imaging and Spatial Frequency Domain Imaging light source is 10-50 mW, which is
      comparable to halogen-bulb household flashlights. Efficacy will be evaluated based on
      comparison of pre-treatment visit and post treatment day 1, week 1, week 4, and week 12
      measurements.
