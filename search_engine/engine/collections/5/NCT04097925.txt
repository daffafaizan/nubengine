        -  To determine Doravirine concentrations in seminal plasma and cervicovaginal fluid in
           HIV-1 infected male and female individuals receiving antiretroviral therapy (ATR) with
           Doravirine plus Descovy速.

        -  To evaluate HIV-1 viral load in seminal plasma and cervicovaginal fluid in HIV-1
           infected male and female individuals receiving ART with Doravirine plus Descovy速.

      Study Phase:

      Phase II

      Study Design:

      Open label, single arm, single center, prospective study.

      Study Disease:

      HIV-1 infection

      Study Endpoints:

        -  Concentration of Doravirine in seminal plasma and cervicovaginal fluid in HIV-1 infected
           male and female individuals, respectively, 8 weeks after switching to Doravirine plus
           Descovy速.

        -  HIV-1 RNA in seminal plasma and cervicovaginal fluid in HIV-1 infected male and female
           individuals, respectively, 8 weeks after switching to Doravirine plus Descovy速.

      Target Population:

      Male and female adult HIV-1 infected patients receiving standard ART with tenofovir
      alafenamide/emtricitabine (TAF/FTC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate/emtricitabine or
      abacavir/lamivudine , plus an non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, a boosted
      protease inhibitor or an integrase inhibitor during at least 3 months, with plasma HIV-1 RNA
      suppression (<40 copies/mL) during at least 6 months.

      Number of Subjects Planned:

      15 male and 15 female individuals.

      Study duration:

      16 weeks
