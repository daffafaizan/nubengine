    
      This is a phase III, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind active controlled
      2-arm parallel group study to compare efficacy, safety, and tolerability of CHF 5993 pMDI
      with CHF 1535 pMDI with respect to lung function, incidence of moderate and severe COPD
      exacerbations, and other clinical efficacy and safety outcomes.

      After screening, eligible subjects will enter 2-week run-in period using their regular COPD
      maintenance therapies after which they will be randomized to one of 2 study treatment groups.
      Following randomization, subjects will be assessed after 4 weeks then at 6-week intervals
      thereafter for a period of 52 weeks. A follow-up safety phone call will be performed a week
      after the last clinic visit. A subset of subjects consenting to participate in the
      pharmacokinetic substudy will undergo additional assessments (totaling 3 visits) during the
      scheduled study visits.

      During the study, daily symptoms, rescue medication use and compliance with the study drug
      will be recorded via a subject electronic diary. Subject concomitant medications, adverse
      events, and healthcare resource utilization will be assessed and recorded throughout the
      study. At intermittent study visits, subjects will undergo vital signs examinations including
      weight, spirometry measurements, and 12-lead ECG. Symptoms and COPD health status will be
      assessed through disease specific questionnaires. Routine hematology, blood chemistry, and
      serum pregnancy testing will be performed before enrollment and at end of study.
