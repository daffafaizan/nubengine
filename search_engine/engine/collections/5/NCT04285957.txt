      stroke patients, the Frenchay Activity Index (FAI) and the Walking Handicap Classification
      (WHC). These tools have been recently indicated for the assessment of participation in Stroke
      patients by the Italian Association of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (Minimal Stroke
      Assessment Protocol - PMIC2); they are currently used in Italian research and clinical
      settings, but no official translation exists. The process requires a standardized translation
      protocol, including forward and backward translation, using a multistep revision structure,
      to ensure conceptual and semantic equivalence. The validation process includes a pilot
      evaluation of on 10 individuals post-stroke admitted to the Neurological Rehabilitation Unit,
      Foundation Don Gnocchi Scientific Institute, and a validation on a sample of 60 stroke
      patients including reliability, internal consistency and concurrent validity assessment of
      the translated version against the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) - Italian version and the
      Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI) - Italian version, respectively
