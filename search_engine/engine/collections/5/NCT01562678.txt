      effects of liraglutide on brain activation in areas involved in cognitive control and reward
      during food visualization.

      Study participation will span approximately 1.5-2 months. Subjects will learn to
      self-administer the medication and will have a total of 8 study visits plus one screening
      visit. The visits will include the following tests/procedures:

        1. Vital signs (blood pressure, temperature, heart rate, breathing rate)

        2. Height, weight and other body measurements like waist

        3. Blood tests

        4. Urine pregnancy test (women only)

        5. Electrocardiogram (EKG)

        6. Medical history

        7. Physical exam

        8. Body Composition tests

        9. Study logs to record food intake and blood sugar

       10. functional MRI

      We plan to recruit a total of 24 subjects to be treated with placebo and liraglutide. We
      propose to enroll 12 obese diabetic (type 2) and 12 lean diabetic (type 2) subjects. Equal
      numbers of men and women will be enrolled and the randomization will block for gender.
