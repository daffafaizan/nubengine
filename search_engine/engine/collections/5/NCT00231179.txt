      intervention. The premise of the MOM Program was that professional support through home
      visits and frequent phone contacts would improve children's cognitive and behavioral
      development, ultimately improving their early educational success. The children were enrolled
      in the MOM Program at birth. The MOM Program Continuation provides continued intervention for
      the children and mothers of the original cohort to assure that the children are prepared for
      kindergarten entry at 5 years of age and to evaluate the children's cognitive and behavioral
      outcomes at age 5 years. The program will also create a longitudinal database to study the
      linkages between maternal cognitive ability and child cognitive, educational, and behavioral
      outcomes through entry into school.
