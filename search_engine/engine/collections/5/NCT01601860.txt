      promote uterine contractions. Several non-pharmacological resources can be used during labor,
      such as relaxation techniques and ongoing support, maternal mobility, walking, breathing
      exercises, massage, Swiss ball, stool, shower, whirlpool and application of transcutaneous
      electrical stimulation (ENT .) Despite the role of physiotherapy in labor is not an
      established practice in public hospitals, it is expected that with the evidence of the
      benefits of non-pharmacological resources at this time, managers and health professionals
      validate the importance of interdisciplinary care in pregnancy - postpartum. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate the effects of resources on non-pharmacological pain of mothers in the
      active phase of cervical dilatation when compared to controls. This research is a randomized,
      controlled clinical study that includes pregnant women randomly assigned to two groups:
      Intervention Group (IG) women who will use the following sequence features: ambulation (with
      cervical dilatation of 4 to 5 cm), alternating stance associated with ENT (cervical
      dilatation from 6 to 7 cm) and a shower (with dilation> 7 cm) for 40 minutes each resource;
      Control Group (CG) women who will not use any physical therapy resource, are subject only to
      routine procedures of maternity care . For pain assessment will use the Visual Analogue Scale
      - VAS and the body diagram of the location and spatial distribution of pain. Results are
      presented in tables and graphs made to better understand the comparisons between the control
      and intervention. To compare maternal morbidity, obstetric and neonatal between groups will
      be used Fisher's exact test or chi-square.
