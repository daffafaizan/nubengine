      reducing symptoms from allergic rhinitis and asthma. Using a randomized, double blinded
      placebo, controlled trial we will be then able to assess if there are any changes after the
      use of the PECO air purifier after completing an initial baseline survey & comparing to the
      exit survey. This is a double-blind study, which means that neither the participant nor the
      investigator knows which device is being used until after the trial is over.
