      (comorbidities and disabilities), mobility (walk without help, need assistance and totally
      dependent for transfers), way of living (home living or institutionalized), biological data
      (blood and urine), therapeutic projects about the option for dialysis and the medicals reason
      to start dialysis. As it is an observational study of current practices, no additional tests
      or additional visits were mandatory either at inclusion or during the follow-up.

      Data on dialysis start and outcomes were extracted from the French National ESRD registry
      REIN. This linkage was approved by the French Advisory Committee on Information Processing in
      Material Research in the Field of Health (CCTIRS), the National Commission for Information
      Technology and Privacy (Commission Nationale de l'Informatique et des Libertes) and ethic
      committee. The starting dialysis condition included patient's clinical characteristics, the
      use of a central vascular catheter (CVC), the unplanned condition of dialysis start and the
      first modality of dialysis (peritoneal or hemodialysis). After dialysis start, patient
      survival and information about dialysis withdrawal before death was collected.

      The number of patients to include was fixed to more than 500 to study at least 15 prognosis
      factors with estimation of more than 30% of death during follow-up.
