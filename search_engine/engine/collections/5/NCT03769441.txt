      deficiency is associated with an unfavourable prognosis in these patients. In patients with
      heart failure and iron deficiency, treatment with intravenous iron improved exercise capacity
      and quality of life. Whether such beneficial effects may also occur in kidney transplant
      recipients is unknown.

      Objective: Our main objective is to address whether correction of iron deficiency with
      ferric(III) carboxymaltose improves exercise tolerance and quality of life in iron-deficient
      kidney-transplant recipients.

      Study design: A multicentre double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled clinical
      trial will be performed to compare the effects of ferric(III) carboxymaltose with placebo.

      Study population: 158 iron-deficient kidney transplant recipients. The intervention arm will
      receive 10 mL of ferric(III) carboxymaltose (50 mg Fe3/mL, intravenously) every six weeks,
      with a total of four dosages. The control arm receives an intravenous placebo solution
      (saline).

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is the distance walked in six minutes,
      as quantified by the six-minute-walking-test at the end of follow-up.

      The investigators expect that iron-deficient kidney transplant recipients will benefit from
      ferric(III) carboxymaltose treatment as a result of an improvement in exercise tolerance and
      general wellbeing.
