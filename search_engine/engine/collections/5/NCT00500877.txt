      depressive symptoms when presenting for smoking cessation treatment and have poor smoking
      outcomes relative to other smokers. Carefully conducted clinical trials have supported the
      efficacy of cognitive-behavioral mood management treatment for depression in improving
      smoking cessation outcomes in this high-risk group. Although efficacious, these intensive
      group treatments require significant resources and thus may have limited impact outside of
      specialized smoking cessation programs. In the present study we will develop and obtain
      preliminary data on the efficacy of proactive telephone counseling for smoking cessation that
      integrates cognitive-behavioral mood management skills training for depression (MM). Smokers
      with a history of recurrent MDD will be randomly assigned to the proactive telephone
      counseling for smoking cessation with mood management (MM) or a standard proactive telephone
      counseling (ST) comparison condition. We expect that this program of research will result in
      the development of a specialized, efficacious treatment with broad reach into a significant
      subpopulation of smokers at greatest risk for difficulties quitting, and will therefore have
      important clinical and public health significance in decreasing the overall prevalence of
      cigarette smoking.
