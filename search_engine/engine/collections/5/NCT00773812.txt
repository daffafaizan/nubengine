    
      This is a placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial of a nicotinic agent based on evidence that
      a disturbance occurs in nicotinic cholinergic transmission in the brain of autistic children.
      This pharmacotherapeutic trial will be conducted as a direct result of findings of a
      nicotinic receptor abnormality in autopsied brain tissue from individuals who suffered from
      autism. A pharmacological agent, mecamylamine, with specificity for the nicotinic receptors
      implicated in autism, will be tested in children with autism spectrum disorder. Twenty
      children who meet inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized in a 2:3 ratio to 14 weeks
      of either matched placebo (n=8) or mecamylamine (n=12). Children randomized to placebo who do
      not respond will be given the opportunity to enroll in a ten week open label extension.

      The trial has been completed and published in J. of Child & Adolescent Psychopharmacology.
