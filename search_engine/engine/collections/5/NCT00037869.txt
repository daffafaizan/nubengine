    
      MIBG is used to visualize a group of specific cells in the body. It has been known to deliver
      the radioactive iodine to the tumor (cancer) cells selectively and result in their
      destruction.

      Before treatment starts, patients will be evaluated with a tracer scan, using either I-131
      MIBG or I-123 MIBG to locate the tumor site(s). If no MIBG accumulation can be found within
      tumor sites, the patient will not be able to continue on this study. Patients will also have
      CT scans and urine and blood tests. Women able to have children will have a pregnancy test.

      If tumor sites are found and patients are fully eligible, they will receive a therapeutic
      (treatment) dose of I-131 MIBG by vein over 120 minutes. Some patients may have to receive a
      lower dose of MIBG. Patients will require hospitalization for treatment and will remain
      hospitalized for about 3-6 days.
