    
      This is a population-based case-control study in Germany.

      Cases are women who are between 15 and 49 years old with a diagnosis of venous
      thromboembolism (VTE). The VTE is diagnosed in Germany between January 2002 und December
      2007.

      Controls are women who are between 15 and 49 years old without a VTE diagnosis. About 4
      controls matched by year of birth and region will be allocated to each case.

      Both cases and controls will receive a similar self-administered questionnaire except of some
      case-specific questions which are not applicable for the controls.

      Study participants will be asked for their informed consent. Data confidentiality will be
      ensured by the Berlin Center for Epidemiology and Health Research.
