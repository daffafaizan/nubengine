    
      This is a Phase II trial to determine the ability of a reduced intensity conditioning regimen
      to allow successful engraftment with alpha/beta T and CD19+ depleted peripheral stem cell
      grafts from unrelated or partially matched related donors. There are two conditioning
      regimens depending upon patient diagnosis and age.

      The study will include patients 0-22 years with PID, including immune dysregulation syndromes
      for which hematopoietic stem cell transplant is indicated.

      Treatment: Either conditioning regimen (listed below) followed by alpha/beta T and CD19+
      depleted donor peripheral stem cells

        1. Reduced intensity conditioning with busulfan x 8 doses, fludarabine 40 mg/m2 x 4,
           thiotepa 5 mg/kg x 2, ATG 3 mg/kg x 3.

           OR

        2. Myeloablative regimen with busulfan x 16 doses or Daily for four days, fludarabine 30
           mg/m2 x 5, thiotepa 5 mg/kg x 2, ATG 3 mg/kg x 2.

           OR

        3. Immunotherapy regimen on days -9, 8, 7 with anti-thymocyte globulin 3 mg/kg/day (for
           severe combined immunodeficiency patients only).

        4. Infusion of alpha/beta T and CD19+ depleted donor peripheral stem cells.

        5. Follow up, including evaluation of chimerism and immune reconstitution.
