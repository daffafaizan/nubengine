      > 65 years old and scoring CHADS2VASc > 1. Patients will be randomized to receive Warfarin
      (INR between 2 and 3) or Dabigatran (150 mg twice daily) for two years. After one year and at
      the end of the study, individuals will be evaluated regarding cognitive endpoints following
      the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke-Canadian Stroke Network Vascular
      Cognitive Impairment Harmonization Standards (Hachinski et al. Stroke 2006;37:2220-2241). The
      investigators will use the 60 minutes evaluation protocol complemented by the Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).
