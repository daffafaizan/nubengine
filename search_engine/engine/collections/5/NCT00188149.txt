      subsequent radiotherapy in patients with complete remission after ABVD chemotherapy. Patients
      with limited disease receive four cycles, patients with intermediate disease (according to
      the criteria of the German Hodgkin Study group, GHSG) receice six cycles of ABVD. In case of
      residual mass (> 1.5 cm), additional involved field irradiation is planned. The aim in
      advanced disease using BACOPP-D regimen which includes cyclophosphamide, adriamycin,
      dacarbazine, procarbazine, prednisolone, bleomycin and vincristine, is to reduce the
      hematological toxicity and the secondary leukemias by omitting etoposide (in comparison to
      the BEACOPP escalated regimen). All patients receive eight cycles of the BACOPP-D regimen. In
      case of residual mass (> 1.5 cm), additional involved field irradiation is planned.
      Additionally, we want to evaluate the CT- and PET-based remission status after chemotherapy
      and at final staging.
