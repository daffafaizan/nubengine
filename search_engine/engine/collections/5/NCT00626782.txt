      filtration surgery to control glaucoma. The control will consist of patients randomly
      assigned to receive inter-operative mitomycin C 0.4 mg/ml which is applied in a standard
      fashion with a soaked pledget inserted in the sub-tenon's space during surgery. The study arm
      will consist of patients randomly assigned to receive a sub-tenon injection of Ranibizumab
      0.5 mg/0.05mL with a 30 gauge needle on a tuberculin syringe at the termination of the
      surgery. No mitomycin C will be applied.
