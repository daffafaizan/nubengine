      PRISMA-3 (NCT03160521) through to the end of the treatment period, may be eligible to enter
      into this optional long-term extension segment of the study. During this extension,
      open-label Risperidone ISMÂ® (i.e., either 75 or 100 mg) will be administered to all
      participating patients once every 4 weeks for approximately 12 months. Patients who enter
      into the extension segment of the study will begin participation in the extension segment
      immediately upon completion of the end-of-treatment visit assessments and procedures.

      In addition to patients continuing from the double-blind segment of the study PRISMA-3
      (rollover patients), clinically stable patients not previously enrolled in the study (de novo
      patients) may be eligible to enter the long-term extension segment of the study. These
      patients will be evaluated for eligibility at a screening visit and, if eligible, will be
      allocated to receive either 75 or 100 mg Risperidone ISM every 4 weeks for approximately 12
      months.

      Approximately 100 de novo patients are planned to be enrolled in the extension segment of the
      study, in addition to rollover patients.

      The planned total number of randomized patients in this OLE segment of the study is
      approximately 479 patients total randomized planned.
