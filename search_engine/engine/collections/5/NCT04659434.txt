      mature B lymphocytes and eliminates these cells potentially via a number of different
      mechanisms. The R-GemOx regimen has been adopted by numerous medical institutions
      internationally as therapy for older patients or comorbid patients with relapsed or
      refractory DLBCL and as a back-bone for the investigation of novel therapies in combination
      with chemotherapy. The cytotoxic T-lymphocyte co-receptor PD-1 has been extensively studied
      and is recognized to provide critical inhibitory signals that down-regulate T-cell function
      and provides a mechanism for immune evasion for tumors. PD-L1, the ligand of PD-1 is
      expressed on DLBCL tumor cells, along with infiltrating non-malignant cells, primarily
      macrophages, with PD-1 expressed on tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Sintilimab targets
      programmed PD-1 on tumor cells and prevents interaction with either PD-1 receptor or B7.1
      (CD80), both of which function as inhibitory receptors expressed on T cells. Interference of
      the PD-L1:PD-1 and PDL1:B7.1 interactions may enhance the magnitude and quality of the
      tumor-specific T-cell response through increased T-cell priming, expansion, and/or effector
      function. This study of sintilimab in combination with rituximab, gemcitabine and oxaliplatin
      aims to address the unmet clinical need of patients with relapsed and refractory DLBCL. It is
      based upon a sound mechanistic approach, investigating the activity of novel agents and will
      aim to compressively explore biomarkers of response. The primary objective will be the
      complete response rate (CRR) of this salvage therapy. A maintenance phase of sintilimab will
      be added as this may induce an on-going T-cell response to neo-antigens released as a result
      of previous treatment.
