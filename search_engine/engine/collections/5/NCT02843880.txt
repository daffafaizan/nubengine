      consecutive to HIV infection, bone marrow or solid organ transplantation. However, in
      severely ill patients, as in septic shock, it has been proved that after a hyper-inflammatory
      phase occurred a negative control of the immunity, resulting in a paralysed or impaired
      immune system. The length and extent of this immunodeficiency is correlated with the duration
      of ICU stay, the occurrence of nosocomial infection and mortality.

      A better understanding of CMV's natural history reactivation in the critically ill patient
      would better define the benefits from a specific therapy.
