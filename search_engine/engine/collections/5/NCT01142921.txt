      conditions for primary bile duct cancer include recurrent infections and autoimmune diseases
      such as recurrent pyogenic cholangitis (RPC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC) as well
      as congenital problem such as choledochal cyst. Peri-ampullary tumour, pancreatic tumour and
      metastatic tumours with bile duct compression are other causes of bile duct obstruction. As
      many of these tumours are discovered at a late stage, curative treatment is usually not
      feasible. Palliative endoscopic stenting of the obstructed biliary system remains the
      treatment of choice for the majority.

      The main problem with endoscopic stenting of the biliary system is the short stent patency
      period. There are some reports on modifications to plastic biliary stenting method in recent
      years including changes in stent designs, use of a different material or coating,
      administrating prophylactic antibiotics and the use of special drugs. All these have failed
      to show any conclusive effect on the stent patency period.

      A preliminary study has demonstrated some promising results in the use of a stent with an
      anti-reflux property very similar to the stents the investigators are using in this study.
