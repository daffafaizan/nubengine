      T2DM. Based on the mechanism of action which involves reducing hepatic glucose output, it is
      possible that day time (AM) or night time (PM) dosing of GSK1362885 could produce different
      plasma glucose lowering effects, acting either on prandial or post-absorptive elevations of
      HGO. This study is designed to compare glucose profiles following AM and PM doses to
      determine if there is any advantage to either one. This study will compare glucose profiles
      following a single dose of GSK1362885 in the morning before breakfast (AM) to a single dose
      administered at night (PM). These two dosing periods will be randomized and each subject will
      receive both dosing regimens. A third dosing period (BID) is not randomized, but is included
      to explore the effects of GSK1362885 on glucose profiles when administered twice daily in a
      24 hour timeframe.
