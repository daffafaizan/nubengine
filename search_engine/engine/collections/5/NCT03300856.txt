    
      Objective- To retrospectively study the results of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in
      various neurological disorders and create a descriptive analysis of the results.

      Study population- Existing records of patients within the NINDS database who have had TMS
      performed to measure central motor conduction time (CMCT).

      Design-

        -  Retrospective descriptive analysis.

        -  The NINDS EMG Database will be queried using terms such as TMS, CMCT, and MEP (motor
           evoked potentials) to identify EMG reports on patients who underwent TMS for diagnosis

        -  Within these reports peripheral motor conduction time (PMCT), the cortical motor evoked
           potential (MEP) latency and amplitude will be used to calculate CMCT, clinical patient
           factors pertinent to estimation of CMCT as well clinically significant physical exam
           findings will be recorded as well.

        -  Clinical diagnoses and neurological exams will be extracted from medical records

        -  Patient identifiers will be de-linked after compiling data from medical records

      Outcome measures

      - Results of CMCT using TMS in different diagnoses will be summarized for different
      neurologic disorders and correlated to clinical exam measures documented in previous records
