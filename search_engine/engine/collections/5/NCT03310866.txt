      Fiberoptic laryngoscope is a reliable tool for endotracheal intubation in difficult airway
      cases (Modified Mallampatti III&IV), but always there is difficulty to visualize the glottis
      due to airway tendency to collapse, classically a specific fiberoptic airway with a side way
      is used and it may added head tilt chin lift jaw thrust. A new technique utilizing
      sevoflurane anesthesia to maintain the respiratory drive without exposing the patient to the
      stress of the awake airway instrumentation. Simultaneous utilization of both Macintosh curved
      laryngoscope and Fiberoptic bronchoscope during Endotracheal intubation (ETT) will be
      examined for the efficacy during difficult airway management.

      All patients should be examined preoperatively for the scoring Modified Mallampati or non
      tongue protrusion mallampati (NT-MMT) airway score. The pharyngeal structures were then
      evaluated and the best view (lowest class) was recorded. The classification follows m-MMT and
      is as follows: class 1, full visibility of tonsils, uvula, and soft palate; class 2,
      visibility of hard and soft palate, upper portion of tonsils and uvula; class 3, visibility
      of the soft and hard palate and base of the uvula; and class 4, visibility of only the hard
      palate, class III or IV patients were included in the study. Inhalational anesthesia use
      maintains the respiratory drive of the patient allowing less stressful technique.
