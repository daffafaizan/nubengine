      first technique will involve pealing of the outer layer of the lateral wall of the cavernous
      sinus before the dura is opened and the tumour attacked, and the second group of cases will
      be operated by a standard technique, where the tumour will be directly attacked with out
      pealing of the outer layer of the lateral wall of the cavernous sinus. Blood loss will be
      monitored in each case by calculating the amount of blood in the suction container and
      subtracting it from the amount of fluids used for irrigation during surgery. The number of
      cotton patties and dressings will be also counted with each case as well as the number of
      gauzes used. The pre-operative complete blood picture will be documented particularly the
      haemoglobin , hematocrits and others. The same lab data will be also monitored after surgery.
      The amount of blood transfusion required will also be calculated in each case.
