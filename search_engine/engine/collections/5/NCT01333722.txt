      anesthesia was standardized for all participants. Upon completion of surgery, designated
      study personnel ensured continued eligibility per the selection criteria of the protocol.

      After an appropriate period of time following bunionectomy, participants who had a pain
      intensity score of â‰¥ 40 mm on a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS) and moderate or severe pain
      intensity per the categorical pain intensity scale were eligible for randomization, in equal
      numbers, into 1 of 2 treatment arms: hydrocodone/acetaminophen extended release or placebo.
