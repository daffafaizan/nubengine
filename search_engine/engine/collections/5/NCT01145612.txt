    
      Marfan syndrome is a genetic disease of the connective tissue. Patients with Marfan syndrome
      experience an expansion of the aorta that can lead to dissection or rupture of it. This is
      the main cause of mortality in these patients.

      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Losartan versus Atenolol in
      the progression of aortic dilation in patients with Marfan syndrome.

      The measurement is made by echocardiography, assessing the diameter of the aorta in different
      zones: valve annulus, sinuses of Valsalva, sinotubular junction, ascending aorta, aortic
      arch, thoracic and abdominal aorta.

      A total number of 150 subjects diagnosed with Marfan syndrome and who meet the diagnostic
      criteria of Ghent, of both sexes, 75 per treatment group, aged between 5 and 60, will be
      included in the study. The study is being conducted in two Spanish hospitals.

      The treatment is maintained throughout the study period.
