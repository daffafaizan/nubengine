      1 will have standardized physical therapy. Patients are given surveys to complete that ask
      about how their back pain is affecting their quality of life before starting treatment, 6
      weeks after starting treatment, and 3, 6, and 12 months after starting treatment. If at the 6
      week point, the patient and doctor do not think the current treatment is working well enough,
      the patient is given the option to try the other treatment.
