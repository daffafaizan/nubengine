    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation, safety, pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic
      study of CEND-1 in combination with nabpaclitaxel and gemcitabine administered weekly for
      three weeks followed by one week off over 28 days.

      This protocol is designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and biologic activity of
      CEND-1 in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) who are undergoing
      combination therapy with nabpaclitaxel and gemcitabine. CEND-1 is a tumor-penetrating peptide
      (scientifically also known as iRGD) that activates a drug transport mechanism specifically in
      tumors.

      Study involves an initial dose escalation phase with four different CEND-1 dose levels, first
      as a monotherapy (during 1-week run-in), followed by combination therapy with nabpaclitaxel
      and gemcitabine (one 28-day treatment cycle). A subsequent expansion phase with approximately
      28 subjects will assess the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of the combination
      treatment using two different CEND-1 dose levels.
