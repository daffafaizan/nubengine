      Approximately 30,000 infants are born each year with congenital heart defects.Over one-third
      of those babies will require cardiac surgery. A particularly lethal cardiac defect is one
      with single ventricle physiology. The objective of this research proposal is to perform an
      ongoing single institution prospective clinical trial examining the overall clinical outcome
      of children with single ventricle physiology.
