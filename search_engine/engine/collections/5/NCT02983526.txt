      patients. By preserving proximal bone load, the transmission to the proximal femur is
      supposed to improve and future revision surgery would be facilitated. The hypothesis is that
      a more conservative resection of the femoral neck could lead to better clinical outcomes
      compared to a conventional stem. The clinical outcomes and the fixation of a short femoral
      stem were therefore compared with a stem of standard length. 83 patients were included in our
      randomized controlled trial where patients either received a Collum Femoris Preserving (CFP)
      stem or a Corail hip stem. Clinical outcomes are being assessed, plain radiographs are
      studied and the early migration is being measured using radiostereometric analysis. All of
      the patients have gone through 1 year follow-up. The 2 years results will be available at the
      end of 2017.
