      low birth weight and prematurity are the most frequent adverse effects of the infection. The
      current WHO recommendation consists on the provision of insecticide treated nets (ITN's) and
      intermittent preventive treatment (IPT). Results from a recentn trial of ITN's have shown a
      significant reduction in maternal anaemia, parasitaemia and low birth weight prevalence in
      women sleeping under impregnated nets. However, scarce information exists on the relative
      efficacy of IPT and ITNs to reduce the deleterious effects of malaria infection during
      pregnancy when given at the same time. This information is of relevance to guide national
      malaria control programmes.

      This study consists on the administration of two double blind doses of IPT with
      Sulfadoxine-Pyrimethamine or placebo at predefined intervals, after the beginning of the
      second trimester. All women receive an ITN.
