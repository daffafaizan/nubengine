    
      The aim of this study is to demonstrate the therapeutic non-inferiority of bemiparin sodium
      (LMWH) versus enoxaparin sodium (LMWH) during a 7±2 days treatment period and a follow up of
      11 weeks observation period.

      Primary endpoint:

      The percentage of patients with an improvement in thrombotic burden at Visit 3 (Day 83)
      defined as a ≥4-point reduction in thrombus score (or at least halving the thrombus score,
      when the total score is ≤ 6), without confirmed symptomatic extension of recurrence of DVT,
      confirmed symptomatic PE, or VTE-related death at Visit 3 (Day 83 / Month 3), as measured by
      complete compression ultrasound (cCUS) by Duplex sonography according to a standardized
      protocol.

      Secondary endpoint:

      The secondary efficacy endpoints are defined as the:

      • Incidence of symptomatic venous thromboembolic events (VTE) at Visit 3 (Day 83:

        -  Recurrent DVT

        -  Pulmonary embolism

      Incusion criteria:

      Patients with acute deep-vein thrombosis of the leg (DVT) with symptoms of less than 14 days,
      confirmed by complete compression ultrasound (cCUS) within 48 hours prior study start.

      Patients who have given their signed declaration of consent and data protection declaration
      Males and females aged 18 years
