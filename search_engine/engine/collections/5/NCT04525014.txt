        -  Determine if the adult dose of RRx-001 is safe when given together with 2 chemotherapy
           drugs called irinotecan and temozolomide in children and young adults with
           previously-treated cancerous tumors

        -  Determine the side effects of RRx-001 in children and young adults when given together
           with irinotecan and temozolomide

        -  Understand if the combination of RRx-001, irinotecan, and temozolomide is helpful for
           children and young adults with previously-treated cancerous tumors

        -  In patients with brain tumors, measure if RRx-001 causes changes in the tumor on
           Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)

        -  Determine if RRx-001 causes changes in the immune system which may help the body
           naturally fight the tumor
