    
      Each patient is subjected to clinical, laboratory and endoscopic evaluation, each eligible
      patient is assigned to one of the arms:

      Arm 1: patients with ulcerative colitis (50 patients) Arm 2: patients with Crohn's disease
      (50 patients) In each arm, patients are classified according to clinical an endoscopic
      activity of the disease.

      Each patient is subjected to ultrasound examination of the bowel using a Philips iU 22
      machine according to a standardized protocol:

        -  12h fasting period

        -  exploratory scanning with the use of convex C5-1 probe

        -  detailed scanning with the use of linear L 12-5 probe with Power Doppler

        -  choosing a bowel segment with the most prominent changes

        -  Contrast-enhanced Ultrasound (CEUS)

      CEUS is performed according to the following protocol:

        -  administration of drotaverine hydrochloride (No-Spa ®) to reduse excessive peristaltic
           movement

        -  visualization of the previously chosen affected bowel segment with the use of DCE-US
           (Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound) technology

        -  administration of 2.4 ml SonoVue® intravenously with a bolus injection through a
           peripheric venous line (left antecubital vein), followed by a 10ml 0.9% Natrium Chloride
           bolus

        -  the video-loop is acquired during contrast agent administration and wash-out (preferable
           loop duration - 3 min)

        -  the original DICOM loop is sent to a work station Philips QLab platform is used to
           acquire a fitted Local Density Random Walk Wash-in Wash-out algorithm (LDRWIWO
           algorhithm) time-intensity curve of contrast agent wash-in and wash-out. Qualitative and
           quantitative (Time to peak, Rise time, Mean transit time, Wash-in Slope, Peak intensity,
           Area under curve, Time from peak to one half) parameters are calculated for each region
           of interest (ROI).
