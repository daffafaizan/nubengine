      in fruits/vegetables and low in energy-dense foods and engage in 150 minutes of
      moderate-to-vigorous physical activity each week. However, cancer survivors are provided with
      few, if any, resources to meet these guidelines and there are limited data supporting how
      cancer survivors can achieve sustained dietary change. There are even fewer behavioral change
      resources available to minority cancer survivors. Few studies have examined the separate and
      synergistic effects of in-person education and electronic or "e-"communication strategies in
      changing and maintaining health behaviors.
