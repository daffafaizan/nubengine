      I. To investigate whether two different radiologists can reliably interpret the following
      quantitative criteria regarding the maximally enhancing portion of a soft tissue sarcoma
      (STS), on sequential contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) exams performed before, during, and
      after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC): change in peak enhancement (decibels), change in slope
      of enhancement curve, and change in area under the curve.

      II. To evaluate CEUS as a potential early response assessment biomarker by comparing the CEUS
      rating result to computed tomography (CT)/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rating results.
      (Exploratory) III. To examine the agreement between CEUS versus CT/MRI determined treatment
      response within each radiologist rater. (Exploratory) IV. To examine the agreement between
      CEUS versus CT/MRI determined treatment response based on the consensus rating result from
      the two radiologist raters. (Exploratory) V. To explore potential quantitative biomarker from
      all possible parameters that can be extracted from CEUS data for assessing an early treatment
      response to neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) in sarcoma using receiver operating characteristic
      (ROC) curve when predicting radiologists rated binary outcome: responders versus
      non-responders. (Exploratory) VI. To collect preliminary data for shear wave elastography
      (SWE) in the same patient population. (Exploratory)

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo real-time CEUS and SWE at baseline, 6 weeks after initiation of neoadjuvant
      therapy, and 9 weeks after initiation of neoadjuvant therapy (prior to surgery).

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 24 hours.
