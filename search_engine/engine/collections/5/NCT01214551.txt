      tests (ECT) and that a heart rate-based protocol does not ensure sufficient exercise
      intensity to induce bronchoconstriction. It is not common clinical practice to perform a pre
      ECT to establish maximal heart rate or maximal oxygen uptake. The heart rate formula
      recommended by ATS (HRmax= 220-age) is usually applied to determine recommended intensity of
      the ECT. Conducting a second ECT, based on the knowledge of the first test, introduce the
      possibility to adjust the intensity on an individual basis. In addition, based on clinical
      experience, patients may seem reluctant to perform maximal the first time they undergo an ECT
      on a treadmill. The hypothesis is that patients are less reluctant to perform maximal the
      second time they undergo the test when they are more accustomed to the procedure and the
      treadmill by itself.
