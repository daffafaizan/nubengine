    
      The initial part of the study is a prospective cross-sectional study which will describe the
      biochemical coagulation profile in nephrotic patients. It will include 60 patients with
      nephrotic syndrome and data from 50 anonymous blood donors matched in age and gender for
      comparison.

      The second part of the study is an open-label, controlled, non-randomized, interventional
      clinical trial consisting of 3 groups of patients with nephrotic syndrome or atrial
      fibrillation treated with either Dalteparin or Apixaban. The study participant is expected to
      be in stable condition after 4 full days of treatment. For administrative reasons, the final
      biochemical tests are performed on day 4, 5, 6 or 7 described as day 4 in this protocol.

        -  Group A: Up to 50 patients with nephrotic syndrome treated with injection Dalteparin 200
           Units/kg subcutaneous once a day for 4 days

        -  Group B: 10 patients with nephrotic syndrome and membranous nephropathy treated with
           Apixaban 5 mg twice daily for 4 days.

        -  Group C: 10 patients with atrial fibrillation and no kidney disease treated with
           Apixaban 5 mg twice daily for 4 days.

      Patients participating in the initial part of the study will be included in det second part
      (Group A) if they meet the inclusion criteria. If the patient is diagnosed with membranous
      nephropathy it is possible to be included in the initial part as well as the second part
      (Group A and B).
