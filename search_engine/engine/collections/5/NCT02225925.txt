      adenocarcinoma has advantages over external beam radiation in that a very high dose can be
      delivered to the tumor while limiting the doses to the surrounding normal tissue (i.e., bowel
      and bladder). It is established that outcomes after treatment with brachytherapy are related
      to the technical quality of source placement within the gland. Accurate placement of the
      radioactive sources with achievement of optimum dose distributions within the prostate is key
      to the success of brachytherapy with regard to both killing tumor as well as minimizing
      toxicity.

      Due to factors such as deformations of the prostate during needle insertion, needle deviation
      from intended path during insertion, prostatic edema from needle trauma, and relaxation of
      tissues as well as source migration after needle removal, the actual source positions upon
      completion of the procedure may fail to accurately match their intended placement, resulting
      in variations from the idealized dosimetric plan.

      One way to overcome this complex problem is to have the capability of visualizing the sources
      once they are in the prostate and then continuously updating the dosimetric plan in real
      time. To this end, we have developed a mechanism whereby ultrasound and fluoroscopy are
      quantitatively integrated to allow for real-time visualization of source positions
      intraoperatively. A prior Phase I study performed by this group evaluated a prototype version
      of this mechanism, resulting in the successful treatment of 6 patients with true
      intraoperative dynamic dosimetry. Dosimetric outcomes within this cohort of patients was
      excellent, and the intraoperative doses predicted by the system more accurate than that
      predicted by the current standard method (ultrasound-based dosimetry).
