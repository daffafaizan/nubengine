      traditional Chinese medicine. It deems that a surgery might consume Qi, then cause to
      imbalance of Qi and Blood, especially in elder patients. Besides, surgery lead to change of
      stress response (hormones). The EAS administration intra-operatively perhaps be beneficial to
      recovery of patients, reduce the incidence of postoperative complications. The main possible
      mechanism was stress response regulation. The hypothesis is that the EAS improve
      postoperative recovery of patient through regulating stress response.
