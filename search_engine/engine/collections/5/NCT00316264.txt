      administered sequentially to high-risk children during the same RSV season. It was
      anticipated that approximately 240 children (80 in each group) would be enrolled from the
      southern hemisphere during the upcoming RSV season (2006). Children were randomized into one
      of three regimens in a 1:1:1 ratio; the first group received 2 doses of motavizumab followed
      by 3 doses of palivizumab; the second group received 2 doses of palivizumab followed by 3
      doses of motavizumab; and the third group received 5 doses of motavizumab. Motavizumab or
      palivizumab was administered at 15 mg/kg by IM injection every 30 days, for a total of 5
      injections.
