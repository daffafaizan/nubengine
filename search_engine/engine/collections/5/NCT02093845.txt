    
      SORT-OUT VIII is a randomised, multicenter, all-comer, two-arm, non-inferiority trial
      comparing the everolimus-eluting SYNERGY stent versus the Biomatrix NeoFlex stent in
      treatment of atherosclerotic coronary artery lesions.

      Primary Endpoint:

      Device-related Target Lesion Failure (TLF) hierarchically as cardiac death, non-index
      procedure related acute myocardial infarction (AMI) not clearly related to another lesion
      than the target lesion, or target lesion revascularisation (TLR) (new revascularization of
      target lesion) (significant stenosis in the stent ± 5 mm distal/proximal) by percutaneous
      coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass operation (CABG) within 12 months.

      Secondary Endpoint:

      Device-related target lesion failure hierarchically as cardiac death, non-index procedure
      related acute myocardial infarction, not clearly related to another lesion than the target
      lesion, or new target lesion revascularization by percutaneous coronary intervention or
      coronary bypass operation at 2-5 years.

      Patient-related combined endpoint hierarchically as all-cause death, non-index procedure
      related acute myocardial infarction or all new revascularizations by percutaneous coronary
      intervention or coronary bypass operation at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months.

      Individual above mentioned stent- or patient-related endpoints at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60
      months

      MACE (combined endpoint as cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction or new
      revascularization of the study vessel)

      Stent thrombosis defined according to the Academic Research Consortium (ARC) criteria within
      24 hours (acute), between 1 and 30 days (subacute), between 30 days and 12 months (late), and
      after 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 months (very late).

      Device success rate defined as the frequency of a successful implantation with residual
      stenosis < 20% of the study stent in all the stenoses scheduled to be treated.

      Procedural success rate defined as the frequency of successful implantation with residual
      stenosis <20% of the study stent in all the stenoses scheduled to be treated and without
      serious complications (cardiac death, non-index procedure related acute myocardial infarction
      related to target vessel or new revascularization of target lesion by percutaneous coronary
      intervention or coronary bypass operation).

      Inclusion criteria:

      All patients aged ≥18 years who are eligible for treatment with one or several drug-eluting
      coronary stents at one of the three heart centers in Odense, Skejby and Aalborg can be
      included in the study.

      Exclusion criteria Age < 18 years The patient does not wish to participate The patient is not
      able to consent to randomization (eg intubated patients) The patient do not live in Western
      Denmark The patient do not speak Danish The patient is already included in this study The
      patient is participating in other stent studies Life expectancy <1 year Allergic to Aspirin,
      clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor Allergic to everolimus or biolimus Only implanted bare
      metal stents (BMS) Only performed plain old balloon angioplasty (POBA)
