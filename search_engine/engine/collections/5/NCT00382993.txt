    
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, two-attack, out-patient,
      early-intervention evaluation of subjects who have migraine with or without aura and who
      discontinued use of short acting triptan(s) within the past year due to non-response or
      intolerance. Subjects will treat 2 separate migraine attacks during the mild phase of each
      attack; one attack will be treated with one tablet of the Combination Product (sumatriptan
      succinate and naproxen sodium) and the other attack with one tablet of placebo (crossover
      design); however, the order of these treatments will be randomized. A minimum 1-week washout
      period is required between study medication treatment of the first and second migraine
      attacks.

      Each subject will have two visits: (1) a Screening visit at study entry and (2) a Final visit
      4-10 days after the second (or last) attack. A telephone contact will also be required 1-3
      days after the first attack, and then once per month until the Final visit.

      The primary study objective is to assess efficacy as measured by sustained pain-free (SPF)
      relief of Combination Product compared to placebo in treating migraine subjects who have
      previously discontinued treatment with short acting triptans (rizatriptan, sumatriptan,
      almotriptan, zolmitriptan, and eletriptan).
