      given every 3 weeks (Q3W), following a single priming dose of cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 IV
      in patients with advanced triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) who have received at least one
      prior line of therapy. The primary objective is to estimate progression-free survival (PFS)
      for cyclophosphamide + pembrolizumab in advanced TNBC patients compared to pembrolizumab
      alone (historical PFS = 1.9 months).
