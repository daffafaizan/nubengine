      scheduled for a major surgical intervention, in whom standard haemodynamic monitoring
      includes arterial pressure monitoring.

      Non-invasive wired patches, connected to a Cheetah cardiac output monitor, will be installed,
      as well as traditional haemodynamic monitoring (ECG, SaO2, non-invasive blood pressure). A
      computer link between a Philips monitor (MP50 or MP70) is made, to obtain selected curves in
      a digital format for post-intervention processing. After awake insertion of an arterial
      catheter in the radial or brachial artery and induction of anaesthesia, patient becomes
      intubated and mechanically ventilated.

      Before surgery, following data will be registered for 5 min.: ECG, invasive arterial pressure
      tracing, cardiac output (Cheetah monitor), SaO2 tracing, arterial pressure tracing and pulse
      pressure and stroke volume variation (Nexfin).

      When SVV > 15%, the operation table will be put in Passive Leg Raising (PLR) to optimize the
      filling status of the patient (test of preload dependency). When positive haemodynamic
      reaction is present, the patients will obtain a rapid infusion bolus of 250 ml of
      crystalloids.
