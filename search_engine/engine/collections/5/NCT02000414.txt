    
      Methodology:

      Prospective, open-label, non-randomized pharmacokinetic study. Daptomycin will be given IP in
      the CAPD fluid (200mg in 2L Nutrineal) once daily, in a 6 hours-dwell time. The process of
      dialysis is done four times per day : three during the day (6,6,and 4 h) and one time at
      night (8h). Duration of treatment depends on bacteria identified (14 or 21 days).

      Analyses will be performed on data from all patients meeting the criteria for inclusion and
      exclusion.

      For each patient, plasma, dialysate and urine kinetics will be studied.

      For each parameter, mean and standard deviation are calculated.

      Number of centers & patients:

      One center, twelve patients.

      Sample size justification:

      This is an observational pharmacokinetic study of consecutive PD patients presenting to Caen
      University Hospital with peritoneal infection and who meet inclusion criterias over one year.

      Population: CAPD patients with a Gram positive peritoneal infection
