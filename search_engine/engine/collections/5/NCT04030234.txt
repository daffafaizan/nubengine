    
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, randomized controlled trial, which will randomize
      participants aged ≥50 years with an average baseline SBP ≥130 mmHg and a previous history of
      cardiovascular diseases or at high vascular risk. The study will compare the effects on the
      incidence of major cardiovascular events of allocation to achieve an intensive SBP goal (SBP
      <120 mmHg) with a standard SBP goal (SBP <140 mmHg) in four years of follow up.
