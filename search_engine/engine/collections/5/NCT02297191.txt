      guidance to inject local anesthesia into the potential space between the muscle bodies of the
      erector spinae. The medial branch of the dorsal ramus of each thoracolumbar nerve innervates
      the muscle and skin overlying the erector spinae muscle to the midline. By anesthetizing each
      nerve we believe minimally invasive (1-2 level) back surgery may be completed with less pain
      and preclude the side-effect laden opioid analgesics.
