      non-invasive, easily to perform, less time consume, has direct association with severity of
      inflammation of bronchial trees and sputum eosinophils, has benefit for diagnosis and
      monitoring the treatment in asthmatic patients.

      In Thailand, this field of study is less extend, especially in children population. The
      investigators hypothesized that patients with asthma exacerbation may have high level of
      fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) than non exacerbation group.

      It is therefore desirable to examine the association between fractional exhaled nitric oxide
      (FeNO) and asthma exacerbation among atopic asthmatic Thai children and will be the main
      objective of this research.
