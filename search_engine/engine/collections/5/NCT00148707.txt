    
      -  Patients will be given CT-2103 intravenously every 3 weeks. One week after the first
           dose of CT-2103 a physical exam, blood work and assessment of any side effects will be
           performed.

        -  Prior to each injection of CT-2103, a physical exam, blood work and assessment of any
           side effects will be performed (every 3 weeks).

        -  Every 6 weeks the patient's cancer will be re-evaluated with either a CT scan or MRI to
           determine whether the treatment is working.

        -  Additional blood work will be performed once per week after the first two doses of
           CT-2103.

        -  The participation in this study will last at least 2 cycles (6 weeks), however patients
           may remain on the study as long as there is no disease progression, and they are able to
           tolerate the study drug without severe side effects.
