        1. To compare the therapeutic window (TW) of directional versus nondirectional deep brain
           stimulation for treatment of tremor.

           Hypothesis: directional DBS will result in a wider TW than nondirectional DBS.

        2. To compare the effects of directional versus nondirectional DBS on speech Hypothesis:
           Objective and subjective speech impairment will occur to a greater extent in
           nondirectional DBS versus directional DBS optimized for tremor control.

        3. To compare the effects of directional versus nondirectional DBS on balance and gait
           Hypothesis: Objective and subjective balance and gait impairment will occur to a greater
           extent in nondirectional DBS versus directional DBS optimized for tremor control.

        4. To assess efficacy for tremor of nondirectional and directional DBS in an optimized
           programming configuration Hypothesis: both directional and nondirectional DBS will
           significantly improve tremor compared to baseline.
