      become severely deconditioned or weakened afterwards. For some individuals this can even mean
      that they can no longer completely return to their usual way of life following one of these
      major operations. As part of this study the investigators are attempting to identify ways to
      maximize patients' recovery and to maximize their overall quality of life following these
      major operations. It is possible that preconditioning may make a difference to patient's
      overall quality of life, decreased or need for hospital length of stay and decreased
      postoperative medical complications occasionally seen during these operations, in essence
      provide an overall enhancement to their surgical recovery. Physiatrists are physicians who
      are medical experts in maximizing a patient's overall ability to function well and live
      independently. Investigators are proposing patient participation in an initial pilot study in
      order to test the question as to whether or not participation with a physiatrist and any
      interventions recommended by said physician would help improve a patient's postoperative
      recovery.
