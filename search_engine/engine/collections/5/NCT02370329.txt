    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate for clinical response (complete remission [CR], partial remission [PR], or
      clinical improvement [CI]) as defined by International Working Group-Myeloproliferative
      Neoplasms Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) criteria in a cohort of intermediate-2/high risk
      myelofibrosis (MF) patients. Response in a second cohort of early stage MF patients will also
      be described.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the adverse event profile of P1101 in patients with myelofibrosis by cohort
      (early vs intermediate-2/high risk).

      II. To evaluate the tolerability of P1101 in patients with myelofibrosis by cohort (early vs
      intermediate-2/high risk).

      EXPLORATORY AND CORRELATIVE RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) and patient-reported symptoms using the
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) with P1101 for patients with
      myelofibrosis by cohort (early vs intermediate-2/high risk).

      II. To evaluate the impact of P1101 on bone marrow and histological features of myelofibrosis
      including cytogenetics, blast percentage, fibrosis, and JAK2-V617F allele burden by cohort
      (early vs intermediate-2/high risk).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive PEG-proline-interferon alpha-2b subcutaneously (SC) on days 1 and 15.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months for 3 years.
