      communities, implementing culturally and linguistically appropriate health promotion
      activities that improve families' diet and physical activity behaviors is imperative. "Radio
      Stories" is an education entertainment strategy that has significant potential as a health
      promotion tool. Through a CBPAR process, we aimed to create and test the effectiveness and
      acceptability of "SoLaHmo Radio Stories" about changing knowledge and behaviors to prevent or
      manage diabetes for Somali, Latino, and Hmong families.

      Methods: SoLaHmo community researchers interview 3 families (1 Somali, 1 Latino, and 1 Hmong)
      who have successfully implemented lifestyle changes to prevent or manage diabetes, and then
      create 3 "radio stories" based on the families' experiences. To test the stories, we are
      conducting a two-arm trial that includes intervention groups (20 people per community) that
      listen to the radio stories and control groups (20 people per community) that receive a
      brochure with similar information (N=120). Effectiveness and acceptability of the program
      will be tested with pre-and post questionnaires.

      Anticipated Results: Higher rates of satisfaction, increased knowledge, and intention to
      change in participants receiving the radio stories, as compared to control group
      participants, will indicate radio story program effectiveness and acceptability.
