      at many departments. It is thought to facilitate dissection and reduce peroperative bleeding,
      but the main argument for its use is that bleeding bone surfaces might impair the fixation of
      cemented prostheses, because of less cement penetration.

      We investigate in a RCT 50 patient with radiostereometric analysis, where 25 is randomized to
      a tourniquet during the hole operation and 25 are not.

      Primary outcome is MTPM, a meassure of migration(loosening) of the kneeprosthesis.

      Secondary outcomes are total bleeeding, pain, range of motion and outcome of a patient self
      assesed knee score (KOOS) Total follow up time 2 years
