      associated with longer hospital stays, increased costs, and morbidity. Postoperative delirium
      usually occurs 2~3 days after surgery. Intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine lacks
      preventing postoperative delirium in elderly noncardiac major surgery.

      We hypothesized postoperative dexmedetomidine for two days as a mixture drug of
      fentanyl-based PCA could reduce the incidence of postoperative delirium. We compared this
      effect with other control group who received fentanyl-based PCA only.

      We also investigate EEG patterns of patients during emergence and compared the EEG patterns
      who developed delirium postoperatively in PACU(Postanesthesia care unit) or general ward.
      Dexmedetomidine has analgesic effect. We expected postoperative dexmedetomidine has benefits
      of opioid sparing effects.
