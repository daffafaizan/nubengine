      with equal randomisation. The trial will be conducted in the Academic Vascular Surgical Unit
      of Hull York Medical School based at Hull Royal Infirmary, a university teaching hospital.

      Target population The target population for this study are individuals with symptoms of SVI
      with ultrasound evidence of axial vein reflux and who have agreed to receive treatment for
      their axial vein reflux.

      Recruitment Each patient referred to the vascular service with symptomatic SVI is assessed.
      Patients who potentially meet the inclusion criteria will be made aware of this research
      study and provided with the appropriate information, including the patient information sheet
      (see appendix 1). Patients will be given an opportunity to think about the invitation to
      participate and discuss with family/friends or other healthcare professionals if desired.
      Patients expressing an interest in participation will be offered an appointment for a
      screening visit with a study investigator.

      Randomisation and Blinding Randomisation Participants will be randomised to one of the three
      treatments. Randomisation will be conducted by a sealed envelope system. Once enrolled in the
      study, efforts will be made to assess and manage all participants as outlined in the
      allocated treatment protocol until the pre-determined end-point of the study or until
      participant withdrawal. Following randomisation the participant's GP will be informed of the
      intended treatment modality Blinding Due to the nature of the procedures involved it will not
      be possible to blind the participant or clinical team as to which group the participant is
      allocated. Bias will be limited by the use of objective measurements, standardised protocols,
      use of patient reported outcomes and standardised assessor outcomes.

      Power Calculation In order to detect a clinically significant difference in technical success
      of 15% with a power of 80% and a significance of 5%; 73 participants per group will be
      required. Assuming a 10% drop out rate we therefore aim to recruit 80 participants per group.
      The study will therefore randomise 240 participants in total over the 3 study groups.

      Treatment Protocol All cases will be performed on a day-case, out-patient basis as per the
      standard practice in our unit by an experienced endovenous surgeon. For each participant, the
      investigating team will re-assess the inclusion and exclusion criteria, confirm the consent
      and undertake the procedure as per the protocol.

      Participants judged to be at high risk of venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) due to the use
      of exogenous oestrogens, past medical history or a family history of VTE or thrombophilia or
      immobility will be given a single pre-operative dose of prophylactic molecular weight heparin
      (LMWH), in the absence of contraindications. All participants will have duplex assessment and
      marking using the same protocol with only the endovenous procedure differing.

      The sclerotherapy drug used will be Sodium Tetradecyl Sulphate, also known as STD and
      marketed as Fibrovein® (STD Pharmaceutical Products, Hereford, UK). STD comes in different
      variations of concentration, for this trial we will use 3%, 1.5% or 1% STD depending on the
      procedure protocol. STD can be used as foam or as a liquid preparation which makes it ideal
      for our study. The STD used will be from routine stocks. It will be stored at room
      temperature in a suitably secure location in the ward, clinic or theatre. Careful records
      will be kept regarding which participants receive STD and its batch number Preoperative
      procedure The treatment aim is to eradicate any significant SVI present in the limb.
      Preoperatively the veins are marked by the surgeon using duplex-ultrasound with the patient
      standing. This will identify the extent and position of the refluxing axial vein alongside
      any incompetent perforating veins and varicose tributaries. The significant superficial
      varicose vein (GSV, ASV, SSV, GV) to be treated will have its length measured and noted. In
      addition, the average diameter of the varicose vein will be calculated via three transverse
      images of the vein (proximal, middle and distal) and noted. Potential areas to be punctured
      by cannulae may have local analgesia applied prior to treatment. The participant will be
      positioned supine on the operating table where in the Clarivein and Ultrasound Catheter group
      sterile precautions including disinfectant skin preparation and sterile draping will be
      employed, and the Foam Sclerotherapy and tributary treatment group skin disinfectant only.
      The ultrasound transducer will be prepared with a sterile covering and secured to the sterile
      drapes to allow sterile intra-operative ultrasound duplex scanning.

      Operative Procedure: Foam Sclerotherapy Group The axial vein will be cannulated under local
      anaesthesia with an 18G (green), 20G (Pink) or 22G (Blue) Intravenous cannulae under
      ultrasound guidance with the patient reclined in a supine position for GSV or ASV treatment,
      prone position if SSV or GV treatment. This will be performed at the lowest point of
      demonstrable reflux and throughout the length of the incompetent vein at 20cm intervals. Each
      insufficient tributary system will also be cannulated separately. Venous blood will be
      aspirated and the cannulae flushed with normal saline to confirm that each is inside the
      target vein. Local anaesthesia can be used at each puncture site prior to needle insertion if
      desired by the patient. Once the cannulae are secured the leg is elevated to empty the veins.

      The foam is then prepared by the Tessari technique by the surgeon. Two 2-ml syringes will be
      connected via a three way stop-cock tap and a 5 micron filter in series (Braun Medical,
      Sheffield, UK). The syringes will contain 1 part Sodium Tetradecyl Sulphate 3% and 3 parts
      air. In practice 0.5ml of 3% STS will be drawn up against 2 ml of air. The foam will be
      produced by at least 20 passages from syringe to syringe through the filter.

      Up to 2ml of foam will be injected into each cannula under ultrasound control to observe
      venous spasm, followed by gentle massaging of the skin to propagate the foam through the
      segment of vein treated. The surgeon will also endeavour to prevent propagation of fresh foam
      beyond perforators and junctions into the deep venous system. The patient will be asked to
      dorsi-flex and plantar-flex their ankle several times to clear any foam which might have
      entered the deep venous system. At least 30 seconds will be left between each injection of
      foam. As per the European consensus guidelines a maximum of 12mls of foam will be used at one
      sitting32 33. Typical volumes of foam reported by Bradbury are 4-12ml in the GSV and 2-8 ml
      in the SSV34. After ensuring that the axial vein is treated the surgeon can then progress to
      the treating the tributaries and application of the dressings, as detailed below.

      Operative Procedure: Catheter Directed Foam Sclerotherapy (CDS) Group The straight segment of
      axial vein will be cannulated under local anaesthesia at the lowest point of demonstrable
      reflux and a guide-wire inserted to facilitate the placement of the catheter system. The
      access cannulae will be removed and replaced with a 5F introducer sheath over a guide. A
      Unifuse® (AngioDynamics, Cambridge, UK) catheter system will be deployed via the sheath.

      Unifuse® catheters available are 5F with either 45 cm or 90 cm lengths in combination with
      5cm, 10cm or 15cm long infusion patterns. The appropriate Unifuse® catheter will be selected
      and deployed through the introducer sheath and advanced to within 2cm of the junction or
      perforator at the upper limit of incompetence or the top of the incompetent segment in the
      case of segmental reflux. The catheter will be aspirated to ensure correct position and
      flushed with normal saline. Each tributary system will be cannulated as was the case in the
      FS group.

      A 1:3 foam of 3% STD will be produced as described for FS. At this point the patient will be
      repositioned into a Trendelenburg position (head up). The Unifuse® Self-Occluding ball wire
      will be inserted and the tip correctly positioned at 2cm from the junction under ultrasound
      guidance. As the internal diameter of the Unifuse® catheter is 1mm (3F) approximately 0.35ml
      of foam in the 45cm catheter or 0.7ml of form for the 90cm catheter will be injected to fill
      the dead-space. The appropriate volume of foam will be then be infused through the Unifuse®
      catheter during withdrawal under ultra-sound guidance. The catheter will be withdrawn the
      length of the infusion pattern following each injection. The surgeon will endeavour to
      prevent propagation of fresh foam beyond the perforators and junctions into the deep venous
      system. The maximum volume of foam used in one sitting is again limited to 12 ml, although
      the dead space in the catheter will be added to this. Once the varicose vein is treated the
      total volume of foam used is noted. After ensuring that the axial varicose vein is treated
      the surgeon can then progress to the treating the tributaries and application of the
      dressings, as detailed below.

      Study Visits Baseline measurements will be collected from all participants once consent is
      obtained and prior to randomisation. Study measurements will be taken on the day of treatment
