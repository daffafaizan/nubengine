      addiction,intolerance etc.The improvement of mindfulness ,the emotional quotient(EQ) proved
      to be effective to reduce the problems.The original teaching methods in school or in the
      temple are inadequate from increasing number of adolescent problems. The new technique
      integrated between Buddhism and group intervention is proposed to improve the mindfulness and
      EQ in adolescence.
