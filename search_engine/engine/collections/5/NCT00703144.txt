    
      The pharmacokinetics of piperacillin/tazobactam will be evaluated in twenty septic patients
      with renal failure undergoing continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration. This is a prospective
      study.

      Continuous replacement therapy has a continuous effect on drug elimination which could
      compromise effective antibiotic treatment.

      Patients will receive a standard course of pip/tazo 4g intravenously 8 hourly administrated
      immediately when CVVHDF will be started.

      Blood samples will be collected at 30mn, 2h, 4h, 6h, 8h, 16h, 24h for the first and the
      second day.

      We will measure plasma piperacillin/tazobactam concentration and compare them to MICs for the
      whole dosing interval.
