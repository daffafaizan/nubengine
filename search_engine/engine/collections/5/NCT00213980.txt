      bisphosphonate, on the bone mineral density (BMD) of postmenopausal women with breast cancer.
      An approved bisphosphonate, alendronate, is of benefit in patients with osteoporosis,
      however, this agent has a roughly 30% incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms and up to 50% of
      patients may take the drug improperly, compromising absorption and potentially efficacy.
      Zoledronate is a heterocyclic imidazole third generation bisphosphonate, which is
      administered intravenously (IV) and has little toxicity. Zoledronate is more potent than
      alendronate, and because of its route of administration it does not have the problems of poor
      oral bioavailability and non-compliance.
