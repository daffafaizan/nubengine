      have history of osteoporotic fracture or hyperkyphosis (hunched-back posture). Participants
      will be randomized to either a Nordic walking intervention group or a waiting-list control
      group (the latter group will receive same intervention after the trial is completed). The
      pole-walking intervention will be 12 weeks in duration, including 3 weekly Nordic walking
      sessions (warm up, Nordic walking with posture and leg strengthening exercises and stretches)
      tailored to each participants. The investigators will define osteoporosis status at baseline
      (via DXA scans). The investigators will compare between group changes in dynamic balance,
      posture, quality of life, mobility, muscle strength, size and composition (using low
      radiation CT scans) after 3 months of Nordic walking intervention.
