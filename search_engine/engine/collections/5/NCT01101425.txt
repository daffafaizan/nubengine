    
      Objectives retrospective part (closed to patients registration in September 2013):

        -  To perform a large international joint retrospective analysis of clinical and biological
           data of male breast cancer (BC) patients treated from 1990 to 2010.

        -  To create a database of patient characteristics, disease features, treatments received,
           and clinical outcomes of a large series of men diagnosed with BC from 1990 to 2010 in
           centers in Europe and USA.

        -  To perform a central pathological review of the corresponding large series of male BC
           tumors to determine their biologic characteristics and identify relevant prognostic and
           predictive markers.

      Objectives prospective part (opened early 2014):

        -  To run a prospective registry of all male BC patients (including newly diagnosed)
           irrespective of the stage and treatment, in the participating institutions for a period
           of 30 months; collection of FFPE, fresh frozen and blood samples is optional but highly
           encouraged.

        -  Quality of Life sub-study

      The two parts of this study will provide important information regarding male BC biology and
      clinical evolution. The collected follow-up information will provide an overview of the
      current practice in the early and the advanced disease and also offer precious information of
      the disease evolution in such rare patients' population.
