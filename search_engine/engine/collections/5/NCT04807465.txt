      this study. After allocation of patients into 2 groups according to their smoking habits
      (non-smokers; 24, smokers;23), lesions in each patient were restored with a resin composite,
      (Essentia, GC) using a universal adhesive G-Premio Bond and phosphoric acid (i-Dental) in
      three different application modes (etch&rinse, selective-etch or self-etch). The restorative
      treatments were performed by single operator. Two experienced and calibrated examiners
      evaluated the restorations for retention, marginal discoloration, marginal adaptation, color
      match, postoperative sensitivity and secondary caries at one week (baseline), at 6-, 12, and
      18 months using modified USPHS criteria.While the USPHS criteria measure the clinical
      performance of the restorative material, it scores according to three different
      degrees;Alpha:The restoration is clinically perfect. Bravo:All features of the restoration
      are sufficient, need not be renewed. Charlie: the restoration is clinically unsuccessful,
      unacceptable. The gingival and plaque index were also assessed with a periodontal probe.
