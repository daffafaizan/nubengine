    
      A randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of combination therapy longwave
      diathermy on high power and interferential currents, as compared to longwave diathermy at low
      power (control group) for sensory and motor symptoms in patients with CIPN in the feet and
      lower legs. Sensory and motor symptoms are defined as numbness, pain, discomfort and balance
      impairment.

      Interferential currents is administered by "Electrostimulation unit ES-520 & Vacuum Unit.

      The longwave diathermy at low and high power is given thru capacitive energy transfer system
      and is administered by "Skanlab 25 Bodywave".

      The drugs that have been clinically tested in other studies were magnesium, calcium, vitamin
      E and B6, glutamine, glutathione, n-acetyl cysteine omega-3 fatty acids, acetyl-L-carnitine
      and alpha lipoic acid.
