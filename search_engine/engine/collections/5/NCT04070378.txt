      multiple myeloma, has broad-ranging immunomodulatory effects on nonplasma cells that express
      CD38, and is able to cross the blood-brain barrier. CD38 expression on CD8+ T-cells is
      significantly increased in the blood of early AD patients as compared with age-matched
      controls, and activated T-cells are capable of trafficking into the central nervous system
      and exerting toxic effects. This study is designed to explore whether treatment with
      Daratumumab may have a clinically meaningful effect on patients with mild to moderate
      Alzheimer's disease.
