    
      Tibial osteotomies represents a well-established treatment option for the medial femorotibial
      knee arthrosis.

      Osteotomy can be performed in minus or in plus, at the latter case with or without
      interposition of tissue (autologous bone, heterologous bone or bone substitute).

      Even though excessive bleeding is not a frequent complication, the blood loss and formation
      of subcutaneous haematoma can determinate more post-interventional pain, wound suffering and
      the risk of infections.

      Tranexamic acid is an antifibrinolytic agent and its use in proximal tibia osteotomies has
      been retrospectively evaluated in a number of papers, all of which agree on its safety and
      efficacy in terms of reducing peri-operative bleeding. However, to date there have been no
      randomised clinical trials demonstrating its superiority in terms of reducing bleeding,
      subcutaneous haematoma and wound complications in proximal tibia osteotomies.

      This is a randomised controlled double-blind clinical trial focused on the evaluation of the
      effectiveness of the tranexamic acid on bleeding , pain and wound complications reduction in
      tibial osteotomies
