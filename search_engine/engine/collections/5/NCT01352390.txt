      colorful reminders to engage in a given health behavior. Others will receive identical
      reminders along with a prompt to share the reminder sheet with their child so it can be
      turned into a piece of art. The investigators are interested in whether the coloring prompt
      will lead the reminder to stay in the home for longer, be placed on the refrigerator, etc.
      and thus result in an increase in compliance with the recommended health behavior.
