      called Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) that helps CLL cells live and grow. By blocking this,
      it is possible that the study drug will kill cancer cells or stop them from growing.
      Ibrutinib has been FDA approved for the treatment of CLL patients who have received at least
      one prior treatment; however, the FDA has not yet approved ibrutinib as the first treatment
      for previously untreated CLL. Therefore, ibrutinib is still considered to be study drug,
      which means it is still being studied.

      Fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, and rituximab (FCR) are intravenous chemotherapy and antibody
      drugs that together are a standard chemotherapy regimen used for younger patients with CLL.
      Although FCR is highly effective, it does not typically lead to cure.

      In this research study, the investigators are combining a new treatment for CLL, ibrutinib,
      with a standard chemotherapy regimen for CLL, FCR, to determine whether this combination
      (iFCR) is safe and effective for patients with previously untreated CLL.
