      from slow growing prostate cancer at diagnosis, and for better support systems to guide
      patients in decision-making regarding management options.

      Decision support interventions that are tailored to specific clinical conditions are known to
      have increased patient self-efficacy, knowledge, question-asking, and satisfaction; and
      decreased decisional conflict, regret, anxiety, and distress.

      To reduce the risk of over-treatment, our team has developed individual risk prediction
      models that we have now integrated into our decision support intervention (DSI).

      Delivering such decision support intervention should increase patient knowledge and
      question-asking by the patient to their doctor.

      The decision support intervention can be delivered by telephone and or the Internet.
