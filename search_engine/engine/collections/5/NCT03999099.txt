      public health and economic crisis continues as no interventions effectively prevent smoking
      relapse. Between 40-70% of smokers are unable to maintain abstinence and 75% of those who do
      attain abstinence will relapse within one-year. These relapse rates remain high even when
      using currently available cessation aids, which primarily target the cholinergic system,
      suggesting the need for medications with novel targets such as orexin. The current proposal
      will improve scientific knowledge and/or clinical practice by translating preclinical
      research on orexin into the clinical domain by indicating: 1) whether orexin antagonism
      attenuates motivational factors associated with smoking relapse, 2) whether suvorexant shows
      promise as a smoking cessation aid, or 3) whether suvorexant contributes too many unwanted
      side effects despite mitigating the motivation to smoke, thus confirming the role of orexin
      in nicotine dependence and indicating the need to develop more specific orexin antagonists.
