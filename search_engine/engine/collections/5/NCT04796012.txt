      solid tumors in childhood. This combination has not been tested. Thus, in the first cohort,
      investigators will determine the feasibility of administering vincristine, irinotecan,
      temozolomide, and atezolizumab simultaneously in children with relapsed or refractory solid
      tumors, regardless of PD-L1 status. In the next cohort, investigators will determine the
      objective response rate (ORR), duration of response, and progression-free survival of
      children with PD-L1(+) relapsed or refractory solid tumors treated with vincristine,
      irinotecan, temozolomide, and atezolizumab.
