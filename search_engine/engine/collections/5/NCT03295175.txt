      identity document or the number of the attention. The urologist who perform the correction of
      the megaprepuce, will take a segment of the dartos and send it for histopathological
      analysis: staining with hematoxylin-eosin, smooth muscle actin marker, associated with the
      research record number. Same procedure will be performed with the controls and hypospadias
      group. Only the principal investigator will know the assignment of medical record and their
      respective group (congenital megaprepuce, hypospadias or controls). The samples will be sent
      to pathology without any clinical data, and they will be analyzed by two pathologists, both
      blind.
