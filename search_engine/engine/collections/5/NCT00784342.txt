    
      This is a prospective longitudinal study of adult patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) who will be enrolled when their COPD is considered clinically stable or during
      an acute exacerbation. This design will allow both within-person and between-person
      comparisons by exacerbation experience. Comprehensive clinical and patient-reported
      assessments will be performed at baseline and at 3 months (end of study). Subsets of items
      will be administered by interactive voice response (IVR) over the course of the study to
      measure changes in key symptoms over the course of recovery from an exacerbation. A subset of
      patients will be interviewed at the end of the study to assess content validity of PROMIS
      items in this patient population.

      With such a study design, we will be able to evaluate the validity of the PROMIS items in
      this patient population under acute and stable conditions and evaluate responsiveness of
      several PROMIS item banks under conditions of known change in an underlying chronic disease.
      We will also evaluate stability of sub-domains that are not hypothesized to change with COPD
      exacerbations.
