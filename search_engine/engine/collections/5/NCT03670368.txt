      or comparison group. A second set of participants will be randomly assigned to either being
      in the mentee or comparison group. These participants will come from Chicago Public School
      elementary schools. In total, there will be 125 mentors, 125 comparators, 125 mentees, and
      125 comparators. Participants will come for a laboratory visit in which cardiovascular health
      measures will be taken (details below). Visits will occur once at baseline (before the
      intervention starts), and once post-intervention. There will be a mid-point assessment of
      questionnaires. Participants in the intervention group will engage in one-on-one mentoring
      sessions (mentors together with mentees) once a week after school for the school year.
      Participants in the comparator group will receive written versions of all materials covered
      in the mentoring sessions.
