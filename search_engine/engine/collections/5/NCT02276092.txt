      dosing, route and duration of antibiotic therapy. Antimicrobial stewardship programs usually
      include pharmacists and/or doctors with expertise in infection diseases management.
      Prospective chart review and physician feedback is a common intervention used by
      antimicrobial stewardship programs to improve antibiotic utilization and patient outcomes.

      Pneumonia is the most common reason for antibiotic utilization in hospitals. Significant
      variation in antibiotic utilization for patients with pneumonia has been repeatedly
      demonstrated in published studies despite the existence of best-practice treatment
      guidelines. Treatment variation from these guidelines has been demonstrated to result in
      worse outcomes such as increased mortality. Antimicrobial stewardship programs can help
      reduce the treatment variation from guidelines.

      Despite improvements in certain outcomes, antimicrobial stewardship programs have not
      demonstrated any impact on the length of stay of patients admitted to hospital with
      pneumonia. Part of this absence of evidence may be due to poor study design and failure to
      recruit sufficient patients. This study will include the implementation of an antimicrobial
      stewardship program across many hospitals and the study design and analysis will account for
      the design problems of the previous studies.
