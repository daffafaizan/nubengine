    
      Application of marketed compression systems (Juxta-Fit or Trico bandages) used for treatment
      by trained specialists with assessment of the interface pressure and volume reduction. For
      the first two hours, bandages and Juxta fit will be applied by experienced medical staff and
      the use of the juxta-fit device will be explained to the patient. Thereafter the devices will
      be removed and patients in the Juxta fit group will apply the device themselves in the
      treatment. In this second phase after 2 hours, patients may adjust the Juxta-Fit according to
      their needs and comfort when they feel the device is getting too loose as activity of
      self-management during 24 hours. The patient will document this in a diary.

      Detailed measuring data:

      Volumetry:

      Measurements after 0h, 2h and 24 h by using classic water displacement apparatus.

      Pressure:

      Measurements after 0h, 2h (pre and post system change) and 24 h at the B1 region:

        -  Supine and standing to calculate the Static Stiffness Index (SSI);

        -  Supine with and without dorsal flexion to calculate the Dynamic Stiffness index (DSI).

      Circumference measurement as safety parameter At 5 cm above the upper part of the patella the
      circumference is measured at 0-2-24 hours to monitor eventual fluids shift.

      Questionnaire

      - The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) is used at 0 (pre-treatment), 2 and 24 hours to register the
      comfort of the materials used.
