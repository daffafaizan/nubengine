    
      Background:

      That diabetes cause serious diabetic complications from the eyes, kidneys, nerves and large
      vessels is known. Good metabolic control during the first 8-10 years has been shown to delay
      and even alleviate diabetes complications, but not entirely prevent them. When complications
      occur early after diabetes onset there are also likely genetic causes. If the various
      diabetes complications have different formation mechanisms or different sensitivity of blood
      sugar impact is not studied previously.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Genetic factors determine increased risk of early onset of complications.

        2. Oxidative stress increases the risk of complications.

        3. Inflammation, hyperlipidemia and hypertension leads to hypoxia and oxidative stress.

        4. Combined hypoxia and hyperglycemia leads to complications.

      Questionnaires:

        1. Are there measurable risk factors that indicate different sensitivity to develop
           diabetes complications?

        2. Are there differences between men and women?

        3. Are there differences between type 1 and type 2 diabetes?

      Knowledge achievements:

      Being able to anticipate and prevent diabetes complications with specific approaches would
      mean major benefits for patients and society.
