      In adult and pediatric studies, the BIS monitor has been shown to decrease time to emergence,
      decrease volatile anesthesia requirement, decrease recovery time and in some cases, decrease
      post-operative morbidity (REFS). The effect on intra-operative and post-operative parameters,
      when BIS is present but not specifically designated to be used as a monitor to guide
      anesthesia delivery, has not been specifically examined. This will be the first pediatric
      study which applies BIS on all patients and randomizes the anesthesiologists to either be or
      not be privy to seeing the BIS values during intra-operative period.
