      locally advanced stage II-III rectal cancer, based on several randomized Phase III clinical
      trials. With this standard treatment, 5-year local failure rate and distant metastasis rate
      is 10% and around 35%, respectively. Capecitabine, an analog of 5-fluoruracil (5FU), was
      demonstrated to have similar treatment results compared to 5-FU, but have much lower
      toxicities. Oxaliplatin based chemotherapy, also showed a better disease-free survival rate
      compared with 5-FU based-regimen. So far, some Phase I/II studies have shown the safety and
      preliminary results of either concurrent chemotherapy of capecitabine or oxaliplatin and
      capecitabine. The long-term results in comparison of capecitabine concurrent
      chemoradiotherapy with oxaliplatin/capecitabine concurrent chemoradiotherapy need to be
      further analyzed.
