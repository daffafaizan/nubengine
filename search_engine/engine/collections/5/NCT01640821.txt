      at the end of the intervention period (T=2), and at 1-y post-intervention (T=3). While data
      collection instructions and assessment materials will be provided by the research team,
      administration of the CdM? program will be totally under the responsibility of each CSSS, so
      that the program will occur outside of the research team control. Validated questionnaires
      will be used to assess nutritional profile, physical activity level, and psychosocial
      variables among the participants (N=168). Weight, height and waist circumference will also be
      measured for each participant. In order to ensure that our results are not due to the effect
      of time, women on a waiting list for CdM? program, will be recruited (N=84) for the
      short-term effect. All these data will be treated using sophisticated analyses strategies.
