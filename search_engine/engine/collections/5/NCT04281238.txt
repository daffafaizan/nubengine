    
      Yoga is an ancient Indian practice, dating back several thousand years, with objective of
      uniting mind, body, and spirit. In Western cultures, Hatha yoga is most commonly practiced,
      and generally includes a set of physical poses(asanas), breathing techniques(pranayama) and
      deep relaxation(savasana).Yoga has been shown to increase mobility, reduce pain, and improve
      quality of life in many diseases. However, there is no study examining the effects of yoga
      training in AS patients.Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the effects of
      yoga training in AS patients.

      60 AS patients aged 20-60 years will be randomly assigned to yoga or control group. Home
      exercises will be taught to both groups, and a brochure with home exercises will be given.
      The yoga group will participate in a yoga class 3 days a week, during 8 weeks. The control
      group will not participate in a yoga class, only will do home exercises. Assessments will be
      done at baseline and after 8 weeks.
