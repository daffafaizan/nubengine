      followed by resection of the radiated tumor at the time of transplant.

      The study is a 3+3 phase 1 study with incremental dose of radiation to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD). Dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be defined as grade 3+ radiation
      related toxicity. If one DLT is seen, then an additional 3 patients will be treated at the
      same dose level. If 2 or more DLT are seen at any given dose level, then the previous dose
      level will be defined as the MTD. A minimum of 3 patients and maximum of 18 patients will be
      included for the phase 1a. Due to the expected higher radiation risks in patients with
      end-stage ILD (group 1), these patients will be stratified separately from non-ILD patients
      (group 2, 3 and 4) during phase 1a. Dose tested are: 3 x 400 cGy, 3 x 600 cGy and 3 x 800 cGy
      for the ILD cohort and 3 x 800 cGy, 3 x 1000 cGy and 3 x 1200 cGy for the non-ILD cohort.

      Once the MTD is determined, patients will proceed to phase 1b using the MTD determined in the
      phase 1a. ILD and non-ILD patients may have different MTD so two separate phase Ib cohorts
      will be conducted. A total of 12 patients will be included for each cohort in the phase 1b.
      The dose distribution will be administered using a standard homogenous dose distribution for
      tumors â‰¤2 cm, and an heterogeneous dose distribution for tumors >2 cm.
