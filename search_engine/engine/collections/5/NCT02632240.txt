      xenogenic collagen matrix and CTG used with the tunnel technique. The collagen matrix is a
      possible alternative to connective tissue graft.

      The purpose of this clinical study is to compare short-term (3-6 months) outcomes of a root
      coverage using the tunnel technique with the collagen matrix and the same technique with CTG
      for the treatment of multiple recessions Miller class I and II.

      Twenty eight patients are enrolled in the study. Patients in the test group are treated with
      xenogenic collagen matrix using the tunnel technique whereas patients in the control group
      with CTG. Clinical recordings are obtained at baseline and after 3 and 6 months. The
      percentage of average recession coverage (ARC) is evaluated after 3 and 6 months after the
      surgery.
