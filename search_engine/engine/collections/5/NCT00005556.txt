      As bone marrow transplantation becomes one of the preferred treatments for life-threatening
      diseases of the blood, increasing numbers of patients must seek compatible marrow from
      unrelated donors. The low probability of finding a good patient-donor marrow match means that
      between one- to two-thirds of ill patients never locate a donor with perfectly compatible
      marrow. Furthermore, once volunteers are identified as a preliminary match for a patient, 30
      to 40 percent are either unwilling or medically unable to actually donate marrow. Thus,
      volunteer attrition contributes significantly to the problems already inherent in finding a
      suitable donor candidate.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study examined the relationship of volunteer characteristics and donor center factors to
      volunteer psychological outcomes during two critical stages in the blood testing process and
      to donor center rates of volunteer cooperation at these stages.

      Longitudinal and cross-sectional survey data were gathered from a total of over 2,900
      potential marrow donors who were at one of two critical decision points in the process
      leading to donation (DR-blood-typing, CT-blood-typing), and from personnel at the 100 NMDP
      donor centers. These data allowed the investigators to (a) describe the distribution and
      interrelationships between donor center structural characteristics and the strategies centers
      utilize for volunteer recruitment and retention, (b) determine which donor center factors
      (both structural and tactical) and volunteer background characteristics best predict positive
      volunteer-specific psychological outcomes at later typing stages, and examine and revise
      models of individual volunteer-specific outcomes and aggregate across-center retention rates.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
