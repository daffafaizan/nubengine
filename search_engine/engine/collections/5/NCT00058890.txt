    
      Double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of gabapentin for the pruritus of
      cholestasis. Duration: 4 weeks. Some travel funds available for patients from out of the NY
      area for all the visits. Hospitalization at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment. One
      outpatient department visit at week 2.

      All patients have to be referred by their physician, who will receive a summary of the
      results at the end of the patient's study participation.

      If patients are randomized to active drug and respond to it with decrease in pruritus, a one
      week supply of medication is given. The referring physician could prescribe the drug for long
      term use. If the patient is randomized to placebo they can be treated with active medication
      provided by the study for 4 weeks, at end of which, the drug could be prescribed by referring
      physician if the patient responds to the drug with decrease in the pruritus.
