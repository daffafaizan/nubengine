      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of adjuvant tamoxifen vs anastrozole, in terms of local control and
           prevention of contralateral disease, in postmenopausal women with locally excised ductal
           carcinoma in situ.

        -  Compare side effect profiles of these drugs in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the efficacy of these drugs, according to the receptor status of the primary or
           recurrent cancer in these patients.

        -  Compare the rate of breast cancer recurrence and growth of new contralateral tumors
           after cessation of treatment with these drugs in these patients.

        -  Compare breast cancer mortality in patients treated with these drugs.

        -  Compare the effect of these drugs on other cancers, cardiovascular disease, fracture
           rates, and non-breast cancer deaths in these patients.

        -  Compare the tolerability and acceptability of side effects experienced by patients
           treated with these drugs.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, multicentre study. Patients are stratified
      according to participating centre. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tamoxifen and oral placebo once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral anastrozole and oral placebo once daily. In both arms,
           treatment continues for 5 years in the absence of disease recurrence or unacceptable
           toxicity.

      Patients are followed annually for 5 years and a further 5 years (minimum) off treatment.

      ACTUAL ACCRUAL: A total of 2,980 patients were accrued for this study over 9 years.
