    
      This is a single-arm, open-label, study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the
      selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) compound, Selinexor given orally to patients
      with transfusion-dependent, EPO-refractory lower-risk MDS (Low risk and Intermediate-1 as
      defined by IPSS). Patients will be dosed at the clinic on clinic visit days and received
      Selinexor for dosing at home on additional days.

      Patients will be evaluated for disease response according to the 2006 IWG response criteria
      for MDS. This includes evaluation for altering the natural history of disease, cytogenic
      response hematologic improvement, and quality of life.
