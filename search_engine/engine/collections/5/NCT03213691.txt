      I. To determine the objective response rate (ORR; complete response + partial response) in
      pediatric patients treated with selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) with advanced solid
      tumors (including central nervous system [CNS] tumors), non-Hodgkin lymphomas or histiocytic
      disorders that harbor activating genetic alterations in the MAPK pathway.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the progression free survival in pediatric patients treated with selumetinib
      (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) with advanced solid tumors (including CNS tumors), non-Hodgkin
      lymphomas or histiocytic disorders that harbor MAPK activation mutations.

      II. To obtain additional information about the tolerability of selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen
      sulfate) in children with relapsed or refractory cancer.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate other biomarkers as predictors of response to selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen
      sulfate) and specifically, whether tumors that harbor different mutations or fusions will
      demonstrate differential response to selumetinib (AZD6244 hydrogen sulfate) treatment.

      II. To explore approaches to profiling changes in tumor genomics over time through evaluation
      of circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive selumetinib sulfate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Cycles
      repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
