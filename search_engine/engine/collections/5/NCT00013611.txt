      advanced HIV infection who are treated with interleukin-2 (IL-2) plus active antiretroviral
      therapy (ART) to a control group of individuals treated with stable ART alone. The primary
      objective of the study is to determine if intermittent cycles of IL-2 delay the occurrence of
      opportunistic infections and the progression of advanced HIV disease compared to ART alone.

      Patients will be assigned randomly to 1 of 2 groups. Patients in Group 1 will receive
      subcutaneous IL-2 twice a day for 5 days, every 8 weeks, in addition to ART. Patients in
      Group 2 will receive ART only. In both groups, CD4+ T cell counts and viral load are
      monitored.
