      dosed at each dose level. The first 3-week cycle of treatment constitutes the dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT) evaluation period. If none of the 3 patients experience a DLT during the
      evaluation period and the Safety Review Committee agrees this was a reasonably well tolerated
      dose, 3 patients will be enrolled at the next dose level. However, in the event of 1 DLT, 3
      additional patients will be enrolled at the same dose level. Any dose level with 2 or more
      DLTs will be considered to have exceeded the maximum tolerated dose and subsequent patients
      will be enrolled at lower dose levels. After the first cycle, patients may continue to
      receive XMT-1522 until disease progression as long as the drug is well-tolerated and patients
      continue to derive clinical benefit in the opinion of the Investigator.

      After completion of the dose escalation, the expansion segment will enroll the patients with
      the following kinds of cancer:

        -  Cohort 1: Advanced breast cancer, HER2 IHC 1+, or HER2 IHC 2+ without HER2 gene
           amplification

        -  Cohort 2: Advanced breast cancer, HER2-positive, who have received prior ado-trastuzumab
           emtansine

        -  Cohort 3: Advanced gastric cancer, HER2-positive, who have received prior trastuzumab

        -  Cohort 4: Advanced non-small cell lung cancer, HER2 IHC 2+ or 3+, any HER2 gene
           amplification or mutation status
