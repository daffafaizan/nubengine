      patients with diffuse large B cell Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma. However not every patient benefits
      with this expensive therapy. Recent data suggest that patients with BCL-6 negative lymphoma
      are more sensitive to Rituximab therapy. It is also known that patients with
      high-intermediate and high IPI risk does not benefit form standard three weekly CHOP
      chemotherapy.

      In this study we intend to define a subgroup of patients in whom this therapy will be of
      maximum benefit.

      We will prospectively treat a group of patients with the following characteristics:

      < 60 years old low and low intermediate IPI risk BCL-6 negative B-cell NHL Treatment regimen:
      R-CHOP (standard dosis) for 8 cycles
