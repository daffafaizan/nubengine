    
      Two or three embryos will be transferred at day 5 after ovum pick-up (OPU).

      The patients will be divided randomly (closed envelop method) into 3 groups:

        -  Group A (50 patients): embryos will be transferred using a medium supplemented with 0.5
           mg/mL of hyaluronic acid (EmbryoGlue®, Vitrolife, Sweden) for 20 minutes before
           intrauterine transfer took place

        -  Group B (50 patients): embryos will be transferred using a medium of 30%
           Protein-supplemented Culture Medium (Global total®, Life Global group, Canada) for 20
           minutes.

        -  Group C (50 patients): a novel technique in which embryos will be transferred using a
           medium of autologous Follicular Fluid for 20 minutes.

      Follicular fluid will be collected in a sterile procedure, centrifuged for 20 minutes in an
      embryo test tube. The supernatant will be removed in a sterilized technique then heated to
      56°C for 30 minutes then filtered through 0.22 micron filter. Gentamycin sulphate will be
      added at a concentration of 10 µg/mL then the liquid is preserved in a normal freezer.

      Defreezing follicular fluid will be performed at day-1 before embryo transfer. The follicular
      fluid will be warmed to room temperature. Preparation of embryo transfer media will be
      performed as usual, will be covered with paraffin oil (Ovoil®, Vitrolife, Sweeden) and then
      incubated overnight in 7% CO2, 9% O2, 22% N2.

      All embryo transfers will be performed using an embryo transfer catheter (Labotect catheter,
      Labotect GmbH, Germany).

      Number of embryos transferred will be according to ASRM guideline 2013 on day 5 after ovum
      pick-up (OPU).
