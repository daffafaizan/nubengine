      myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure, and recent studies also show that sST2 is
      involved in acute rejection of the cardiac graft in recipients. Experimental studies confirm
      that the ST2 / IL-33 pathway is involved in the process leading to cardiac transplant
      rejection in animals. In particular, administration of IL-33 would have a positive effect on
      pre-clinical cardiac graft survival. No study have looked at the level of ST2 / IL-33 of the
      donor, with the purpose that it might reflect the condition of the transplanted heart and its
      initial level of Immune tolerance and maybe predict the risk of subsequent dysfunction.

      In this non-interventional study, several blood samples will be taken on donors before organ
      procurement and on recipients prior to grafting, on day 7 and at the time of each myocardial
      biopsy (approximately 16 myocardial biopsies the first year). Serum level of sST2 and IL-33
      will then be determined according to the ELISA method on each blood sample.

      Fifty consecutive couple donors/ recipients will be included in the study. This number of
      subjects is calculated to detect a doubling of the donor sST2 level between the two recipient
      groups with 30-day mortality and without mortality (potency: 90%, alpha risk: 0.05,
      bilateral).
