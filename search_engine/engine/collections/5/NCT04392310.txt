      characterized by malignant clonal expansion and differentiation arrest of myeloid progenitor
      cells.

      The etiology of AML is heterogeneous. In some patients, prior exposure to therapeutic,
      occupational or environmental DNA-damaging agents is implicated, but most cases of AML remain
      without a clear etiology.

      The incidence of AML had been higher than that of the other three subtypes of leukemia (
      [ALL], [CML], and [CLL])& accounts for the highest percentage (62%) of leukemic deaths.

      AML is primarily a disease of older adults. The age-adjusted incidence for those aged 65
      years or older is 20.1 per 100,000 persones in comparison to 2.0 per 100,000 person-years for
      those younger than 65 years old.

      Males are 1.2-1.6 times more likely to develop AML during their lifetime as evidenced by
      population-based studies in the US, UK, Canada, Denmark, Australia and Algeria. AML is one of
      the most common form of Hematological Malignancy in adults and has the shortest survival
      (5-year survival = 24%). Curative therapies, including intensive chemotherapy and allogeneic
      stem cell transplantation, are generally applicable to a minority of patients who are younger
      and fit, while most older individuals exhibit poor prognosis and survival. Differences in
      patient outcomes are influenced by disease characteristics, access to care including active
      therapies and supportive care, and other factors. After many years without therapeutic
      advances, several new therapies have been approved and are expected to impact patient
      outcomes, especially for older patients and those with refractory disease.
