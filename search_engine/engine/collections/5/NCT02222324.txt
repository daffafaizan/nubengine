      Phase will have 2 periods: Screening (up to 27 days) and Baseline Period 1 (1 day).
      Eligibility will be determined during the Screening Period. The Randomization Phase will
      consist of 8 periods: Treatment Period 1, Baseline Period 2, Treatment Period 2, Baseline
      Period 3, Treatment Period 3, Baseline Period 4, Treatment Period 4, and a Follow-Up Period.
      Each Baseline Period will last 1 day, followed by the corresponding treatment period. On the
      first day of each treatment period, subjects will receive a single dose of the assigned study
      drug. During each treatment period, subjects will be required to stay in the clinical unit
      from the baseline period to 24 hours postdose. Subjects will then be released from the clinic
      and will undergo a washout interval of at least 13 days, during which time they will return
      for additional PK sampling.
