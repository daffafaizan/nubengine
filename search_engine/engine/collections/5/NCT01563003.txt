      disorderS (ASD) and anxiety. Many children who have an autism spectrum disorder experience
      substantial anxiety that can cause impairment above that of an ASD alone. Few studies have
      examined effective treatment options for anxiety in this population. In typically developing
      youth, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is considered the gold standard for treating
      anxiety. But, in order to address the unique needs of children with ASD, this study utilizes
      a modified CBT treatment plan which includes social skills and parent training. In our past
      studies, this cognitive-behavioral treatment plan has been effective in kids with ASD and
      anxiety compared to kids who did not receive any treatment.The current study compares this
      modified treatment plan to other treatment options in the community. The experimental
      component of this study is being assigned to 1 of 2 groups. The first group will receive CBT
      immediately for a period of 16 weeks. The second group will have to wait 16 weeks before
      receiving CBT. During this time period, children may receive any other services in the
      community. Overall, all adolescents receive the same type of therapy; it's matter of whether
      he/she receives it immediately or after a wait period. Sixteen weekly sessions comprise CBT.
      All therapy and assessments associated with this study will be free of charge.
