    
      The aim of this study is to develop a New Safety Checklist in perioperative patients
      undergoing cardiac catheterization in interventional cardiology units and assess it impact on
      the incidence of perioperative complications compared to habitual practice.

      The study will consist in two phases; the first phase: development of the New Safety
      Checklist, and the second phase will be a multicenter randomized clinical trial, a parallel
      two-arm corresponding to the use of the New Safety Checklist compared to the habitual
      practice in all patients undergoing cardiac catheterization in interventional cardiology
      units, according to the inclusion criteria..

      The expected number of patients in this trial will be 6000. The principal outcome of this
      study will be: the incidence of perioperative complications. The secondary outcomes will be:
      socio-demographic data, clinical patient data and procedure type data. Data collection will
      be done through reviewing clinical history.
