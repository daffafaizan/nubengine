      Interleukin-6 (IL-6) has emerged as a potential therapeutic target in RA. This is based on
      the greater understanding of the role this cytokine can play in various aspects of the
      pathogenesis of RA. It has been shown that IL-6 is responsible for various clinical symptoms,
      including,fatigue, anemia, anorexia, fever, as well as the production of autoantibodies and
      increase in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, all of which develop in patients with RA.
      Tocilizumab, as monotherapy and in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to be
      effective for RA patients with insufficient response to methotrexate or other
      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs. These observations about the effects of tocilizumab
      were extended to patients refractory to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. Tocilizumab also
      slows down the progression of structural joint damage. Furthermore, a 5-year long-term safety
      and efficacy has been shown. The place of Tocilizumab therapy in early RA is still unknown.

      Cardiorespiratory endurance (CRE), the most fundamental component of physical fitness can be
      severely impaired in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). It has been shown that
      intensive and early treatment of RA can induce sustained clinical remission, improve general
      health and physical fitness and might therefore have an impact on the quality of life of RA
      patient. This study was planned to measure the CRE by a work capacity index obtained in a
      submaximal testing (W65%/kg) in early RA patients treated with tocilizumab compared to
      Methotrexate alone.
