1368. immunologic competence and induction of neoplasms bypolyoma virusthymectomy at 3 days of age in severalinbred strains of mice and in an f1 hybridresulted in a strikingly increased frequencyof neoplasms following infection withpolyoma virus.  age susceptibility was extendedto at least 30 days of age in highlyresistant c57bl mice.  the usual stigmataassociated with thymectomy at birth werenot found in the 3-day thymectomized mice.nonetheless the methods used to restoreimmunologically deficient thymectomizedneonates were also effective in restoringthe capacity to resist polyoma virus tumorinduction: adult syngeneic spleen cells,thymus tissue in millipore diffusion chambersand syngeneic thymus grafts.  growthcurves of polyoma virus in kidney, salivaryglands and liver were quite similar inthymectomized and intact litter mates.hemagglutination-inhibition antibodies deter-mined periodically up to 30 days afterinfection were also similar in both groups.these results are discussed in terms ofa concept involving virus-specific 'tumor'antigens and the immunologic status of the animal.
