      patients is still lacking.

      The acute, critical or progressive disease status predestinies to relevant changes in
      cardiovascular metobolism. High-risk patients in the present trial comprise those with acute
      heart failure, myocardial infarction (STEMI and NSTEMI), sepsis, septic shock, ischemic and
      non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF
      <35%).

      Therfore this study investigates to identify disease-specific patterns of metabolic and
      microbiomic changes. These patterns may help to understand pathophysiology at the metabolic
      stages and find out those patients being at highest risk of adverse future outcome.
