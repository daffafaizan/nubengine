      metabolic syndrome and a major factor responsible for the development of type 2 diabetes.
      Although the mechanisms responsible for muscle insulin resistance are largely unclear, lipid
      oversupply is an important factor. Among numerous potential mechanisms whereby lipid
      oversupply may cause muscle insulin resistance, current evidence points towards inflammation
      as being critical. Recent studies in animals, however, indicate that the inflammatory
      response in skeletal muscles may require the presence of circulating pro-inflammatory factors
      suggesting that the inflammation induced insulin resistance in skeletal muscles may be a
      secondary event. More specifically, activation of Nuclear Factor-Kappa B(NF-kB), and
      inflammatory master switch that drives the production of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines
      in fat and liver, has been implicated in causing insulin resistance in skeletal muscles by
      increasing circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines. In contrast, animal studies have found
      that activation of NF-KB directly in skeletal muscles has no or little effect on its insulin
      sensitivity but does produce other abnormalities such as increased proteasome activity. The
      study shall therefore be undertaken to determine to what extent lipid-induced inflammation
      and insulin resistance in skeletal muscles requires the presence of circulating
      proinflammatory factors in humans.
