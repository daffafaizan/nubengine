    
      This is a phase II, multicenter, open label, single arm study that will evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of Isatuximab administered intravenously at 10 mg/kg in combination with CyBorD
      induction treatment and Lenalidomide maintenance treatment in a 28-day long cycle in
      autologous stem cell transplant-eligible patients.

      The induction treatment consists of four cycles of Isa-CyBorD. Isatuximab will be given on
      days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of cycle 1 and days 1 and 15 of cycle 2-4 in combination with
      Cyclophosphamide at 300 mg/m2 on days 1, 8, 15 and 22, Bortezomib at 1.5 mg/m2 on days 1, 8,
      15 and 22 and Dexamethasone at 40 mg on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day cycle.

      Following the induction phase, all subjects achieving at least stable disease will have stem
      cell mobilization per standard institutional procedures. This is followed by high dose
      chemotherapy (Melphalan 200 mg/m2) and autologous stem cell transplantation.

      ((If, for unexpected logistical reason, there is a foreseen delay of stem cell mobilization
      or transplantation of more than eight weeks after the end of cycle four of induction, an
      additional cycle of Isa-CyBorD can be given at the investigator's discretion.))

      The maintenance treatment consisting of Isatuximab at 10 mg/kg administered intravenously on
      days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of cycle 1, days 1 and 15 of cycle 2 and 3 and day 1 all subsequent
      28-day maintenance cycles in combination with Lenalidomide administered orally at 10 mg on
      days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle will be administered starting at day 100 (+/- 7 days) after
      the transplant. Lenalidomide, if tolerated well, will be increased to 15 mg starting with
      cycle 3.
