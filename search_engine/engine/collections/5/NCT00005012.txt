      antiretroviral regimen but are randomized to receive one of four doses of PEG-IFN or PEG-IFN
      placebo administered subcutaneously once per week until results of HIV genotyping/phenotyping
      are available (approximately 4 weeks). Patients who respond with a 0.5 log or greater
      decrease in HIV RNA at Week 4 have optimized HAART added to their ongoing PEG-IFN regimen and
      are followed for 24 weeks in an observational study.
