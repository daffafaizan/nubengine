      This is an observational retrospective study that aims to evaluate the expression of
      receptors and activating proteases mediating SARS-CoV-2 entry and spreading in the local
      population of Ticino. The level of expression of these factors will be compared between
      infected and non-infected subjects. The sub-project will examine RNA samples from
      nasopharyngeal swabs taken from subjects tested for COVID-19.

      Sub-project 2:

      This is a haplotype- and diplotype-based case-control retrospective study that aims to
      investigate the association between the HSD3B1 gene variations and outcome of COVID-19 in the
      local population of Ticino. The gene status of HSD3B1 will be defined and compared between
      two groups of patients: the patients who experienced a severe SARS-CoV-2 infection (severe
      pulmonary insufficiency, ICU admission, eventually death) and the group with a mild-moderate
      COVID-19 disease without pulmonary insufficiency and oxygen need.
