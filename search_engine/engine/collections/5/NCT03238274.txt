    
      The objective of this study is to demonstrate the clinical performance of the SofiaÂ® 2
      analyzer and Sofia Lyme FIA test in the CLIA waived test environment in comparison to
      Comparator Method(s) and/or an FDA cleared predicate test(s) using matched finger-stick,
      whole blood and serum from symptomatic subjects. The finger-stick and venous whole blood
      specimens will be tested by CLIA waived test operators. The matched plasma (from the leftover
      whole blood) and serum specimens will be sent to a separate reference laboratory for testing
      to compare the matched specimen using the Comparator Method(s) and/or an FDA-cleared
      predicate test(s). The results of this study may be used to support a 510(k) and/or
      CLIA-Waiver submission for testing whole blood sample types.
