      of bleeding was achieved as is routine for the individual Otolaryngologist performing the
      procedure. Next the surgeon used 3-0 chromic (absorbable) sutures on tapered needles to close
      one tonsillar fossa but leave the tonsillar fossa on the other side open. The side chosen was
      determined by a computer generated schedule. Routine postoperative care was given.
