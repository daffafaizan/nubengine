      studies.

      Evidence-based components of the program include:

      Interdisciplinary Champion Teams; Palliative Care Education, including illness-trajectory
      pamphlets for staff and family members; Comfort Care Rounds with staff; Prognostic Tools to
      trigger end-of-life discussions; Palliative Care Conferences; Bereavement Pamphlets for
      families; and Post-Bereavement Follow-Up for families, and staff

      The goal is to implement and assess this program across three provinces in Canada (Ontario,
      Saskatchewan, Manitoba). The investigators will use the findings to revise the program and
      inform the scaling up of the program across diverse settings and provinces.
