      and mortality. The incidence of PE during urologic surgery was previously report at 0.9 -
      1.1% with mortality rate less than 2%. But the recent study by Fukazawa et al report the
      incidence of PE was 11% in renal cancer patients underwent nephrectomy with mortality rate as
      high as 33%. The risk factors associated with PE included major surgery, cancer, arrhythmia,
      massive bleeding and level of tumor thrombus in inferior vena cava.

      Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is a very helpful intraoperative monitoring tool in
      major, non-cardiac surgery to detect emboli and guide the hemodynamic management in severely
      unstable patients. But it requires sophisticate machine and well-trained operator, the rate
      of utilisation was still limited.

      The investigators aimed to determine the incidence of perioperative PE in renal cancer
      patients undergoing nephrectomy. the secondary outcomes include risk factors associated with
      perioperative PE, clinical outcomes, the rate of TEE utilization in this operation and
      outcome.
