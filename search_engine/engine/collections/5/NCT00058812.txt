      cell line or LCL by infecting the blood with a laboratory strain of EBV called B95. We will
      then use this EBV-infected cell line (which have been treated with radiation so that they
      cannot grow) as stimulator cells and mix it with more blood. This stimulation will train the
      T cells to kill EBV infected cells and result in the growth of an EBV specific T cell line.
      We will then test the T cells to make sure that they kill the EBV infected cells and not the
      normal cells and freeze them.

      The marrow donor's T cells will be thawed and injected through an intravenous line for a
      period of 10 minutes. The subject may be premedicated with diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and
      acetaminophen (Tylenol). We would give one dose of the cells on or after day 45 following
      transplant if the subject agreed and was well enough. If the EBV DNA levels remain high or
      the subject has persistent disease, s/he may be eligible to receive up to 5 additional
      injections of T cells at the original dose at monthly intervals. After the subject has
      received the T cells, s/he will be contacted by the research nurse or another member of the
      study team weekly for 6 weeks, then once every three months for a year so that we can check
      on his/her progress.

      We will continue to follow the subject in the BMT clinic after the injections. To learn more
      about the way the T cells are working, an extra 40 mls (about 8 teaspoonfuls) of blood will
      be taken pre-infusion, 4 hours after the infusion, 3-4 days post infusion (optional) and at
      1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after the T cell infusions, and then at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post
      infusion. The blood should come from the central intravenous line, and should not require
      extra needle sticks.
