      patients with brain injury. This noninvasive method measures local blood flow velocity and
      direction in the proximal portions of large intracranial arteries. The operator requires a
      short training and experience to perform. The third ventricle diameter measurement by
      transcranial duplex flow sonography was performed in healthy volunteers . This studies show
      similar results in those obtained with the MRI or Computer Tomography (CT). Currently the
      third ventricle diameter measurements by transcranial Doppler
