      successful recanalization rate compared to Solitaire in patients with acute ischemic stroke
      caused by large vessel occlusion.

      The secondary objectives is to verify whether there is significant differences in time to
      achieve recanalization, NIHSS score, mRS(modified Rankin Scale) score between stent
      retriever(Catfish) and Solitaire in patients with acute ischemic stroke caused by large
      vessel occlusion.

      The third objectives is to compare the rate of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage, serious
      adverse event(SAE), all cause of mortality with 90 days after operation, between stent
      retriever (Catfish) and Solitaire in patients with acute ischemic stroke due to large vessel
      occlusion.
