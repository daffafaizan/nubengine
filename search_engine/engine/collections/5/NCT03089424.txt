    
      This is a randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, with voluntary patients with
      chronic non-specific low back pain.One hundred and forty-eight patients will be randomly
      allocated to two treatment groups: Placebo or PBMT for 4 weeks (3 times per week, total of 12
      sessions of 27 minutes each). The clinical outcomes will be obtained at the completion of
      treatment (4 weeks) and at 3, 6 and 12 months after randomization. The data will be collected
      by a blinded assessor. The statistical analysis will follow the intention-to-treat principles
      and the between-group differences will be calculated by using mixed linear models.

      The outcomes of interest are pain intensity, disability, function and global perceived
      effect.
