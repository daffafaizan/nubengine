    
      The PRESILLION Stent System is intended for use in patients with symptomatic ischemic heart
      disease attributable to stenotic de novo lesions of native coronary arteries with reference
      vessel diameter from 2.5 mm to 4.0 mm with a lesion length up to 30 mm that are amenable to
      percutaneous treatment with coronary stenting. The stent is intended as a permanent implanted
      device.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of the PRESILLION Stent System
      in the treatment of de novo stenotic lesions in native coronary arteries. The primary safety
      measure is the composite of MACE up to one (1) month follow up. The MACE rate shall meet the
      performance goal for bare metal stents in order to show the safety of the device.

      The protocol has been amended and data will be collected for a time point as close as
      possible to (but after) the 6 months post index procedure in a non-interventional and
      retrospective manner. The data point will contain exactly the same follow-up information as
      was collected during the 1 month follow-up.
