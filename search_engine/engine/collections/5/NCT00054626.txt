        -  Compare the overall, cause-specific, and disease-free survival of patients with
           high-risk muscle-invasive transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder treated with
           adjuvant cisplatin and gemcitabine vs observation after radical cystectomy.

        -  Compare the dose intensity and toxicity of two different schedules of cisplatin and
           gemcitabine in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center and disease status (T2 [G3 only] or T3-4 [any G], N0-2 vs any T, N1-2,
      M0). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients are further randomized to 1 of 2 treatment regimens.

             -  Regimen A: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 2 and gemcitabine IV on days 1, 8,
                and 15.

             -  Regimen B: Patients receive cisplatin IV on day 15 and gemcitabine as in regimen A.

      Treatment in both regimens repeats every 28 days for 4 courses.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation followed by cisplatin and gemcitabine as in arm I
           at relapse.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 700 patients (350 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 3 years.
