      irregular menstrual cycles, a more frequent incidence of infertility, metabolic syndrome,
      oxidative stress, and inflammation, as well as acne and hirsutism. In addition to ovulation
      disorders and the multifollicular ovaries structure in an ultrasound examination,
      hyperandrogenism is a typical clinical feature of the Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), which
      is diagnosed in approximately 8.6% of adolescent girls. Excessive body weight makes it
      difficult to diagnose at an early stage of the disease and intensifies metabolic and hormonal
      disorders, as well as those related to oxidative stress and inflammation of the body. Some
      research studies suggest that PCOS may negatively affect oral health of women, increasing the
      risk of periodontal problems.

      The main purpose of this research was to check whether serum androgen levels and concomitant
      metabolic changes, oxidative stress and inflammation in adolescent girls with
      hyperandrogenism may be related to diet.

      The investigators aimed to identify the factors that increase the risk of being overweight
      and of obesity among adolescents with clinical features of PCOS, related to diet and
      DEA(Disordered Eating Attitudes).

      The objective was also to investigate the relationships between markers of oxidation and
      markers of Systemic Inflammation and macronutrients intake, such as carbohydrates and fiber,
      protein (animal, plant), fats and cholesterol in normal and overweight/obese girls with
      clinical features of PCOS.

      Additionally, the investigators would like to evaluate the relation between oral health of
      girls with PCOS (including condition of periodontium and dental caries) and their dietary
      habits, hormonal, metabolic and oxidative and inflammatory status.
