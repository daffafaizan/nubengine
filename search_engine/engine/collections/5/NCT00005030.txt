      patients with colorectal carcinoma metastatic to the liver.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of four
      doses of preoperative SCH 66336 (no treatment, 100 mg, 200 mg, or 300 mg). Patients receive
      oral SCH 66336 twice daily for 7-14 days prior to exploratory laparotomy and/or resection of
      hepatic metastases. Patients randomized to no treatment may undergo surgery at any time
      within 15 days of randomization. Other patients undergo surgery on days 8-15.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (10 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      10 months.
