5319. urinary porter-silber chromogensfollowing intravenous metho-pyrapone and acth in patients with breast cancerurinary porter-silber chromogens have beenmeasured in 2 groups of patientswith breast cancer before, during and afterintravenous methopyrapone andacth administration.  the control groupconsisted of females free of disease5 years or more following mastectomy whilethe study group had documentedmetastatic disease.  no significant difference inthe urinary porter-silber chromo-gens was found between the 2 groups on any dayduring the course of the study andwere within the range of normal as measuredin this laboratory.  it is concludedthat the functional reserve capacity for bothpituitary acth secretion and adreno-cortical steroidogenesis in patients withadvanced metastatic breast cancer is rela-tively normal.
