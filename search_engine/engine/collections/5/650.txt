epidemiology of mycoplasma pneumoniaeinfection in familiesand ruth mcmahanthe transmission and clinical manifestations of in-fection with mycoplasma pneumoniae were studied in 114families in which there was a case of atypical pneumonia.m pneumoniae was isolated from a throat culture of theindex pneumonia patient in 36 of these families.  trans-mission to other family members occurred in 23 of the36 families.  in these 23 families, 84% of the childrenand 41% of the adults were infected.  the index casesare included.  of the total 59 patients with family-contactinfections, 42 had lower-respiratory-tract symptoms, 6had pharyngitis alone, 9 (all children) were asympto-matic, and 2 had probably unrelated symptoms.  thetime intervals between cases within a family suggesteda median incubation period of 23 days.  treatment withtetracycline seemed neither to cure the symptoms com-pletely nor to abolish the carrier state that often lastedone to three months.
