      adolescent depression and anxiety, Training for Awareness, Resilience and Action (TARA). TARA
      is based on our current understanding of the neuroscience of adolescent depression and
      anxiety. It employs specific approaches drawn from mindfulness practices and yoga to promote
      physiological regulation and attention modulation, emotion regulation, and cognitive control.
      The investigators will perform three initial (non-randomized) beta tests with 6-12
      participants each to refine our intervention manual. The investigators will enroll up to 30
      participants total, aged 14-18 with depression and/or anxiety symptoms, to receive the TARA
      intervention. The investigators hypothesize that TARA will be feasible in terms of
      recruitment, retention, adherence, and participant receptivity to the intervention as gauged
      through feedback surveys and a focus group. The primary outcomes are depression symptoms
      assessed with the Reynolds Adolescent Depression Scale (RADS-2) and anxiety symptoms assessed
      with the Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children (MASC). Secondary outcomes include
      self-reported emotion regulation and attention/awareness. The investigators hypothesize that
      participants will show improvements in these measures. In a small subset of participants, the
      investigators will also test the feasibility of using functional MRI (fMRI) before and after
      the intervention to measure the underlying neurobiological effects of TARA. The aim is to
      develop a protocol for possible future use in a larger study to examine effects of the
      intervention on patterns of amygdala activation linked with adolescent depression.
