      programs are to be realized, adherence to antiretroviral regimens will be critical. To date,
      however, there are few evidence-based approaches that are scalable and sustainable in busy,
      programmatic settings where HIV burden is high. The study seeks to implement the
      intervention, which includes patient-centered counseling and adherence supporter training,
      for both HIV-positive (for antiretroviral therapy, or ART) and HIV-negative (for pre-exposure
      prophylaxis, or PrEP) pregnant and breastfeeding women, thus providing a universal approach
      to support PMTCT programs holistically. The study will enroll pregnant women 18 years of age
      or older receiving antenatal care services at one of the designated study facilities. In
      Group 1, the study will enroll 100 HIV-positive women who started (or re-started, after a 6
      months or longer treatment interruption) a first-line ART regimen within the past 30 days. In
      Group 2, the study will enroll 200 HIV-negative women willing to initiate and continue oral
      PrEP, in the form of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emtricitabine (TDF-FTC), and who
      report factors that place them at elevated risk for HIV acquisition.
