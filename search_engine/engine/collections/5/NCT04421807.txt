      protein-rich fluid in interstitial tissue spaces as a result of abnormal development or
      damage to the lymphatic system. Lymphedema is divided into 2 as primary and secondary.
      Secondary lymphedema is the most common form seen in upper extremity, usually after breast
      cancer treatment approaches. In lymphedema, not only upper limb affected, but also posture,
      balance, shoulder girdle, scapula and quality of life can be adversely affected. Complex
      decongestive therapy has been accepted as the gold standard treatment in lymphedema to reduce
      edema, however, there were insufficient studies investigating the effects on the posture and
      the balance in patients with lymphedema. Scapulatoracic stabilization exercises aim to
      increase muscle stability ability, kinesthetic awareness, ovarall stability and balance.
      However, when the literature is reviewed, no study is found investigating the effect of
      scapulatoracic stabilization exercises in individuals who developed lymphedema after
      mastectomy.
