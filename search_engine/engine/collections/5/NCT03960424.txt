      Randomized Control Trial (CER RCT) to:

      Specific Aim 1: Assess usability of an evidence-based DTM intervention utilizing a Community
      Based Participatory Research (CBPR) approach and adapt it to facilitate acceptability and
      feasibility in a population of H/L patients with T2D, and their caregivers and providers.

      Specific Aim 2: Assess whether H/L patients receiving DTM attain significantly improved
      patient-centered outcomes compared to COM, through a CER RCT. Expected outcomes include
      improved diabetes quality of life (QoL), glucose management (GM), blood pressure (BP),
      cholesterol, medication adherence, and diabetes self-efficacy (SE), and reduced diabetes
      distress, problem areas in diabetes (PAID), inpatient utilization, unscheduled T2D physician
      visits and sick days.
