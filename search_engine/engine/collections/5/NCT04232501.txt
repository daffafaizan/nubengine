      thrombosis in immobilized and post-surgical patients. The investigators aim to compare a new
      sequential compression for the leg that utilizes a servo motor for compression as opposed to
      a traditional pneumatic motor that is typically used in the hospital and after surgery.
      Pneumatic sequential compression devices are cumbersome, expensive and not mobile. This new
      compression device was developed to provide a cheaper, mobile device that can be worn by the
      patient after surgery and while at home during ambulation. The addition of the servo motor
      and fine sensors may also be able to detect sub-clinical DVT's that contribute to
      post-surgical pulmonary embolus and post-surgical complications. The investigators aim to
      learn how this new device performs in the subset of patients undergoing complex spine
      surgery, the incidence of post-surgical DVT with this new device compared to traditional SCD
      and if this new device is capable of detecting sub-clinical post-surgical DVT.
