      reintegration is unclear. One of the challenges is that physical parameters change over time
      as does the person's awareness and perception of what activities are important to be able to
      engage in at the community level. Interventions have led to gains in physical capacity,
      function and community reintegration, but the benefits have been shown to dissipate within
      three to six months. It has been suggested that maintenance therapy (tune-ups) for stroke
      survivors post-discharge could prevent or curtail decline in function of aging stroke
      survivors and enhance quality of life and well being; constructs that relate strongly to
      community reintegration. This study will determine whether tune-ups can alter the time course
      and magnitude of changes in physical capacity and function and their influence on community
      reintegration. Stroke survivors discharged from rehabilitation will be followed for a 15
      month period with laboratory or home assessments conducted at 3 month intervals. Assessors
      will be blind to whether the subject is receiving a tune up. Evaluations conducted after the
      tune-up at 9 months and 12 months post-discharge will allow us to determine if the tune-up
      effectively reduced physical impairment, improved function and resulted in better community
      reintegration compared to control.
