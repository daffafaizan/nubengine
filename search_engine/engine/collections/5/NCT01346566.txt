      management of zonular weakness, allowing for in-the-bag IOL implantation. The Cionni modified
      capsule tension ring (M-CTR) has an anterior eyelet that provides for fixation of the
      capsular bag without violating its integrity. Adult and pediatric studies have shown the
      usefulness of the M-CTR to manage zonular weakness. However, there are very few prospective
      studies that show the outcomes following implantation of the M-CTR and in-the-bag IOL on a
      longterm basis. Therefore, the investigators decided to carry out this study to report the
      intraoperative performance and postoperative outcomes on a longterm basis following M-CTR and
      in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) implantation.
