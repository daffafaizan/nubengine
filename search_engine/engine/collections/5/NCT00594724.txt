      surgical or radiation treatment to the tongue. This study will use a non-invasive imaging
      technique, Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), to investigate cortical responses to
      partial glossectomy or radiation therapy for treatment of a tongue malignancy. Patients with
      Stage I-IV (AJCC) malignancies of the tongue who are treated with surgery and or radiation
      therapy will be imaged using fMRI pre-operatively and at approximately six months
      postoperatively.

      Patterns of brain activity from the fMRI studies will be compared with matched healthy
      control subjects. The results of this investigation will provide needed information on both
      central and peripheral mechanisms of adaptation.
