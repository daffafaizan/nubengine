    
      This is an open-label, multicenter, non-randomized dose-escalation study of oral LCL161
      administered in combination with oral topotecan. Topotecan is US FDA approved for treating
      metastatic ovarian cancer, stage IV-B cervical cancer, and small cell lung cancer (SCLC).
      LCL161, an investigational product, is an oral small-molecule antagonist of inhibitors of
      apoptosis proteins (IAPs). Preclinical data suggests that IAP antagonists work in synergy
      with other anti-cancer agents. This study is designed to evaluate the combination of these
      two agents in patients with SCLC and ovarian cancers where treatment with topotecan would be
      appropriate. The study will be conducted in 2 parts. In the dose-escalation part of the
      study, patients with relapsed/refractory SCLC and gynecologic malignancies will be eligible
      for enrollment to determine the optimal dose of the drug combination to be administered.
      Patients can continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The
      dose-expansion part of the study is limited to patients with ovarian cancer and
      relapsed/refractory SCLC (2 cohorts with 12 patients each) to further assess safety and
      preliminary anti-tumor activity. Up to 52 patients are planned for enrollment at 3 centers in
      the U.S.
