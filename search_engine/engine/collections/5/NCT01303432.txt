      purpose of the present intervention study is to determine whether the daily consumption of a
      yogurt supplemented with Mobile is effective in improving joint function and quality of life
      of individuals with low intensity gonalgia. Previous research using in vitro and animal
      models have demonstrated the efficacy of Mobilee in reducing inflammation and promoting
      anabolic responses in joint tissues. In addition, in two previous human intervention trials,
      the effects of Mobilee in joint function had been assessed using isokinetic tests. The
      present trial aims to confirm those previous results.
