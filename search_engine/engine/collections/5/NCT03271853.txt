    
      FirstSense Medical, LLC is a medical device company which has developed a breast cancer
      screening device, the Sentinel BreastScan II [SBS II]. This radiation free device is being
      developed to produce data which will be analyzed by Therma-Scan Reference Laboratory. Dr.
      Hoekstra, CEO of Therma-Scan, is the author of a published paper based on breast thermal data
      with a reported 95% sensitivity and 91% specificity. The SBS II examination will take
      approximately 7 minutes.

      This study is designed to evaluate the Sentinel BreastScan II as well as the analysis of data
      by Therma-Scan. SBS II thermal breast data is an adjunctive aid to standard breast imaging.
      Currently, mammography is one of the standards of care in screening for visible signs of
      breast cancer. Breast thermology is the analysis of the heat signature data from an examined
      breast. All study costs will be incurred by the sponsor. Study subjects will incur no cost to
      participate. All scientific data revealed in this protocol will be used for the specific
      objectives of the study. The SBS II is a non-significant risk device. There is no contact
      with the subject during the entire procedure.
