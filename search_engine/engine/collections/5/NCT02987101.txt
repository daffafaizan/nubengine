      In many cases these ulcers are treated conservatively and the healing time can be several
      months. In this open randomized clinical trial we will examine if we can accelerate wound
      healing when using autologous stromal vascular fraction (SVF) as an adjunct to standard wound
      care.

      The plan is to include 30 patients with arterial or arteriovenous chronic leg ulcers and
      these are randomized in two groups of which one receives standard wound care only and the
      other group receives autologous stromal vascular fraction treatment in addition to standard
      wound care.
