      Approximately 20% of MHI patients presenting in PS with mild brain injury take antiplatelet
      agents and 10% take oral anticoagulant therapy. The data available to characterize the risk
      of adverse events in patients with MHI using DOAC are few and of poor quality.

      Our study aim is to evaluate the prevalence of cerebral hemorrhage in patients arriving in ED
      with an MHI. Furthermore, we aim to establish whether the intake of antiplatelet and
      anticoagulants may represent a risk factor for the onset of cerebral hemorrhage and
      mortality. A prospective observational study that will include all patients who will refer to
      the Emergency Department of the Gemelli Polyclinic for an MHI for 2 years. Patients will be
      divided into four groups based on recruitment or less of anticoagulants and antiplatelet
      agents. We will then determine for each group the prevalence of cerebral hemorrhage,
      hospitalization, neurosurgical intervention, and mortality at different follow-up times. We
      will compare the groups to assess the possible increased risk in patients under treatment and
      between the various drugs.

      We expect that in head trauma the use of dicumarol anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents is
      associated with a greater risk of cerebral bleeding compared to DOACs. We also expect that
      patients taking DOAC have a greater risk of bleeding than patients not undergoing any type of
      antiplatelet/anticoagulant treatment.
