      investigators will measure ICD lead function multiple times throughout the surgery as well,
      to determine if and when device malfunction occurs. ICD lead function is measured
      noninvasively through a specialized computer the same way it is checked in the clinic. In
      addition, the investigators will test ICD function as they usually do following surgery.
