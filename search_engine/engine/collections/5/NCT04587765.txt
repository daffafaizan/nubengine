      dramatic change in the behavioural patterns, which is particularly evident in children. The
      spread and development of information technology has reduced children's time for physical
      activity. Previous studies have found that physical activity is essential for the growth and
      development of adolescents, preventing and reducing obesity, slowing the development of
      myopia, and is closely linked to mental health. However, parents in China are concerned that
      increased outdoor activity will reduce the amount of time spent studying and affect academic
      performance. Currently, there is a lack of strong evidence on the impact of physical activity
      on academic performance. In this study, we propose to provide after-school physical education
      classes for students in primary schools in a rapidly urbanizing area, and assess the effects
      of the intervention on children's academic performance, physical fitness, myopia, and mental
      health to provide evidence for the development of educational programs and arrangements for
      after-school activities.
