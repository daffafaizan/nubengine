      evolve to a terminal phase resembling acute leukemia. A subject of clinical urgency for
      researchers, clinicians, patients, and health care underwriters such as Medicare, is the role
      of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in the treatment of older patients
      with higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). The use of reduced intensity conditioning
      (RIC) regimens has extended HCT to the care of older patients with acute myelogenous leukemia
      (AML) and lymphoma and a number of retrospective and phase II trials for patients with MDS
      now show the curative potential of RIC alloHCT in selected patients.

      This protocol is designed to evaluate the relative benefits of RIC alloHCT compared to
      non-transplant therapies focusing on overall survival. This will be done by having patients
      biologically assigned to the alloHCT arm or the hypomethylating therapy/best supportive care
      arm and following them for survival at 3 years.
