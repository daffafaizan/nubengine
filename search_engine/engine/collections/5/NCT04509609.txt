    
      Retrospective observational study. Retrospective data from clinical charts of patients
      affected by LGMD 2E will be collected after the subscription of informed consent.Data
      considered will include any clinical variable measured, both objective and subjective. All
      data obtained will be anonimized before any treatment. Data will be grouped according to the
      age of the patient, in order to have more data for each age and to gain a trustable
      description of the disease progression. The possible correlation of each variable to age, to
      other variables and to objective clinical outcomes will be studied. Clinical outcomes
      considered will include age of loss of deambulation, age of introduction of respiratory
      assist, age of introduction of cardiological therapy. Data collected will also be divided in
      two groups according to different genetic diagnosis in order to evaluate phenotipical
      differences of genotypical clesses. First group will count all patient with the truncating
      mutation c.377_384duplCAGTAGGA in exon 3, both in heterozigosis and in homozigosis Second
      group will include all the other patients.

      Both on the global data collection and on data divided according to genotype, statistical
      analysis will be performed. Those analysis will study linear regression both with the
      univariate, bivariate and multivariate model.
