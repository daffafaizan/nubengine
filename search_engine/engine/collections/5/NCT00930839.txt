      (PGD2). To fully understand this mechanism, the investigators will examine the systemic
      release of PGD2 and skin blood flow using laser Doppler (LDF) on the upper and lower limbs of
      healthy control subjects. The investigators will quantify and establish the effects of oral
      nicotinic acid (NiaspanÂ®) given alone and in combination with aspirin on:

        1. skin blood flow using laser Doppler (LDF) of glabrous and hairy skin of the forearm of
           healthy subjects

        2. the severity and intensity of flushing using a visual analog scale, FAST tool, and
           whether aspirin is able to block the flushing response

        3. the impact on sympathetic/parasympathetic balance using the various frequencies of heart
           rate variability (HRV) which reflect the contribution of the different divisions of the
           autonomic nervous system (ANS)

        4. circulating levels of PGD2 and other neuropeptides to determine other mediators of the
           flushing response. This will allow us to conclude whether this pathway is intact and
           explore other non-DP1 vasodilatory mechanisms.

        5. Langerhans cell density in epidermis and microvasculature using immunohistochemistry of
           Langerin (measured as CD1a) in 3 mm skin biopsies of volar and hairy surfaces of the
           forearm and hairy surface of the lateral aspect of proximal lower limb. To date, there
           is very little known about the density or distribution of Langerhans cells. The PGD2
           receptor DP1 will be examined for its content in the epidermis using
           immunohistochemistry or RTPCR.
