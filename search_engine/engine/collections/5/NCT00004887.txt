        -  Compare the one and two year survival of patients with inoperable advanced non-small
           cell lung cancer treated with paclitaxel and cisplatin versus standard platinum therapy.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these two regimens in this patient population.

        -  Compare the performance status, tumor response, and quality of life in these patients
           after these treatment regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      center, stage of disease (IIIA vs IIIB vs IV), or performance status (ECOG O vs 1 vs 2 vs 3).

      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms:

        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, followed by carboplatin IV over 30
           minutes on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive mitomycin IV, ifosfamide IV over 3 hours, and cisplatin IV over
           1 hour on day 1 OR mitomycin IV, vinblastine IV, and cisplatin IV over 4 hours on day 1.

      Treatment continues every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed before each treatment course.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 300 patients (150 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
