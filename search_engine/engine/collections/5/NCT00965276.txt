      breast cancer over the past decades. The B-28 clinical trial from the National Surgical
      Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) assesses the efficacy of adding paclitaxel to the
      doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide regimen in the treatment of patients with axillary node positive
      breast cancer. The primary aim of B-28 is to determine whether four cycles of paclitaxel
      (Taxol (Registered Trademark)) (T) following four cycles of postoperative Doxorubicin
      (adriamycin (Registered Trademark) (A) and cyclophosphamide (C) will more effectively prolong
      disease-free survival (DFS) and survival (S) than four cycles of AC alone in patients with
      operable breast cancer who have one or more histologically positive axillary lymph nodes. The
      B-28 clinical trial tissue microarray consists of specimens from 2,000 cases enrolled. The
      tissue microarray set is an ideal platform for evaluating predictive markers of doxorubicin
      and/or paclitaxel response or resistance.

      Akt, a serine/threonine protein kinase regulated by the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K),
      is of importance in cell survival, tumorigenesis, and recently shown, chemoresistance. It
      confers survival advantage to cells by transducing signals from growth factor receptors that
      activate PI3K. The primary aim of this study is to evaluate whether the levels of
      phosphorylated AKT are associated with disease-free and overall survival in patients with
      node-positive breast cancer treated with AC and/or AC followed by paclitaxel.
