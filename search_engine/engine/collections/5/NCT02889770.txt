      depends on the balance between lung recruitment and overdistension. Some authors showed that
      incremental levels of PEEP did not much affect dead space in ARDS patients. These studies
      used different methods for the assessment of dead space.

      Such technique also overestimates the dead space. We believe that the right way to measure
      dead space is applying the original Bohr's equation using the mean PACO2 value. Therefore,
      the aim of this observational study was to describe the effect that PEEP has on Bohr's dead
      space and its sub-components in mechanically ventilated patients with ARDS.

      This observational study was performed in the Intensive Care Unit of a University Hospital.

      Protocol design The protocol started recording the data during baseline protective
      ventilation. After 15 minutes of data recording, we studied four levels of PEEP - 0, 6, 10
      and 16 cmH2O - which were randomly assigned by a randomization table.

      Respiratory, hemodynamic, arterial blood gas analysis and volumetric capnographic parameters
      were recorded. We analyzed the last 2 minutes of each protocol steps consisting in more than
      30 breaths or data-points.
