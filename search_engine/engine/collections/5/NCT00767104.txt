    
      This is a pilot study of subjects with mild to moderate/severe facial acne vulgaris with an
      assessment of 2-4 on the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) scale . We will enroll 40-60
      subjects in order to obtain 40 evaluable subjects. Evaluable subjects will be defined as
      those that complete the protocol, or those that fail to complete due to an adverse event
      related to the study. One-half of subjects will be assigned to sleep on the study product,
      which is a standard size pillowcase made of a silk-like fabric. The other half will be
      assigned to sleep on the placebo pillowcase made of 100% cotton. Each subject will be
      instructed to sleep on this pillowcase every night for 12 weeks. Investigators will be
      blinded to the type of pillowcase used by the study subject. The distribution of placebo and
      study product pillowcases will be randomized 1:1. The study period will last for 12 weeks.
      Subjects will be evaluated at baseline, weeks 2, 6 and 12.
