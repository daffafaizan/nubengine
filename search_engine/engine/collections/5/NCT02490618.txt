      patients with residual bleeding pockets of â‰¥ 5mm following scaling and rootplaning.
      Simultaneously the additional benefit of subgingival application of probiotics via oil drops
      will be investigated.

      Recruitment: This study will be a single centre (Department of Oral Health Sciences,
      University Hospitals Leuven), double blind, randomized, placebo controlled clinical trial
      with within each patient a split mouth design. The randomization (by means of a computer
      program) and double blind design are thought to minimize the bias of the investigator and
      patients.

      Selection of the study population: Adults, who consult at the department of Periodontology at
      the University Hospital Leuven, and who fit the inclusion criteria will be asked to
      participate in this study.
