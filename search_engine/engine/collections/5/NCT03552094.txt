      the New Caledonian population is exposed. In the absence of specific treatment or vaccine,
      disease vector control remains the method of choice to limit their spread. However, the
      traditional methods of prevention and disease vector control must today face their limits:
      mosquito resistance to insecticides, difficulty of access and destruction of breeding
      areas... The World Mosquito Program Noumea project is based on the artificial colonization of
      the mosquito vector Aedes aegypti by the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia, which reduces its
      ability to transmit arboviruses. The breeding of mosquitoes carrying the bacterium Wolbachia
      in the laboratories of the Institut Pasteur of New Caledonia requires the use of human blood
      samples for mosquito gorging.

      The objective of the research is to generate, maintain and amplify Aedes aegypti Caledonian
      lineages carrying the bacterium Wolbachia for the planned insect release program in Noumea.

      The establishment of Wolbachia in Aedes aegypti populations in Noumea should lead to the
      reduction of active transmission of dengue, Zika and chikungunya in the municipality.
