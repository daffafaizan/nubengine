        1. The primary end point of the study is to evaluate the time taken to complete blocks with
           and without the use of the needle guidance device. (Start time is considered as the
           first skin touch by the needle until the completion of the block. Completion of the
           block is defined as withdrawing the needle completely out of the body). The principal
           investigator/co-investigator and an independent observer will be recording the time
           taken to complete the block.

        2. Ease of the technique- (Will be assessed with a short questionnaire survey at the end of
           the procedure). Immediately after the block is finished, the performing physician will
           be requested to fill out the questionnaire.

        3. Number of times needle needs to be re-directed. This is self a reported measurement. The
           person performing the block, investigators (attending physician) and an independent
           observer will be recording number of times the needle was manipulated.

        4. Number of times needle was pulled out entirely out of the body and reinserted. This is
           also a self reported measurement.

        5. Efficacy of the blocks performed will be assessed (This is part of the routine standard
           of care assessing the blocks.)

        6. Total amount of time taken to complete the whole procedure (Starting from the first time
           the ultrasound probe was placed on the patient to the withdrawal of the needle after
           completing the procedure)
