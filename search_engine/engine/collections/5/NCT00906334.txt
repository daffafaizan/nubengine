      ON 01910.Na 800 mg/m^2/24h as an continuous intravenous infusion (CIV) over 48 hours once a
      week for 3 weeks of a 4-week cycle. As of Amendment 3 to the Protocol, the regimen is changed
      to 1800 mg/24h for 72 hours every other week for the first four 2-week cycles and every 4
      weeks afterwards. The total study duration is 31 weeks, which includes a 2-week screening
      phase, a 27-week dosing phase, and a 4-week follow-up phase that begins after the last dose
