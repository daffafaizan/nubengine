      to the treatment with lidocaine injection or ischemic compression. Each treatment will be
      placed once a week, for four weeks. Women randomized for treatment with Ischemic compression,
      will be first subjected to transcutaneal electrostimulation(TENS), in order to receive
      analgesia on trigger point. The analgesia will be used to inhibit the painful stimulation.
      The device used for this will be the Dualpex 961, with 100 Hertz of frequency and pulse of
      250ms. The intensity will be vary according the painful threshold of each patient. The
      electrostimulation will be made for 30 minutes. The electrodes will be applied around the
      trigger point. After analgesia, the ischemic compression will be applied. This therapy
      consists in a continuous pressure on trigger point. For this we will use one algometer to get
      maximum of homogeneity on therapy. The pressure intensity will be placed by the average
      between the values gotten during three previously measurements of threshold pain in each
      patient. This therapy will be applied three times with duration of 60 seconds each with a 30
      seconds of rest between the applications. Injection of anesthesia: this therapy will be
      applied directly in trigger points with two mL of lidocaine 0.5% with needle of 22 gauges
      directly and perpendicularly in trigger point. The Evaluations for each treatment will be
      carried immediately before the randomization; In one month: immediately after the four weeks
      of treatment; - Three months: three months after the treatment; - Six months: six months
      after the treatment.
