      of peritoneal dialysis (PD), we perform a prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center
      clinical study. The patients initiation of PD treatment within 6 months are randomized to be
      assigned to two groups: 6L of dialysate per day and 8L of dialysate per day, follow up will
      be regularly performed at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 36 weeks, 48 weeks,
      60 weeks, 72 weeks, 84 weeks and 96 weeks. Serum biochemical parameters, Kt/V, residual renal
      function (RRF), life quality and cardiovascular test will be regularly recorded. Clinical
      outcomes such as mortality, technique failure, complications and life quality between the two
      groups will be investigated.
