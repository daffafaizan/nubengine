    
      This is an open-label prospective, randomized, controlled, multi-center study comparing
      DTM-SCS programming approach to Conventional SCS programming approach.

      Subjects meeting study entrance criteria will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of two
      study treatment groups:

        -  Test treatment group with DTM-SCS programming approach

        -  Control treatment group with Conventional SCS programming approach

      Data at follow-up visits will be compared between the two treatment groups, and in reference
      to baseline assessments collected at the beginning of the study.

      There is an optional two-way crossover to the other treatment group available for all
      subjects who remain implanted at 6 month visit.

      Up to 250 subjects may be enrolled at up to 20 clinical sites in the United States in order
      to include an estimated 135 subjects to the point of randomization.

      This would allow a minimum of 100 subjects (50% in each treatment arm) to complete the
      3-month endpoint.

      The expected total duration of this study is approximately 32 months. Enrollment of subjects
      is expected to last 18 months. Subjects who have received the permanent implant will be
      followed up for approximately 14 months. This consists of Baseline assessments, up to 10 days
      of trial stimulation, and 12 months of treatment following implantation and activation of the
      device.
