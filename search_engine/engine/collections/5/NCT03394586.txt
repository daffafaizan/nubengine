      identified. The investigators will perform a retrospective chart review and assess patient
      reported outcomes and objective measures of inflammation to assess response and remission.

      As clinical response in UC the investigators will define a composite end point of: Marked
      improvement in partial Mayo score AND improvement in one or more of the following parameters
      (acquired during chart review):

        -  Endoscopy data

        -  ultrasonography

        -  Calprotectin (cut off 100microg/g)

        -  CRP

        -  Anemia resolution

      Marked improvement is defined as: Clinical response based on partial Mayo Score (including
      physician global assessment): decrease in partial Mayo score ≥ 2 points and ≥ 30% from
      baseline and a decrease in rectal bleeding subscore ≥ 1 point or absolute rectal bleeding
      score ≤ 1. Improvement in lab work is defined as a reduction of the difference between
      baseline values and the next limit of normal by ≥ 30%. Improvement in endoscopy/
      ultrasonography is defined as a reduction of colitis in the same technique compared to
      baseline substantiated by images (endoscopy) or measurements of diameter of the bowel wall.

      As clinical remission in UC the investigators define normalization (i.e. absence of
      pathology) of patient reported outcomes (Frequency of stool, blood in stool) AND no evidence
      of residual disease activity in all of the following parameters:

        -  endoscopy data

        -  ultrasonography

        -  calprotectin (cut off 100microg/g)

        -  CRP and anemia
