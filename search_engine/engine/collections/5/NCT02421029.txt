      than 20 years and postmenopausal women in two groups: Group 1: Individuals who had a
      gadolinium-enhanced MRI study within 1-4 weeks before participation and Group 2: Individuals
      who had gadolinium-enhanced MRI study within 3-6 months before enrollment. The results will
      inform future analyses of gadolinium retention, excretion, and potential symptoms associated
      with same.

      Thus, the specific aims of this cross sectional study are to:

        1. Evaluate levels of gadolinium in the urine of adults with normal kidney function and a
           prior MRI performed within 6 months at baseline, and after a single dose of edetate
           calcium disodium .

        2. Evaluate levels of endogenous and xenobiotic metal levels and their relationship with
           gadolinium levels.

        3. Evaluate for symptoms of gadolinium toxicity.
