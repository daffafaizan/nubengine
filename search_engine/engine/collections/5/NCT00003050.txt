      therapy in patients with locally advanced breast cancer. II. Determine the pathological
      effects of paclitaxel and radiation in locally advanced breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized, dual institution study. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over
      1 hour twice a week for a total of 8 weeks. This is started within 1 week of a tumor biopsy.
      Patients receive radiotherapy 5 days/week for 5.0 weeks within 1 week of the first paclitaxel
      dose. Operable patients who have progressive disease with the above therapy undergo a
      modified radical mastectomy (MRM), then receive 4 courses of doxorubicin IV and
      cyclophosphamide IV, administered once every 21 days. Inoperable patients receive this same
      chemotherapy regimen, then are reevaluated for surgery. Patients who have stable disease or
      who respond to the paclitaxel/radiation regimen undergo a MRM, then receive 4 courses of
      doxorubicin IV and paclitaxel IV (over 3 hours) once every 21 days. All patients with hormone
      receptor positive tumors receive tamoxifen for 5 years after all other therapy is completed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 patients per institution) will be accrued over
      18- 24 months.
