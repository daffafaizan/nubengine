      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility of thalidomide and temozolomide in pediatric patients with
           relapsed or progressive poor prognosis brain tumors or recurrent neuroblastomas.

      Secondary

        -  Determine preliminarily evidence of biologic activity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      STATISTICAL DESIGN: The primary data analysis will estimate the percentage of patients who
      can complete 6 months of therapy in the mixed population. With a target accrual of 20
      patients the 90% confidence for the true feasibility rate will be no wider than 40%.
