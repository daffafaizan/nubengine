      other group will receive a placebo (a pill which looks like sildenafil, but contains no
      medication).

      Patients will undergo a heart catheterization, echocardiogram and exercise stress test.
      Patients will then take study medication for 12 weeks. A repeat heart catheterization,
      echocardiogram and exercise stress test will then be performed.
