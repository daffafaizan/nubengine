      including fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and a novel non-invasive method to measure retinal
      flavoprotein fluorescence (FPF) may be used to better predict Stargardt macular dystrophy
      progression and monitor treatment effects than conventional modalities such visual acuity and
      visual field. This method involves the use of novel statistical methods to assess the
      heterogeneity of fundus autofluorescence images.

      Participants will complete 3 visits to the University of Michigan Kellogg Eye Center. Each
      visit will take approximately 2.5 hours. The initial visit will include a routine clinical
      eye examination, measurement of best-corrected visual acuity, indirect ophthalmoscopy,
      microperimetry, frequency-domain optical coherence tomography, Goldmann visual fields, fundus
      flavoprotein fluorescence (FPF) imaging, and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) and fundus
      photography. Patients will return for evaluation at 6 and 12 months after their initial visit
      to repeat testing and imaging.
