      intended to improve both serious mental illness (SMI) and diabetes mellitus (DM)
      self-management in 100 individuals with SMI-DM vs. 100 individuals with SMI-DM receiving
      treatment as usual (TAU). The intervention will be conducted in a safety-net health system
      primary care setting and will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial (RCT). The
      primary effects of TTIM will be assessed with respect to SMI symptoms, Functional Status/Role
      Impairment, General Health Status, and DM outcomes. Secondary outcomes include adherence to
      psychotropic and DM medication, and engagement in healthy behaviors.

      This assessment will include quantitative assessment of facilitators/barriers targeted by the
      proposed intervention as well as a supplemental qualitative assessment. The qualitative
      assessments will include input from patients and interventionists. Specific aims for the
      qualitative analysis are to validate findings from the RCT, expand understanding of "key
      active ingredients" of TTIM, and provide information to inform future studies on individuals
      with SMI and related medical conditions.
