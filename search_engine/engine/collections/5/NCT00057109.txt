      We have previously shown that: 1) time tradeoff utilities for current health are high,
      indicating that patients have a strong will to live; 2) half of patients felt that their life
      was better now than before they were HIV-infected; and 3) certain non-health-related factors
      such as spirituality and concern and love for oneï¿½s children correlated with health values
      and a sense that life has improved.

      Objectives:

      1) To assess health values of veterans and non-veterans with HIV/AIDS; 2) To characterize
      spirituality in patients with HIV/AIDS; 3) To derive a power function relating health ratings
      to utilities; and 4) To assess whether society assigns higher values to health states for
      veterans than for non-veterans.

      Methods:

      We interviewed 100 representative veterans with HIV/AIDS from the Cincinnati and Pittsburgh
      VAMCs and, concurrently, 350 non-veterans with HIV/AIDS from Cincinnati and Washington, DC,
      twice over 12-18 months. The patient questionnaire included clinical and demographic data;
      health values measures; a question comparing life now with life before being infected with
      HIV; and measures of health status/health concerns, HIV symptoms, depressive symptoms,
      spirituality/religion, adherence, social support, self-esteem, and optimism. We also assessed
      how medical house officers rate and value the health state of a hypothetical patient with
      congestive heart failure, identified either as a 72-year-old veteran or merely as a
      72-year-old male.

      Status:

      Data collection completed ahead of schedule. Several manuscripts published with others to be
      submitted soon.
