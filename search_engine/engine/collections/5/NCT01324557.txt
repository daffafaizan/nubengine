      failure (ESRF) programs. The quality of glycemic control is known to be an important
      determinant of the rate of progression of patients with diabetic continuous ambulatory
      peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Diabetic CAPD patients are usually treated with dialysis
      fluids utilizing glucose as the osmotic agent to provide ultrafiltration. Most of diabetic
      CAPD patients had HbA1c readings above 7% despite the recommendation to keep the reading
      below 7%.

      The continuous blood glucose monitor (CGMS) has recently offered an opportunity to monitor
      blood glucose at 5-minute intervals for 72 continuous hours in diabetic patients. The CGMS
      patterns reveal blood glucose tracings well above the recommended standards of control in
      most of the diabetic CAPD patients.

      Good glycemic control is often difficult to maintain in diabetic patients treated with CAPD
      because they are continuously exposed to high concentrations of glucose in peritoneal
      dialysate. However, recent studies have suggested that diabetic patients who use insulin pump
      has been shown to reduce glycated hemoglobin levels without an increased risk of
      hypoglycemia, as compared with a regimen of multiple daily insulin injections, but results in
      diabetic CAPD patients have not been reported.
