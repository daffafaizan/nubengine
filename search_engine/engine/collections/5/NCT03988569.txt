      quality of information provided to patients including written pamphlets, videos, and
      websites. Such interventions have been called decision aids. Decision aids may promote
      informed consent through greater knowledge and consistency of personal values or attitudes
      with an enacted choice. Providing adequate information increases satisfaction, more rapid
      symptom resolution, reduced emotional distress, reduced use of analgesia, and possibly
      shorter hospital admissions. Cochrane reviews have established that audiovisual decision aids
      enhance informed surgical consent, yet little data exists about the benefits of such aids in
      Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery (FPMRS)4.
