      administered systemically, has demonstrated analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and anti-pyretic
      activity. The mechanism of its action is thought to be due to its ability to inhibit
      prostaglandin biosynthesis (cyclo-oxigenase inhibitors). However, they leave the lipoxygenase
      pathway free to generate leukotrienes. This pharmacodynamic activity has been speculated as a
      reason why NSAIDs produce less ocular side effects than corticosteroids. It has been widely
      used in ophthalmology. In 1987, Flach1 published its effectiveness in the treatment of
      aphakic and pseudophakic macular edema. Its efficacy after cataract surgery has been shown2
      and it has been compared to topical steroids after extra-capsular cataract extraction3,4,5
      and phacoemulsification6,7. It has been used as analgesic after radial keratotomy(RK)8,9,
      photorefractive keratectomy (PRK)10 and laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK)11

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of the NSAID ketorolac tromethamine
      ophthalmic solution 0.4% with the steroid loteprednol etabonate ophthalmic suspension 0.5%
      for preventing anterior segment inflammation after routine cataract surgery.
