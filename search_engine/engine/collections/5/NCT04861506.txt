      occlusion which in stage IIb was recommended for thrombectomy. However, with the development
      of new tools, including drug coated balloon, paclitaxel eluting stent, interwoven stents,
      debulking tools, stage IIb patients and some subacute thromboembolic lesions were also
      effective in some retrospective studies.

      Despite The shift of Endovascular-first strategy has been documented in recent literature.
      There still lack evidence to support either approach have a significant advantage over the
      thrombectomy. And stage IIb lesions and subacute lesions are often excluded in prospective
      clinical trials. Therefore, a well-designed real-world study that track the safety and
      clinical relevant outcomes, are required to determine the optimal therapies for patients with
      acute or subacute thromboembolic occlusions of lower extremity.
