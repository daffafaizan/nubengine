      surgery also decreases insulin resistance and improves diabetes. Our study enrolled
      individuals approved for bariatric surgery to collect data on modifiable predictors and
      laboratory outcomes. These data would allow us to systematically assess clinical outcomes
      over one year post bariatric surgery and elucidate how insulin resistance is decreased and
      diabetes is improved.

      The type of surgery was selected by the subjects between Roux-en-Y gastric bypass or a
      laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding. Participation in the study involved having a small
      sample of tissue obtained from the abdomen and subjects were also given the option to have a
      biopsy performed in the thigh area during their elective surgical procedure (optional adipose
      and muscle tissue biopsies).

      Subjects were examined prior to surgery and at 2, 3, 6 months after intervention.
      Anthropometric and body composition measurements were performed using the Bioelectrical
      Impendence Analysis (BIA) before surgery and 6 months post operatively. Morning blood was
      collected after overnight fasting during each visit. Some of the non-diabetic subjects
      completed a mixed nutrient stimulation study during the baseline and 6-month visit. Blood
      samples were collected immediately prior to drinking the liquid drink, and every 30 minutes
      after the meal ingestion for 2 hours.
