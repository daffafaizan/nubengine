      care costs annually (U.S Dept of Health and Human Services data, 2006). Down syndrome is an
      independent risk factor for osteopenia/osteoporosis. Increases in life expectancy as well as
      costly morbidity following fracture are reasons for further investigation of osteoporosis and
      prevention in this population. Etiology for low bone density is presently unknown in this
      population but may be related to unique genes on chromosome 21 which alter the biochemistry
      of bone metabolism or change the gonadal, thyroid and parathyroid function to alter bone
      formation and/or resorption. There are no published data on the measurement of bone turnover
      markers in the Down syndrome population; therefore we will measure and accrue this
      information and compare to our Ts65Dn data, as described later in this protocol.

      This pilot study will serve as the foundation for a larger translational research grant which
      will address multiple issues regarding the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of
      osteoporosis in the Down syndrome patient population and the Down syndrome mouse model
      (Ts65Dn). The data has the potential to improve our fundamental understanding of osteoporosis
      pathogenesis and treatment in the Down syndrome patient with potential applications to
      treatment in the general population.
