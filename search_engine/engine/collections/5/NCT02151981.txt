    
      This is a phase III, open label, randomized study assessing Osimertinib (80 mg, orally, once
      daily) versus platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (standard of care) in subjects with
      confirmed diagnosis of Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutation positive NSCLC, who
      have progressed following prior therapy with an approved Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor
      Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) agent and whose tumours harbour a T790M mutation within
      the EGFR Gene. Subjects must be chemotherapy naive and must agree to provide a biopsy for
      central confirmation of T790 mutation status following confirmed disease progression on their
      first line EGFR-TKI treatment (e.g. erlotinib, gefitinib or afatinib). Suitable subjects will
      then be randomized to receive either Osimertinib (80mg orally, once daily) or platinum-based
      doublet chemotherapy (pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 + carboplatin area under the plasma
      concentration-time curve AUC 5 or pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 + cisplatin 75 mg/m2) on Day 1 of
      every 21-day cycle in a 2:1 (Osimertinib: platinum-based doublet chemotherapy) ratio. Once
      subjects on the platinum-based doublet chemotherapy arm are determined to have objective
      radiological progression according to RECIST 1.1 by the investigator and confirmed by
      independent central imaging review, they will be given the opportunity to begin treatment
      with Osimertinib 80mg, once daily. These subjects may continue treatment with Osimertinib
      even after disease progression, as long as they are continuing to show clinical benefit, as
      judged by the investigator. The primary objective of the study is to assess the efficacy of
      Osimertinib compared with platinum-based doublet chemotherapy by assessment of Progression
      Free Survival (PFS), using investigator assessments according to Response Evaluation Criteria
      in Solid Tumours (RECIST 1.1), as well as asensitivity analysis of Progression Free Survival
      using Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR).
