    
      This study is a prospective observational study of women's heart rate and heart rate
      variability throughout one complete menstrual cycle. A minimum of 10 volunteers aged 18 years
      of age or over will be recruited via a variety of methods according to the criteria detailed
      in section 9. They will be required to wear a chest heart rate monitor and wrist heart rate
      monitor for 1 hour each day, and throughout the night for one menstrual cycle. In addition, a
      daily early morning urine sample will be collected throughout the study.

      Urine samples will be returned to SPD on a regular basis for measurement of urinary hormones
      related to pregnancy and fertility. Data collected via the monitors including heart rate and
      heart rate variability will be downloaded for comparison.
