      PDE5i is known to relax smooth muscle cells, it is suggested that PDE5i may dilate cerebral
      vessels and lead to an increase in cerebral blood flow. The main mechanism of subcortical
      vascular cognitive impairment are hypoperfusion of the brain. Therefore, in this study, the
      investigators will investigate whether Udenafil can increase cerebral blood flow and also
      lower peripheral blood viscosity in normal and subcortical vascular cognitive impairment
      subjects.
