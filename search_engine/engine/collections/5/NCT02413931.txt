    
      Single-center, observational, prospective cohort study including all patients hospitalized on
      the MDR-TB ward at Marius Nasta Institute.

      An estimated 100 patients with MDR-TB consecutively admitted for treatment at the MNI will be
      assessed for eligibility as study participants. All potential participants will be asked to
      provide information on demographic, epidemiological and clinical characteristics as well as
      prior treatment and disease history. Microbiological data, treatment and adverse events data
      will also be recorded. The data is expected to supplement the existing body of knowledge
      about patients with MDR-TB from the region.

      In order to characterize M. tuberculosis strains, sputum samples will be collected from the
      participants upon admission to the MDR-TB ward and after 3 months of therapy. Additionally,
      subsequent samples identified as being positive after prior culture conversion will also
      undergo testing. Key examinations on these samples include drug susceptibility testing on
      solid media and molecular typing. If samples originating from the same patient show
      discordance, whole genome sequencing will be performed to allow strain comparison between the
      actual patient strain and those isolated from other patients to identify potential nosocomial
      transmission. The location on ward of patients as well as their activities will also be
      recorded in the scope of identifying possible routes of transmission.

      Blood and urine samples will be collected at specific time points during the study and
      further assessed in order to identify candidate biomarkers that are potentially correlated
      with response to anti-tuberculosis therapy.

      All data generated from this study will be collected on standardized study forms and entered
      in a password-secured database.
