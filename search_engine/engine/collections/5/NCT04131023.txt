      The investigators pursued the following specific aims:

        1. Evaluate the impact of a mobile, real-time metabolism tracking device on gestational
           weight gain (GWG) (i.e. total weight gain and rate of weight gain) in pregnant women.
           The investigators postulated that the metabolism tracking (Breezing) group would have a
           higher proportion of women who gain the appropriate amount of weight per IOM
           recommendations. Further, the investigators expected the women in the Breezing group to
           gain a mean weight within +/- 3 lbs of their recommended GWG range per IOM guidelines,
           compared to standard care-receiving controls.

        2. Assess changes in resting energy expenditure during pregnancy in relation to
           self-reported dietary intake (at baseline, 4 weeks, 8 weeks, and 12 weeks). The
           investigators hypothesized that energy requirements would change across the second
           trimester and that self-reported caloric intakes would correlate with resting energy
           expenditure (REE)-corrected values (from Breezing) for women in the Breezing group.

      Exploratory Aims

      1. Evaluate the associations among objective and self-reported sleep parameters (actigraphic
      total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and mid-sleep point; sleep
      diary total sleep time, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, and mid-sleep point;
      insomnia symptoms; and sleep disordered breathing risk) and GWG within the Breezing and
      control groups.
