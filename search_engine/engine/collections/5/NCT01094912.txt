      compression or invasion of nerve tissue by metastasis is frequent and often unresponsive to
      oral drug therapy and even to epidural administration of opioids. In such refractory pain in
      a palliative setting, one modality that could be helpful is the use of technics of
      locoregional analgesia. Currently, they are routinely used for the management of acute
      postoperative pain and become to be more widely used for cancer surgery. For example,
      intrapleural intercostal nerve blocks after major lung resection or preincisional
      paravertebral blocks after breast surgery have been shown to improve pain control. However,
      locoregional analgesia is only occasionally used in chronic cancer pain.

      The procedures used are epidural analgesia, rachianesthesia, or continuous nerve blocks.
      L-bupivacaine will be used. The procedure will be performed only if the injection test is
      positive.

      The patients will be evaluated before and after the procedure, the patient being his/her own
      control. Evaluations will take place immediately before the procedure, then at 48 hours, 1
      week and 1 month after the procedure.
