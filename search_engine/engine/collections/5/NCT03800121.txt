    
      The main objective of this pilot study is to quantify exosomes and analyze their protein and
      RNA content in patients with sarcoma with disease:

        -  localized before and after treatment with surgery,

        -  metastatic before and after treatment with 1st line chemotherapy.

      The secondary objectives are:

        1. Determine whether the initial exosome concentration and the protein and RNA profile they
           contain vary with the localized or metastatic stage of the disease.

        2. Determine if the exosome concentration as well as the protein and RNA profile they
           contain varies after treatment.

        3. Determine if the initial exosome concentration (at T0) is associated with a response to
           treatment.

        4. Determine whether the change in exosome concentration before and after treatment is
           associated with a response to treatment.

        5. Identify a protein marker or RNA associated with a treatment response (marker present at
           T0 or occurring during follow-up).
