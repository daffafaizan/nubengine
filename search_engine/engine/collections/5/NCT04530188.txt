      Inhaled sedation with volatile anesthetic agents has been proposed as an efficient and safe
      alternative to usual intravenous sedation such as propofol or midazolam in the intensive care
      unit. In acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) models, preclinical studies comparing
      inhaled sedation to intravenous sedation showed that sedation with sevoflurane improves
      oxygenation, reduces the lung and systemic inflammatory response, decreases formation of
      alveolar edema and is associated with a less pronounced increase in extravascular lung water
      (EVLW, the amount of water contained in the lungs outside the pulmonary vasculature) or
      pulmonary vascular permeability index (PVPI), the ratio of EVLW over the pulmonary blood
      volume). Although benefits of inhaled sedation on inflammation and oxygenation have been
      shown in humans, its direct effect on EVLW or PVPI has never been evaluated in patients with
      ARDS. It could be important as their levels are factors independently associated with
      mortality in patients with ARDS.

      Aim:

      To evaluate the effect of inhaled sedation with sevoflurane in comparison with sedation with
      propofol on the degree of PVPI and the amount of EVLW in patients with moderate-to-severe
      ARDS.

      Hypothesis:

      The hypothesis is that inhaled sedation with sevoflurane reduces PVPI and EVLW in patients
      with ARDS compared to sedation with propofol.
