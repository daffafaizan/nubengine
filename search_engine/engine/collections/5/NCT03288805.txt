    
      110,000 adult Chinese (35 to 74 years old) without chronic diseases and major disability who
      have been living in South China including Guangdong, Fujian, Guangxi and Hainan for more than
      5 years will be recruited. All participants will be prospectively followed up for the
      incidence of chronic diseases (stroke, coronary heart disease, malignant neoplasms, chronic
      obstructive pulmonary diseases, diabetes and hypertension) and their risk factors (impaired
      glucose tolerance and obesity). Information about socio-demographic, diet, lifestyle,
      psychological status, medical history and current medication will be collected by
      questionnaires. Physical examinations including height, weight, waist and hip circumferences,
      blood pressure, fat mass and vital capacity will be conducted. Besides, blood, urine and
      fecal samples will be collected for further analysis. Annual meteorological data throughout
      the study period will also be collected. The associations between climate, diet and lifestyle
      and risks for chronic diseases will be evaluated.
