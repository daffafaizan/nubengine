      complication to anaesthesia.

      A difficult intubation occurs in approx. 1.2 - 3.8 percent of all anaesthesias .

      The standard procedure of intubation in Denmark is to use the curved Macintosh blade. This
      method, however, has some limits, as it requires a direct view of the area of the vocal
      cords. For that reason we are looking for new methods of intubation that can give a better
      overview.

      The Truview PCD™ laryngoscope is a commercially available laryngoscope with an integrated
      optical lens that can be connected to a camera head, and gives a better view of trachea
      during intubation under a general anaestetic. Furthermore it is possible to connect 8-10
      liters of oxygen per minute to the Truview PCD™ laryngoscope, which will prevent fog on the
      viewtube and slow down the rate of desaturation.
