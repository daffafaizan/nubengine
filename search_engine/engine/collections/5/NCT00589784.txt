    
      This is a phase II study of Sunitinib in patients with recurrent or inoperable meningiomas.
      An exploratory study will be performed for patients with recurrent hemangiopericytoma or
      hemangioblastoma. There will be approximately 50 patients enrolled on this study (40
      meningiomas and 10 hemangiopericytomas/hemangioblastomas). The treatment plan is to use daily
      SU11248 at a dose of 50 mg, using the established schedule of 4 weeks of treatment followed
      by two weeks of rest period, forming a six-week treatment cycle. A medical professional will
      see each patient at least every six weeks while on the medication for toxicity assessment and
      physical examination. Extent of disease evaluations will occur at baseline, two weeks, twelve
      weeks, 24 weeks, and every twelve weeks thereafter. These evaluations will include MRI of the
      brain (or CT head if a patient cannot undergo MRI) and MR perfusion.
