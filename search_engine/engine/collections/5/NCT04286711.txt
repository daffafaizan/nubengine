    
      This is a Single arm, open, phase I / II clinical trial. The study was divided into tolerance
      observation stage (dose exploration stage) and efficacy expansion stage (dose expansion
      stage).

      This study is to evaluate the tolerance of albumin-paclitaxel combined with apatinib and
      Camrelizumab in the second-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer to determine the maximum
      tolerable dose (MTD) of the combination.

      The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of albumin- paclitaxel in
      combination with apatinib and Camrelizumab in the second-line treatment of advanced gastric
      cancer.
