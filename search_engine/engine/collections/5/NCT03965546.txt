      peptide of alpha fetoprotein (AFP), which is expressed on 60-80 percent of hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). This clinical study evaluates the safety and pharmacokinetics of ET140202-T
      cells with TAE or Sorafenib in patients with HCC who have no available curative therapeutic
      options and a poor overall prognosis.
