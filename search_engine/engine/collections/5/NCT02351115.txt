      epilepsy will show a reduction in epileptic activity when they take a single dose of Staccato
      Alprazolam as compared to placebo. People with photosensitive epilepsy have changes on their
      electroencephalogram (EEG) when shown flashing lights. Three dose levels of Staccato
      Alprazolam will be compared to placebo.

      This study will also assess the level of sedation of Staccato Alprazolam compared to placebo.
