      most smokers do not utilize these interventions. As such, the vast majority of smokers do not
      capitalize on potentially effective nicotine dependence treatments. The way in which health
      risk information is presented may influence interest in a smoking cessation program. In a
      series of preliminary studies, individuals provided with messages that primed the role of
      genetic variation in susceptibility to addiction to smoking exhibited positive consequences
      on intentions to quit (Cappella, Lerman, Romantan, & Baruh, 2005). The proposed study has
      been designed to examine the effect of a message that primes genetic susceptibility on actual
      enrollment in a smoking cessation program, actual response to smoking cessation treatment,
      and potential moderators and mediators of this effect. The results of this pilot study may
      provide preliminary data for a larger trial and have implications for designing interventions
      to promote utilization of effective treatments for nicotine dependence among smokers.
