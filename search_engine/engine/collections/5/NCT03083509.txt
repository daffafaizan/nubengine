      within-subject profiling of recovery during both a control and exercise week. This design
      also allowed each group to perform an ecologically valid exercise session as well as having
      markers of recovery tailored to the areas of interest specific to each cohort. By having each
      group perform a non-exercise control week, this gives valuable information on the reliability
      and smallest worthwhile change for a range of both novel and commonly used recovery markers.
