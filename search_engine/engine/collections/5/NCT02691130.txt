    
      This is a multi-center, randomized, double blind active-controlled Phase 2b study. 222
      subjects will be randomized 1:1:1 into three groups to receive two sequential non-adjuvanted
      0.5 mg or 1.0mg intramuscular injection of M-001 (treatment), or two placebo (saline)
      injection, before receiving the Alum adjuvanted H5N1 vaccine at a sub optimal dose of 3mcg.
      Hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) will be evaluated at baseline and 3 weeks after H5N1 whole
      virion inactivated pandemic influenza vaccination as a measure of M-001's ability to enhance
      the humoral response. Cell mediated immune (CMI) responses will also be evaluated at baseline
      and after immunization with M-001 as a measure of M-001's standalone immunogenicity. The
      subjects will monitored for safety throughout the study until day 180.
