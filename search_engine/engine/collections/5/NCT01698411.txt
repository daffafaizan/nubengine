      chronic complain of insomnia. In our study, sleep duration is evaluated by complete
      evaluation of quality and quantity of sleep: one night PSG, associated with sleep agenda
      during 3 weeks, actigraphy, and several sleep questionnaires. We join to this sleep
      evaluation, a complete hemodynamic evaluation with: path way velocity and central BP obtained
      by tonometry, ambulatory BP measurement (ABBM), and self- BP measurement.

      The primary objective of this epidemiological study is to show an increase risk of
      hypertension when sleep duration is less than 7 hours, with objective measurement of sleep
      duration and hypertension.

      Secondary objectives are to evaluate role of complain of insomnia in the risk of
      hypertension, and to determine cardiovascular risk in insomnia with hemodynamic explorations.
