      impairment of B-cell function and compensatory hyperinsulinemia in predisposed Latinos with
      insulin resistance and that HCV eradication improves these abnormalities. This study
      addresses changes in the metabolic parameters over time. In addition, it is hypothesized that
      moderate alcohol consumption impacts insulin resistance and secretion and 30 patients with or
      without HCV who drink alcohol moderately will have discontinuation of alcohol use for 6 weeks
      and have metabolic testing before and after alcohol discontinuation.
