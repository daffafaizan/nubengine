      and Peptides derived from the grass pollen allergen Phl p 5. In a previous trial in allergic
      but otherwise healthy subjects the product has been shown to elicit a potent IgG response to
      the epitope of PreS1, which is responsible for binding to the cellular receptor NTCP. These
      antibodies prevent infection with HBV in a cell culture model. The present study will
      evaluate if such an immune response can also be achieved in four different patient
      populations: 1) vaccine naive subjects; 2) subjects having failed to seroconvert upon
      vaccination with a licensed HBV vaccine; 3) patients who are chronically infected with HBV,
      but are classified as inactive carriers; 4) patients with active chronic HBV infection who
      are HbEAg negative and chronically treated with nucleo(t)side (NUC) antiviral drugs. All
      subjects will receive 5 s.c. injections of VVX001, the time course of antibody response to
      PreS1 will be monitored in all of them. In cohort 4) NUC treatment will be withdrawn at
      different timepoints during the study and the effect of treatment with VVX001 on hepatitis B
      disease Parameters will be monitored. Subjects will be followed for 6 months after the of
      treatment for Evaluation of a long-term effect.
