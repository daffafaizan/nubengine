    
      The Michigan Medicine COVID-19 Cohort is a prospective observational cohort study of patients
      hospitalized specifically for COVID-19 at the University of Michigan Health System in Ann
      Arbor. Medical records of all consecutive patients with a positive SARS-CoV-2 are reviewed,
      and patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection but not primarily admitted for COVID-19 were
      excluded.

      Biologic samples of patients enrolled in M2C2 were collected, and clinical characteristics
      including in-hospital outcomes were characterized in detail.

      Biomarkers measured include, but not be limited to, soluble urokinase plasminogen activator
      receptor (suPAR), high sensitive C reactive protein (hs-CRP), brain natriuretic protein
      (BNP), high sensitive troponin T (hsTnT), interleukin 6 (IL-6), osteopontin, a2-antiplasmin.
