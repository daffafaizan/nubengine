      promoter region of Fas Ligand gene (rs 763110) and Fas (rs1800682) and clinical outcome on
      patients with MPM treated with platinum-Based agents as first line. the patients will have
      one of three following genotypes : Thymine/Thymine, Thymine/Cytosine or Cytosine/Cytosine
      (for Fas ligand polymorphism) and Adenine/Adenine, Adenine/Guanine or Guanine/Guanine ( for
      Fas polymorphism).
