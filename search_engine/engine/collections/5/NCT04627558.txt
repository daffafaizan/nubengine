      balance reactions and increased postural oscillations cause an increase in the fear of
      falling and the risk of falling in stroke patients. These disturbances cause stroke patients
      to make more effort to balance while standing. Balance assessment performed in individuals
      with stroke determines the risk of falling and is important in preventing complications that
      may develop due to loss of balance.

      Dubousset Functional Test (DFT); A conceptually practical four-component assessment test has
      been proposed by Dr. Jean Dubousset to assess the functional capacity of adult individuals.
      The validity of the test was made in individuals with spinal deformity. DFT; It consists of
      four components: getting up from a chair without arms and walking 5 meters forward and
      backward, descending and climbing steps, transition from standing to sitting on the ground,
      and the dual task test in which the individual walks while counting down from 50 at the same
      time. In the literature, there are many scales that evaluate balance and functional
      performance in stroke. However there is no validity and reliability study of Dubousset
      Function Test developed to evaluate balance and functional performance of stroke. For this
      reason, the aim of study is to examine the validity and reliability of Dubousset Function
      Test in stroke patients
