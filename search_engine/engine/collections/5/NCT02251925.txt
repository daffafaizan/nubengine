      be prepared for transfer by using either natural cycle (with or without hCG for ovulation
      induction) or Hormonal cycle (with or without administration of GnRH-a) In natural cycle
      without hCG, daily monitoring of urinary LH is started from day eight of the cycle and
      frozen-thawed embryo transfer is planned 3-5 days after detection of LH surge, observing
      mature follicles in ultrasound and endometrial thickness over 7mm for cleavage embryos.

      In natural cycle with hCG, after detection of mature follicles in ultrasound and endometrial
      thickness over 7mm, 10,000IU hCG is injected for ovulation and embryo transfer is performed
      3-5 days later in cleavage stage.

      In group 3, injection of GnRH agonist (Superfact) at a subcutaneous daily dose of 0.5 mg is
      started on the day 17-19 of the natural menstrual cycle. Once pituitary desensitization is
      confirmed, hormonal treatment is commenced with 4mg/day oral Estradiol valerate and after 7
      days if endometrial thickness is adequate, Estradiol administration will be continued with
      the same dose and 100mg Progesterone is administered before embryo transfer, otherwise
      patients are candidates for higher dosage of Estradiol till favourable endometrial thickness
      is achieved.

      In the hormonal group without GnRH-a, endometrial preparation will be started with daily
      administration of 6 mg Estradiol valerate from the 2nd day of the natural menstrual cycle for
      6 days. Then treatment will be continued similar to the 3rd group.
