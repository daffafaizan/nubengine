      will enroll additional patients at the dose found in phase I. Patients in phase I and phase 2
      will have the same treatment and followup.

      Participants will undergo standard of care diagnostic imaging, complete blood count (CBC)
      with differential and chemistry labs initially. While receiving the GCSF, participants will
      have a CBC with differential checked a day after each dose and one day prior to first day of
      radiation. The treatment planning FDG PET/CT will be performed shortly after the GCSF. During
      chemoradiation, participants will have weekly CBC with differential checked and other labs as
      standard of care.
