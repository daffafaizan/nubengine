      (S-NIMV) as compared to non-synchronized nasal IMV (NIMV) will decrease breathing effort in
      preterm infants immediately after extubation when recovery from RDS, as measured by phasic
      esophageal pressure deflection.

      Furthermore, the investigators plan to evaluate the effects of synchronized NIMV on gas
      exchange and brain oxygenation, and to evaluate the reliability of a newly developed
      abdominal pressure sensor device for the S-NIMV mode in a newly designed commercially
      available ventilator device.
