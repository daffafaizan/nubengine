    
      In this randomized controlled trial, a total of 240 patients divided evenly across the two
      participating IVF centers will be recruited. Patients will be randomized to a control and to
      a treatment group, each containing 120 participants.

      Only patients with at least one evaluable blastocyst will be randomized. Patients will
      undergo ovarian hyper-stimulation, oocyte retrieval, fertilization and embryo culture per
      standard clinical protocol determined by IVF center.

      In the control arm, patients will undergo a single frozen embryo transfer with an untested
      blastocyst with the best morphology. All other blastocysts with lower morphology will undergo
      trophectoderm biopsy on day 5, 6 or 7 and will be frozen. PGT-A results of the untransferred
      embryos will be revealed to the patient AFTER the outcome of the initial ET is known. If the
      initial transfer results in a non-conception cycle and additional euploid embryos are
      available for transfer, these cycles will be followed and their outcomes collected.

      In the experimental arm, all embryos will be cultured to blastocyst and all viable
      blastocysts will undergo trophectoderm biopsy and PGT-A. PGT-A will be performed regardless
      of the number of blastocysts available. Patients will undergo frozen transfer of the single,
      best quality euploid blastocyst. If the initial transfer results in a non-conception cycle
      and additional embryos are available for transfer, these cycles will be followed and their
      outcomes collected until the embryo cohort is exhausted.
