      modifiable risk factor,2 nearly half of all CHD patients are obese and the current standard
      of care fails to implement evidence-based obesity treatment for this high-risk population.
      The efficacy of exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation for improving exercise capacity and CHD
      risk factors is markedly blunted in CHD patients with obesity. Current programs largely focus
      on nutrient intake and produce minimal weight loss, on average. Our data show that despite
      appropriate exercise prescription and adherence, only 22% of CHD patients with obesity lose
      even the minimum recommended body weight over a 3-month program. These findings indicate that
      targeting reductions in caloric intake is needed to optimize outcomes in these patients and
      suggest that current programs are too short to produce adequate weight loss and ensure the
      necessary behavioral adaptations for long-term maintenance. Randomization to diet-induced
      weight loss in combination with aerobic exercise improves exercise capacity, quality of life,
      and CHD risk factors more than exercise alone and reduces long-term mortality in overweight
      and obese adults. The primary goal of this study is to determine the feasibility of adding a
      6-month behavioral weight loss intervention to exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation.
