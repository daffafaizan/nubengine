      Researchers hope to study the effects of the combination of Nivolumab and Ipilimumab. Many
      cancers use specific pathways (such as PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4) to evade the body's immune
      system. Nivolumab and ipilimumab work by blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 and CTLA-4 pathways and thus
      releasing the brakes on the immune system so it can stop or slow cancer.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Nivolumab and Ipilimumab as a
      treatment option for melanoma, but has not approved them for use when cancer cells spread to
      the cerebrospinal fluid
