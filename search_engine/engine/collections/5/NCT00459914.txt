      hypertension referred from a hypertension clinic. Patients with an AHI >15 are randomized to
      either continuing their usual pharmacological treatment alone or adding CPAP to their usual
      treatment, during a 3 month period.

      The main endpoint is the comparison of the mean 24h systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as
      assessed by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, between both treatment arms. The secondary
      endpoint is to assess changes in serum markers of endothelial dysfunction and angiogenesis
