      performed to assess the survival rate of all-ceramic restorations cemented adhesively. The
      effectiveness of cementation largely depend on the method used. The Air-Water-blasting
      performed prior to conventional acid-etch of dental tissues offers an increase in bond
      strength compared to the conventional etching technique.
