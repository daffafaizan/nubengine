      measurements as a surrogate for volume determination. Modern CT scan techniques, in
      combination with algorithms developed at MSKCC, allow the calculation of tumor volume. This
      protocol is designed to evaluate the reproducibility of the calculated volume of pulmonary
      masses on separate CT scans obtained on the same day in patients with non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC). Patients with NSCLC undergoing non-contrast CT scan of the chest will have a
      second, non-contrast CT scan of the chest performed. Uni-dimensional, bi-dimensional, and
      volume measurements for the primary NSCLC lesion will be determined on both scans and the
      values compared.
