    
      This study will enroll approximately 200 men and women ≥ 18 years of age who are SARS-CoV-2
      PCR positive undergoing home quarantine & approximately 200-1500 immediate household
      contacts, both male and female, ≥ 1 year of age.

      This study will test and follow persons quarantined at home after testing positive for
      SARS-CoV-2 (COV) and their household members.

      The CO-HOST mobile nurse initiates a home visit to the home of the COVID-19 index case after
      they and their household members (COV-HC) verbally express interest in the study and provide
      consent or assent as appropriate. At the first visit, nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs and blood are
      collected from COV and all members of the household (COV-HC) to determine infection status.
      Additional samples (nasal swabs, saliva, nasal strips), both nurse-collected and
      self-collected, may also be collected from COV and COV-HC. The nurse will provide specific
      instructions and training on how to perform self-collected swabs.

      Every week, thereafter, COV-HC are tested during the 28 days of the study. If home visits are
      not possible, then participants will perform self-collected swabs for testing. If COV-HC
      develops symptoms, they will be referred per standard of care (SOC).

      If COV or COV-HC are hospitalized, they will remain in the study for outcome assessment, but
      without further sample collections.
