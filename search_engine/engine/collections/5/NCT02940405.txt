    
      -  Patients will be clinically and radiographically examined and their eligibility will be
           assessed and preoperative pain will be measured. Eligible patients will be treated in
           one visit.

        -  Patients will be randomly assigned to one of 2 groups: experimental group (taking a 10
           mg tablet of ketorolac) and the control group (taking a placebo tablet). Each tablet
           will be taken one hour before starting treatment. The patient's pain will be assessed
           before local anesthetic adminstration. After 15 minutes of the initial inferior alveolar
           nerve block (IANB), the teeth will be examined using a cold pulp sensitivity test; in
           case of no or mild pain, the treatment will be initiated.

        -  During root canal treatment, no to mild pain response will be considered success. In
           case of failure, supplemental anesthesia will be administrated.

        -  Postoperative pain will be assessed 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours after treatment. The number
           of patients who will require rescue analgesic medication within the 48 hours
           postoperatively will be counted.
