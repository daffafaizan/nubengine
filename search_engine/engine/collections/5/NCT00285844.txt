      resistant individuals and insulin sensitive individuals (to serve as controls) will be
      eligible to enroll. Fat cel biopsy and CT scan of the abdomen is required at baseline and
      after an intervention with either weight loss or pioglitazone (drug to improve insulin
      resistance). Subjects will repeat insulin resistance test after the intervention as well.
      Subjects will learn much about their metabolism in this study, and will have an opportunity
      to improve their insulin resistance.
