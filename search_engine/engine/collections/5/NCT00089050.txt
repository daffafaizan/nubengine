      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of gemtuzumab ozogamicin and cyclosporine, in terms of the
           complete remission rate, in older patients with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  Determine the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Correlate clinical response with laboratory studies of drug susceptibility in patients
           treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclosporine IV continuously over 72 hours on days 1-3 and 15-17.
      Eight hours after initiation of each cyclosporine infusion, patients receive gemtuzumab
      ozogamicin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
