      RIC-Mel network (network for Research and Clinical Investigational Research on Melanoma)
      (NCT03315468).

      The RIC-Mel network has set up a national database in order to reference the active file of
      melanoma patients in France. The RIC-Mel database, supported by Nantes University Hospital,
      had been approved by French authorities (CCTIRS and CNIL). The RIC-Mel network is coordinated
      by Pr B. DRENO (Nantes University Hospital) and Pr C. LEBBE (Saint-Louis Hospital, AP-HP,
      Paris). Nowadays, 49 centres located all over the country are participating, with more than
      19,000 melanoma patients included in the database. The RIC-Mel database is referred as one of
      the privileged access to any research program on melanoma by the Cancerology Group (GCC) of
      the French Society of Dermatology .

      Based on this, BMS and the RIC-Mel network had established a partnership to set up a study in
      order to estimate the overall survival of melanoma patients treated by Nivolumab during the
      French ATU program.

      Data are collected in the RIC-Mel database by participating centres. Information of centres,
      follow-up of activity, data reviewing and extractions are realized by the RIC-Mel network.
      Data analysis is performed by BMS following a developed statistical protocol.

      Patients included in the study were patients with unresectable or advanced metastatic
      melanoma, which received at least one of Nivolumab, dispensed during the French ATU program.
