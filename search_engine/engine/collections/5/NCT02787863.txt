           (CD3+CD16+CD56+), activated T-cells (human leucocyte antigens, CD3+HLA DR+), CD3-HLA
           DR+.

        4. Microbiological examination of sputum.

        5. Determining the clinical effectiveness of vaccination.

             -  the number of exacerbations of chronic bronchopulmonary pathology for the year
                prior to vaccination and during the first and fourth years after vaccination;

             -  the number of courses of antibiotic therapy a year prior to vaccination and during
                the first and fourth years after immunization;

             -  the number of hospitalizations for acute exacerbations of chronic bronchopulmonary
                disease during the year prior to vaccination and during the first and fourth years
                after immunization.

        6. Method of estimating quality of life associated with health in patients with chronic
           bronchopulmonary pathology (asthma control questionnaire (ACQ-5), COPD assessment test
           (CAT)).

      Characteristics of variables (arms 1-8).

        1. The age of patients (years): mean (standard deviation) [min; median; max] for normally
           distributed variables; median [Q25; Q75] - for variables with distribution different
           from normal.

             -  The index of activity induced NBT-test (neutrophils), % if intensity >of 0.36.e.
                [>28]

             -  The percentage of NBT-positive cells in spontaneous test, % [2-19]

             -  Circulating immune complexes (CEC) cond. units [0,055-0,11]

             -  CD3+, % [55-80]

             -  CD3+CD4+, % [31-49]

             -  CD3+CD8+, % [12-30]

             -  CD19+, % [5-19]
