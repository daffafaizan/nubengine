      reported that hyperuricemia is related to exercise capacity, inflammation markers and
      diastolic dysfunction in such patients. In addition, hyperuricemia in CHF relates to both
      symptomatic status (i.e. morbidity) as well as impaired prognosis (i.e. mortality).
      Hyperuricemia is likely to play an important role in the pathophysiology of CHF.
      Up-regulation of xanthine oxidase (XO) activity in CHF has been shown to contribute to higher
      uric acid (UA) in CHF and the therapeutic concept of XO inhibition has shown beneficial
      effects in a number of surrogate markers in these patients. The XO inhibition accounts for
      substantial decrease in oxygen radical load, the latter is discussed as the main benefit of
      XO inhibition treatment in hyperuricemic patients. However, whether high uric acid itself is
      important or merely a marker of XO activity (and hence of increased radical accumulation) is
      currently under discussion. Therefore, this study aims to assess (I) the contribution of UA
      itself to the CHF pathophysiology and (II) to test the effect of lowering UA by uricosuric
      treatment in CHF.
