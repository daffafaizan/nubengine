      enhanced experience of specialized pediatric transplant teams have all led to marked
      improvements in patient and kidney graft survival in infants and young children Long-term
      graft survival rates decrease in adolescents 11 to 17 years of age. Several studies have
      suggested this decrease may be the result of noncompliance with immunosuppressive medications
      in this age group. Therefore, protocols that minimize the use of immunosuppressive
      medications, while retaining kidney function are necessary for improving graft and patient
      survival in children. The purpose of this study is to determine the safety of sirolimus
      monotherapy for long-term immunosuppression in children and adolescents after kidney
      transplantation.

      This study will enroll 10 participants who previously completed the CCTPT-PC01 study. The
      accrual period is scheduled for 12 months. The study follow-up period will last 96 weeks.
      Patients from the CCTPT-PC01 study have been maintained on sirolimus and mycophenolate
      mofetil (MMF) since 2-3 months post transplant. Enrolled participants receiving (MMF) or
      Azathioprine at study entry will have their doses withdrawn gradually over a period of 6
      months. Dosage will be reduced by 25% initially and by 25% every 2 months resulting in
      complete withdrawal by 6 months.

      This study will consist of 11 study visits after screening and study entry. Study visits will
      occur at weeks 1, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 60, 72, 84, and 96. A physical exam, vital signs,
      sirolimus levels, as well as blood and urine collection will occur at all visits. A renal
      biopsy will be performed at week 96.
