      arrhythmia, cardiogenic shock and other clinical complications. Different therapeutic options
      are available to support these patients in the perioperative period including inotropes,
      vasopressors, and vasodilators, and also assist devices such as intra-aortic balloon pump
      (IABP) and others.

      IABP increases myocardial oxygen supply by increasing diastolic coronary perfusion pressure
      and decreases myocardial oxygen demand by reducing left ventricular afterload. Additionally,
      IABP can also improve cardiac output and systemic perfusion. The hypothesis of this
      randomized and controlled trial is that the placement of IABP immediately before the cardiac
      surgery reduces clinical complications in high-risk patients.
