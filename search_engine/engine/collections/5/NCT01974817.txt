    
      The purpose of the study is to determine the immunogenicity of 13-valent conjugate
      pneumococcal vaccine in patients 50 years or older with end stage renal disease on dialysis.
      Patients will receive one dose of 0.5ml of Prevnar-13 intra-muscularly. Antibody response to
      pneumococcal serotypes will be studied ar 2months and 12 months after administration of
      vaccine.

      The study will try to determine Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization in patients 50 years or
      older with end stage renal disease on dialysis and also investigate if there are any change
      in Streptococcus pneumoniae colonization after Prevnar-13 vaccination.
