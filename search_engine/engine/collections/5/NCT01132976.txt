      Nottinghamshire NHS Trust's community personality disorder service will be eligible for
      inclusion. After initial assessment for suitability for the service, patients will be
      randomised to receive the motivational interview plus treatment as usual or treatment as
      usual only. The investigators aim to recruit 100 participants over 1Â½ years. The comparison
      is between a motivational intervention called the Personal Concerns Inventory plus treatment
      as usual and and treatment as usual only in the client preparation phase. The feasibility
      measures are (1) the recruitment rate to a goal-based motivational interview plus treatment
      as usual or treatment as usual only, and (2) the acceptability of the intervention to clients
      and therapists. The investigators will also develop measures to assess the processes by which
      the intervention may have an effect, and assess the cost of the intervention compared with
      treatment as usual.
