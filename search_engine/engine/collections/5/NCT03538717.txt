    
      To describe the clinical profile of patients with a long response to Axitinib and to identify
      clinical factors which could be related with the long response to Axitinib, through the
      comparison between long responder patients and a group of refractory patients.

      For this study are defined as "long responder", those patients who has a Progression Free
      Survival (PFS) of at least 9 months since the initiation of Axitinib treatment, and
      "refractory patients" those who have Progression Disease (PD) in the first response
      assessment since the initiation of Axitinib treatment (estimated PFS â‰¤3 months]

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To describe the efficacy of Axitinib treatment in the long responders group, and in
           relation with the treatment received before Axitinib, in terms of PFS, ORR, CB, OS, TTP
           ...

        -  To describe the tolerability and drug management of Axitinib in this population.

        -  To describe treatment received after Axitinib in this population.

      Study procedures:

      For the recruitment, the Investigator should review the inclusion / exclusion criteria. In
      case of patients alive at the moment of the inclusion, the investigator will require them to
      sign the IC.

      With the data available in the medical records, the information requested will be recorded in
      the electronic data collection tool.
