    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Define an individually adapted (by dosage) protocol of pemetrexed disodium, cisplatin,
           and vitamin B12 in patients with unresectable pleural mesothelioma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the relationship between pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters
           (hematologic and nonhematologic).

        -  Analyze the inter-individual pharmacokinetic variations and the influence of the
           covariables on the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed disodium.

        -  Analyze the impact of pharmacogenetic (MTHFR, TS, GSTpi, ERCC1, XPD) variations on the
           toxicity of pemetrexed disodium.

        -  Validate a strategy of adapting dosage.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes and cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day
      1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive vitamin B12 intramuscularly on day -7 and
      then every 9 weeks until chemotherapy is completed.

      Blood samples are collected during the first and third courses of chemotherapy. Samples are
      analyzed by pharmacogenetic (MTHFR, TS, GSTpi, ERCC1, xPD), pharmacokinetic, and other
      pharmacological methods.
