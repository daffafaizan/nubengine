      found in men with hyperlipidemia, hypertension, or diabetes, and may also be an early warning
      of peripheral arterial disease. We looked for a relationship between the degree of ED and the
      presence of PAD as measured by the Ankle Brachial Index (ABI) associated with co-morbid
      conditions. Men over the age of 50 with hyperlipidemia, diabetes, hypertension, or tobacco
      use were asked to complete a Sexual Health Inventory for Men (SHIM). An ABI was measured
      using a hand held Doppler. 175 men from two urban and three suburban Family Practices in
      Tidewater Virginia participated. Outcome measures included SHIM scores, ABI, Systolic Blood
      Pressure, LDL, Hemoglobin A1C and tobacco use. Moderate or severe erectile dysfunction (SHIM
      < 11.0) was identified in 44% of participants. More than 12.5% of men with severe ED (SHIM <
      7.0) had an ABI positive for PAD at 0.95 or less. The results were adjusted for the presence
      of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, diabetes and tobacco use. Men with hypertension did not
      demonstrate a significant increase in the frequency of PAD compared to diabetics or smokers.
      Neither race nor age was found to increase the prevalence of ED. The complaint of erectile
      dysfunction in men over age 50 should prompt a physician to consider peripheral arterial
      disease. A simple self-administered SHIM test should help identify men at risk for PAD and
      suggest further evaluation if the score is 7.0 or less.
