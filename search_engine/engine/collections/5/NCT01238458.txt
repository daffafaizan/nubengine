      of [18F]AV-45 in various neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, we will expand the
      database of [18F]AV-45 PET imaging in Alzheimer's disease and MCI patients to refine the
      definition of a positive scan in patient with AD and MCI as compared to healthy control.
      Secondary, we will expand the safety database of [18F]AV-45 PET imaging. In addition, the
      image characteristics and prevalence of AÃŸ positivity will be evaluated in different subsets
      of MCI and AD patients.
