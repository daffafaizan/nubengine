      treatment is improving more persons with CF are living into adulthood and are entering into
      serious dating relationships. A diagnosis of CF has medical implications of concern to
      potential life partners including infertility, decreased life span and an increasing need for
      medical management with age. In addition, there is a small but non negligible possibility of
      future children inheriting the condition. These implications may make this type of disclosure
      a particularly important event in one's life and may affect one's disclosure decisions.
      Little research has been done on the process of disclosure in this population, and research
      specifically on disclosure to dating partners is lacking.

      This study seeks to gain insight into the experience of disclosing a CF diagnosis to a dating
      partner through semi-structured in-depth phone interviews with approximately 30 persons who
      have CF and who vary in gender, age, ethnicity, and severity of their condition. The
      interviews will explore general experiences of disclosure to dating partners, will focus on
      selective disclosure of certain information to certain recipients, and will explore the
      implications of the disclosure or non-disclosure experiences. The qualitative interviews will
      be transcribed and subjected to thematic analysis, which will identify common themes across
      interviews. An understanding of the disclosure process experienced by persons with cystic
      fibrosis may provide insight into ways health care practitioners can support their patients
      during this process.
