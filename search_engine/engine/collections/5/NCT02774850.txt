      Participants will be patients less that 19 years of age at diagnosis receiving or having
      received chemotherapy for AML from seventeen participating pediatric hospitals across the
      United States. There is no study intervention; this is a medical record abstraction study
      only. Investigators will abstract subjects medical record data over the study period in order
      to study clinical outcomes including the occurrence of bacteremia and time to the start of
      the next course in the chemotherapy regimen, in relation to neutropenia management strategy.
