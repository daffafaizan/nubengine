      intervention, and is characterized by systematic and repeated exposure to feared movements,
      activities and/or sensations in order to decrease fear and subsequently increase physical
      activity.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The purpose of this project is to develop and test a
      cognitive behavioural intervention targeting specific fears in patients with PDN, in order to
      increase physical activity and improve QOL.
