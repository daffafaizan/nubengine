      families, and society despite treatments including psychotherapy, substitution therapy or
      receptor blockers, and psychoeducation. The investigators have developed a novel treatment
      that combines transcranial photobiomodulation (t-PBM) and Schiffer's Dual Brain Psychology
      (DBP)

      The investigators will use a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled protocol in which
      22 patients with significant opioid cravings and a history of recent or current OUD attended
      three one-hour weekly sessions. After baseline measures of opioid craving, and other
      psychometrics, subjects will receive two unilateral t-PBM applications (810 nm CW LED, 250
      mW/cm2, 60 J/cm2, 4 min) or a sham (foil-covered LED) at F3 or F4. Prior to any treatment,
      the investigators will use 2 tests to determine which hemisphere is more associated with a
      negative outlook and cravings and will treat that side before the more positive hemisphere.
      The primary outcome measure will be an opioid craving scale (OCS). plus weekly Hamilton
      Depression (HDRS) and Anxiety (HARS) Rating Scales prior to treatments. Patients will be
      closely monitored for any possible adverse side-effects from the treatment.
