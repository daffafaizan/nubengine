    
      This is a prospective, single-center, observational study, investigating the clinical and
      hemodynamic features of maturation of hemodialysis native arteriovenous fistula (AVF).
      Hemodynamic features under investigation are the diameter of the feeding brachial artery,
      volume of flow (VF) measured with transcutaneous Duplex ultrasound (DUS), resistivity index
      (RI), diameter and wall thickness of the efferent vein, measured at days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
      14, 21, 30, 60 and 90 post creation. Clinical features of maturation are the time of first
      access successful cannulation and the performance of three consecutive adequate dialysis
      sessions.
