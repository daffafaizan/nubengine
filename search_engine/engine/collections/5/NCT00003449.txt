        -  Determine the response rate, progression time, and survival of patients with
           platinum-resistant ovarian cancer treated with weekly paclitaxel and gemcitabine.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the toxic effects and safety profile of premedication with steroids with this
           regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to prior treatment with paclitaxel (none or
      relapse more than 6 months after paclitaxel versus progressive disease or relapse less than 6
      months after paclitaxel).

      Patients receive dexamethasone IV, then paclitaxel IV followed by gemcitabine IV, for 3
      consecutive weeks on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment is continued every 4 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients are followed until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-35 patients will be accrued for this study.
