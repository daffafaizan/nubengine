      defects around teeth, dental implants, and prior to implant placement. The main function of
      the membrane barrier in GBR is to mechanically prevent the undesirable penetration of
      epithelial cells and fibroblasts to the bone defect area, creating a secluded space where
      bone regeneration may occur. Resorbable and non-resorbable membranes have been used in GBR.
      While non resorbable membranes require another surgical procedure for removing the membrane
      after the healing period, the resorbable membranes have the advantage of transmitting tissue
      fluids, excluding undesirable cell penetration and sparing an additional unwanted surgical
      procedure. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of Hypro-SorbÂ® F, a bilayered
      bioabsorbable membrane in inducing bone regeneration in different dental procedures requiring
      GBR.
