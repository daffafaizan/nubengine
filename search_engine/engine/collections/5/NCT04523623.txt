    
      A randomized, blinded cohort study. Consented patients will be randomized to receive either
      ibuprofen or oxycodone after initial RN patient assessment in Emergency Department Triage
      determines a need for radiographs to evaluate for possible forearm fracture. Pain assessment
      scores will be determined at Triage and at 30-minute intervals throughout the patient's
      course until the patient is discharged home or additional analgesic medication is
      administered.
