      moment-to-moment experience, has been receiving substantial scientific attention as a process
      that can be stress and health protective (Brown, Ryan, & Creswell, 2007). Recent reviews by
      Baer (2003), Bishop (2002), and Grossman et al (2004) support the effectiveness of the
      standardized and manualized MBSR program in reducing stress and functional disability in a
      variety of chronic illnesses, although no studies have tested if MBSR impacts clinical
      markers of HIV, although some evidence suggests that MBSR improves some markers of innate
      immunity and quality of life in HIV-infected adults (see Robinson, Mathews, & Witek-Janusek,
      2003). In this study, we propose to extend this work by investigating the impact of this
      intervention on biological and functional health status in HIV-positive adults.

      We propose to determine whether the 8-week MBSR program is more effective than a one-day MBSR
      seminar in: (1) maintaining immune resistance in HIV infection (i.e. maintaining counts of
      CD4+ T lymphocytes and reducing HIV viral load), and (2) improving HIV-related quality of
      life. Additional analyses will test for a dose-response effect of MBSR by examining if MBSR
      class attendance and daily meditation practice are associated with the primary and secondary
      outcomes. These aims will be tested in a sample of 50 HIV-positive adults that is diverse
      with respect to ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation.
