      the world.

      PEGs are non-absorbable isosmotic solutions that pass through the bowel without net
      absorption or secretion. Significant fluid and electrolyte shifts are therefore attenuated.

      However, several studies have shown that PEG may also impair renal function. One recent
      population-based study reported that the use of PEG was associated with an increased risk of
      acute kidney injury.

      The renal safety of PEG in Taiwanese patient has not been reported.
