      Performance Lab (HPL) to determine whether they qualify to participate in the study. Upon
      qualification, participants will be scheduled for their first testing session which will
      include: a body composition analysis via an InBody 770, hunger questionnaires, VAS
      questionnaires, follow up questionnaire, and 5 resting energy expenditure (REE) tests.
      Participants will be randomized into an order that determines which supplement to ingest at
      their testing sessions. Example: A, C, B will correspond to taking A the first session, C the
      second session and so on.

      Supplementation protocol: Participants will be randomized into an order that determines which
      supplement to ingest at their testing sessions. Example: A, C, B will correspond to taking A
      the first session, C the second session and so on. Subjects will take one pill with 8oz of
      water in one minute of allotted time.

      After initial REE, heart rate, blood pressure, questionnaires, and body composition tests,
      subjects will ingest the first of three supplements. After ingestion, subjects will complete
      four REEs every hour. At initial and 60 minutes post ingestion, ECG measurements will be
      recorded using the Biopac BSL. After each REE is complete, heart rate, blood pressure, and
      questionnaires will be taken and recorded. The REE will last 20 minutes, thus to ensure
      ending time is at the hour mark, the REE will be started at the 40 minute time point. Once
      testing is finished, subjects will return to the lab two more times with a one week washout
      period to ingest the remaining supplements.

      Two days prior to each of the three testing sessions, participants will record their dietary
      intake via MyFitnessPal.
