    
      The main objective of this current study is to determine whether the optimised WHELD
      intervention, will significantly improve quality of life for people with dementia in
      comparison to the usual care provided in care homes.

      Key secondary objectives will be to determine the specific impact of the optimised WHELD
      intervention on a range of outcomes including mental health and unmet needs, physical health
      and use of psychotropic drugs, staff attitudes and the quality of the interaction of care
      staff with people with dementia, person centred environment in care home settings and overall
      provide a cost-effective, simple and practical intervention.

      We hypothesise that the intervention will significantly improve several key outcomes.
      Specifically we hypothesise that, compared to treatment as usual the optimised WHELD
      intervention will:

      â€¢ Improve quality of life for people with dementia living in nursing homes

      The secondary hypotheses are that the optimized WHELD intervention will:

        -  Reduce agitation, other behavioural and neuropsychiatric symptoms

        -  Reduce the use of antipsychotic and other psychotropic drugs use

        -  Reduce unmet needs

        -  Reduce mortality

        -  Improve mood and depression

        -  Improve the quality of interactions between staff and residents

        -  Provide person centred environment in care home settings

        -  Provide a cost-effective intervention

      The study design is a cluster randomised controlled, 2 arms trial to be run in 80 care homes,
      including 960 - 1280 participants.

      Each cluster in the optimised WHELD intervention arm will receive the optimised WHELD
      intervention for 9 months.

      Evaluations will be undertaken to understand the breadth of benefits conferred by the
      intervention to be assessed when used in comparison with the progress of the participants
      residing in the care homes allocated to the TAU trial arm. Baseline and follow up data will
      be collected on all consented residents who meet the inclusion criteria at each participating
      care home.
