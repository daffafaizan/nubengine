      household heads who receive Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF) and have serious
      mental illness (SMI). The findings from this study will be used to determine the feasibility
      of conducting a full-scale longitudinal study of the impact of welfare reform outcomes on
      female household heads who have SMI and are currently or formerly recipients of welfare.
