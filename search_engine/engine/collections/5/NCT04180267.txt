      on vertebral BMD, muscle health, balancing ability and functional ability in wheelchair users
      (mainly on wheelchair for outdoor activities).

      Healthy elderlies aged 65 years or above, with walking difficulties and using wheelchair are
      eligible. We exclude anyone who: [1] cannot stand and walk independently, [2] have vibration
      treatment before, [3] with malignancy, [4] with acute fractures or severe osteoarthritis
      (18), [5] with cardiovascular concern such as with pace-maker in-situ, [6] with chronic
      inflammatory conditions known to affect muscle metabolism such as rheumatoid arthritis, and
      [7] with high frequency of physical activities, such as subjects who participated in regular
      exercise five times a week or more.

      Recruited subjects will be randomized to either LMHFV or control group. Subject assigned to
      LMHFV group will receive LMHFV (35Hz, 0.3g, 20min/day, at least 3 times/week) for 6 months.
      The primary outcome is BMD at the lumbar spine to be assessed by dual-energy X-ray
      absorptiometry (DXA) that is clinically recommended for the diagnosis of osteoporosis. All
      primary and secondary outcome assessments for all groups will be performed in the
      investigators' institute at baseline and 6 months post-treatment.
