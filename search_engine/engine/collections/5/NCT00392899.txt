      Primary

        -  Compare the efficacy of adjuvant tegafur-uracil vs observation only in patients with
           curatively resected stage II colorectal cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare relapse-free and overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare the occurrence of adverse events in patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, controlled study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo observation.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral tegafur-uracil on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 7 days
           for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,000 patients will be accrued for this study.
