      Registration, Bedside Monitoring Equipment (BME), and Lab data. As patients arrive in the
      unit, workflow activities are started with patient context. Typical implementations of the
      IHI guidelines for Sepsis screening dictate that patients are rescreened on regular intervals
      to detect Sepsis. The PSST for Sepsis solution will monitor Lab and BME data stores and
      continually update the screening forms for a particular patient. It will also alert
      clinicians when a manual screen is required in the Microsoft InfoPath form. The constant
      screening loop is managed by the PSST for Sepsis solution and will continue to run until the
      patient screens positive for Severe Sepsis, or moves to the next workflow of auditing a
      patient with Sever Sepsis.

      When patients reach a state of "positive screen" (either manually, or through the automated
      data monitors) the PSST for Sepsis solution will move this patient from a screening workflow
      to an auditing workflow automatically. The PSST for Sepsis solution will then monitor the
      treatment process through Microsoft InfoPath form posts and alert clinicians when treatment
      goals have not been met. After a successful auditing process and completion of the 6 and 24
      hour bundles, the patient will be placed back into a screening workflow. The end result is
      that patients will remain in a screening/auditing workflow loop until the patient is
      discharged from the unit.
