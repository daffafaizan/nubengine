      and current trauma in Native communities compromise caregivers' mental health and parenting,
      which in turn affect early childhood behavior problems and adverse events that increase
      children's risk for suicide and substance use in adolescent and young adulthood.

      Wa'Kan Ye'Zah will combine adapted elements of: 1) Common Elements Treatment Approach (CETA),
      an evidence-based intervention proven effective to reduce stress, depression and
      trauma-related symptoms, 2) Family Spirit, an evidence-based parent training program to
      promote positive early child development in Native American communities, and 3) cultural
      components informed by tribal-specific risk and protective factors for suicide and substance
      abuse identified in community-based studies that led to this proposal. The intervention will
      consist of 12 weekly individual lessons taught to parents and children (ages 3 to 5) at Head
      Start facilities by indigenous community health workers, a delivery strategy selected to
      enhance participant engagement, local acceptability and sustainability.

      This study will use a randomized control trial (RCT) with an embedded single-case
      experimental design (SCED) to determine the effectiveness of the intervention on mental
      health and behavioral outcomes among N=120 parent-child dyads, while empirically exploring
      the added benefit of specific cultural components on parent/caregiver outcomes. on mental
      health and behavioral outcomes among N=120 parent-child dyads, while exploring the added
      benefit of cultural components on parent outcomes. The study plan is situated within a
      well-established trust relationship with tribal communities, innovative formative research
      that led to this proposal, and an experienced, multi-disciplined study team led by an
      Indigenous Principle Investigator.

      A supplement has been added to this clinical trial, the goal of the supplement is to add to
      our understanding of opioids and other substance use and suicide risk in Native communities
      by analyzing individual social network data to understand the relational factors that may
      increase both risk of suicide and opioid use and the relational characteristics of networks
      that act as protective factors for suicide and opioid use.
