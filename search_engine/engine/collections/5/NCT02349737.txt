      measurement using BIA. ICD therapy will have been temporarily inactivated before the
      measurement to avoid inappropriate shocks, and the sensitivity level of the ICD will be set
      to maximum. Body composition will be measured at three frequencies (5 khz, 50 khz and 100
      khz).

      Interference will be assessed by the presence of visible artefacts on the real-time
      electrogram, with ICD marker annotations showing atrial and/or ventricular sensed episodes.
      The outcome measure will be the number and proportion of patients who have electromagnetic
      interferences of the ICD when BIA is done.

      The procedure will take approximately 5-10minutes, with reprogramming of the device at the
      end of the test. No further follow-up in the context of the study will be performed.
