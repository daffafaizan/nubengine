    
      Our project is designed to help families and children with mild or moderate symptoms early,
      before problems become worse and more difficult to treat.

      The Strongest Families Program is a distance parenting program that was developed at the
      Centre for Research in Family Health at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Most
      families are able to manage these problems if they are given the skills to do so. The
      Strongest Families "Parenting the Active Child" Distance Program is done over the telephone;
      families do not have to travel to a centre to receive help. This program includes a handbook,
      videos and weekly phone calls between the parent and non-professional'coach'. The coach
      provides support to families, answer questions and guide parents as they learn the skills.
      Strongest Families has helped hundreds of families in Nova Scotia.
