      Eligible patients will be contacted by the local study coordinator or a study nurse and
      informed about the study. After having provided written informed consent, they will be
      presented with the following two questionnaires for self-report of general symptoms, specific
      dental and oral symptoms, and quality of life issues; the EORTC QLQ-C30 and the QLQ-OH17. In
      addition to these two, a short debriefing interview will be conducted by study coordinator /
      study nurse for assessment of feasibility and patients' opinion about the questionnaires.

      The case report form (CRF) on medical and demographic data will be completed by the study
      coordinator / study nurse before or after the patients have completed their part.

      A subset of the patients will be assessed twice, as examination of test - retest reliability
      is important in phase IV of the development process.
