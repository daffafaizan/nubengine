      patients with platinum-resistant recurrent or refractory ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal
      carcinoma who have failed on higher priority treatment protocols. II. Determine the nature
      and degree of toxicity of aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive aminocamptothecin colloidal dispersion IV over 120 hours weekly for
      two of every three weeks. Courses are repeated every 21 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, then
      every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 23-56 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-12
      months.
