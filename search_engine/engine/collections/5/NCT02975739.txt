      internal radiation therapy. These microspheres emits beta radiation. The majority of the
      radiation dose will be absorbed within 3.2 mm with a maximum penetration in tissue of 9 mm.
      Therefore this can result in a high local tumor ablative dose with minimal dose to healthy
      adjacent tissue.
