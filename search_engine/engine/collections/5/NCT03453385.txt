      Pre-Filled Tank; n=440) or not (n=220). E-cigarette samples are inclusive of a battery and
      self-contained tanks of assorted flavors to last up to 4 weeks. Participants will be
      recruited nationally, but a subset (N=120) will be recruited locally to allow for biomarker
      collection . Our two-fold purpose is to 1) characterize naturalistic uptake of e-cigarettes,
      and 2) assess impact of e-cigarette uptake on smoking behavior. All smokers will be asked to
      provide smoking diary data, captured electronically, daily for 4 weeks. More substantive
      phone assessment will track smoking and related behaviors at baseline (Day 0) and +10, +17,
      and +24 days (weekly during initial 3 weeks, following brief lag for delays in product
      mailing), and at +1, +3, and +6 months.
