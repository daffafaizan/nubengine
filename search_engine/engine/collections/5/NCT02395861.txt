    
      Adult Medical or surgical, brain-injured or not, ICU patients requiring invasive mechanical
      ventilation for at least 48 hours and with alteration of consciousness induced or not by
      sedatives. Inclusion will take place at the 24th hour (Â± 12) after admission into the ICU
      will be enrolled. Those patients with either pregnancy, post anoxic coma, brain death,
      pre-existing neurologic disease disturbing the interpretation of the brainstem reflexes
      (Guillain-Barre, myasthenia, gravis, brain tumor, inflammatory or degenerating disease of the
      posterior fossa, acute peripheral neurologic disease), or declined participation will be
      excluded.

      The measurements will be based on:

      D1 : Demographic data, cause for admission, brainstem reflexes, Glasgow Coma Scale score,
      Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU) , Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS),
      Behavioral Pain Scale (BPS), simplified index of gravity (IGS 2) score, Sequential Organ
      Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores, cumulated sedative doses and Secondary Systemic Cerebral
      Aggressions (ACSOS) parameters D3 : parameters of D1, electrophysiologic analyses:
      Electroencephalogram (EEG), auditory evoked potentials (EAEP), Somatosensory Evoked Potential
      (SEP), recording of clinico-biological data, Cognitive evoked potentials (CEP) in patients
      with consciousness alteration still on mechanical ventilation at day 3.

      D1-D28 : date of death, date of extubation, SOFA, CAM-ICU, cumulated doses of sedatives and
      analgesics, duration of sedation, occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia after Day 2, brain
      imaging data if available.

      D28 : Glasgow Outcome Coma Scale and mini mental state
