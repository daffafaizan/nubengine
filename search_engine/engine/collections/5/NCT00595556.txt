      effects to topiramate, a medication that has demonstrated efficacy in a randomized clinical
      trial for treatment of alcoholism. Because zonisamide is potentially better tolerated and
      easier to titrate in the outpatient setting than topiramate, it may offer important clinical
      advantages in the treatment of alcoholism.

      This is a small 12-week placebo-controlled pilot study examining tolerability and potential
      efficacy in anticipation of a larger, placebo-controlled trial of zonisamide for treatment of
      alcohol dependence. It is a randomized, double-blind trial of zonisamide vs. placebo at
      flexible dosages of 100-500mg/day in alcoholics receiving ambulatory psychosocial treatment.
      Participants will take part in six individual Cognitive-Behavioral based therapy sessions,
      which are focused on learning coping skills. Participants must endorse a goal of either
      cutting down their drinking to non-hazardous levels, or abstinence.
