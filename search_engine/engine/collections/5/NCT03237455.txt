      from bariatric surgeries clinics. All patients will have the diagnosis of metabolic syndrome
      National Cholesterol Education Panel III (NCEP). Patients in their 5th decade of life will be
      recruited for the study. This study group will have to meet the NCEP 3 criteria for metabolic
      syndrome and/or have type 2 diabetes mellitus (9). An age and sex matched individuals who do
      not meet these pre-requisits will serve as a control group.

      All asymptomatic patients will undergo postero-anterior and lateral x-rays of the thoracic
      spine, unless they have postero-anterior or lateral thoracic spine or chest x-rays in the
      year preceding the recruitment. For patients with back pain, addition of cervical or lumbar
      spine radiographs will be permitted based on the physician judgement. Patients recruited for
      the study will have a total spine and sacroiliac MRI (see below) read by radiologists and
      rheumatologists, expert in musculoskeletal imaging, who will be blinded for the patient's
      data. The readings of the radiographs and the MRI will be performed in a random order.

      All patients and controls will undergo postero anterior and lateral thoracic spine X-rays and
      MRI of the entire spine and their sacroiliac joints (Spine: sagittal T1-weighted and T2 with
      fat suppression sequences, SIJ semicoronal T1-weighted and T2 with fat suppression sequences)
      at study entry.

      An accepted scoring system for the interpretation of the MRI studies will be employed for
      both the spine and the sacroiliac joints.
