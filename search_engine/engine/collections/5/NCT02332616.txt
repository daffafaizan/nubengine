      postoperative pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting are well-documented.

      Anaesthesia and surgery are associated with a dramatic increase in the inflammatory response.
      The complement system participates in the disposal of products due to inflammatory damage.
      The complement activation generates proinflammatory mediators which amplifies the tissue
      damage and the inflammation.

      Glucocorticoid administration prior to surgery is thought to effectively reduce the
      inflammatory response and the activation of the complement system. The effect of
      glucocorticoids on specific complement markers after surgery is unknown and calls for further
      investigation.
