      compulsions (repetitive ritualistic behaviour). Core symptoms of OCD cause remarkable
      distress and often perceived as inappropriate. The prevalence of OCD in the general
      population is estimated between 1% and 3%. It is a psychiatric illness that can lead to
      chronic functional impairment. Treatment options for OCD include cognitive behavioural
      therapy (CBT) and/or pharmacotherapy. Even when the best treatment options are used,
      approximately 10% of these patients remain severely affected and are considered
      therapy-refractory resulting in marked suffering and impairment in self-care, work and social
      life. More recently, deep brain stimulation (DBS) has been investigated as a therapy for
      refractory OCD, and the procedure was granted a limited humanitarian device exemption by the
      FDA in 2009. For these patients, deep brain stimulation (DBS), a neurosurgical treatment that
      involves stereotactic implantation of electrodes in specific deep-seated brain regions, has
      emerged as a new treatment option.
