      allows them the chance to conceive. Women between the ages of 18 and 45 years with minimal to
      mild endometriosis and pelvic pain of greater than three months duration, will be enrolled
      into a 6-month prospective phase 2 clinical trial.

      Comparison: Following enrollment, one week after the last menstrual period, eligible
      participants will be randomized to a 6-month treatment of rosiglitazone 4 mg/day. Efficacy
      comparisons will be made utilizing visual analog scale diaries, Short-Form McGill Pain
      Questionnaires and physical component summary scores of the SF-36. Secondary measures will
      include cytokine quantification, proteomics, gene array analyses and serious adverse effects.
