      a high risk of pain, trophic changes and autonomic dysfunction. There is currently no
      effective treatment for diabetic neuropathy, and good glycemic control is the only way to
      minimize the risk of occurrence. Clearly, it would be desirable to prevent, impede, or
      reverse the disrupting and often life-threatening manifestations of peripheral neuropathy by
      stimulating growth or regeneration of peripheral nerve axons.
