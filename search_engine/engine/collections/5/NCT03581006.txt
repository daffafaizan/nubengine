      before and after 6-month intervention with calorie restricted Mediterranean diet to: 1)
      determine the effects of a technology assisted calorie restricted diet on metabolic risk and
      lung function; 2) determine differences between usual care and intervention group using
      genomics and metabolomics that may be targetable markers for further evaluation; 3) quantify
      the metabolome and evaluate pre/post changes in BMI, FEV1, FeNo, vascular stiffness, and
      overall quality of life; and 4) explore dietary modification as treatment of WTC-LI. The
      biomarker profile of the cohort control will be useful for discovering biomarker associations
      with other disease manifestations such as: bronchial wall thickening on CT, obstruction on
      FEV1 /FVC ratio, bronchodilator response, methacholine reactivity, and other definitions of
      loss of FEV 1 . This cohort control will be an asset to future studies.
