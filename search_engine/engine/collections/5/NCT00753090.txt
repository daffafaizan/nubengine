    
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Vanguardâ„¢ Deep Dish Rotating
      Platform Knee (mobile bearing knee) as compared to Vanguard Cruciate Retaining Knee (fixed
      bearing knee). This trial will be conducted as the randomised, controlled study.

      Implant loosening and polyethylene wear in fixed-bearing knee prostheses were recognized as
      major causes of late failure. The mobile bearing knee have the theoretical advantages of
      potentially minimizing the polyethylene wear and reducing implant to bone interface stress in
      order to reduce the incidence of implant loosening. Therefore, the aims of this study are to
      prove the Vanguard deep dish rotating platform knee is at least as effective in clinical
      outcome as the widely used current design of knee replacement and better in long term
      survivorship.

      The efficacy of the device will be determined by the relief of pain, restoration of function
      and range of motion. The durability of device will be determined by the absence of
      revision/removal and radiological integrity. To assess the safety of the device, all post
      operative complications will be recorded either device related or otherwise. Patient
      satisfaction as determined by answers to patient outcome questionnaires (Oxford Knee Score,
      WOMAC and Lower Extremity Activity Scale).
