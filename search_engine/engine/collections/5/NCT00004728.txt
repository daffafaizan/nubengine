      consists of using medications to prevent blood clots from forming. Currently, the best
      medication to use in this situation is unknown. The purpose of this study is to compare the
      effectiveness of two different medications, warfarin or aspirin, for the prevention of stroke
      due to narrowing of one of the large arteries in the brain. Patients must have experienced a
      recent transient ischemic attack (TIA) or mild stroke. Stroke of this type is thought to
      occur more often in minorities.
