    
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the leading diseases causing mortality
      and morbidity, despite advanced pharmacotherapy and therapeutic management. Although COPD
      primarily affects the lungs, it also implies extrapulmonary manifestations, such as
      nutritional depletion, skeletal muscle dysfunction, and abnormal respiratory muscles.

      Pulmonary rehabilitation is widely used to treat COPD patients and it has been shown that
      pulmonary rehabilitation should be implemented at all COPD stages, bringing them benefits in
      terms of improved exercise capacity, symptoms, and quality of life.
