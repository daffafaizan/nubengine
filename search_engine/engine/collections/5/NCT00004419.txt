      subcutaneous recombinant human insulin-like growth factor I (rhIGF-I) on day 7.

      Patients receive rhIGF-I twice daily 15-30 minutes before breakfast and dinner, and are
      hospitalized for the first week of therapy. Patients return for an outpatient exam on day 19
      of rhIGF-I therapy. Approximately 30 days into the therapy, patients are readmitted to the
      clinical center for repeat screening tests. Patients then receive maintenance therapy of
      rhIGF-I for up to 6-12 months. A washout period follows the maintenance therapy phase.

      Patients are followed weekly, biweekly, or monthly depending on blood glucose response of
      patients off rhIGF-I therapy. Weekly phone contact with study coordinator is mandatory during
      this time.
