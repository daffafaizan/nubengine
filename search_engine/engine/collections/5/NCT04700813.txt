    
      Procedure and methodology: during a follow-up visit to their usual diabetist (at CHU de
      Liège), we will send each potential volunteer, fulfilling the conditions for inclusion, an
      information and consent form relating to genetic analyzes. Participation in the protocol is
      voluntary, after detailed information and discussion with the patient. Once the participation
      agreement has been obtained, we will take a blood sample, which will be the only sample from
      the entire study.

      All the tubes will be centrifuged, decanted, separated and frozen at -80 °C at the CHU de
      Liège for constitution of a serum bank on site, and of a DNA library at UMR8199.

      For DNA extraction, samples will be sent at -80 ° C. DNA extraction will be automated
      (Autopure, Qiagen).

      After DNA extraction, the genes involved in monogenic diabetes (Table 1) will be sequenced
      via Twist or NimbleGen capture in combination with Illumina sequencing (NovaSeq 6000), as
      recommended by Twist, NimbleGen and Illumina. The target will also include genes involved in
      the rare forms of metabolic diseases associated with diabetes: obesity, metabolic syndrome,
      familial hypercholesterolemia, kidney disease, cardiovascular disease and non-alcoholic fatty
      liver disease. This will help refine the patient's phenotypic understanding and improve their
      care.

      Following sequencing, mutations will be detected and annotated according to the
      bioinformatics protocol implemented and optimized in UMR8199 since 2009.

      Clinical and medical data will also be collected: weight, height, blood pressure, drug
      treatment, medical and surgical history as well as any other important medical information
      concerning the subject of the project. Data concerning the patient's ethnic origin will also
      be collected.
