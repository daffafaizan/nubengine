      of the lung, or significant air leaks that are likely to become prolonged air leaks following
      lobectomy, segmentectomy, or lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS). An air leak present on
      postoperative day 7 is considered prolonged unless present only during forced exhalation or
      cough. An air leak present on day 5 should be considered for treatment if it is: 1)
      continuous, 2) present during normal inhalation phase of inspiration, or 3) present upon
      normal expiration and accompanied by subcutaneous emphysema or respiratory compromise. IBV
      Valve System use is limited to 6 weeks per prolonged air leak.
