        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of temperature-sensitive liposomal doxorubicin
           (ThermoDox™) when used in combination with local-regional hyperthermia in women with
           locally recurrent breast cancer.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of ThermoDox™ when used in multiple-course dosing.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temperature-sensitive liposomal doxorubicin
      (ThermoDox™).

      Patients receive ThermoDox™ IV over 30 minutes immediately followed by hyperthermia to the
      chest wall/axilla over 1-2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21-35 days for up to 6
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ThermoDox™ (with or without standard-dose
      granulocyte colony-stimulating factor [G-CSF] support) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      is determined. The MTD without G-CSF support is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). At least 6 patients are
      treated at the MTD. If the only DLT is neutropenia in > 1 of 6 patients treated at any dose
      level, then additional cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ThermoDox™ with
      G-CSF support (standard-dose G-CSF or standard-dose pegfilgrastim) until the MTD is
      determined. The MTD with G-CSF support is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3
      or 2 of 6 patients experience DLT after the addition of G-CSF support.

      Quality of life and pain are assessed at baseline, prior to courses 3 and 5, and at 21-42
      days after completion of therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
