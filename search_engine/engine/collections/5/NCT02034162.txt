      participant receives), randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance), multi-center,
      parallel-group study (each group of participants will be treated at the same time) to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of mebendazole (a drug currently being investigated for
      Helminth gastrointestinal infections) compared with placebo (an inactive substance that is
      compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial) in
      children (including pre-school and school-aged children) with Helminth infections. The study
      will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase, and a
      post-treatment (or follow-up) phase. A pharmacokinetic (explores what a drug does to the
      body) open-label substudy (asks a separate research question from the parent study while
      using the same participant population but does not contribute to the parent study's
      objectives) will be included in the parent study to measure the level of mebendazole in the
      blood. Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study. Each participant will take
      part in the study for approximately 30 days.
