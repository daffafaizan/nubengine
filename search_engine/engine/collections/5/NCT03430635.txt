      preoperatively staged with ¹¹C-choline PET/CT. This metabolic imaging modality was performed
      in addition to standard abdominal CT or magnetic resonance imaging. Several PET/CT parameters
      were recorded and analyzed. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify
      whether those PET/CT parameters could be predictors of overall survival (OS) and disease-free
      survival (DFS) of HCC patients.
