      infection who are not immediately eligible for protocol enrollment but who are likely, within
      the next year, to become candidates for protocol entry. It will also enable the Pediatric
      Branch to follow children who present with either clinical findings that constitute important
      educational experiences for the NCI trainees or who have unique or unusual medical problems
      that are likely to benefit from the research expertise of the NCI.
