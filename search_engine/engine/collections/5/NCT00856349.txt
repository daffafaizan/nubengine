      and decrease quality of life. Previous studies have shown that device programming and
      features can safely reduce the number of shocks patients receive. This study will explore the
      extent to which physicians use these programming and features. It will determine whether
      repeat and frequent awareness to how they program their own subjects and the programming
      trends of all enrolled subjects will change their programming patterns. This will be
      accomplished by understanding physicians' device programming behaviors and providing reports
      as a tool to help physicians manage their subjects and provide shock reduction programming
      recommended by previous publications.
