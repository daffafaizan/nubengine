      The study is a three period observational study of biomarkers of zinc status before, during
      and after zinc depletion. The entire dietary study will take 24 days composed of three parts:

        -  Dietary Acclimation (Phase 1): 7 days

        -  Dietary Zinc Restriction (Phase 2): 10 days

        -  Dietary Zinc Repletion (Phase 3): 7 days

      The dietary treatments and all blood draws will be carried out in the General Clinical
      Research Center (GCRC) at University of Florida. Previous research from has shown that both
      metallothionein gene expression and specific zinc transporter genes in blood leukocyte
      subsets are directly proportional to dietary zinc intake. By using cDNA array analysis and
      quantitative PCR technology with blood RNA, those genes most sensitive to zinc nutrition will
      be identified for the purpose of developing zinc status assessment methods on how zinc
      functions in human biology.

      Additionally, buccal mucosal cells will be collected in the GCRC by using swabs, i.e., in a
      noninvasive manner, to further characterize the expression pattern of the genes under study.
      This method has the potential for nutrition studies in the field (international nutrition,
      etc).
