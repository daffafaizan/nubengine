    
      Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a highly disabling group of conditions including
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), acute and chronic interstitial pneumonias, connective
      tissue diseases and sarcoidosis. People with ILD frequently experience breathlessness on
      exertion, which limits their ability to undertake daily activities and reduces health-related
      quality of life.Available treatments for ILD have proved largely ineffective, offering no
      improvement in survival and demonstrating only limited impact on quality of life.

      Aims of the Research

        1. Evaluate the effects of Pulmonary Rehabilitation on exercise capacity and quality of
           life in patients with ILD

        2. Determine the physiological response to Pulmonary Rehabilitation in patients with ILD

        3. Determine the relationship between the aetiology and severity of ILD and the effects of
           Pulmonary Rehabilitation.

      Comparisons: 8 weeks exercise training compared to control group (maximal exercise capacity,
      functional exercise capacity, dyspnoea, quality of life).
