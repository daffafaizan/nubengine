      pain in the elderly is critical in view of its high prevalence, negative impact on quality of
      life and the treatment risks associated with chronic medication use. This is particularly
      germane to the veteran population, with a prevalence of lower back pain in excess of 40%. In
      1998, published guidelines from the American Geriatric Society listed chiropractic management
      among the non-pharmacologic strategies for treating chronic pain symptoms in older adults. A
      recent study showed that a substantial number of older patients who received chiropractic
      care were less likely to be hospitalized, less likely to have used a nursing home, more
      likely to report a better health status, more likely to exercise vigorously and more likely
      to be mobile in the community. Patients undergoing chiropractic care have also reported
      greater satisfaction as compared to standard medical care. Despite the general clinical
      acceptance of chiropractic care and satisfaction with chiropractic services, evidence on the
      potential benefit and safety of chiropractic management of lower back pain in older adults is
      lacking. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of chiropractic
      management in older adults with chronic lower back pain, by comparing spinal manipulation to
      a sham intervention.
