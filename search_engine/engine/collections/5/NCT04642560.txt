    
      It is an observational, prospective, multicenter, French study in pediatric or neonatal
      resuscitation. Any child hospitalized in pediatric or neonatal resuscitation and benefiting
      from the establishment of antibiotic treatment for an episode of suspected bacterial
      infection, community or nosocomial, is eligible.

      The practitioner in charge of the child fills out a standardized questionnaire (CRF)
      collecting information concerning the primary and secondary judgment criteria. The day of the
      start of antibiotic therapy at doses adapted to the suspected bacterial infection corresponds
      to D0. No additional intervention is performed solely for the purposes of the study.
