      FDA-approved for use in allergic asthma, though its clinical role is not precisely defined.
      It binds IgE on the same site of the Fc domain as the high affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI), and
      therefore, blocks the interaction between IgE and mast cells or basophils. It, therefore, may
      be used as a mechanistic tool in the study of IgE. As IgE levels are reduced with omalizumab,
      FcεRI expression on human basophils is reduced. This reduction of basophil receptors and
      allergen induced activation is pronounced within 7 days of the initial administration and is
      reversible once omalizumab administration is discontinued. The omalizumab-induced reductions
      in mast cell FcεRI expression and function is unchanged at day 7 and significantly reduced by
      day 70. These changes were based upon intravenously administered omalizumab at a dose of 0.03
      mg/kg/IU IgE/mL in a total of three subjects. We propose to exploit the kinetics of faster
      omalizumab effects on circulating basophils relative to tissue mast cells to elucidate the
      role of the basophil versus mast cell activation in nasal airway allergen challenge, which
      has not been studied to date.
