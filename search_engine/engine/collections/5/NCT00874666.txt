      and garlic foods is highly questionable and unpredictable from in vitro tests, due to
      dependence upon alliinase activity under conditions that challenge alliinase activity (heat,
      gastric acid, intestinal proteases). It is likely that garlic supplement manufacturing
      procedures and coatings, meal conditions when supplements are consumed (high or low protein),
      and garlic food preparation conditions (temperature, surface area) will greatly affect
      allicin bioavailability. Such variability may account for some of the many conflicts seen in
      clinical trials on cardiovascular disease risk factors.

      To resolve these issues, this study will determine the actual bioavailability of allicin from
      several types of garlic supplements and garlic foods under various conditions.
      Bioavailability will be determined by measuring the area under the 32-hour curve for breath
      concentrations of allyl methyl sulfide, the main metabolite allicin.
