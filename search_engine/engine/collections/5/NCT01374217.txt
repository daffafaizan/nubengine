      tadalafil with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) or BiRd. 19 patients on Rd or BiRd will be
      treated with tadalafil for a minimum of 6 months. The investigational drug will be
      discontinued if there is evidence of disease progression as defined by the International
      Uniform Response criteria [1]. For responding patients (patients who have a CR, VGPR, PR or
      SD), the therapy will be continued until progression or intolerable adverse effects. Blood
      and bone marrow will be collected for various studies as detailed in section 14.10. Clinical
      response will be monitored every month during the study.
