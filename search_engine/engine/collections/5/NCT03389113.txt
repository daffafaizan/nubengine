      strength and postural control. However, there has not yet been a report on the cortical
      activity changes induced by whole body vibration exercise in brain injury patients with
      minimally conscious state.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups. One group will go through whole
      body vibration with exercise and the other will only perform exercise. The primary outcome
      measurement of this study was cerebral cortex activity based on changes in oxygenated
      hemoglobin concentration using functional near-infrared spectroscopy. Behavioral assessment
      were performed using the coma recovery scale-revised and modified ashworth scale.
