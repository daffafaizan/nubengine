5514. the incorporation of sv40 genetic material into adenovirus 7 asmeasured by intranuclear synthesis of sv40 tumor antigenthe l.l. strain of adenovirus 7, free ofdetectable infectious sv40 virus, inducedsv40 tumour antigen, demonstrable byfluorescent antibody staining, in green mon-key kidney, rabbit kidney, hamster embryoand human embryo kidney cell cultures.in green monkey and human cell culturesthere was a cytopathic effect and morecells contained the sv40 tumour antigenthan in the other types of culture.adenovirus 7 viral antiserum neutralizedthe sv40 tumour antigen inducingability of the l.l. strain virus but anti-sv40monkey serum and serum from sv40tumour bearing hamsters did not.  anadenovirus 7 preparation propagatedexclusively in human tissue did not inducethe sv40 tumour antigen.  the sv40tumour antigen was entirely localised withinthe cell nuclei and appeared to betransmitted to daughter cells during mitosis.
