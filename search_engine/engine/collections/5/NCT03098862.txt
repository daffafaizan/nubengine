      scope. There were over 28,000 cases and 11,000 deaths. During and following the outbreak, it
      became evident that spectrum of disease being observed in the communities and the Ebola
      treatment units was much broader than previously thought. In this study, we aim to identify
      host genetic factors that underlie the observed variation in disease susceptibility,
      severity, clinical sequelae, viral persistence, and serological response. We will enroll EVD
      survivors, close contacts of survivors, EVD healthcare workers, and individuals who have
      received investigational Ebola vaccines (population controls), and collect a blood sample,
      HIV/syphilis infection status, demographics, and medical history from participants.

      Most subjects will complete study participation after a single study visit; subjects having
      Ebola serology and/or HIV/syphilis testing done as part of this study will return for one or
      two follow-up visits to receive their HIV/syphilis test results and post-test counseling and
      Ebola serology results. We will genotype participants and compare results between cohorts to
      address the study aims. This may provide insight into pathogenesis and host immunity and
      potentially suggest new methods of intervention.
