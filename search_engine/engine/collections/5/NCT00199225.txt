      analysis and interpretation of clinical studies to assess the potential for delaying cardiac
      repolarisation. This paper recommends to perform a 'through Qt/QTc' study to expand ECGs
      safety evaluation during later stages of drug development. It was recomended that the study
      was randomized, blind and placebo controlled. Moreover, as a high sensitivy is necessary in
      order to detect differences in the QTc measure, it was essential a positive control included.
      On that basis, the positive control should be well-characterized and consistently produce an
      effect corresponding to the largest change in the QT/QTc interval that is currently viewed as
      clinically not important to detect (a mean change of around 5 ms. Because of this, we decide
      select as positive control: moxifloxacin, used in the most of similar phase I clinical
      trials.

      In these type of studies, as recommended by the guidelines, there should be a caracterization
      to ensure that the dose-response and generally the concentration-response relationship for
      QT/QTc prolongation, including exploration of concentrations that are higher than those
      achieved following the therapeutic doses. So, thererfore, we decided use 100 mg/daY (10 times
      the therapeutic dose) as supratherapeutic dose to be administered.

      We decide propose a new phase I study as recommended guidelines (a single-blind, randomised,
      placebo and active-controlled, parallel design). With this, we've tried complet the
      rupatadine effects over QTc and another electrocardiographic parameters and valued the
      risk-benefit relationship for this new antiH1 and PAF antagonist
