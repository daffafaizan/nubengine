      weeks before their mandatory training they will be emailed with the study information leaflet
      and a link to a video which explains how to use Mednav. On the morning of the mandatory
      training/teaching they will be approached by the practice development midwife/Chief or
      Principle investigator who will give them a copy of the consent form and again the study
      information leaflet and show the Mednav video. Eligibility criteria will be checked and the
      study explained, before taking written informed consent.

      Participants will personally sign and date the consent form, before any study specific
      procedures are performed.

      Once the team is decided, the investigators will then randomise them to use of Mednav or no
      mednav, The participants will then undertake a simulated management of post partum
      haemorrhage which will be recorded for later review. Faculty will record the timing of
      completion of key technical skills.

      A team of 8 assessors will review these simulated scenario recordings. Assessors will
      complete validated questionnaires to assess teamwork. Assessors will be asked to complete a
      technical skills list, showing timing and completion of various technical aspects of managing
      post partum Haemorrhage.

      The end of the study will be when the required sample size has been recruited or significance
      found on interim data analysis.
