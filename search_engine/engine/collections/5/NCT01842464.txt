      anchored to the Arcus Tendinous Fascia Pelvis (ATFP) rather than to the Sacro-Spinous (SS)
      ligaments commonly used for the posterior compartment reconstruction. The SS ligament
      suspension for apical support mesh fixation is thought to yield higher and stronger anchoring
      point than the ATFP. The authors presumed that anterior mesh fixation to the sacro-spinous
      ligament are both, feasible and effective.
