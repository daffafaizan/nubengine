      to remedy musculoskeletal disorders in recent years. ESWT seems to be an effective treatment
      modality many different musculoskeletal conditions, including rotator cuff tendinopathies,
      calcifying tendinopathy of the shoulder, lateral epicondylitis, greater trochanteric pain
      syndrome, patellar tendinopathy, achilles tendinopathy, plantar fasciitis, and bone
      disorders. ESWT seems to have chondroprotective, anti-inflammatory, neovascularization,
      anti-apoptotic, and tissue regeneration effect on tissues which could be relevant in the
      treatment of OA.
