      diagnosis of Generalised Anxiety Disorders

      Main objective is to quantify the therapeutic benefit of a thermal cure on generalized
      anxiety disorders and to understand the psycho-biological substrates of this improvement.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  A decrease of Insula activity at rest during the answers to aversive pictures and during
           the task of subjective measurement of heartbeat.

        -  A decrease of sensibility to emotional interference by subliminal presentation of
           emotional words thanks to a lexical task and a color recognition task associated to
           simultaneous measurement of physiological indicator of emotional activity ( dermal
           resistance)
