    
      Rationale:

      The combined data from 3 studies outside the Unites States investigating the Lung Volume
      Reduction Coil system (RePneu LVRC) showed statistically significant improvements in
      pulmonary function, exercise capacity and quality of life at both 6-Months and 12-Months post
      treatment. 24 months post treatment the improved pulmonary function and exercise capacity are
      slightly decreasing. Retreating the patient with the LVR coil system in other parts of the
      lung could potentially lead to new improvements in lung function, dyspnea, exercise capacity
      and quality of life and may reduce the rate of decline.

      Objective:

      To investigate the safety and feasibility of re-treating patients with severe Chronic
      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with the RePneu LVRC system.

      Study design:

      This study is a non randomized uncontrolled intervention.

      Study population: Patients with severe emphysema who have previously been treated with the
      lung volume reduction coil system and significantly improved in lung function, exercise
      capacity or quality of life, 6 months after the treatment.

      Intervention:

      Patients will receive a lung volume reduction coil treatment by bronchoscopy.

      Main study parameter:

      The safety objective of this study is to identify the potential number and type of
      device-related and procedure-related adverse effects.

      Secondary study parameters:

      Lung function

        -  Change in RV, 6 months following treatment

        -  Change in RV/TLC ratio, 6 months following treatment

        -  Changes in FEV1 and FVC, 2 and 6 months following treatment

      Quality of life

        -  Change in the SGRQ score, 2 and 6 months following treatment

        -  Change in the CCQ score, 2 and 6 months following treatment

      Functional measures

        -  Change in the mMRC score, 2 and 6 months following treatment

        -  Change in the 6MWD, 2 and 6 months following treatment
