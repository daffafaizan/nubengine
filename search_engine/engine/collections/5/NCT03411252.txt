      sphincter (LES) and loss of esophageal peristalsis which leads to dysphagia. Standard of care
      for achalasia includes endoscopic management (dilation and injection of injection of
      botulinum toxin) and surgery, however both of these options carry procedural risks, may lose
      efficacy over time and many patients are not appropriate candidates for these treatment
      options. Unfortunately, there are limited oral medications for patients with achalasia.
      Mirabegron is an oral beta-3 agonist currently FDA approved for overactive bladder that works
      by relaxing the bladder muscles. Beta-3 receptors have also been identified in the LES with
      stimulation leading to LES relaxation in preclinical studies. Through a proof of concept
      pilot study, the investigators aim to evaluate the effect of mirabegron in patients with
      achalasia via high resolution manometry and a validated dysphagia scale.
