      treatment for prostate cancer can decrease the number of circulating prostate cancer cells.
      Radium 223 kills prostate cancer cells by damaging their DNA. Other than looking at the
      changes in the number of circulating prostate cancer cells before and after Radium 223,
      researchers would also like to look at the changes in a DNA damage marker, called gamma H2AX,
      in the circulating prostate cancer cells before and after treatment with Radium 223.
      Assessing the DNA damage marker gamma H2AX is investigational. It is performed in the same
      tube of blood that is used for assessing the changes in the number of circulating prostate
      cancer cells.
