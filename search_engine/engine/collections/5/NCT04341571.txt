    
      A randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial in 30 patients between 31 to 60 years of
      age with a diagnosis of prediabetes (IFG 100 a 125 mg/dL, IGT 140 a 199 mg/dL, HbA1c 5.7 a
      6.4%) in accordance with the American Diabetes Association without treatment.

      Patients with one or more of the following criteria will be excluded: History of liver,
      kidney or heart disease; systolic blood pressure ≥ 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure ≥ 90
      mmHg, HbA1c ≥6.5%, triglycerides ≥ 400 mg/dL, total cholesterol ≥240 mg/dL; pregnancy or
      lactation; consumption of medications or supplements with effects on glucose levels.

      They will be assigned randomly two groups of 15 patients; one of the groups will receive 750
      mg of metformin twice at day (before breakfast and dinner) for 13 weeks.

      The other group will receive 400 mg of probiotics 1 time at day (before breakfast) and
      placebo pill (before dinner) for 13 weeks.

      They will be measured fasting blood glucose, postprandial glucose levels and glycosylated
      hemoglobin, and will be calculated area under curve of glucose an insulin, total insulin
      secretion (Insolinogenic index), first-phase of insulin secretion (Strumvoll index) and
      insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index).

      This protocol It´s already approved by the local ethics committee and written informed
      consent it´s going to be obtained from all volunteers.

      Statistical analysis will be presented through measures of central tendency and dispersion,
      average and deviation standard for quantitative variables; frequencies and percentage for
      qualitative variable. Will be used Wilcoxon range test for identification of differences
      between baseline and final evaluation of each intervention group, Mann-Whitney U Test and
      Wilcoxon Test for the within-groups differences. It will be considered satitistical
      significance p >0.05.
