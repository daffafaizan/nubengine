      clearing, foreign body sensation, throat pain, sensation of excessive phlegm, and difficulty
      swallowing. A significant minority also present with GERD, rhinosinusitis-induced post-nasal
      drainage, direct allergic effect, and smoking issues.

      Amitriptyline is commonly used for mental/mood problems, but is also prescribed to treat
      chronic laryngitis because some investigators suggest a neuropathic etiology for idiopathic
      chronic laryngitis. No trials have compared any treatment for chronic laryngitis to placebo
      and it is unknown if currently used therapies for chronic laryngitis are effective.

      At the baseline visit, subjects will be assigned at random to amitriptyline or placebo, which
      they will take for 4 weeks each. Subjects will be seen in the clinic at baseline and after 10
      weeks. Improvement will be measured using standardized symptom scales, and a self-reported
      subjective improvement percentage.
