      randomized to NS2359 and 40 to placebo. The primary hypothesis is: more NS2359-treated
      subjects (compared to placebo-treated subjects) will achieve 3 consecutive weeks of cocaine
      abstinence, as measured by urine benzoylecgonine (BE) assay, during the last three weeks of
      the trial. The study is 9 weeks: one week of screening, followed by an 8-week double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial. All subjects will receive weekly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)
      to encourage abstinence during their 3 times weekly clinic visits. Investigators expect ~ 20%
      dropout rate, based on our recent CA clinical trials (eg, Kampman et al, 2015 and 2013), so
      80 randomized patients will yield ~ 64 study completers. There will be a 1 month start-up
      period, followed by 20 months of recruitment for the study. The 1 month start-up period will
      allow for training of staff, preparation of study capsules, placement of study
      advertisements, etc. Penn IRB approval has been obtained. There will be a 2-month termination
      period to allow the final patients to complete the study. Data cleaning, statistical analyses
      and preparation of reports will be done in the final two months. Based on recent cocaine
      pharmacotherapy trials conducted by our team, monthly enrollment of ~4 CA participants
      (respondents to flyers and advertisements) is feasible.

      Recruitment will occur at the University of Pennsylvania's Treatment Research Center (TRC),
      led by Kyle Kampman, MD, and Wade Berrettini, MD, PhD, Professors of Psychiatry at Penn. At
      the TRC, CA patients are respondents to advertisements for free treatment of CA. The
      ethnicity is 90% African-American, 9 % European-American, 70% male, mean age 47 (+/- 12).
