      (Day 1). The patch will be worn for 7 days during which time, safety assessments, pain
      scores, mucositis scores, PK sampling & vital signs will be assessed on each day. After patch
      removal subjects will continue with these assessments on a daily basis until Day 12. The
      subject will then be followed up for 10 days (to Day 22) to collect information on
      ongoing/new SAEs/AEs.
