      (n=29; 97%) or left thoracotomy (n=1; 3%) and cardiopulmonary bypass with deep hypothermic
      cardiac arrest were recruited. All patients were operated under deep hypothermia and
      circulatory arrest, with optional selective cerebral perfusion during circulatory arrest.
      Active patient recruitment started from September 2007 and ended in May 2011. All patients
      were monitored with a bilateral fronto-temporal four channel abbreviated EEG, a bilateral
      frontal two-channel near-infrared spectroscopy, postoperative transcranial Doppler ultrasound
      evaluation of median artery circulation and postoperative biochemical neuromarkers. The study
      montage was set up by a dedicated research nurse, who also performed the transcranial Doppler
      measurements. The neuromonitoring data were not used at the time to guide therapeutic
      decisions, with the exception of near-infrared spectroscopy monitoring.
