fine structure of staphylococccal l-forms.l forms of staph. aureus and bacterial cells wereprocessed by the same technique for electron microscopy.ultrathin sections allowed comparison of structural unitsand indicated that staphylococcal l form units of allsizes lack the rigid cell wall and the compact, fibrillarnuclear area of bacterial cells.  the l form units arebound by a typical 'trilamellar' membrane comparableto that described for mycoplasma species.  nuclearareas in staphylococcal l forms present a diffuse appearanceand could not be correlated with size of anyparticular structural unit.  many small units were seenwithin large bodies and possibly are involved in the reproductiveprocess.  no evidence of division by formationof septa or by pinching off of cytoplasmic fragmentswas obtained from the electron micrographs.
