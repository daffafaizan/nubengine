    
      Eligible patients can be randomize in the trial after his consent form has been signed, and
      after all inclusion and non-inclusion criteria have been checked.

      The randomisation will result in the allocation of arm A (ADT +docetaxel), arm B (ADT
      +docetaxel +Abiraterone), arm C (ADT +docetaxel +radiotherapy) or arm D (ADT +docetaxel
      +Abiraterone +radiotherapy) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio.

      The randomization will be stratified (by minimization) according to:

        -  enrolment center,

        -  performance status (0 vs. 1-2)

        -  disease extent: lymph nodes only vs. bone (with or without lymph nodes) vs. presence of
           visceral metastases.

      CRPC is defined by cancer progression (either a confirmed PSA rise or a radiological
      progression) with serum testosterone being at castrated levels (<0.50 ng/mL).

      When the CRPC stage is reached, castration (either LHRH agonist or LHRH antagonist) will be
      maintained in all patients.

      Investigators will be free to manage patients reaching CRPC at their discretion (using for
      example docetaxel, zoledronic acid, denosumab, sipuleucel-T, radium-223, cabazitaxel, etc)
      according to local uses and guidelines.

      Abiraterone may be used in arm A and C if abiraterone has become the standard treatment for
      CRPC when this stage is reached.
