    
      This is a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, crossover study. The investigators will
      recruit women with PCOS in ages 40-49 yo. Subjects will be randomized to either receive
      metformin (2000 mg daily) or low dose oral contraceptives (OCs: 20 mcg ethinyl
      estradiol/norethindrone acetate 1mg) for a total of 6 months, and they will crossover to the
      other treatment for the following 6 months. Subjects will have the following assessed at
      baseline and 6 months after each study medication: blood pressure, weight, waist-to-hip ratio
      (WHR), average intermenstrual cycle length (in the previous 3 months), Ferriman-Gallwey score
      (as a measure of hirsutism), total testosterone (T), sex hormone binding globulin, calculated
      free T, fasting insulin, fasting glucose, 2-h glucose (during oral glucose tolerance test),
      Matsuda index, HgA1c, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, estimated
      cardiovascular risk (Framingham risk score), health-related quality of life using both PCOS
      questionnaire (PCOSQ) and the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36), and severity of anxiety using
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire. For safety surveillance, the
      investigators will measure electrolyte levels, renal function, liver function, and pregnancy
      tests immediately before study mediation initiation and every 3 months. For statistical
      analysis, per PCOSQ domain, the post-treatment QoL scores will be analyzed via a linear mixed
      model (LMM), in which the LMM will be specified in accordance with a 2 treatment by 2 period
      crossover design. The investigators determined that if 73 subjects complete the study, the
      investigators expect to have at least an 80% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis that QoL
      is inferior with metformin therapy vs. OCs.
