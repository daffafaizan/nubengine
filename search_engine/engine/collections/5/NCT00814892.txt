      Primary

        -  Determine the proportion of patients with androgen-independent prostate cancer who are
           progression-free at one year after treatment with DC-APCC.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate treatment toxicity.

        -  Evaluate time to prostate-cancer specific mortality.

        -  Evaluate progression-free survival.

        -  Evaluate time to PSA progression, and duration of PSA-based response.

        -  Evaluate quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo standard leukapheresis to harvest peripheral blood mononuclear
      cells for dendritic cell vaccine preparation and will receive the APCC vaccine and autologous
      dendritic cells derived from CD14-positive myeloid peripheral blood cells ID in every 2 weeks
      for the first 2 treatments (cycle 1 and 2), and then every 4 weeks therafter for up to 14
      administrations in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The first
      four patients will be observed for four weeks following the third DC-APCC vaccination to
      assess toxicity, the enrollment of patients will continue if toxicity related events not
      present.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for translational studies. Samples are
      measured for a number of immune parameters by quantifying T-cell and dentritic cell
      populations by analysis of surface marker molecules by flow cytometry, T-cell proliferation
      assay, non-specific cytokine release, lysate-specific cytokine release, and cytokine
      expression measured by cytometric bead array and qPCR.

      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires periodically.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study.
