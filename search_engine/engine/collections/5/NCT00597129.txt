      patients with locally advanced and/or metastatic pancreatic cancer. The primary objective is
      to determine the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 90Y-hPAM4
      in this population. Secondary objectives include the assessment of tumor targeting,
      biodistribution, organ dosimetry and pharmacokinetics (PK) of 90Y-hPAM4 as determined by
      pre-therapy administration of 111In-hPAM4, the assessment of the antigenicity of 90Y-hPAM4,
      as determined by development of human anti-humanized antibodies (HAHA), and to obtain
      preliminary information on the efficacy of single dose 90Y-hPAM4 in this patient population.
