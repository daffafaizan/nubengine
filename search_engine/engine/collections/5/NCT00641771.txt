      citrate-malate, will be administered throughout the study at an individualized dose
      supplementing the patient's daily dietary calcium intake to a total of approximately 1200 mg.
      At the end of the stabilization period, baseline calcium absorption will be determined and
      patients will be randomized to receive either MK0217A, or matching placebo once weekly for 4
      weeks.
