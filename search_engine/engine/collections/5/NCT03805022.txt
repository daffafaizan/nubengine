           chemotherapy + surgery +/- radiotherapy)

        -  Arm B: experimental arm (6 cycles of neoadjuvant doxorubicin and ifosfamide based
           chemotherapy + surgery +/- radiotherapy)

      For low-risk CINSARC patients, this a multicenter prospective cohort with treatment at the
