    
      Primary objectives

      1. To determine the safety and feasibility of adoptive transfer of T cells modified to
      express CD19-specific chimeric antigen receptor (CD19CAR) for treatment of leukemia and
      lymphoma

      Secondary objectives

        1. To measure the efficacy of anti-tumor responses after CD19CAR T cell infusion

        2. To determine if CD19CAR T cells engineered with 4-1BB signaling domain is superior to
           that with CD28 signaling domain for their homing and persistence after CD19CAR T cell
           infusion
