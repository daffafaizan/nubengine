      balloon used to deliver medication over time) containing pain medication and a continuous
      infusion catheter or "soaker" catheter (a tube which releases the pain medication through
      tiny holes in it, right at the site of injury) placed in the extrathoracic paraspinous space
      (a site in the back that is near the broken ribs) to create a continuous intercostal nerve
      block is relatively novel. Truitt and colleagues have published two studies evaluating the
      effectiveness of this approach. A pilot study on 30 patients was published in 2010 showing
      that placement of these catheters was a safe, viable and effective procedure, and resulted in
      decreased pain scores in rib fracture patients. A second study included 102 patients studied
      prospectively (from the time of admission to the hospital) comparing epidural anesthesia (an
      injection of anesthetic into the spine) with local catheter delivery in a non-randomized
      fashion in 2011. This approach is beginning to be more widely used, but has never been
      studied in a randomized fashion, and has never been compared to patient-controlled analgesia
      (PCA, delivery of a pain medication by the push of a button), commonly used at many
      hospitals.

      We hypothesize that accident patients with two or more rib fractures who receive pain control
      through the continuous infusion system will achieve improved pain control in a dose-dependent
      fashion, improved lung function, and therefore, will require less narcotic pain medication,
      achieve discharge criteria earlier and have a shorter hospital length of stay in comparison
      to patients treated with PCA alone.
