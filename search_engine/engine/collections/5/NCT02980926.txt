      length of the procedure. A short acting spinal is generally used for procedures lasting less
      than 90 minutes. A longer acting medication would be any that lasts longer than 90 minutes.
      These medications not only block the signals that travel along the pain nerves, they also
      prevent the signals that tell the patients muscles to move. This means that after a total
      knee replacement a patient may delayed in their ability to get up and start walking early
      after surgery. Walking early in the recovery has been shown to decrease the rate of pulmonary
      embolism and death. Ambulating early is also important to prevent loss of strength,
      constipation, pneumonia and urinary retention.
