      reduction on post-instrumentation and post-obturation pain in mandibular posterior teeth with
      symptomatic irreversible pulpitis and sensitivity to percussion treated in two visits. Three
      hundred and eight patients were included in this study. Inclusion criteria were posterior
      mandibular teeth having symptomatic irreversible pulpitis with sensitivity to percussion.
      Patients were randomized into two equal groups. In the intervention group, occlusal reduction
      was done, while, in the control group, the occlusal surfaces were left intact. Conventional
      endodontic treatment was performed in two visits using a rotary nickel-titanium system
      followed by the lateral-condensation obturation technique. Post-instrumentation pain was
      assessed after 6, 12, 24 and 48 hours following the first visit, and post-obturation pain
      after 6 and 12 hours following the second visit. Each patient received a pain diary to record
      their pain levels and rescue medication intake.
