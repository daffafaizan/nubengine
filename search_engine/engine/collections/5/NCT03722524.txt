    
      It is multicenter, observational, non-controlled, open-label program. The baseline
      characteristics will be analyzed in all the patients who started the treatment
      (intention-to-treat [ITT] population). In case of significant differences between two
      treatment groups, the baseline characteristics will be provided for both of them.

      Changes in the SBP and DBP (with the corresponding confidence intervals) will be assessed in
      the patients who completed the program without major deviations from protocol (per-protocol
      population [PPP]).

      The analysis of parameters with normal distribution will be performed using the Student's
      t-test for paired measurements; otherwise the non-parametric Wilcoxon test will be used. The
      percentage of patients with normalized BP, as well as the percentage of patients who
      responded to treatment (with 95% confidence intervals), will be calculated.

      Questionnaires: The score for each scale will be calculated as the sum of scores for
      questions constituting the scale.

      Assessment of the AEs will be carried out in all the patients who started the treatment (ITT
      population).
