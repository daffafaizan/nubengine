      younger than six years of age. Glycemic control using multiple daily injection (MDI) therapy
      can be difficult to achieve and maintain in the very young, especially in the immediate
      post-diagnosis period. This study evaluates early initiation of continuous subcutaneous
      insulin infusion (CSII) therapy in young children using a novel delivery method in the form
      of a self-contained, lightweight, and disposable insulin pump unit controlled with a wireless
      handheld device. The outcomes of interest are the feasibility, safety, and potential
      metabolic benefits of this approach. We will recruit 14 pediatric patients, aged one to ten
      years, from a pool of all children newly diagnosed with T1DM admitted to the Children's
      Hospital of Alabama to use the pump.General diabetes education and CSII-specific training
      will take place in a series of outpatient sessions with the PI and study nurse. Pump therapy
      will be initiated within two months of diagnosis providing that all requisite education and
      training has been successfully completed. Data will be collected for both study group and
      control group patients for six months via phone calls and monthly clinic visits. Areas which
      will be evaluated include glycemic control, residual endogenous insulin secretion, frequency
      of severe adverse events, parental distress, insulin needs, and physical growth. While
      initiating CSII in the immediate post-diagnosis period in this population may be initially
      time-intensive, it is anticipated that it will ultimately become time-saving because of the
      greater ease in blood sugar management.
