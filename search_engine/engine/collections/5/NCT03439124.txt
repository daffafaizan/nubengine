    
      This was a randomized, investigator-blind, active-controlled multi-center study to evaluate
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of ceftobiprole medocaril compared
      with IV standard-of-care cephalosporin treatment with or without vancomycin in pediatric
      patients aged 3 months to less than 18 years with HAP or CAP requiring hospitalization and
      therapy with IV antibiotics. Randomization was stratified by four age groups (3 months to < 2
      years; 2 years to < 6 years; 6 years to < 12 years; 12 years to < 18 years), and by diagnosis
      of HAP or CAP.
