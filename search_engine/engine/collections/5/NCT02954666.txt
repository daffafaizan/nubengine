      study will involve eight different steps, from the screening procedure through study
      completion: screening, enrollment, pharmacological testing, group allocation, preprocedural
      assessment, procedure, follow-up, study completion.The dedicated study nurse and the PI are
      responsible for recording all data from the trial on the case report forms (CRFs) and
      completing the study database. A dedicated independent physician will be responsible for the
      safety monitoring. The PI will permit inspection of the trial files and the database by
      national or international official controlling scientific authorities, if required. The PI
      will review and monitor completed CRFs and the database at regular intervals throughout the
      trial.
