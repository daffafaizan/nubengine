      endocrine therapy for PSA failure after radical prostatectomy. Patients who have PSA failure
      after radical prostatectomy under a diagnosis of localized prostate cancer (T1-2 N0M0) are
      randomized into treatment group of either radiotherapy followed by endocrine therapy or
      endocrine therapy alone. Urologic Oncology Study Group (UOSG) in the JCOG composed of 36
      specialized institutions will recruit 200 patients. The primary endpoint is time to treatment
      failure (TTF) of bicalutamide and secondary endpoints are TTF of protocol treatment,
      progression free survival, overall survival, adverse events and quality of life (QOL). The
      Clinical Trial Review Committee of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group (JCOG) approved the
      protocol on April 13, 2004, and the study was activated on May 17, 2004.
