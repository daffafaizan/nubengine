      observation that Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), and acute insulin resistance increase
      proinsulin concentrations led to the suggestion that a proinsulin/insulin ratio is a marker
      of β-cell integrity. However, proinsulin has a longer half-life (20-30min) than insulin
      (5min) and, unlike insulin, is not extracted by the liver. This limitation can only be
      overcome by direct and simultaneous measurement of insulin and proinsulin secretion. This
      experiment will measure in vivo proinsulin clearance so that proinsulin secretion can be
      calculated in people with differing degrees of glucose tolerance. It is also notable that
      subgroups of prediabetes differ in their fasting glucose and free fatty acid (FFA)
      concentrations. Whether short-term alteration of fasting glucose and FFA can alter subsequent
      prandial glucose metabolism is unknown. The loss of 1st phase insulin secretion(thought to
      represent release of pre-formed insulin granules) in T2DM can be partly restored by improved
      glycemic control although 2nd phase insulin secretion (thought to represent de novo synthesis
      of insulin) is unchanged. This experiment we will ascertain if changes in fasting FFA and
      glucose alter 1st and 2nd phase insulin secretion in people without diabetes.
