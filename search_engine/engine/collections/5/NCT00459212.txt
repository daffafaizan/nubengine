      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of GTI-2040 in patients with relapsed, refractory, or
      high-risk acute leukemia, high-grade myelodysplastic syndromes, or refractory or blastic
      phase chronic myelogenous leukemia.

      II. Assess the toxicity and efficacy of this drug in these patients. III. Assess plasma and
      intracellular pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously on days 1-4 and 15-18. Treatment repeats every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of GTI-2040 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected on days 1, 4, 15, and 19 of course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies.
      Samples are analyzed by proteomic assay, dCTP pool measurement, and real-time polymerase
      chain reaction for mRNA of RRM2, RRM1, and p53R2.
