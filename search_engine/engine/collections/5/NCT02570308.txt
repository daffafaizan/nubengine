      This is a Phase I/II study of IMCgp100 administered on a weekly basis with an intra-patient
      escalation dosing regimen. The intra-patient escalation occurs at the third weekly dose on
      Cycle 1 Day 15 (C1D15). According to this regimen, all patients in the trial will receive 2
      weekly doses of IMCgp100 at a dose level below the identified weekly recommended Phase II
      dose (RP2D-QW) and then a dose escalation will commence at the third weekly dose at C1D15
      with the goal to achieve a long-term dosing regimen at a dose higher than that identified for
      the straight weekly dosing regimen (RP2D-QW). The dose escalation will identify the
      intra-patient escalation regimen (RP2D-IE).

      The Phase I portion of the study was a standard 3+3 dose escalation design. The Phase 1
      portion of the study is now complete. The recommended Phase II dose of the intra-patient
      escalation dose regimen (RP2D-IE) was identified and the 2 expansion cohorts in metastatic
      uveal melanoma will be completed. The cohorts will enroll patients with metastatic uveal
      melanoma and are defined based on prior therapy The expansion portion will enroll
      approximately 150 patients.
