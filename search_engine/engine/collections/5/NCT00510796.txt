      cancer. Currently, women go through separate screening procedures. Endometrial biopsies are
      performed at a separate visit to the gynecologist, and patients are not sedated for the
      procedure. This study will involve performing an endometrial biopsy while you are sedated for
      your colonoscopy.

      Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood or urine pregnancy test before
      they can take part in this study.

      As part of the study, you will be asked about your past experience with endometrial biopsy
      and colonoscopy. You will be asked about your perception of pain, your expectations, and the
      benefits and barriers to the combined screening.

      You will then be sedated. The colonoscopy will be performed first by a gastroenterologist.
      This will be followed by the endometrial biopsy, which will be performed by a gynecologic
      oncologist.

      A telephone interview will be performed two weeks after this procedure. The interview will
      last about 15 minutes. You will be asked about your perception of pain and the benefits and
      barriers to the combined screening.

      This is an investigational study. A total of 50 women will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.
