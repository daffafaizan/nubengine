      anesthetized patients may participate in the study. Pencil-point spinal needle and
      bupivacaine (Marcaine Heavy Spinal 0.5 %) will be used.

      At the end of surgery ultrasound-guided regional block will be performed. Each patient will
      be randomly allocated to one of the treated group: transversus abdominis plane block (TAP) or
      quadratus lumborum (QL). Patients receive 0.2 mL of local anesthetic solution (0.375 %
      ropivacaine) on each side.

      Postoperative pain will be measured with VAS (visual-analog scale) 2, 4, 8, 12 and 24 hours
      after the end of the operation.

      Paracetamol, metamizole, ketoprofen may be given as required. Whenever pain exceeds 40 (VAS)
      5 mg of morphine will be given intravenously (maximum two dosages per day).

      1, 3, 6 months patients will be called to assess neuropathic pain. Neuropathic Pain Symptom
      Inventory (NPSI) will be used.
