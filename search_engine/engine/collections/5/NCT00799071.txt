      infections in children with CGD. Breakthrough fungal infections while on itra-conazole
      prophylaxis are described in literature indicating the need for a drug with a broader
      antifungal spectrum. PSZ might provide in this need. PSZ may also have a clinical safety and
      tolerability advantage over other antifungal agents. Because PSZ is metabolized through phase
      II glucuronidation it is less common to be subject to drug interactions. PSZ is known to be a
      CYP3A4 inhibitor, but does not inhibit other CYP enzymes, therefore it may exhibit fewer drug
      interactions as compared with other azole antifungal agents.

      Treatment of children is still off-label use. No data have been published to date on the
      exposure of PSZ in children under the age of 8 or in children with CGD. There is an urgent
      need to study the use of PSZ in these young children. Furthermore, the current regimen for
      antifungal prophylaxis requires a three times daily administration of PSZ. For this specific
      purpose less complex dosing schedules are warranted thus defining the need to examine a twice
      daily schedule.

      As the tolerability and pharmacokinetics are unknown in patients under the age of 8 years and
      only limited data are available for age groups 8 to 16 years, we propose a feasibility study
      of a twice daily regimen of PSZ prophylaxis in CGD patients. With this information available
      we can suggest a dosage for future prophylaxis in this patient group.
