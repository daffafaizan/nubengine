    
      Fifty highly trained endurance runners (men and women, age: 18-35 years) will be recruited
      for this study. The first testing session will serve as a screening tool to determine subject
      eligibility. Following the first testing sessions subjects will be divided into EIAH or
      non-EIAH groups based on SaO2 at VO2max (EIAH < 93%, non-EIAH > 95%; Dempsey and Wagner
      criteria). Subjects with intermediate SaO2 (93-95% at VO2max) values will be included in the
      study for correlational analyses only.

      All subjects will be advised orally, and in writing, as to the nature of the experiments and
      will give written, informed consent to the study protocol.

      Study Design & protocol:

      Subjects will be asked to visit the Exercise Performance Laboratory at the Sylvan Adams
      Sports Institute on three occasions. During the first visit subject will perform resting
      pulmonary function tests (PFTs) followed by a graded exercise test to exhaustion on either a
      motorized-treadmill for the determination of VO2max, degree of EIAH (SaO2 at VO2max) and
      maximal heart rate (HRmax). On the second visit, subjects will perform PFTs, followed by a
      brief warm-up run for 10 min at a moderate intensity equivalent to 60% of HRmax, as obtained
      from the incremental test and a 30-min trial at either half-marathon pace (HM30), designed to
      simulate a tempo workout often practiced by endurance runners. The third visit, conducted 24
      hours after the 30-min trial, will include a blood draw only.
