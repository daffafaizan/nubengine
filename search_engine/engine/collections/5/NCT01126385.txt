      transpedicular fixation using pedicle screws. A major complication of this treatment is a
      cut-out or back-out of the screw due to insufficient anchorage of the implant in the
      vertebral body.

      A new mechanical device was developed in order to provide the surgeon with intraoperative
      information about the mechanical strength of the cancellous bone. In cases of low bone
      quality, the treatment can be adapted to the patient's condition, for example by augmentation
      of the screw anchorage using bone cement. However, this treatment involves a risk of cement
      leakage and subsequent pulmonary embolism or nerve damage. Furthermore, cement augmentation
      is time-consuming. Therefore, there is a need for a diagnostic device that can
      intraoperatively support the surgeon's decision on the appropriate treatment.

      DensiProbe Spine was developed accordingly to the clinically approved DensiProbe Hip, which
      was designed for the same diagnostic reasons in patients with hip fractures undergoing
      fracture fixation with the dynamic hip screw (DHS). However, the application of bone strength
      measurements in the spine is in so far different to the hip as the anatomical dimensions in
      the spine are much smaller and lower values of bone mineral density (BMD) and bone strength
      are expected.

      The objective of this pilot study is to investigate the handling and feasibility of the newly
      developed DensiProbe Spine measurement device. In case of a positive result of the pilot
      study, a multicenter cohort study will be performed in order to clinically validate the
      DensiProbe Spine device by assessing the correlation between DensiProbe Spine measurements
      and the amounts of pedicle screw migration in patients undergoing transpedicular fixation.
