      and analyses occurring at the level of "schools" (i.e., we are not randomly assigning
      individuals to groups). To assess the efficacy of a visual screening program, we will compare
      visual outcomes in 25 schools randomly chosen to receive the program and 25 schools allocated
      to "care as usual" one year after screening. The screening tools are HOTV crowded acuity,
      Preschool Randot Stereoacuity Test, and Plusoptix Autorefractor. The outcome measures will
      assess later differences between schools receiving the visual screening program and control
      schools for prevalence of (1) visual and (2) reading problems. A lower prevalence of either
      or both problems in schools where the visual screening program was offered would provide
      evidence for the efficacy of vision screening. Primary outcome measure is the prevalence of
      amblyopia, reduced stereo vision, and untreated clinically significant refractive errors in
      "screened" versus "care as usual" schools. Secondary outcome measure is the proportion of
      children performing 1 standard deviation below average on reading scores in "screened" versus
      "care as usual" schools.
