    
      Ovaries from all less than 45 year-old breast cancer patients who undergo oophorectomy by
      laparoscopy after treated with chemotherapy will be enrolled to the study. Pieces of cortex
      of each patient will divide into two groups. Group 1 is fresh fragments (control group) and
      group 2 is vitrified group. Ovarian tissues in group 2 will be vitrified or warmed with
      medium and devices of Ova-kit type M (Kitazato, Japan).

      Cortex fragments of each group will have:

        -  Follicle survival evaluation by Neutral red staining

        -  Histological evaluation by Hematoxylin and Eosin staining

        -  Evaluation relative Growth Differentiation Factor 9 (GDF-9) and Caspase-3 gene
           expression by real-time Polymerase chain reaction (PCR).

      Comparison of data collected from 2 groups will be carried on to evaluate the effectiveness
      of the technique before applying this technique for cancer patients in Vietnam.
