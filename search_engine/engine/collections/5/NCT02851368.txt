      imaging (NIFI) system in the detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules. Patients selected
      for enrollment in this study will be adults (â‰¥18 years) that have been scheduled for surgical
      biopsy and/or resection of a primary lung nodule identified by prior imaging. Patients will
      receive an injection of indocyanine green (ICG) contrast dye one day prior to their surgery.
      Intraoperatively, the NIFI system will be used to visualize and characterize the fluorescence
      patterns given off by these lung nodules, as well as look for additional undiagnosed nodules.
      These nodules will then be resected and receive histological characterization, as per
      standard of care. The NIFI system will be evaluated for its ability to 1) visualize nodules
      and their margins 2) differentiate between benign and malignant nodules and 3) identify
      additional undiagnosed nodules.
