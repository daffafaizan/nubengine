        -  Assess expression of emotion, as a function of patient presence, among spousal or other
           cohabiting caregivers (CG) of post-hematopoietic stem cell transplantation patients.

        -  Assess desynchrony among subjective (self-report) and expressive indicators of emotion,
           as a function of patient presence, in these participants.

        -  Correlate CG dispositional inhibition and desynchrony with physical and marital
           satisfaction in these participants.

      OUTLINE: Caregivers (CG) complete written questionnaires assessing demographics, positive and
      negative affect, dispositional inhibition, marital satisfaction, and physical health over 45
      minutes to 1 hour on day 1. CG then engage in two oral emotional expression exercises (on the
      topic of caregiving and the transplant) over 2 hours on day 2. Patients are present for one
      oral emotional expression exercise.

      Participants are followed at 2 weeks and 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patient/spouse couples will be accrued for this study within
      18 months.
