        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of OGX-011 (clusterin
           antisense oligonucleotide) when administered with neoadjuvant hormonal therapy before
           radical prostatectomy in patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of OGX-011 when this regimen is administered in these
           patients..

        -  Assess the effects of this regimen on pathologic complete response rates in these
           patients.

        -  Correlate plasma and/or prostate concentrations of OGX-011 with patient response or
           toxicity measures.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of OGX-011.

      Patients receive OGX-011 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, 5, 8, 15, 22, and 29; oral flutamide
      three times daily for 4 weeks; and buserelin subcutaneously on day 1.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients (except for 1 patient at starting dose) receive escalating doses of
      OGX-011 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose
      at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. The
      recommended phase II dose is the dose preceding the MTD.

      Patients undergo radical prostatectomy and bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy 1 week after the
      last dose of neoadjuvant therapy.

      Patients are followed at 7 days after surgery and then at 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25-33 patients will be accrued for this study.
