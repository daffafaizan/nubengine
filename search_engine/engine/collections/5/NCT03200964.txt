      procedure is finished, based on the information available in the medical records.

      the study has no end point and keeps collecting data as long as procedures are performed.

      The data is analyzed intermittent when medical questions arise on quality and outcome changes
      due to changes in clinical treatment taken in order to improve individual patient care.
