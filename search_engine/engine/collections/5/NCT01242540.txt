      activates a matrix of areas, but that this activation decays during stimulation, possibly
      reflecting the body's ability to "accommodate" to the stimulation. The majority of these use
      short applications of pain lasting 1 to 30 seconds. However, investigators are now using
      stimulations much longer than the periods that were typical a few years ago. The effect of
      signal decay on the activation maps generated by these longer tasks is not known. Because the
      signal change in many of the subcortical areas involved in pain processing is low, errors in
      analysis due to neglecting the signal decay may induce significant artifact.

      Materials and Methods: Using transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, 20 healthy
      volunteers will experience two different painful stimulations: a repeating 30-second long
      stimulation and a constant 2 minute stimulation. The brain activity for each will be
      determined and compared. In addition, the signal decay during each painful stimulation will
      be quantified and compared.

      Significance: Investigators are using longer stimulations periods in an attempt to understand
      how the brain processes "real- life" pain instead of the artificial on-off pattern of earlier
      studies. However, significant attention has not been paid to the possible effect of
      accommodation on the stimulus and how this may impact the activity pattern found. In
      addition, proof of activation of pain-control areas like the periaquaductal gray while
      inverse changes are occurring in pain-perceiving areas has not been sought. This study will
      address both of these issues with a single BOLD FMRI experiment.
