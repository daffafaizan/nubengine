      marrow transplants for immunodeficient patients, reconstitute a new immune system with
      lymphocyte depleted stem cells. Subsequent disease activity will be followed by (1) Crohn's
      disease activity index (CDAI), (2) quality of life instrument (IBDQ), (3) type and amount of
      therapy for CD, and (4) flow cytometry of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets. In addition,
      the subjects will undergo periodic absorption function testing, to assess small intestinal
      function. We anticipate that this study will also form the basis to clarify further the role
      of the immune system in Crohn's disease.
