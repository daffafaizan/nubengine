      select the starting dose at 50 mg in combination with cisplatin for NSCLC or BTC. The safety
      monitoring committee (SMC) will review the starting dose of 50 mg data and decide whether it
      is adequate to escalate the dose to 100, then 150 mg according to Bayesian optimal interval
      (BOIN) design. Moreover, based on the PK profiles and modelling, the loading dose 100 mg QD
      for 7 days will keep the minimal efficacy concentration and effectively maintain the p-STAT3
      level low enough to translate the anticancer efficacy with clinical efficacy for the study
      drug SC-43.

      The cisplatin efficacy for NSCLC and BTC, the chosen dose and dosing schedules 75 mg/m2 in a
      3-week cycle in combination with SC-43 are supported by previous clinical experience of
      observed efficacy and safety profiles for the indicated study populations.
