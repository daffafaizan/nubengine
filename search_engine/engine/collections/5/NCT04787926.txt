    
      This study is a multicenter, open-label, post-market study to evaluate the safety and
      performance of DuraLock-C 4.0%, 30.0%, and 46.7% in the maintenance of catheter patency of an
      indwelling HD CVC in adult HD patients treated in clinic.

      On Day 0, patients to be instilled who meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the
      exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study to receive 1 of the 3 DuraLock-C solutions.
      It is expected that a minimum of 3 sites will enroll patients to the study in order to cover
      the 3 solutions to be tested; each site will enroll to 1 unique DuraLock-C solution only,
      until the sample size for the solution has been reached.

      DuraLock-C 4.0%, 30.0%, or 46.7% solutions will be instilled to lock the catheter as part of
      the routine care of the patient. Individual patients will receive the catheter locking
      solution (CLS) as a catheter lock post-HD session until catheter dysfunction is observed or
      until the end of the study period (Calendar Day 90). The CLSs are commercially available and
      will not be provided as part of the study design.

      End of Study (EOS) will take place at the patient's next scheduled session.
