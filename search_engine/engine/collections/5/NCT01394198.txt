      prior to a scheduled routine or diagnostic endoscopy. Immediately prior to the scheduled
      endoscopy, subjects enrolled in the study will be palpated by a Neuromuscular Medicine
      (NMM)/Osteopathic Manipulative Medicine (OMM) specialist for spinal tenderness, tissue
      texture changes and asymmetry or restricted range of motion as well as tenderness of Chapman
      points. The entire spine from the occipitoatlantal joint to the sacrum will be evaluated
      along with specific intercostal abdominal and lower extremity areas. The positive structural
      examination findings of spinal tenderness, tissue texture changes and asymmetry or restricted
      range of motion will be compared to the visual and pathological findings recorded in the
      operative report of the endoscopy procedure and the pathological report of any biopsies
      obtained during the endoscopic procedure.
