      exercise modalities, whereas resistance training have been discouraged in patients with
      cardiovascular disease, due to safety concerns related to cardiovascular response (heart rate
      and blood pressure) during the exertion. Contrary to such concerns, recent hemodynamic
      studies have reported lower blood pressure and heart rate during higher intensity resistance
      training (>70 % 1-RM) compared to lower intensity resistance training (>40 % 1-RM).
      Furthermore, the latest meta analysis have demonstrated that combined resistance training
      with standard aerobic interval training has been superior than aerobic training alone in
      several aspects of health.

      However, there is still huge heterogeneity in training intervention design, also there still
      lacks studies to further elucidate the effects of high intensity resistance training combined
      with aerobic training on physical performance (aerobic capacity, muscle strength, balance),
      body composition, quality of life, morbidity, mortality, etc. Therefore, the aim of this
      study was to examine the effects of high (70%-80 % 1-RM) versus low loads (30%- 40 % 1-RM)
      resistance training in combination with aerobic interval cycling (50 % -80% of baseline peak
      Power output) in coronary artery disease patients and patients with heart failure.
