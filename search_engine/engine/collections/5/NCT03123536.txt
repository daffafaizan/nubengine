      by the anesthesiologist for evaluation of cardiopulmonary dysfunction and other emergent
      situations. However, it remains unclear whether use of perioperative point-of-care ultrasound
      can reduce the worse postoperative outcomes in high surgical risk patients.

      Patients were randomly allocated to two groups. In the point-of-care ultrasound group,
      treatment was oriented by the findings of point-of-care ultrasound, while in the control
      group the decisions about the management of patients were made by the experience of the
      clinical team. The primary outcome measures were hospital mortality and 28-day mortality, and
      the secondary outcome measures were the complications and length of hospital stay.
