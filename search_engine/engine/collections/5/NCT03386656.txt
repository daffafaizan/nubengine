      fibrinolytic properties of plasmin. Tranexamic acid binds to plasminogen when it is
      transformed into plasmin. The activity of the tranexamic acid-plasmin complex on fibrin
      activity is less than the activity of free plasmin alone.

      There are two methods of presentation: one, as an injectable solution; Two as a clear,
      colorless aqueous solution.

      Tranexamic acid in Spain is approved for use in the prevention and treatment of bleeding due
      to general fibrinolysis. As for its specific indications the investigators find that it is
      used for the treatment of metrorrhagia, menorrhagia, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, urinary
      hemorrhagic disorders after prostate surgery, surgery of ears, nose, throat, gynecological,
      thoracic, abdominal or cardiovascular or to counter associated hemorrhages To the
      administration of a fibrinolytic drug.
