    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Evaluate the ability of adjuvant hormone therapy with an LHRH agonist
      (Goserelin depot) to produce an increased disease-free survival and to prolong overall
      survival when initiated during the first week of radiotherapy in prostatic cancer patients
      with a high risk of developing metastatic disease.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Whole-pelvic irradiation using photons with a
      recommended energy of at least 10 MV (Co60 therapy is acceptable if higher energy
      unavailable). Arm II: Radiotherapy plus 2-Drug Combination Hormonal Therapy. Whole-pelvic
      irradiation as in Arm I; plus Goserelin, ZDX, NSC-606864; Cyproterone acetate, CPTR,
      NSC-81430.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 400 patients will be entered over 5 years. At least 75 patients on each
      arm should be followed until relapse.
