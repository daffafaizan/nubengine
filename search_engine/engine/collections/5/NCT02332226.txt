      Parents of children with cancer have great information needs and report that these are not
      always met. Psychosocial suffering such as stress and anxiety is also common in this group.

      INTERVENTION

      The intervention in this study builds upon the representational approach for patient
      education. It emanates from Leventhal's theories about illness representation and educational
      theories about conceptual change. Central elements in the approach are parental choice of
      information topics of interest, and a thorough assessment of present parental knowledge
      before information is given. Each parent in the intervention arm gets four sessions with an
      intervention nurse.

      DESIGN AND METHODS

      The study comprises a multi-centre randomized controlled trial with two parallel arms with a
      1:1 allocation ratio. One arm will receive the intervention and the other standard care
      according to local routines at each ward. The effect will be measured with validated
      instrument which are answered on a web platform. Complementary to the quantitative
      evaluation, we will perform a process evaluation aiming at understanding the change
      mechanisms, treatment fidelity, dose delivered, contextual factors of importance and how the
      intervention further could be optimized.
