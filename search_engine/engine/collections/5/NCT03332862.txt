      increasing. Durable PVI is cornerstone for long-term freedom of AF. In one previous study
      continuous ablation was suggested to be more efficient in durable PVI. However, this
      hypothesis has not been proven in randomized fashion.

      The current study is to confirm whether continuous versus discontinuous design of encircling
      lesions are comparable under the same conditions of power delivery.

      The study design is a two-centre prospective randomized trial to compare the acute efficacy
      by using the above described approaches.
