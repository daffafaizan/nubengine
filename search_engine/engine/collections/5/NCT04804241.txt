      maintenance dose: placebo) over 52 weeks in either the Sacramento or East Bay locations the
      University of California Davis Alzheimer's Disease Research Center (ADRC), with cognitive
      outcomes, blood, and CSF markers of neuroinflammation. This pilot study will provide an
      estimate of treatment effect size on cognitive trajectory, daily function, and brain atrophy.
      The trial will last 1 year (52 weeks on 10 mg/day of active drug or placebo) with primary
      efficacy measures at baseline, week 26, and week 52. Additional safety monitoring visits will
      occur at weeks 4, 12, and 36 including physical exams, measurement of blood pressure, vital
      signs, safety labs, electrocardiogram recordings, collection of Adverse Events and
      Concomitant Medications. The study will culminate with a visit at 78 weeks (26 weeks after
      last dose, allowing full wash-out from the central nervous system (CNS)) to test if the
      previously treated and untreated groups show any differences, as would be expected if
      Senicapoc treatment for 1 year was disease-modifying. All participants will be required to
      participate in either the CSF Sub-study or the Amyloid Positron Emission Tomography (PET)
      Sub-study. All participants will be required to participate in the Cognitive Event Related
      Potential (ERP) Sub-study.
