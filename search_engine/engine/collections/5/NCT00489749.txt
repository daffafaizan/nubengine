      surgical repair, there are a variety of protocols, ranging from complete immobilization to
      immediate postoperative mobilization with early weightbearing. However, no clear consensus
      regarding the optimal postoperative rehabilitation protocol for ATRs exists. Early
      rehabilitation after ATR has been shown to be beneficial in animal and human studies. Human
      prospective studies and randomized controlled trials have shown that early postoperative
      mobilization do not pose additional risks compared to cast immobilization, with a trend
      toward a reduction in lost work days and an earlier return to sport. However, these trials
      define early postoperative mobilization differently (i.e. use different combinations of
      weightbearing and range of motion). This makes it difficult to determine which factor in the
      early rehabilitation process plays an important role in optimizing recovery. An important
      component of early rehabilitation is weightbearing.

      Comparison: Patients weightbearing in the early rehabilitation period after surgical repair
      of the Achilles tendon compared to patients non-weightbearing after the surgical repair of
      the Achilles tendon repair. With the exception of weightbearing status, both groups performed
      the same rehabilitation program.
