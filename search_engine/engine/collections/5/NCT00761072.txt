      remifentanil are often used together. Previous studies have demonstrated the synergy between
      these combinations of medications. From these data, drug interaction models have been
      developed to pair drug effect-site concentrations with event markers of interest to the
      clinical anesthesiologist. For example, the amount of remifentanil and propofol typically
      required during the induction of anesthesia to cause loss of responsiveness to verbal or
      moderate stimuli has been studied. Likewise, the blood concentration levels present during
      emergence from anesthesia have been explored describing levels typically present for patients
      to return to consciousness.

      The purpose of this study is to retrospectively analyze the infusion doses of both
      remifentanil and propofol for pediatric patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery at CHOP.
      These data will be applied to the pharmacokinetic models to determine the predicted effect
      site concentration, and the relationship of that concentration to the 50% and 95% doses as
      predicted by the model.
