    
      This is a single arm, open label study of approximately 100 high-risk prostate cancer
      patients scheduled for prostatectomy and extended pelvic lymph node dissection. Patients
      receive a single IV dose of 99mTc-MIP-1404 (study drug) followed by SPECT/CT scan 3-6 hours
      after injection. As standard of care, patients will undergo prostatectomy and extended pelvic
      lymph node dissection (EPLND) within three weeks of study drug dosing. 99mTc-MIP-1404 image
      data will be evaluated for visible uptake and compared with histopathology.
