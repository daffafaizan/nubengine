      fertility. However, the standard morphology evaluation on random stained cells from the
      ejaculate is of limited value during ICSI. Current research is directed towards the
      dysmorphisms of the sperm head.A new technique based on the motile sperm organelle morphology
      examination (MSOME) at a magnification of at least Ã—6000 has been developed. The MSOME
      assesses the nucleus, for both shape and chromatin content, which is the most important sperm
      organelle in influencing ICSI outcomes. The goals for this study are to identify whether
      there is a connection between morphologic sperm normalcy under high magnification and (i)
      semen analysis according to the new World Health Organization (WHO) reference values and (ii)
      ICSI outcomes.
