      with postpartum depression. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to active acupuncture
      or placebo acupuncture. The subjects will receive acupuncture treatment twice per week for 4
      consecutive weeks. The acupuncturist of this trial will not participate in data collection
      and data entry. The trial assessor will be blind to the subjects' treatment allocation.
