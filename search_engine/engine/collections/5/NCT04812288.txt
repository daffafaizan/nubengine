      and physical performance including balance, gait speed, and endurance in older adults by
      utilizing the NIRS device. The investigators want to determine the relationship between
      different types of tests and oxygenation for older adults with 4 levels of physical activity.
      This study will help towards identifying possible short and effective exercises for older
      adults with different activity levels.
