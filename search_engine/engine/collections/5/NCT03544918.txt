      The study has the intention to:

        -  Identify patients with inherited LQTS in order to give them optimal treatment.

        -  To identify patients with acquired QT prolongation in order to possibly correct
           electrolyte disorders and therapeutically prescriptions in order to minimize the chance
           of life-threatening arrhythmias.

        -  To analyse to what extend a specific reason for QT prolongation can be found in patients
           with heart rate adjusted QT prolongation, or to which extend the QT prolongation without
           syncope, or family history of sudden cardiac death, is an unspecific finding.

        -  To analyse time dependent risk of patients with QT prolongation related to underlying
           disease

        -  To analyse to what extend genetic variations might predispose for acquired QT
           prolongation.

        -  To compare life expectancy of patients with QT prolongation related to case control
           patients with out QT prolongation.

        -  To implement rapid reaction on newly diagnosed QT prolongation, and follow up of
           survival after implementation of improved care.

             -  To examine if the T wave morphology score applied on patients ECGs with QTc >500
                ms, has independent prognostic value in this cohort.
