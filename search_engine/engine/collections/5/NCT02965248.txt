      patients, resulting in a poor prognosis. Hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) is
      effective to colorectal peritoneal metastasis and may play a significant role in reducing the
      risk of metachronous peritoneal metastasis among patients with locally advanced colorectal
      cancer. Oxaliplatin is routinely used for HIPEC in the Europe and Raltitrexed may be another
      ideal drug for HIPEC. The present phase II multicenter, randomized controlled trial is
      designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant HIPEC with raltitrexed or
      oxaliplatin versus no HIPEC in locally advanced colorectal cancer.
