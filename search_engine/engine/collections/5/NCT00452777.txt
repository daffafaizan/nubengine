    
      The planned study is an exploratory study which aims to provide proof of the efficacy of
      BVT.115959 in the reduction of the symptoms of pain. Thus, the primary objective is to
      evaluate the anticipated analgesic properties of BVT.115959 in patients with diabetic
      neuropathic pain and to confirm its activity against placebo.

      The study will evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of oral BVT.115959 7 mg administered
      three times a day (t.i.d.) versus a matching placebo in diabetic patients with neuropathic
      pain who are either not on analgesia or are on stable analgesia in the month prior to
      entering the study and who are being maintained on stable analgesia throughout the study.
      Eligible subjects will be randomized in a ratio of 2:1 (BVT.115959: placebo).

      The study consists of a 1-week screening/baseline period, a 4-week treatment period and a 1
      week follow-up period.
