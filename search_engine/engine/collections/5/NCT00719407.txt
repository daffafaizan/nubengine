      disability; yet therapies for birth asphyxia are currently limited. Erythropoietin (Epo) is a
      FDA-approved drug that is an effective neuroprotective agent in animal models of birth
      asphyxia. This is a phase I dose finding multi-center trial that will test the safety and
      pharmacokinetics of Epo in human infants with birth asphyxia. The long-term objectives of the
      proposed research are to reduce mortality and to decrease the risk of long-term disabilities
      in infants who survive beyond the newborn period.
