      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Secondary objectives are to assess the effects of a single bout of aerobic exercise on 1)
      sleep continuity, 2) sleep architecture, 3) pre-sleep arousal, 4) subjective sleep quality,
      5) daytime sleepiness, 6) nocturnal blood pressure, 7) heart rate variability, and 8) the
      frequency and severity of adverse events.

      DESIGN:

      This will be a two-arm parallel group, randomized, outcome assessor blinded, controlled,
      superiority trial. According to sample size calculation a total of 92 patients will be
      randomized using minimization. The trial will take place in the first five days of the

      Day 0-2: Screening, inclusion, and graded exercise test to determine exercise intensity of
      intervention

      Day 3: Questionnaires for background information
