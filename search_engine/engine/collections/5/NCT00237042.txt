      mastication and the temporomandibular joint. These pain problems are about twice as common in
      women as in men in the community, and prevalence peaks during the reproductive years. The
      etiology of TMD pain is unknown, but psychological stress, depression and the presence of
      other somatic complaints have been shown to influence the course of these disorders. Prior
      research suggests that female reproductive hormones may also influence TMD pain.
      Specifically, normally cycling women with TMD experience rising levels of TMD pain
      pre-menstrually during a time of precipitous drop in estrogen and show peak TMD pain during
      menses. Interestingly, a secondary peak of TMD pain occurs at about the time of ovulation,
      another phase corresponding to rapid estrogen change. These data demonstrate a systematic
      relationship between levels of TMD pain and phases of the menstrual cycle. The proposed
      clinical trial will manipulate the behavioral and hormonal factors that are hypothesized to
      influence TMD pain, comparing the effects of:

        -  a continuous oral contraceptive intervention designed to suppress menses and stabilize
           the hormonal environment;

        -  a self-management intervention focused on and timed to the chronobiology of TMD symptoms
           across the menstrual cycle; and

        -  a usual self-management intervention not timed to biological events. The aims of this
           clinical trial are to shed light on the mechanisms underlying the cyclic nature of TMD
           pain and symptoms in women, as well as to determine which treatment modality results in
           the greatest improvement in TMD pain and symptoms.
