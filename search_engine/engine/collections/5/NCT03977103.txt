      hematologic malignancy where HSCT is indicated with the use of a regulatory T cell based
      protocol. Hyper-fractionated Total Body Irradiation or Total Marrow and Lymphoid Irradiation
      based conditioning will be followed by the infusion of T regulatory and T conventional cell
      adoptive immunotherapy and a purified CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell graft. Incidence of Non
      Relapse Mortality, Relapse, acute Graft versus Host Disease, chronic Graft versus Host
      Disease, as well as probability of cGvHD/disease free survival will be assessed in patient
      subpopulations separated according to HLA-matching with the donor (HLA-matched HSCT and
      HLA-haploidentical HSCT) and type of disease (acute myeloid leukemia, acute lymphoid
      leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, myeloproliferative disease, and other).
