      patient's cancer by a procedure called a thoracoscopy. Restaging is a process by which
      physicians measure the response of the patient to treatment. The primary and secondary
      objectives are described below.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary Objective:

      1. Evaluate the feasibility of using videothoracoscopy to access and identify residual viable
      cancer in mediastinal lymph nodes and/or evaluate for other conditions which render patients
      unresectable (pleural carcinomatosis or T4 primary tumors) following prior mediastinoscopy
      and a period of neoadjuvant therapy for Stage IIIA N2 non-small cell lung cancer.

      Secondary Objectives:

        1. Evaluate the safety (morbidity and mortality) of pre-resectional, thoracoscopic
           restaging of patients who have undergone prior mediastinoscopy and induction therapy for
           Stage III (N2) NSCLC.

        2. Assess the accuracy (false-negative rate) of thoracoscopic mediastinal node restaging
           after prior mediastinoscopy and induction therapy.
