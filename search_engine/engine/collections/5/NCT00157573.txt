      without a break in a population of healthy and fit women with evidence of recurrent but
      asymptomatic mullerian malignancy (such as ovarian cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary
      peritoneal cancer). The main goal is to determine the time to treatment termination due to
      disease progression or toxicity.
