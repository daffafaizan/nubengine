           Compare quality of pain relief and quality of life between bilateral ESP bilateral
           catheters Vs Opioid analgesia in donor patients for liver donation.

        2. Methodology:

           • Selection criteria: Age > 18 years old Be volunteer to donate liver Agree to
           participate in the trial

           • Exclusion criteria: Use of chronic opioids Contra-indication tom perform ESP catheter
           (Infection near puncture point, Severe thoracic scoliosis, allergie to local
           anesthestics) A diagnosis of a chronic pain conditionDepression or other psychiatric
           diagnosis

           • Study design: Prospective Randomized Controlled Trial.

           Patients who agree to join the study will be randomized into 2 groups:

           Group 1 (Control group): standard of care in liver donation : Intraoperative analgesia
           by Opioid sufentanil and post operative analgesia by PCA opioid morphine Group 2
           (treatement group): Standard peri-operative analgesia for liver donation in since
           Investigators use regional anaesthesia as first line treatement for peri operative
           analgesia Bilateral ESP catheters with continuous regional analgesia by infusion of
           local anesthestic (Ropivacaine)

           Sample size: investigators expected to increase the Quality of LIfe (QoL) score (using
           under-the-curve area) from 36·9 for the ERAS group to 38.3 for ESP group The sample size
           of 10 patients per group is required to detect such changes assuming a confidence
           interval of 95% with a power of 90% and alpha = 0.05. Considering 20% of drop-out, the
           total sample size is 24 patients (12 patients each group)

        3. Project outcomes:

             -  Primary outcomes Quality of pain relief with opioid consumption

             -  Secondary outcomes Duration of hospitalisation participants satisfaction Quality of
                recovery (QOR 16) Pain at 1 & 3 months rest and mobilization + QOL
