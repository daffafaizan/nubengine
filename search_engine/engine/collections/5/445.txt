28029 enzymic synthesis of steroidsulfates.  ii. presence of steroid sulfo-kinase in human mammary carcinomaextractsextracts of human primary and secondarymammary carcinomas were shown tocontain steroid sulfokinase(s) in every caseexamined.  examination of normalbreast tissue surrounding the tumors revealedvery weak steroid sulfokinaseactivity in some instances.  this was thought tobe due to the fibrous nature andpoor cellularity of the normal breast tissue.normal ovarian tissue specimens,obtained from cancer patients undergoingoophorectomy, did not generallycontain the enzyme, but trace levels were detectedin 1 of 5 specimens examined.steroids, without necessarily showing conversionto steroid sulfate, were observedto increase the incorporation of s35-sulfate intoone of the products formed enzy-mically on incubating breast tissue extractswith s35-adenosine-3'-phosphate-5'-phosphosulfate.
