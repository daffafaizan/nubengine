      paclitaxel for a total of 90 minutes. Cyrotherapy will be delivered using Elasto-gel mitts
      and Rapid relief slippers. These items will be changed 45min after initiation to ensure
      coldness.

      There will be two arms of the study. One arm will include subjects who will wear one
      slipper/one mitt on their foot/hand while the other foot/hand will serve as a control. The
      other arm will include subjects who will have cryotherapy to both hands and feet. . This
      process will be repeated for a total of 12 times in conjunction with 12 doses of paclitaxel.
      At time point 13, during a routine visit to their oncologist, the subjects nails will be
      reassessed along with completion of the BPI and NPSIA total of 25 subjects will be enrolled
      in each arm.
