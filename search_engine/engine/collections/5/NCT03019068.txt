      studies with public funding covering therapeutic, diagnostic or prognostic studies. Selection
      (inclusion, non inclusion) criteria of each CT will be translated into a normalized
      description using ICD10 and french nomenclature of medical or surgical procedures (CCAM,
      Classification Commune des Actes Médicaux), these very nomenclatures being used in the french
      DRG system. Then a dedicated program will query the French DRG national database called PMSI
      (Programme de Médicalisation des Systèmes d'Information).

      For each CT and for each center, the query will select "candidate" patients whose eligibility
      will be checked by thorough examination of the whole patient file by dedicated data
      extractors. In addition, already recruited patients will be compared to the prediction of the
      system.

      Collected data span the period between 2010 and 2014, as well as with the medical files.
