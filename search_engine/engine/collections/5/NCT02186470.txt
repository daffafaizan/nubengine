      Establish the feasibility for preoperative APBI delivered with IMRT in the prone position
      using daily CT guidance for Stage I breast cancer patients who are intended to undergo a
      lumpectomy for breast conserving therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To determine the acute and late surgical and radiation toxicity of preoperative APBI
           delivered with IMRT in the prone position.

        2. To document the cosmetic appearance of the breast when treated with preoperative APBI
           IMRT in the prone position.

        3. Establish the percentage of patients that can meet dosimetric goals and normal tissue
           constraints if treated with preoperative APBI IMRT in the prone position.

        4. Evaluate molecular changes in breast cancer and/or stroma before and after preoperative
           APBI

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo image-guided intensity-modulated APBI twice daily (BID) in the prone
      position over a period of 5-10 days for a total of 10 treatment. Within 4-6 weeks post-APBI,
      patients undergo lumpectomy.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks and then every 6 months
      for 5 years.
