           Virginia hospital over a 12 month period. Our main outcome measure is degradation of the
           glycocalyx in patients with aSAH. All eligible patients with confirmed aSAH admitted to
           the neuro-intensive care unit will be enrolled after consent is obtained from the family
           and/or the patient. Serum samples will be drawn from each patient on admission (day 1)
           and every other day until day 13 for a total of 7 samples per patient.

           The following serum tests will be performed:

        2. Measurement of serum syndecan-1 by ELISA

        3. Measurement of serum heparan-sulfate by ELISA

        4. Measurement of serum matrix metalloproteinases -9

        5. Measurement of serum matrix-metalloproteinase-1

        6. Measurement of urinary microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio

        7. Measurement of daily TCDs (all patients currently receive daily TCDs as part of the aSAH
           protocol at UTMCK and UVA Hospital)

        8. Outcomes:

           a) Chart review: i) Incidence of DCI as defined by a consensus committee on this subject
           and published in the journal Stroke [29].

           ii) In-hospital mortality will be recorded b) Follow-up performed by phone call or
           searching the Social Security Death Index [30]: i) 30-day mortality ii) 90-day mortality
           c) Outcomes follow-up: i) The Glasgow Outcome Scale 12 weeks post aSAH [31]
