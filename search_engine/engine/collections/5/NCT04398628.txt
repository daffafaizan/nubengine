    
      This is a longitudinal, natural history observational cohort study being conducted at
      approximately 150 ATHN-affiliated sites. Participants will be followed for a minimum of 15
      years. Harmonized data elements will be collected at time of enrollment, quarterly, ad hoc,
      and annually. Base data to be collected for all participants. Specific data will be collected
      for participants enrolled in cohort-specific Arms and Modules.

      Each participant will be assigned in a single cohort: Hemophilia, Von Willebrand Disease,
      Congenital Platelet Disorder, Rare Bleeding Disorders, Bleeding not otherwise specified
      (NOS), Thrombosis/Thrombophilia, or Non-Neoplastic Hematologic Conditions. The cohort for
      which a participant qualifies will be determined by the site Investigator.

      Study Arms and study Modules may be developed to provision disease and/or disease specific
      insights related to stakeholders, including but not limited to pharmaceutical companies,
      ATHN, and Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs). Arms may branch off into product-specific data
      collection via Modules to be collected during the study, in conjunction with planned study
      assessments.
