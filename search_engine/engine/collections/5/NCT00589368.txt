      distal upper extremity lead to impaired hand function and disability in Activities of Daily
      Living, accruing enormous costs in terms of health care services and lost productivity. The
      mechanisms of recovery of hand motor function after stroke are poorly understood, and the
      protocols used in clinical practice lack a solid scientific rationale. Prior work has shown
      that grasping with the non-involved hand may assist in planning of grasp with the involved
      hand after stroke. The goal of the proposed project is to investigate the type and nature of
      information relayed across the hemispheres by prior manipulation with the non-involved hand
      to improve planning and control of grasp with the involved hand. Psychophysical methods using
      a grip instrument will be used to examine the type of information necessary for planning of
      grasp, and quantitative surface electromyography will be used to investigate the contribution
      of improved planning to neuromuscular control of grasp. Integration of these methods in the
      study of grasp control will clarify the neural mechanisms underlying hand dysfunction, and
      facilitate the development of rational therapeutic protocols for upper extremity
      rehabilitation after stroke.
