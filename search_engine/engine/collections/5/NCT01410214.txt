      stage completely resected NSCLC pts the role of 5-year survival, but its treatment-related
      life threatening toxicity limits its use. The EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) may
      provide a dramatic response in pts with pulmonary adenocarcinoma carrying EGFR activating
      mutations in the metastatic setting. The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of erlotinib versus NVB plus cisplatin (NP) as adjuvant treatment in pts with stage
      IIIA NSCLC after Complete Resection with EGFR activating mutations and to explore a new
      treatment strategy for this subset.
