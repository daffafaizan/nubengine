        -  Statistical analysis: populations will be compared with chi-square test or Fisher's
           exact test (categorical variables) and Student's t test or Mann-Whitney U test
           (continuous variables). A univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis will
           be performed to evaluate the predictive factors of residual disease. The Kaplan-Meier
           method will be applied for survival analysis and curves will be compared using log-rank
           test. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards ratio will be applied to
           determine the predictive factors of survival. Variables with p values inferior to 0.1 in
           the univariate analysis will be used to perform the multivariate analysis. Statistical
           significance is defined when p < 0.5. The statistical program used will be SPSS version
           23.
