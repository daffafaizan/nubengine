      to a number of target-achieving indicators including systemic central venous oxygen
      saturation(ScvO2) after initial fluid resuscitation within 6 hours, has been one of the main
      treatment for sepsis. ScvO2 is the only indicator that reflects tissue oxygen metabolism.
      However, there're studies confirmed that ScvO2 oriented EGDT cannot reduce the mortality of
      sepsis. So it is important to find out a more effective indicator. Lactic acid is a product
      of anaerobic metabolism of the body, lactate clearance has been found to effectively predict
      the prognosis of sepsis. Few studies have shown that lactate clearance oriented fluid
      resuscitation can be of benefit in patients with sepsis. Nevertheless, whether lactate
      clearance could be combined with sepsis Bundle as a new marker to improve the prognosis
      remains a problem. The objective of this study is to discuss the feasibility of lactate
      clearance oriented sepsis treatment through multi-center clinical trial.
