    
      This phase 2/3 open-label extension study was designed to characterize the safety and
      tolerability of long-term administration of evolocumab to adults and adolescents with severe
      FH (HoFH or non-HoFH severe FH). Participants not on lipid apheresis at enrollment or within
      the prior 8 weeks initiated treatment with evolocumab 420 mg once monthly (QM). Participants
      on lipid apheresis at enrollment initiated treatment with evolocumab 420 mg once every 2
      weeks (Q2W). Dose frequency changes (420 mg QM vs 420 mg Q2W) were permitted at week 12, 24,
      or other visits with Sponsor approval. Participants with < 5% LDL-C reduction from baseline
      and serum unbound proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) < 100 ng/mL could
      discontinue evolocumab. If serum unbound PCSK9 was ≥ 100 ng/mL with QM dosing, the
      participant could switch to evolocumab 420 mg Q2W treatment. Participants on apheresis with ≥
      5% LDL-C reduction from baseline and serum unbound PCSK9 < 100 ng/mL with Q2W treatment could
      switch to QM dosing.

      Participants were to continue to receive open-label evolocumab for up to 5 years or until
      evolocumab became commercially available in the relevant patient population, whichever
      occurred first.
