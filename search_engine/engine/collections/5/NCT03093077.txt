      or a conventional mechanical alignment technique.

      Participants will undergo a kinematic analysis of a deep knee bend using single-plane
      fluoroscopy at 1 year post-operatively. The primary outcome will be based on the 6 degree of
      freedom kinematics and associated joint component proximity during the knee bend task.
      Secondary outcomes include the Knee Society Score, the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome
      Score, and the Forgotten Knee Score.
