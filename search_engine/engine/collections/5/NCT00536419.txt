      year-old males. Within this group, the prevalence of motorcycle accidents is currently
      increasing at a significantly higher rate than the prevalence of car accidents, and studies
      in the international literature suggest that motorcycle drivers comprise a distinct driver
      profile to car drivers. Motorcycles are, by design, more difficult to control, and lend
      themselves more to performing dangerous stunts. Mistakes and lapses in judgment are likely to
      have more severe consequences when motorcycles are involved, especially when one considers
      the exposed nature of the driver. This is of special concern in Brazil, where a large
      population of so called "motoboys" delivers almost everything upon request, from food to work
      documents.

      It is well known that individuals with ADHD have more traffic problems, such as: a higher
      risk of a car accident; more violent crashes; more traffic violations and a greater chance of
      losing the driver's license. On a driving simulator, subjects with ADHD usually present with
      more errors and crashes, in comparison to normal controls. Treatment with Methylphenidate
      (MPH), however, has been shown to improve driving performance on the simulator (For example,
      subjects significantly reduce their speed when necessary as compared to a placebo group), and
      this in turn is a good indicator of better real-life driving performance.

      At present, there are no studies on the effect of ADHD treatment with MPH specifically on
      motorcycle drivers. This is relevant, since the increasing prevalence of traffic accidents
      can attributed to increased incidence of motorcycle accidents. If the treatment proves
      effective, this study will contribute to a reduction in a major social and health concern.
