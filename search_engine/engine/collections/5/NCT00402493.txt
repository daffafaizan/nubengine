      organ with very little or no systemic absorption thereby reducing side effect potential.
      There is very little information in the ophthalmic literature regarding potential drug
      interactions between topical IOP-lowering medications and other medications taken orally for
      other medical reasons. Patients will be randomized to either latanoprost or brimonidine.
      Patients in both groups will be randomized to either placebo or ibuprofen for the first 14
      days and then crossed over to the other treatment for 14 days.
