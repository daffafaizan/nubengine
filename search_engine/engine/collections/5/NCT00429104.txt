      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have what are called "screening
      tests." These tests will help the doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this
      study. You will have a complete medical history and physical exam. This includes blood tests
      (about 2 tea spoons), and x-rays. Women who are able to have children must have a negative
      blood or urine pregnancy test.

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive trastuzumab
      through a vein (IV) every week until the disease gets worse. GM-CSF will be injected under
      the skin at least once a day until the white blood cell count is stable. GM-CSF will also
      continue during the course of study until the disease progresses.

      You will have further evaluation of your disease by computed tomography-CT scan, bone scan,
      chest X-ray, etc. at 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months after the start of treatment. You will
      have blood tests (about 2 tea spoons) at least twice a week until the appropriate dose of
      GM-CSF is found. The dose may increase or decrease depending on the blood test.

      You will have blood (about 2 tablespoons) drawn before treatment at the 2nd and 4th month,
      and if the disease gets worse.

      You will be removed from the study if the disease is progressing or severe side effects
      occur.

      This is an investigational study. The FDA has approved trastuzumab and GM-CSF, but their use
      in this study is experimental. A total of 36 patients will take part in this study. All will
      be enrolled at UT MD Anderson Cancer Center.
