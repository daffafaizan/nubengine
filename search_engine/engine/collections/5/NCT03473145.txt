      In our primary biomarker outcomes of glucose regulation (fasting insulin & glucose, HbA1c,
      HOMA-IR) & blood pressure (BP):

        1. Investigate the 12 week effects of increased standing and additional brief sit-to-stand
           compared to attention controls.

        2. Investigate the dose-response effects of behavioral change on the biomarkers & BP.

      Secondary aims

        1. Assess the effect of changes in standing and sit-to-stand transitions at 12 weeks on
           physical, emotional & cognitive functioning.

        2. Assess the effect of changes in standing and sit-to-stand transitions at 12 weeks on in
           vivo skeletal muscle mitochondrial function.

      Exploratory aims

        1. Explore the possible modifying effect of age on the relationship between intervention
           conditions & primary & secondary outcomes.

        2. Explore the psychosocial & environmental mediators & moderators of changes in sitting
           time, standing time, and transitions.

        3. Explore differences in outcomes between the 2 sitting interruption conditions.
