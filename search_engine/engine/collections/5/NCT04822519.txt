      has risen by more than 20% in the past three decades .

      In the United States, 20-25 million individuals are affected by gallbladder disease,
      resulting in an average annual treatment cost of $6.2 billion Obesity, diet, rapid weight
      loss, metabolic syndrome, and conditions such as cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, irritable bowel
      syndrome, and gallbladder stasis increase the risk of gallstone formation .

      Surgical removal of the gallbladder, cholecystectomy, is the most recommended treatment for
      gallbladder disease; however, the procedure increases the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease, cirrhosis and metabolic effects .

      Oral dissolution therapy using ursodeoxycholic acid is currently one of the leading
      non-invasive alternative treatments for gallstones. Ursodeoxycholic acid dissolves small
      cholesterol gallstones by decreasing hepatic secretion of cholesterol and lowering the
      chances of unsaturated gallbladder bile formation Although oral dissolution therapy has
      proven to be a safe alternative to cholecystectomy, it has a gallstone recurrence rate of
      50%-70% at 12 years post-treatment .

      The high incidence rate and treatment cost associated with gallbladder disease have
      encouraged the search for preventative strategies. In approximately 75% of cases, impaired
      gallbladder motility results from the accumulation of cholesterol gallstones. Therefore,
      agents that reduce lipid concentrations or improve gallbladder motility may reduce the need
      for surgical interventions and/or the use of potentially harmful pharmaceutical products .
