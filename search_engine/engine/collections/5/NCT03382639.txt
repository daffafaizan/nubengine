      negative symptoms in participants who have schizophrenia.

      The study will enroll approximately 234 participants. Participants will then be randomly
      assigned (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups in the
      double-blind period-which will remain undisclosed to the participant and study doctor during
      the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  TAK-831 50 mg once daily

        -  TAK-831 125 mg once daily

        -  TAK-831 500 mg once daily

        -  Placebo once daily

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States, Spain, Italy, Czech Republic,
      Poland, Bulgaria and Ukraine. The overall time to participate in this study is approximately
      20 weeks. Participants will make 11 visits to the clinic, and will be followed up for safety
      assessment 10 to 14 days after the last dose of study drug (Day 98).
