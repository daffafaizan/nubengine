    
      Overall goal

      To evaluate the impact of a package of three interventions aiming to increase
      institution-based delivery and improve emergency obstetric and neonatal care on perinatal
      mortality, in the four districts with the highest maternal mortality ratios in Guatemala.

      Specific objectives

        -  Measure the impact of this intervention package on perinatal mortality rates.

        -  Measure the impact of this intervention package on the proportion of institution-based
           delivery among study facilities.

        -  Evaluate the processes and success of implementing this combined package of
           interventions by analyzing process indicators related to the intervention element
           designed to improve emergency obstetric and neonatal care (PRONTO: emergency obstetric
           and perinatal training program).

      Primary outcome of interest:

        1. Increase in the proportion of institutional deliveries in intervention vs. control
           clusters.

        2. Decrease perinatal death rate in intervention vrs control clinics
