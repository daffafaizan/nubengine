      and straighten the uterus for proper insertion; trans-cervical actions including measuring
      uterine depth, inserting the IUD insertion tube, and removing the tube; and placement of the
      device in the uterus.

      To minimize the discomfort and the hazards of an IUD insertion, several measures have been
      proposed including NSAIDs, anxiolytics, and local anesthetics in the form of intracervical
      gel, cervical and para-cervical block, but there have not done enough studies about their
      effectiveness. According to the review published in the Cochrane, non-steroidal
      anti-inflammatory drugs and misoprostol are not effective on reducing an IUD insertion pain.
      Many trials have been done about effectiveness of lidocaine gel in reducing pain during IUD
      insertion and only one of those trials showed positive effect of 2% lidocaine gel, while
      others failed.

      Lidocaine 2.5% and Prilocaine 2.5% Cream, is an emulsion in which the oil phase is a eutectic
      mixture of Lidocaine and Prilocaine cream in a ratio of 1:1 by weight. This eutectic mixture
      has a melting point below room temperature and therefore both local anesthetics exist as
      liquid oil rather than as crystals. Its absorption of from the genital mucosa is more rapid
      and onset time is shorter (5 to 10 minutes) than after application to intact skin. After a 5
      to 10 minute application of Lidocaine-Prilocaine cream to female genital mucosa, the average
      duration of effective analgesia was 15 to 20 minutes.
