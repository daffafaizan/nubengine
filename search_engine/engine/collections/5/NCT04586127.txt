    
      Adolescents and young Adults (AYA) Needs Assessment & Service Bridge (AYA NA-SB) includes a
      holistic Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROM) assessing AYAs' physical, psychosocial and
      practical needs and a collection of referral pathways for connecting AYAs to services and
      resources based on the needs they report.

      To assess the implementation of AYA NA-SB, the study team will pilot AYA NA-SB in the North
      Carolina Cancer Hospital (NCCH), with a primary focus on implementation outcomes. To
      establish proof-of-concept for AYA NA-SB, the study team will use pilot data to generate
      preliminary evidence on the extent to which AYA NA-SB addresses AYAs' reported needs. To plan
      for AYA NA-SB's scalability and sustainability in diverse health systems, the study team will
      conduct annual 60-minute semi-structured qualitative interviews with AYA providers and
      program leaders from approximately 8 health systems to proactively address challenges and
      prepare for future AYA NA-SB scale-up and sustainability.
