      viruses) that inhabit a particular organ. This prospective, multicentric, observational study
      investigates the bacterial changes that occur in the pulmonary microbiome during the first 72
      hours of mechanical ventilation in patients who have been intubated for non-pulmonary
      conditions in intensive care units (ICU).

      To this aim, genetic analyses will be performed on bronchial aspirate samples that will be
      collected from patients during their staying in ICU. Demographic and clinical information
      will be retrieved from patients' clinical reports and recorded in an apposite clinical report
      forms (CRF) in anonymized way. In particular, the reason for the admission to ICU, absence fo
      concomitant pulmonary diseases, comorbidities, body mass index, hematological examination
      results, concomitant therapies, antibiotic therapy performed in the 30 days prior to the
      admission, ventilation associated pneumonia (VAP)-preventing procedures, complications during
      mechanical ventilation, length of mechanical ventilation will be recorded in the CRF.

      The study will last 24 months.
