      biologically mediated bone loss in the surrounding pelvis. Particles can be found within
      immunologically active cells inside bone lesions. Holes intended for screw fixation in
      uncemented acetabular cups are believed to be a main route for these particles from the
      articulation into the pelvic bone. Using pressfit, screws are not always necessary for a
      successful fixation of an uncemented cup. The investigator's hypothesis is that a pressfit
      fixated cup without screw holes will display a decreased amount of periacetabular osteolysis
      compared to a cup with screw holes. Therefore, 95 hips (90 patients) were randomized to
      receive either pressfit cups without screw holes or the same type of cup with screw holes.
      The occurence and size of periacetabular osteolysis will be compared between the two groups.
      In addition, since the patients will have a computed tomography examination at 7 years and
      between 15 and 18 years the investigator will also analyze development of periacetabular
      osteolysis over time. The different cups were paired with three different types of femoral
      stems. Also, articulation wear and cup and stem fixation will be analyzed using
      radiostereometry.
