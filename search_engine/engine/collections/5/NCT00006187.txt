    
      This is a placebo-controlled, parallel-groups, 12 month, double-blind study, followed by a
      3-month, double-blind, randomized withdrawal period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of an
      investigational drug (currently approved for other indications) to slow the progression of
      symptoms of AD. Patients with probable AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA criteria who have a Mini
      Mental State Examination (MMSE) score between 13 and 26 inclusive will be eligible for
      participation in the study.

      Patients on stable doses of marketed cholinesterase inhibitors approved for the treatment of
      AD (except for tacrine) for at least 3 months are eligible for study entry. Use of NSAIDs
      (except aspirin 81 mg per day) is not allowed during the study.
