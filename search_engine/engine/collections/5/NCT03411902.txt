    
      This pilot study is a RCT, involving 24 participants randomized to Risedronate or placebo
      capsules for 24 weeks. All subjects planning a sleeve gastrectomy (SG) procedure will be
      approached during their pre-surgical evaluation for possible participation in the study.
      Eligible participants will be referred onto the study coordinator to read/sign an
      IRB-approved informed consent prior to enrollment.

      Two in-person baseline assessment visits [baseline visit 1 (BV1), baseline visit 2 (BV2)]
      occurring 1-6 weeks prior to surgery, and two in-person follow up assessment visits [follow
      up visit 1 (FV1) and follow up visit 2 (FV2)] occurring Â±2 weeks from their 23-week
      post-surgery date will be conducted, as well as monthly medication compliance reminders and
      adverse event reporting via phone. Optional additional exploratory assessments include
      CT-derive bone health and blood-based biomarkers, as well as 12-month DXA, CT, and blood
      assessments. The Wake Forest WMC, under the direction of Drs. Ard and Fernandez, will serve
      as a source of recruitment for potential study participants.
