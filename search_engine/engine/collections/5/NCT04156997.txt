      Southwestern Medical Center, Parkland Hospital, and overall Texas Health Resources health
      systems by screening the Electronic Medical Record (EMR) for those with lipid labs and values
      that satisfy criteria for extreme values. Identified participants will be recruited to
      provide health information via survey, permission to extract clinical information from the
      EMR, and blood collection for future analyses. Measurements will span direct measurement of
      circulating species, genetic analyses, and analysis of circulating cells. The blood specimens
      will be stored for future studies and collaborations and thus, will constitute a blood-based
      repository. All study procedures are experimental but do not involve an actual intervention.
