      the US adult population. Gastroesophageal reflux disease comprises a spectrum of acid-related
      disorders including symptomatic nonerosive gastroesophageal reflux disease and erosive
      esophagitis. It affects men and women in nearly equal proportions, and the severity and
      intensity of heartburn symptoms may be similar in both types of patients.

      Dexlansoprazole modified release is a dual delayed release formulation that consists of two
      types of granules contained in a single capsule. This dual delayed release formulation is
      designed to extend the duration of drug exposure and maintain pharmacologically active levels
      over a longer time period.

      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that participants with gastroesophageal reflux
      disease whose symptoms are well-controlled on twice daily proton pump inhibitors, remain
      well-controlled when switched to dexlansoprazole MR.
