      I. To characterize the effects of switching to nicotine vs. placebo standard research
      E-cigarettes (SRECs) from combustible cigarettes (CCs) on product use, product acceptability,
      reinforcement, and nicotine dependence symptoms among adult daily CC smokers.

      II. To characterize the differences between male and female CC smokers when switching to
      nicotine versus (vs.) placebo SRECs from CCs on product use, product acceptability,
      reinforcement, and nicotine dependence symptoms.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To characterize which factors moderate or mediate the effects of switching to nicotine and
      placebo SRECs from CCs among male and female CC smokers.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants will be instructed to smoke their usual brand cigarette as they normally would
      in weeks 1-2 (Phase I) and to use only the SREC (with or without nicotine) in weeks 3-4
      (Phase II) and in weeks 5-6 (Phase III). Participant assignment to SREC type at Phases II and
      III will be counter-balanced within group, with half of men and women receiving the placebo
      SREC during Phase II and half during Phase III. Participants will attend 4 laboratory visits
      with study investigators for 3 hours each over 6 weeks of study participation.
