      by the National Institute of Mental Health. Phase I included the use of marketing research
      (i.e. focus groups, adaptive conjoint analysis, and other survey methods) to produce two
      clinic-based interventions: a public service announcement (PSA) and interactive multimedia
      computer program (IMCP). The two clinic-based interventions are intended to include messages
      that will activate patients to talk with their physicians about specific health concerns
      (depression) and/or any depressive symptoms they've been experiencing. In Phase II (as
      described in this registration protocol), those interventions will undergo assessment in a
      randomized controlled effectiveness trial (RCT) in primary care settings in Sacramento and
      San Francisco.
