j. clin. endocr. 1965, 25/4 (457-464).antagonism between parathyroid extract and adrenalcortical steroids in man.metabolic balance studies were done in 2patients with hypoparathyroidism whoreceived hydrocortisone of prednisoneduring the administration of parathyroidextract.  administration of prednisone wasassociated with phosphate retention,decreased urinary ca, decreased serumca, citrate and glycoprotein concentrations,and increased serum phosphate.excretion of parathyroid activity in theurine of 1 patient was uninfluenced by theadministration of prednisone.  it is concludedthat the antagonistic effect of theadrenal cortical steroids was expressedat the biochemical sites of action of theparathyroid extract in bone and kidney,that the steroids reduce parathyroid secretionbut that their administration probably does notresult in degradation or inactivation ofthe hormone.
