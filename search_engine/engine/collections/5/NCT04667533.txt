    
      A total of up to approximately 24 patients will be enrolled to receive Desidustat in an
      open-label manner.

      The study is divided into three cohorts as given below:

        1. Cohort I: Single-dose 100 mg

        2. Cohort II: Single-dose 150 mg

        3. Cohort III: Single-dose 200 mg

      Note:- After evaluation of PK data of 100 mg dose cohort, next cohort with higher dose will
      be decided. Maximum dose of Desidustat will not be exceeded than 200 mg.

      First cohort will be given 100 mg single dose of Desidustat. On completion of safety and PK
      evaluation of first cohort,the next cohort with escalated single dose (150 mg) of Desidustat
      will be initiated. Similar way third cohort with 200 mg single dose will be initiated after
      safety evaluation of 150 mg cohort data.
