      ECG strip for fifteen minutes at rest will be recorded through a 12-bit analog/digital data
      acquisition card (National Instruments, Austin TX) with a sampling frequency of 200 Hz and
      stored in a computer for offline studies. The digitized ECG signals will than processed and
      analyzed via dedicated robust software to detect the R wave peaks. The R point of each QRS
      complex was defined and the interval between two consecutive R points (the R-R interval) was
      computed. All R-R intervals will be visually inspected and manually edited if necessary to
      exclude background noise and artifacts. The edited segments accounts for less than 1% in each
      patient. A "clean" 2-5-min segment (preferably unedited) will be used for the analyses. An
      autoregressive model with the order of 16 was will be used to estimate the power spectrum
      densities of HRV. The power spectra are quantified by measuring the area under the following
      frequency bands: low-frequency (LF) (0.04-0.15 Hz) known to represents sympathetic activity,
      and high-frequency (HF) (0.15-0.4 Hz) which represents parasympathetic activity.
