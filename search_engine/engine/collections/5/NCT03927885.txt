      I. To determine the effects of open labeled placebo one tablet twice a day (OLP) compared to
      waitlist control (WLC) for reducing cancer-related fatigue (CRF) as measured by the
      Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F) subscale in fatigued
      advanced cancer patients at the end of one week.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the preliminary efficacy open labeled placebo (OLP) and WLC on various
      fatigue dimensions - (Multidimensional Fatigue Symptom Inventory, MFSI-SF), depression (The
      Center for Epidemiologic Studies - Depression [CES-D]), cancer symptoms (Edmonton Symptom
      Assessment System [ESAS]), function and strength (six minute walk test, and 30-sec chair
      stand test), Global Symptom Evaluation (GSE), and quality of life (Functional Assessment of
      Cancer Therapy - General [FACT-G]) in these advanced cancer patients.

      II. To determine effects of OLP on fatigue symptom composite score (ESAS fatigue, pain and
      depression) at the end of 1st and 4th week.

      III. To examine the adherence and safety for the OLP as treatment for cancer related fatigue.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive open labeled placebo orally (PO) twice daily (BID) for 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression.

      ARM II: Patients are assigned to a waiting list during week 1. Beginning in week 2, patients
      receive open labeled placebo PO BID for 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression.
