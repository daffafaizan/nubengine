      day of examinations and 6 days of acclimatization in a climatic chamber in accordance with a
      well accepted protocol, the subjects will undergo 3 days of experiment that will include
      exposure to hot environmental conditions with different helmet-wearing scenarios, while
      wearing uniform and a combat vest: (a) without a helmet (b) with a helmet (c) with a helmet
      connected to a ventilation system. All 3 scenarios will include a two hour effort (walking on
      a treadmill) in heavy heat stress in the climatic chamber at our institute (the Heller
      institute of medical research).
