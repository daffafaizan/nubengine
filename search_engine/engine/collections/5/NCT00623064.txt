    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended doses of lapatinib ditosylate when
           administered with gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin, and determine on the basis of
           acute dose-limiting toxicity in course 1 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic
           transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial tract.

      Secondary

        -  To determine any relationship between drug exposure and adverse events in these
           patients.

        -  To assess the antitumor activity in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of lapatinib ditosylate.

        -  Lapatinib ditosylate, cisplatin, and gemcitabine hydrochloride: Patients receive oral
           lapatinib ditosylate once daily on days 1-28, cisplatin IV on day 2, and gemcitabine
           hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in
           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity until the recommended dose
           of lapatinib ditosylate is determined.

        -  Lapatinib ditosylate, cisplatin, gemcitabine hydrochloride: Subsequently enrolled
           patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate (beginning at one dose level below the
           recommended dose determined in the previous combination) once daily on days 1-21,
           cisplatin IV on day 1, gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes. Courses repeat
           every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      All patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for pharmacokinetic analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed weekly.
