      the collaboration with Study Center for Primary Care and with the Italian Society of
      Angiology and Vascular Medicine (SIAPAV).

      The eligible patients with stable CAD will be called by General Practitioners (GPs).

      For all patients who agree to participate in the study and sign the consent, two visits will
      be done at baseline and after 12 months.

      At baseline will be collected information on socio-demographic and anthropometric data, blood
      pressure, heart rate, CV risk factors, medical history, lifestyle habits, PAD stage (for
      patient with abnormal ABI) and pharmacological therapy. ABI measurement will be done using an
      automatic simple device. In case of abnormal ABI value, a SIAPAV vascular specialist, at GP's
      office, will confirm it using the standard manual continuous wave (CW) Doppler.

      At follow-up visit the following information will be collected the: referral to vascular
      specialist (if requested, at discretion of the GP), relevant change in pharmacological
      therapy, major CV events and progression of PAD, limb and coronary artery revascularizations,
      amputations, major bleeding, and death.
