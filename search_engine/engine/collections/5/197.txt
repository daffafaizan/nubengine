transduction in bacillus subtilis .(i) comparative examinations have shown that the temperate subtilisphages can be divided into two groups . b. subtilis strain nrs 231 wasan adequate common host sensitive to all the examined temperate phages .owing to certain technical advantages this strain was found suitablefor the titration subtilis phages .(ii) some cultural differences have been revealed among substrains ofb. subtilis 168 ind auxotrophs maintained in various laboratories .cells in one of these cultures were partly capable and partly incapableof using ammonia . ammonia assimilation was transducible to ammonianegative bacteria .(iii) after mitomycin c or ultraviolet ray induction the examined b.subtilis strains liberated /bacteriocin/-like principles . this findingis probably analogous to that of seaman et al. concerning pbsx defectivephages . on the basis of bacteriocin production the examined strainswere divided into two groups .(iv) several temperate phages isolated in our laboratory werepresumably identical with phage pbs 1 . phage sp 10 differed from theseagents both in antigenic structure and in host range .(v) transduction by some lysates of pbs 1-type phages was observed atfrequencies of the order of 10 . considerably more and less effectivephage materials were yielded by some lysogenic transductants . thustransducing phages active in the order of 10 were prepared .(vi) transduction frequency, in addition to the properties of thephage, was influenced by the physiological condition of bacteria .(vii) transduction of indole and histidine loci was studied by use ofhis derivatives of strain 168 ind .
