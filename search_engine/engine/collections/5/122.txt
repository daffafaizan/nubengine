aneurysm of the membranous septum .1. aneurysms of the membranous septum are relatively rare lesionspresumably developing on a congenital basis . these aneurysms originatein the left ventricle immediately beneath the aortic valve and bulgeinto the right ventricle, the septal leaflet of the tricuspid valve orinto the right atrium .2. many of these aneurysms do not produce symptoms . others may causeright ventricular outflow tract obstruction or may rupture and result ina septal defect . the resulting shunt will be from the left ventricleinto the right atrium or ventricle .3. an aneurysm of the membranous septum may be an isolated abnormalityor be associated with other congenital cardiac defects, particularlyaortic valvular insufficiency . membranous septal aneurysms may be thesite of bacterial endocarditis or thrombus formation .4. aneurysms resembling those arising from the membranous septum mayoccur as part of the complex of deformities produced by an endocardialcushion defect . however, the angiographic features diagnostic of acushion defect can still be recognized .5. the presence of a septal aneurysm can be established only byangiocardiography . the diagnostic features as seen on the leftventricular angiocardiogram are presented .
