      ketamine IV boluses for acute pain in the Emergency Department. Studies involving continuous
      infusions or intranasal routes of ketamine administration were not included. Thirteen
      randomized clinical trials were identified meeting this criteria. None of these trials
      directly compared ketamine doses within the 0.1-0.3 mg/kg range for pain score reduction and
      adverse events. Many of these trials concluded with the recommendation that further studies
      were needed to evaluate the optimal dosing of ketamine for acute pain and determine which
      populations are most ideal for its use. This study will be the first to evaluate ketamine for
      acute pain in the emergency department at standard of care doses (0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, and
      0.3 mg/kg IV) to determine which dose correlates with the most efficacy and safety.

      This study will include the following procedures:

        -  Patient consent, screening, and enrollment will be performed by the treating resident or
           attending who will remain blinded

        -  Patient will be assigned a subject number

        -  Treating resident or attending will notify the ED pharmacist that a patient has been
           enrolled in the trial

        -  ED pharmacist will notify the IV room and place the study drug order

        -  Either the ED pharmacist or a pharmacy supervisor will randomize the subject based on
           the predetermined randomization list

        -  Study drug will be prepared as 0.1 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, or 0.3 mg/kg IV dose in a 100 mL
           solution of dextrose 5% or sodium chloride 0.9%

        -  ED pharmacist will promptly deliver the study drug to the ED

        -  Baseline vital signs will be assessed prior to starting the study drug infusion

        -  Study drug will be administered via IV infusion over 20 minutes

        -  Treating resident or attending will reassess the patient at 15 minutes from the end of
           infusion, at 30 minutes from the end of infusion, and then every 30 minutes for up to
           120 minutes or until discharge, whichever is sooner
