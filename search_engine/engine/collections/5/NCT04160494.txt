      atezolizumab and D2C7-IT to determine the impact of the combination of D2C7-IT and
      atezolizumab on safety. D2C7-IT will be delivered intratumorally by Convection Enhanced
      Delivery (CED) using an intracerebral catheter placed within the enhancing portion of the
      tumor. The dose of D2C7-IT was reduced from 6920 ng/mL to 4613.2 ng/mL after the first 4
      patients as a precaution due to safety events experienced by these 4 patients.

      Atezolizumab will be administered according to the FDA-approved dosing schedule of 1200 mg
      intravenously every 3 weeks, beginning ~2 weeks after the D2C7-IT infusion.

      Toxicity will be carefully monitored for each patient while they are on study for at least a
      year after D2C7-IT treatment or for at least 30 days after the final dose of atezolizumab if
      the patient continues atezolizumab on-study for longer than a year post-D2C7-IT. Of
      particular interest will be the incidence of adverse events that occur during the first 28
      days after D2C7-IT treatment and the inflammatory events that occur during the first year
      after D2C7-IT treatment.

      The most common risks associated with D2C7-IT are effects related to tumor necrosis,
      neurologic changes (including changes in function, new or increased seizures, swelling of the
      brain, and injury to blood vessels), effects related to catheter placement or removal, and
      effects related to fluid infusion into the brain. The most common risks associated with
      atezolizumab are fatigue, decreased appetite, diarrhea, and nausea. Because atezolizumab
      works with the immune system, it can cause the immune system to attack normal organs or
      tissue and affect how they work.
