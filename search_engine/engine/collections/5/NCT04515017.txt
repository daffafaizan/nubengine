      degeneration of retinal ganglion cells and their axons. Retinal ganglion cells, RGCs is a
      kind of central nervous system neuron whose cell bodies are located in the retina and axons
      make up the optic nerve. When antihypertensive drugs or laser therapy can not reach the
      target intraocular pressure, trabeculectomy (TRAB) is still the standard surgical method for
      glaucoma. The scarring of the operative area is a common reason for the failure of
      trabeculectomy. After trabeculectomy, maintaining the shape and function of the filtering
      bleb is an important aspect to maintain the surgical effect. The increase in the number of
      blood vessels on the filtering bleb and the morphological curvature are often the
      manifestations of decompensation of the filtering bleb. Angiogenesis in the filtering bleb
      region plays an important role in surgical incision healing and is related to the
      accompanying scar formation. Therefore, the evaluation of vascular distribution of filtering
      blebs is an important index and early parameter to evaluate the success or failure of
      surgery. With the improvement of detection methods, it is possible to use AS-OCTA to evaluate
      the function and prognosis of filtering bleb after trabeculectomy. Antimitotic drugs such as
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or mitomycin C (MMC) have always been the most commonly used clinical
      drugs, but the side effects caused by their use are not satisfactory. It is still the
      research direction of glaucoma to find new targets for regulating wound healing and more safe
      and effective drugs.
