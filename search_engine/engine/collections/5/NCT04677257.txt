      myocardial infarction treated with successful primary PCI, to assess the ability of coronary
      physiology parameters, i.e. coronary flow reserve (CFR) and index of microvascular resistance
      (IMR) measured after recanalization to predict myocardial tissue characterization (MVO, MSI,
      IS, T2-rt, T1-rt and ECV) assessed with contrast CMR within a week of the acute event.
      Furthermore, the relationship between left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and of coronary
      physiology parameters will be evaluated.
