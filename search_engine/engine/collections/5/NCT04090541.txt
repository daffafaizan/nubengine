      Kenzo Kase in the 1970s. KT is a complementary method which is used as an adjunct to major
      therapy approaches in various musculoskeletal and neurological diseases.4 KT is employed in
      sports injuries and various health problems; but there is limited scientific evidence
      evaluating KT effectiveness and the results are inconsistent.5 One of the KT potential
      benefits is that of raising the range of motion through increasing blood circulation or
      through stimulation of cutaneous mechanoreceptors and this way it affects fascial tissue.6-8
      Biomechanical Taping (BT) is a technique utilizing a four way elastic tape originally created
      by Ryan Kendrick in the 2010s. BT is a complementary method for supplementing load
      absorption, force contribution and modifying movement. BT affects tissues and movement in a
      mechanical way and it is almost a completely different method from KT. Kase's hypothesis is
      that KT affects fascial tissues and mechanoreseptors, but Kendrick's hypothesis is that BT
      ,which is applied in shortened position and cross joint segments, will gain potential energy
      in case of an extremity realized movement with antagonist activity. Then the weak agonist
      muscle gets activated for repositioning the extremity; this potential energy turns to kinetic
      energy like a released bow. As a result of kinetic energy, it may support the movement with
      using passive mechanical strength.9 In this study, the investigators aim to illustrate
      immediate effects of various taping methods on the performances of healthy subjects. In that
      way the investigators test hypothesis that different taping methods affect healthy subjects
      to improve performance. The investigators; investigate strength, active range of motion and
      vertical jump height as a parameters of performance with No Tape(NT), Sham Tape(ST), KT and
      BT.
