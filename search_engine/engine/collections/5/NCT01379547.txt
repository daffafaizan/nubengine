    
      The duration of antibiotic therapy in patients with sepsis is largely empirical. An extended
      treatment course for up to two weeks is a common practice for patients with sepsis in the
      ICU, despite lack of evidence for this duration of therapy.

      Procalcitonin (PCT) is a new biomarker that has high negative predictive value for systemic
      bacterial infection. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate whether serial PCT measurements
      can shorten antibiotic treatment duration in patients with sepsis in the ICU.

      Specific Aims

        1. To show that implementation of a procalcitonin-guided antibiotics stewardship algorithm
           may result in shortened antibiotics course in ICU sepsis patients

        2. To show that implementation of a procalcitonin-guided antibiotics stewardship algorithm
           may not result in inferior outcome as compared to conventional therapy
