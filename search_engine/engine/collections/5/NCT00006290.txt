      investigators to examine dissatisfaction with body image as a predictor variable in analyses
      of premature study drug discontinuation, loss to follow-up, and study drug non-adherence, and
      as a secondary outcome in antiretroviral and fat redistribution treatment trials.

      Six focus group interviews, each lasting approximately 2 hours, are conducted at 4 AACTG
      sites. Separate groups are run for men and women, and male groups are segmented by sexual
      orientation. A moderator leads discussions about patients' perceived changes in body habitus
      and body image. Group interviews are audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative
      interview data are sent electronically to the Data Management Center, where they are
      thematically analyzed using qualitative data analysis (content analysis) techniques. Salient
      focus group findings are used to construct questionnaire items.
