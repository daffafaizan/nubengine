      co-morbid depression. Since 65% of patients with DM die from cardiovascular disease (CVD),
      concomitant control of CVD risk factors along with glycemic control is crucial to prevent
      adverse outcomes. However, co-morbid depression makes DM and CVD risk factors harder to
      control. We demonstrated that a pharmacist-led group visit model consisting of: 1)
      pharmacotherapy management for DM, hyperlipidemia and hypertension, 2) self-management
      education, 3) case management and 4) behavioral strategies for DM and CVD self-care
      behaviors, was more efficacious in improving hyperglycemia and CVD risk factors compared to
      standard primary care controls in a general DM population and also for patients with DM and
      co-morbid depression. For participants with DM and depression there was also a
      non-significant trend toward improvement in depression despite the lack of depression
      treatment.

      OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to determine whether group visits with added behavioral
      activation (BA) for depression (cases) will have a greater clinical impact than our standard
      group visits without BA for depression (active control) in reducing the risk of future
      coronary events as measured by the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) risk
      engine and depression symptoms as measured by Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) after 6
      months.

      RESEARCH PLAN/METHODS: The goal is to conduct a randomized-controlled pilot trial (n=25 in
      each arm) to evaluate the clinical effect of added BA to our group intervention in patients
      with DM and depression who have a Hemoglobin A1c>=8% and a PHQ-9 depression score >=10 and at
      least one additional CVD risk factor such as tobacco use, hyperlipidemia or hypertension not
      at American Heart Association and American Diabetes Association guideline recommended goals.
      The interventions in both arms will consist of 4 weekly group visits of 2-hour duration
      followed by monthly booster group visits for 6 months to prevent relapse.

      The primary aims are:

        -  1) To examine the effects of our group visit model with and without added BA therapy on
           the 10-year UKPDS coronary event risk, and PHQ-9 depression scores after 6 months

        -  2) To examine the acceptability and adherence to our group visit model with and without
           added BA therapy by way of focus groups and attendance

      The secondary aim is

        -  1) To explore mediating factors of our group visit model with added BA therapy that are
           associated with improvement in CVD risk and depression
