      the safety of the combination with azacitidine. The starting dose will be 400 mg. Azacitidine
      will be continued at maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Evaluation will be based on cycle 1
      toxicity profile. Once MTD will be determined, 20 additional patients will be treated at
      recommended dose.
