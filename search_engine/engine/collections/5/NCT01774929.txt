      told which treatments the participants are receiving, "unblinded"), single-arm, prospective
      (study following participants forward in time), study of TTS-fentanyl in participants with
      moderate to severe pain of osteoarthritis. The study will consist of 2 phases: screening
      phase up to 7 days before starting the treatment and treatment phase of 30 days. The first
      patch will be applied by investigator then by participants until 30 days. The dose of
      TTS-fentanyl can be increased, if needed, by 12.5 microgram per hour until adequate
      (reasonably good) pain control is achieved and taking into account the daily dose of
      supplemental paracetamol required by the participant. Other concomitant (given at the same
      time) analgesics (drug used to control pain) will not be used during this phase. Efficacy
      with regard to pain control will be recorded principally by the participant through
      questionnaires in a daily diary. This record will be used to support more detailed
      assessments at study visits on Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index
      (WOMAC) questionnaire. Participants' safety will be monitored.
