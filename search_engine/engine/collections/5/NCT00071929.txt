        -  Determine the antitumor activity of oxaliplatin in terms of response rate in patients
           with persistent or recurrent endometrial carcinoma that is refractory to curative or
           established therapy.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study.
