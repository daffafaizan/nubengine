    
      A placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover trial will be conducted providing study
      subjects either hydrocodone/acetaminophen 30mg/975mg, sustained release morphine 45mg or
      placebo on separate GCRC visits. A long acting comparator (slow-release morphine sulfate 45
      mg) will be chosen because of its putative equianalgesic effects to the dose of hydrocodone
      (30 mg) selected. Subjects will participate in the three sessions at the UC Davis/Mather
      Medical Center General Clinical Research Center (GCRC) at intervals of 7-10 days. Sessions
      will be approximately 360 min in duration. Subjects will receive either
      hydrocodone/acetaminophen or sustained release morphine around-the-clock for 7-10 days prior
      to the experimental session. At each experimental session, an assessment of abuse liability
      will be completed before the intake of medications, as well as at 0, 60, 120, 180, 240
      minutes after the ingestion of the study medication.
