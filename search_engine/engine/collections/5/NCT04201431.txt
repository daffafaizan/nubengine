    
      This Phase I/IIa clinical trial is designed to primarily assess the safety of the
      PvDBPII-Matrix M1 vaccine in healthy volunteers and to establish whether the PvDBPII-Matrix
      M1 vaccine can demonstrate a reduced parasite multiplication rate in vaccinated subjects
      compared to infectivity controls in a blood-stage controlled human malaria infection model.

      Up to 24 healthy volunteers aged 18-45 will be recruited in England at the Centre for
      Clinical Vaccinology and Tropical Medicine, Churchill Hospital, Oxford.

      All volunteers will receive three doses of the PvDBPII 50ug/Matrix M1 50ug candidate vaccine
      prior to blood-stage CHMI 2-4 weeks after the third vaccination

      Volunteers will undergo blood stage CHMI with Plasmodium vivax.

      Volunteers in a parallel study (VAC069), who will undergo the same CHMI without prior
      vaccination, will be used as infectivity controls.

      Participants in Group 1 will be followed for approximately 9 months after the third
      vaccination, approximately 2 years in total from enrolment. Participants in Group 2 will be
      followed for 1 year from enrolment.
