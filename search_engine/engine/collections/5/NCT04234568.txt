    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety and to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of lutetium Lu
      177 dotatate in combination with triapine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the overall response rate
      (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months
      post therapy.

      III. To measure duration of response (DOR) associated with the combination. IV. To evaluate
      progression-free survival (PFS), 24-month PFS, and overall survival (OS).

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. Measure baseline 68 gallium-dotatate biodistribution. II. Evaluate oral triapine plasma
      pharmacokinetics and corresponding methemoglobin level by venous blood gas proportion.

      III. Evaluate NETest at baseline and disease progression to correlate result with clinical
      outcome.

      IV. Describe the tumor molecular profile using whole exome sequencing (WES), as well as
      ribonucleic acid sequencing (RNAseq) by the National Clinical Laboratory Network (NCLN)
      Genomics Lab, and correlate it with treatment outcome.

      V. Collect plasma for circulating deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) assessment.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of triapine.

      Patients receive lutetium Lu 177 dotatate intravenously (IV) over 30-40 minutes on day 1 and
      triapine orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks (56 days)
      for up to 4 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 24 months.
