      The elevated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations of long distance
      runners has been ascribed almost exclusively to increased muscle lipoprotein lipase. Based on
      data collected in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, the investigators proposed an
      alternative theory: long-distance runners had the HDL-cholesterol metabolism of men who were
      below their sedentary weight rather than the HDL-cholesterol metabolism of lean sedentary men
      who were at their usual sedentary weight. In other analyses, they found that the most
      significant determinant of male runners' plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations was the
      difference between the runners' greatest weight and their current weight. HDL- cholesterol
      levels were highest in runners who had lost the most weight, i.e., highest in those who were
      presumed to be the furthest below their weight set-point

      The study was a result of a Program Announcement (PA) released in October, 1994 on Physical
      Activity and Cardiopulmonary Health. The PA was jointly sponsored by the NHLBI, the National
      Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, and the National Institute of
      Nursing Research.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      In this cross-sectional study, runners and sedentary men and women were measured for
      lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of HDL and
      low-density lipoprotein subclasses, apolipoproteins A-I and B, intravenous fat clearance
      rate, post-heparin lipoprotein lipase and hepatic lipase, adipose tissue lipoprotein lipase,
      cholesteryl ester transfer activity, diet, percent body fat, and regional adiposity. It was
      hoped that the survey would confirm or reject the weight set-point hypothesis, provide a
      possible explanation of the lipoprotein differences between male and female runners, and
      elucidate the mechanism for the lipoprotein changes that occur during exercise-induced weight
      loss.

      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the "End Date" entered in
      the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) record.
