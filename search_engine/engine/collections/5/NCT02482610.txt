    
      This study consists of three, 3-hour postprandial trials in response to consuming the
      following dietary treatments: 1. oral glucose challenge, 2. oral glucose challenge in
      combination with non-fat milk, and 3. oral glucose challenge in combination with whole milk.
      For three days preceding each trial, participants will be provided all meals to standardize
      physiologic responses to test meals. On each trial day, vascular function will be assessed
      and blood samples collected prior to and at 30 minute intervals for 3 hours following test
      meal ingestion.
