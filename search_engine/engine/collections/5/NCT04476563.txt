    
      Checkpoint inhibitor-induced liver injury (ChILI) is a new incompletely understood category
      of hepatotoxicity which is distinct from other types of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) such
      as direct or idiosyncratic DILI. The data regarding the incidence and risk factors is
      lacking. Therefore, 'in-depth phenotyping' together with data from the control group exposed
      to checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) is necessary to develop refined algorithms incorporating
      CPI-related factors, host genetic and environmental risk factors that would enable
      pre-empting ChILI.

      The aim of the study is to enroll two deeply phenotyped cohorts (patients who developed ChILI
      and patients who are starting checkpoint inhibitors) and obtain biological samples at
      multiple time points.
