      are aimed at making the transplanted kidney function sooner and last longer than is usual
      with standard immunosuppression regimens, but without increasing the likelihood of rejection.

      The first innovation, delivering the induction agent rATG in a single large dose rather than
      as a series of smaller doses over 6-8 days, is expected to produce better graft function
      right away, possibly by reducing some of the injury to the kidney that accompanies the
      restoration of blood flow during transplantation ("reperfusion injury"). Some evidence has
      been developed by investigators elsewhere to suggest this will happen.

      The second innovation, replacing tacrolimus with MMF after 6 months, is intended to eliminate
      a well-established major cause of ongoing toxic damage to the kidney. While tacrolimus does a
      good job of preventing rejection, the cost in continuing toxic injury to the kidney is high,
      leading inevitably to eventual graft failure, the inability of the transplanted kidney to
      continue filtering the blood and making adequate volumes of high-quality urine.
