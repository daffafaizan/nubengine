      estrogen suppression such as ovarian ablation, tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor has proven
      beneficial in both adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Zoladex, a kind of luitinizing hormone
      releasing hormone analogue, can offer efficient estrogen suppression as well. It can induce
      reversible amenorrhea and the clinical effect is similar to ovarian ablation. Some studies
      have demonstrated the efficacy of zoladex in treating pre and perimenopausal hormone
      dependent breast cancer in both adjuvant and metastatic settings. Few data is available on
      Zoladex in neoadjuvant treatment for breast cancer In our departments, neoadjuvant CEF
      regimen is of general practice, and a preliminary study is designed to investigate whether
      adding Zoladex into neoadjuvant CEF could further improve results in hormone responsive
      breast cancer.
