      three years of life with a slow introduction of gluten during the follow-up period will
      induce tolerance to gluten. A similar hypothesis is tested if a daily supply of two different
      lactobacillus (LB) strains can suppress an inflammatory response to gluten in the intestine
      by stimulating regulatory T-cells and reduced permeability of gluten peptides in the
      intestine.

      The secondary hypothesis tested is that celiac disease can not be prevented, but the onset of
      the disease will be delayed in children returning to a gluten-containing diet after the
      intervention period (gluten free diet) or probiotic treatment) during the first three years
      of life. The intervention period is 3 years and the follow-up period is further 4 years.

      The primary aim is to study the proportion of children who develop celiac disease
      autoimmunity and progression to celiac disease by the age of 3 years. Secondary aim is to
      study the proportion of children who developed celiac disease at the age of 7 years.
