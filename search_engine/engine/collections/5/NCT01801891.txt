      The negative impact of leg ulceration on patients' quality of life and on healthcare costs is
      well recognised. Increased prevalence combined with poor reported healing rates and high
      incidence of ulcer recurrence makes the development of a new treatment which could accelerate
      healing rates beyond that currently achieved using compression bandaging most desirable.
      Surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation in combination with compression bandaging may
      provide such a treatment.

      Surface neuromuscular electrical stimulation (SNMES) is the application of an electrical
      stimulus to motor points in the body using electrodes placed on the surface of the skin to
      elicit a muscular contraction. It has been shown that SNMES of the calf muscles, when used in
      conjunction with compression therapy, provides improved venous flow velocities over
      compression therapy alone. Furthermore, the week-long effect of SNMES and compression therapy
      on healthy participants was found to be well tolerated by all participants and resulted in
      increases in stimulated venous flow and muscle strength. A combined SNMES and compression
      treatment protocol which stimulates peripheral venous blood flow may help to alleviate
      harmful venous pressures in venous leg ulcer patients and provide some degree of
      strengthening of the calf muscles, thus helping to accelerate the healing rates of venous
      ulcers.
