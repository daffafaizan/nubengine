      with a prevalence of 0.5-7,6%. Frequent or daily headache leads to constraints in the child's
      life in relation to school and social activities.

      The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are not yet fully examined. In several studies
      in adults and in children it is found that the shoulder muscles are tense and tender, but it
      is not known whether this phenomenon is primary or secondary to tension-type headache. A
      decrease in muscle capacity is furthermore found in studies. We therefore aim at examining
      parameters for muscle function in order to compare the differences between children with and
      without headache, and at examining the effect of a 10 week progressive specific strength
      training programme on headache compared to an in time comparable multidisciplinary
      intervention based on lifestyle counseling.
