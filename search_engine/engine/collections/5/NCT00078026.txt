    
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel-group study to
      investigate the efficacy and safety of administering 3 dose levels of APOMINE at 25, 50, or
      100 mg/day or placebo once a day as a capsule to postmenopausal women with low bone mass or
      osteoporosis. Eligible patients must be women between 45 and 75 years of age, have a
      diagnosed low bone mineral density or osteoporosis, and be at least 3 years post menopause.
      The primary endpoint of the study will be changes in bone formation markers (bone alkaline
      phosphatase and osteocalcin). The secondary endpoint of the study will be changes in bone
      formation markers (bone alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin, and P-ICP) and bone resorption
      markers (serum C-telopeptide, urinary N-telopeptide). Blood samples will be drawn at each
      study visit to determine these bone markers as well as for normal laboratory tests. Bone
      mineral density measurements (DEXA) will be performed at the beginning and at the end of the
      study. Up to 60 subjects will be randomized as a cohort for treatment and treated with 25,
      50, or 100 mg/day or placebo (15 subjects per group). All enrolled subjects will receive a
      daily calcium and Vitamin D supplement.
