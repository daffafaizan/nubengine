      Program objectives are to increase parents' knowledge and skills related to nutrition,
      physical activity, and best parenting practices. Developed from a successful existing
      program, the proposed program will include a novel classroom curriculum coupled with outside
      exercises, online resources, and a strong social support network. The curriculum will be
      developed with input from stakeholders during year 1 and implemented during years 2 and 3.
      The target groups are children and parents participating in 4-H Youth Development Programs in
      Montana. Intervention effectiveness will be assessed by comparing objective and self-report
      data between-groups (intervention vs. control) and within-groups (pre- to post-intervention
      and at 6 month follow-up). Physiological measures, including resting heart rate, blood
      pressure, body weight and age- and gender-specific BMI z-scores of children, are expected to
      show significant improvement among children of parents receiving the intervention compared to
      a mailed written materials control group. In addition, positive changes are anticipated in
      outcome measures provided by parents and children, including levels of daily physical
      activity and specific food and nutrition behaviors. Positive changes in parents' attitudes
      about diet, body image, and their perceived feeding practices before versus after
      intervention and at 6 month follow-up are also expected. This project will lead to improved
      understanding of how parents influence child obesity and improved interventions to prevent
      obesity.
