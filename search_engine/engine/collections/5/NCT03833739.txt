      randomly divided into two groups; Group one (28 patients): orthodontic treatment with upper
      arch bond up first and lower arch was bonded when 4 mm overjet was reached. The treatment
      continued until 0.019 x 0.025 " stainless steel wires were reached in both arches. Group 2
      (26 patients): orthodontic treatment with lower arch bond up first with removable anterior
      bite plane in upper arch. When 0.019 x 0.025" stainless steel wire was reached, the upper
      arch was bonded. The treatment continued until 0.019 x 0.025" stainless steel wires were
      reached. Three cephalograms were taken for each patient in both groups; pretreatment (T0) ,
      after bonding the other arch (T1) and at the end of leveling and alignment in both arches
      (T2). Cephalometric measurements and superimpositions were made. Skeletal and dentoalveolar
      treatment changes were compared within and between the 2 groups.
