response of a serum glycoprotein to tissue injuryand necrosis1. the response to necrosis, hyperplasia and tumour growtha serum glycoprotein of the rat underwent a 20-fold increase during 15 daysgrowth of the walker tumour and this increase was not affected when the ratswere treated with terramycin.  the protein increased at the same or a greaterrate when rats were subjected to ischaemic necrosis of one kidney or of two-thirds of the liver.  boiled kidney tissue, on the other hand, had littleeffect upon the protein response, and kidney hyperplasia had none.  it issuggested that this protein increase is a response to substances liberated fromdamaged or necrotic cells.
