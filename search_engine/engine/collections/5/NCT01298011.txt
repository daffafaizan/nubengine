      patients have recurrence of the cancer after successful surgery. The investigators are
      evaluating chemotherapy before surgery, which is a new approach.

      In this study, Abraxane and gemcitabine will be tested as treatment for people with operable
      pancreatic cancer to see if surgery can be successfully performed and if treatment will
      reduce cancer cells in the tumor at surgery.

      Abraxane is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer after
      failure of combination chemotherapy for metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of
      adjuvant chemotherapy. Gemcitabine is approved by the FDA for first line treatment for
      patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancer of the pancreas.
