      to enhanced usual care [n=70; 35/group], with eligible youth to assess intervention
      acceptability, feasibility, and fidelity, as well as trends towards decreased risky firearm
      behaviors, substance use, and criminal justice involvement. Specifically, 70 youth (ages
      16-24) in the ED screening positive for firearm carriage and smartphone ownership will be
      randomly assigned (stratified by age/gender) to either the IntERact group or the control
      group. IntERact group participants will receive an Emergency Department (ED) session of
      behavioral therapy, followed by five additional remote therapy sessions of behavioral therapy
      delivered over the 5 weeks following their ED visit. Behavioral therapy will be comprised of
      motivational interviewing (MI), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and strengths-based care
      management (CM). In addition, youth in the IntERact group will also receive a smartphone APP
      that will be downloaded to their phone. The APP will deliver daily surveys, daily tailored MI
      and CBT messages in response to survey results, one-touch access to pro-social supports,
      psycho-educational materials, GPS-enabled message alerts, and facilitated access to CM
      resources. Youth enrolled in the control group will receive a pamphlet with local violence,
      substance use, and mental health resources. A follow-up assessment will be completed in each
      group at 4 months post-ED visit. Pilot data will aid in refining and clarifying content and
      clinical trial design elements for a future fully powered randomized control trial of the
      intervention (i.e., R01 proposal).
