      most common surgical approach to perform a total knee replacement is called medial
      parapatellar approach, or simply medial approach. It's effective and can be applied virtually
      to all types of knee deformities. The Keblish approach is an alternative approach which uses
      the lateral side of the patella to enter the joint. It's also called lateral parapatellar
      approach. Some orthopaedic surgeons consider the latter approach a better option when facing
      a valgus deformity of the osteoarthritic knee. Theoretically, the Keblish approach can
      promote better soft tissue balance and patellar tracking, but there is no convincing evidence
      on the literature supporting one or another approach for a total knee replacement on valgus
      knee. The objective of this prospective and randomized clinical trial is to compare the
      medial vs lateral approach for total knee replacement on valgus knee.
