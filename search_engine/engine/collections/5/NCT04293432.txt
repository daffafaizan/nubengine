    
      Drug-induced Torsade de Pointes (TdP) is a serious but an overlooked adverse drug reaction
      because a wide range of marketed drugs associated with TdP are commonly prescribed in routine
      practice. Owing to the heightened concern of a vast number of drug-TdP associations including
      newly approved drugs, the investigators, therefore, aims to investigate drug-TdP associations
      by performing disproportionality analysis in order to identify new signals of TdP utilizing
      the individual case reports of TdP in the FAERS database.
