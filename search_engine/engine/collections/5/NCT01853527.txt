      with reduced quality of life and increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. The
      project will recruit patients with angina pectoris and non-obstructive CAD by CT- coronary
      angiography for further imaging with contrast stress echocardiography for diagnosis of
      myocardial ischemia. Better characterization of patients with symptomatic non-obstructive CAD
      due to myocardial ischemia will be done by vascular assessment by tonometry, biochemical and
      genetic markers as well as quality of life questionnaire. This interdisciplinary project is
      expected to add new knowledge to the impact of multimodality cardiac imaging in improving
      diagnosis in patients with symptomatic non-obstructive CAD.
