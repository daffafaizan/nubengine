      stimulation (tDCS) treatment using an investigational device called the Soterix tES Device
      (tDCS device) on the right side of the brain can improve performance on cognitive tests.
      Investigational means that the tDCS device is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) for the use in this study.

      tDCS is a non-invasive way to electrically stimulate the brain. The tDCS device is portable
      and runs on two 9-volt batteries. Electrodes from the tDCS device carry weak electrical
      current through the scalp and skull and into the brain. When the direction of the electric
      current flow is called cathodal, the brain under the site of stimulation reduces its
      activity.

      When tasks are performed, certain parts of the brain are activated. Research studies have
      shown that younger adults and older adults activate similar parts of the brain when
      performing the same task (a memory task, for example). However, other researchers found older
      adults who scored worse on memory tasks, and those with Mild Cognitive Impairment, activated
      an additional part of the brain so both sides of the brain are activated. Researchers are not
      sure whether this additional activation is helpful or not. Investigators in this study
      believe that this extra activation may be contributing to worse performance on tasks.

      It may be possible to use tDCS to reduce the brain activity on the extra activation (right)
      side in older adults, to resemble an activation pattern seen in younger adults (or higher
      scoring cohort). Using cathodal tDCS to reduce brain activity might help the brain in
      performing tasks.
