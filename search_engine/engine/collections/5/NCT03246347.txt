      complete response rate in patients with metastatic hormone sensitive prostate cancer treated
      with ADT, docetaxel and enzalutamide. The primary endpoint of this study will be 12-month PSA
      complete response rate, which will be assessed against a contemporary historical control rate
      for the combination of ADT and docetaxel alone in the metastatic hormone naive setting. The
      study will be conducted at all participating sites across North and South Carolina within the
      Levine Cancer Institute network. Enrollment is anticipated to be completed within 24 months.
