    
      We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial of an Internet-enabled, automated
      self-management program. The study will be carried out through six local sites (offices) of a
      large employer. 3 sites will be intervention sites and 3 will be control sites.

      Subjects enrolled from the intervention sites will receive a blood pressure meter and access
      to an Internet site where they can view their readings, read educational material regarding
      hypertension management and receive personalized tips and feedback.

      Subjects enrolled from the control sites will have access to a blood pressure monitor located
      at their workplace but will only be provided with basic written information about
      hypertension at the start of the trial and will receive no feedback.

      The trial will run for 6 months from the time of enrollment and the primary outcome measure
      will be a change in systolic blood pressure.
