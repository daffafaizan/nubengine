      Null (Ho): The incidence of moist desquamation with the spray skin protector is greater than
      or equal to the incidence of moist desquamation in the control group.

      Alternative (H1): The incidence of moist desquamation with the spray skin protector is lower
      than the incidence of moist desquamation in the control group.

      The skin evaluation of the participants will be weekly, with blinding of this professional.
      For the assessment of secondary objectives, adverse events will be applied to the diarrhea
      assessment scales of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) and CTCAE version 5.0; for
      pruritus the CTCAE scale; for pain the Analog Visual Scale (VAS) and the burning or burning
      sensation will only be recorded.
