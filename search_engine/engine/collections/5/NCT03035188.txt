      12 weeks which applies to the routine use of vismodegib. This period is chosen because within
      this time side effects are acceptable and response is expected. Tumor examination will be
      performed monthly to expeditiously identify patients with progressive disease. This will be
      done by non-invasive imaging techniques thus a further objective of this study is the testing
      of diagnostic suitability of non-invasive methodology for the evaluation of response status
      of the patients.

      Patients in this clinical trial will be treated with an effective medication which is
      approved for the therapy of metastatic and locally advanced BCC for a time having been shown
      to be effective in neoadjuvant setting The same dose as approved for the advanced BCC disease
      is used, therefore it can be expected that the side effects will be predictable. Furthermore
      there are no hints in literature that the efficacy of the used medication may be decreased in
      patients with resectable BCC.

      Since the study patients are less sick than those for whom treatment with vismodegib is
      approved, surgery would be their therapy according to guideline. Thus the risk of vismodegib
      treatment has to be judged against the greater surgical risk if BCC will be operated directly
      without prior reduction of tumor lesion. A benefit for the great majority of the patients
      will be that smaller lesions result in minor scars and better cosmetically outcome of
      surgery.
