      release of specific mediators (such as proteins), genetics (Deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA)
      and/or the body's "instructions" for making proteins (Ribonucleic Acid or RNA) may effect the
      body's clinical response to a stress such as an infection.Epinephrine (adrenaline) is a
      substance produced by the body (in the adrenal gland)in response to stress such as infection
      or injury. Endotoxin is a man- made substance, which causes the body to "mimic" sickness
      (fever, chills, and achiness) for a few hours. This study is designed to give epinephrine
      before and/or after endotoxin to determine if this medication can prevent or relieve any of
      the symptoms caused by endotoxin.In addition, this study may determine whether any of the
      above(proteins,DNA,RNA,etc.) correlate with or affect the body's response to epinephrine
      and/or endotoxin. This will enable the investigator to better understand whether treatment
      with this substance can alter the body's immune response.
