      However, it is still unknown whether H. pylori eradication is useful and required to prevent
      gastric cancer.

      Gastric cancer risk is increased in family members of gastric cancer patient. Though there is
      no direct evidence that H. pylori infection is a risk factor for gastric cancer in family
      members of gastric cancer, current European guideline recommends H. pylori eradication in
      first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients.

      In this study, the investigators will evaluate whether H. pylori eradication can reduce
      gastric cancer risk in the first-degree family members of gastric cancer patients.
