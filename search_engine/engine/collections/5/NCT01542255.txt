      vascular cells and inhibit tumor growth and metastasises. A recent study in a melanoma mouse
      model has identified low dose vinblastine, cyclophosphamide and dacarbazine as a treatment
      which improves the animal's survival and is superior to full dose dacarbazine alone. This
      clinical trial seeks to translate this laboratory model directly into metastatic melanoma
      patients.
