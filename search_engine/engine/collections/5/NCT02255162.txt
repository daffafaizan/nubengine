      research study. The participant will be given a study drug-dosing calendar.

      The investigators are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered
      safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants, not everyone who
      participates in this research study will receive the same dose of the study drug. The dose
      given will depend on the number of participants who have been enrolled in the study prior and
      how well they have tolerated their doses. Participants will receive the following:

        -  Cytarabine

        -  Microtransplantation

        -  Lenalidomide
