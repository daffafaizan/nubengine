      Glucose Monitoring system (FGM) in children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes mellitus
      (T1DM) and attending a 1-week diabetes summer camp, supervised by a multidisciplinary team of
      health care providers. The camp comprised a structured daily routine with five fixed meals:
      breakfast, lunch, afternoon snack, dinner and evening snack. Capillary blood glucose (BG)
      values were measured in parallel with unmasked Flash Glucose measurements (FGM) using the FGM
      reader's built-in glucometer at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Additional measurements were
      taken before snacks, between the meals or overnight and BG was measured only in cases of low
      (<4.0 mmol/L) or high (>15.0 mmol/L) FGM values or when symptoms were discordant with sensor
      readings. Sensor-related issues were documented and a questionnaire assessing satisfaction
      and usability of the FGM was completed by patients and caregivers at study completion.
