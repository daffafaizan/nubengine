      Limited-stage small cell lung cancer (LS-SCLC) represents approximately 40% of cases. The
      current standard of care in limited-stage disease is systemic chemotherapy plus concurrent
      thoracic radiotherapy. Early concurrent chemo-radiotherapy is recommended for patients with
      limited-stage SCLC based on randomized trials. But, the administration of thoracic
      radiotherapy requires the assessment of several factors, including the volume of the
      radiation port, dose of radiation, and fractionation of radiotherapy. Parts of the LS-SCLC
      are local advanced stage (stage Ⅲa and Ⅲb), which can not tolerate concurrent
      chemo-radiotherapy because of large size in tumor and extensive metastasis of lymph nodes. At
      present, it is usually use 3-4 cycles of introduction chemotherapy to decrease the tumor size
      followed by definitive radiotherapy. But it is unclear whether this scheme is tolerant well
      or it could improve the overall survival in patients with LS-SCLC. As a result, we designed a
      prospective phase II randomized controlled trial in order to compare the tolerance and
      therapeutic effects between radiotherapy alone and concurrent chemo-radiotherapy after 3-4
      cycles of chemotherapy in LS-SCLC.
