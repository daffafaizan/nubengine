    
      Primary objective and endpoint

      • Efficacy of tofacitinib in inducing clinical remission of immune related colitis, as
      measured by the proportion of patients who experience diarrhea resolution to grade ≤1 as per
      Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE] v5.0) without the requirement for
      additional immunosuppression (e.g., corticosteroids, biologics, or other immunosuppressors
      targeted for colitis) 8 weeks post-first dose of tofacitinib.

      Secondary objectives and endpoints:

        -  Safety of tofacitinib in cancer patients with immune-related colitis, as defined by the
           occurrence of adverse events grade ≥3.

        -  Efficacy of tofacitinib in cancer patients with immune colitis as defined by endoscopic
           remission of colitis (a total Mayo score of ≤2) at 8 weeks.

        -  Efficacy of tofacitinib to induce a clinical remission of immune-related colitis as
           measured by the time, in days, necessary to achieve a diarrhea of grade ≤ 1 (as per
           CTCAE v 5.0).

        -  Number of patients with tumor progression at 8 weeks per iRECIST and RECIST 1.1 criteria
           compared to baseline scans.

      Exploratory objective

      • The study will collect blood samples from participants seeking to characterize the
      inflammatory landscape of ICI-mediated colitis and biomarkers predictive of response to
      tofacitinib.
