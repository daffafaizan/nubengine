      who present with a distal fibula fracture who were treated with either intermedullary nail
      (IMN) fixation or plate fixation. This objective will be accomplished using the
      Olerud-Molander score, a commonly accepted functional outcome score used to evaluate patients
      post-operatively who have undergone foot and ankle procedures. It is a survey that evaluates
      patient reported outcomes including pain, stiffness, swelling, stair climbing, running,
      jumping, squatting, use of supports, and work/activities of daily living (ADL) level. It does
      not involve physician-measured outcomes. The best possible score is a total of 100. Patients
      will be given a form to complete throughout follow-up and be utilized for data analysis.
      Functional outcome will be analyzed with regards to type of fracture, gender, cause of
      fracture, and affected side to determine if these factors are responsible for any difference.
