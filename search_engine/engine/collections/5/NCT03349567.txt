      in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to improve antimicrobial-prescribing.
      Academic-detailing and an audit-and-feedback intervention will be implemented. Through
      audit-and-feedback, providers will be shown how their antimicrobial-prescribing compares to
      their peers, thereby encouraging them to consider their professional reputation when making
      prescribing decisions.

      The study will use a pretest-posttest design (quasi-experimental design with a non-equivalent
      control group) to assess the effect of our pilot intervention at 2 participating EDs and 2
      control EDs. For each ED, the pretest period will be the 12 months prior to the intervention.
      The intervention itself will last 12 months.

      There will be an estimated 30 ED providers at the 2 study sites and 30 ED providers at the 2
      control sites. Only antimicrobial prescriptions to patients discharged from the ED will be
      evaluated.

      The primary outcome will be antimicrobial-prescribing volume adjusted for the total number of
      patient-visits. Secondary outcomes include the frequency of guideline-discordant
      antimicrobial-prescribing and adverse events.

      At the conclusion of the pilot trial, a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series (ITS)
      analysis will be performed to assess the change in monthly antimicrobial usage for the 2
      intervention sites combined and the 2 control sites combined. The time frame for this ITS
      analysis will be the one-year prior to the pilot trial's initiation through the trial's
      1-year intervention period for a total of 24 months. In addition, a multivariable analysis
      will be performed to identify predictors of guideline-discordant therapy.
