        -  Over the age of 59

        -  Gender and Age-Matched (within 3 years) of main protocol participants

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Parkinson's disease diagnosis

        -  Significant cognitive deficits.

        -  Another neurological or orthopedic deficit that in the investigator's opinion would have
           a significant impact on gait and cognition (e.g. stroke, fracture).

      This study involves one visit to Oregon Health & Science University. The study visit will
      last approximately 2 hours.

      Measurements:

        1. The participant's balance will be assessed by having them stand on a platform and
           completing mental tasks such as naming the alphabet backwards. They will be asked to
           have their eyes open on some tasks and closed on other tasks. For safety, they will wear
           a harness like those used by rock climbers.

        2. The participant's ability to move and balance will be measured by putting six sensors on
           their bodies (both wrists, both ankles, chest, and back). Each sensor is about the size
           and weight of a deck of cards. To measure movement and balance, participants will rise
           from a chair, walk three feet, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down.

        3. The participant's strength will be evaluated using a machine that resembles a stationary
           exercise bike. They will have one leg and foot strapped onto the machine. Participants
           will then be asked to flex and extend their leg as quickly as possible five times. This
           will be repeated with the other leg.
