      using a biomatrix (the Gore Bio-A174; Fistula Plug) in a Phase I study using a single dose of
      20 million cells. Fifteen adult patients with refractory, rectovaginal fistulizing Crohn's
      disease will be enrolled. Participants will undergo standard adjuvant therapy including
      drainage of infection and placement of a draining seton with continuation of pre-existing
      anti-Crohn's therapy. If the participant is not currently diverted, then participants will
      undergo a laparoscopic diversion with a loop ileostomy. Six weeks post placement of the
      draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Bio-A fistula plug as per
      current clinical practice. The participants will be subsequently followed for fistula
      response and closure for 24 months. This is an autologous product derived from the patient
      and used only for the same patient.

      Participants will be screened at outpatient clinic visits and interested qualified
      participants will be offered participation in the trial and consented. At the first study
      visit (Visit 1; Screening visit), the patient will be evaluated and assessed. Six weeks post
      placement of the draining seton, the seton will be replaced with the MSC loaded Gore Bio-A
      fistula plug. Participants will return on: Day 1, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 24,
      Week 52, and Week 104.
