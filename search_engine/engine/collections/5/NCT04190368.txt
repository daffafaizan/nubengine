      familial challenges; while also tackling the medical infrastructure and multi-disciplinary
      care challenges encountered by middle school and high school aged individuals with Type 1
      Diabetes and their caregivers. This new approach consists of Team Clinic Care appointments
      (primarily telemedicine, and in-person as necessary). The study incorporates Virtual Team
      Clinic group/medical group appointments with a multidisciplinary diabetes care team of
      diabetes care providers. Each group will have a special theme (thematic group visits) and
      learning experience aimed at improving glycemic control and treatment adherence, increasing
      social supports and diabetes care satisfaction, and aid in the transition from caregiver led
      treatment to self care. Part of the goal of VTC is to spend less time in clinic while still
      receiving important diabetes education, support, and medical care.
