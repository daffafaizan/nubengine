      treatment of ASIS avulsion fractures in children and adolescents.The investigator plan to
      retrospectively analyzed 59 patients diagnosed with ASIS avulsion fractures in our hospital
      between Jan 2009 and Dec 2016. These patients were divided into two groups: group A
      (conservative group) and group B (absorbable screws). Group A received conservative therapy
      involving bed rest with the affected lower extremity positioned with the hip and knee in
      flexion to ensure minimal tension of the muscles attached to the ASIS avulsion fracture.
      Group B received open reduction and internal fixation with fixation by absorbable screws. Six
      weeks and three months after treatment, all patients were assessed for range of motion (ROM)
      and by X-ray as they returned to activity. One week after treatment, the American Academy of
      Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) lower limb and hip score was used to evaluate hip function; the
      same scores were also determined during follow-up at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months postoperatively.
