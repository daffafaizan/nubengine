      after tisagenlecleucel infusion, and every 6 months in the second year, and annually up to 60
      months after infusion. Efficacy will be assessed until progression; safety will be assessed
      throughout the study. A long term follow-up up to 15 years after CTL019 infusion will
      continue under a separate protocol (CCTL019A2205B)(NCT02445222).
