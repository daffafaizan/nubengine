      which is the usual practice of case handling by centre staff. Randomization will be based on
      centres to prevent exchange of information between the two groups, and thus causing
      contamination. Outcome data will be measured at 3 time-intervals: case intake, 3-month, and
      6-month.

      Participants of the psychoeducation program on empowerment (PPE) will be randomly assigned to
      the program group and the non-program group. For the former a 5-session psychoeducation
      program will be administered. For both groups, outcome measures will be collected at pre,
      post, and 3-month after post test.
