      markers are already present in children of different weight categories and whether these are
      age dependent. Also differences - and relationships - between vascular function measurements
      and plasma biomarkers between lean and overweight/obese children will be compared.The primary
      endpoint is to examine the difference in micro- and macro-vasculature characteristics in
      children with different weight classifications (lean; overweight; obese; extreme obese;
      morbid obese). Secondary endpoints are differences in lipoprotein profiles, pro-inflammatory
      and oral glucose tolerance profiles between different age groups, between lean and
      overweight/obese children and in relation with the measured micro- and macro-vasculature
      characteristics
