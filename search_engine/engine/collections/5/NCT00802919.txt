      patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective psychosis who were treated with
      antipsychotic medication and were cigarette smokers. Three sites (2 U.S., 1 Israel) were
      supported by the Stanley grant. A similar independently supported study was conducted in
      Beijing, China. We were allowed to access these data and combine them for our analysis of
      results. Subjects at each site participated in a protocol which was approved by their
      institutional IRB. All subjects signed informed consent.

      The study evaluated multiple measures of cigarette smoking, cognitive functions by MATRICS
      battery (Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia), and
      psychiatric symptoms by PANSS (Positive and Negative Symptom Scale), SANS (Schedule For
      Assessment Of Negative Symptoms), and Calgary Depression scales. Lymphocytes were collected
      for measurement of epigenetically related mRNA's.
