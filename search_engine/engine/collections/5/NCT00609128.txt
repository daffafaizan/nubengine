      research question is:

      Are there differences in inflammatory mediators and cell surface activation markers in
      patients undergoing seasonal allergic conjunctivitis compared to those with sight threatening
      disease such as Atopic Keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) and will the use of the anti-allergy eye
      drop, PATANOLÂ® (olopatadine hydrochloride) affect these parameters?

      Experimental Design:

      Ocular surface cells (by impression cytology) and tears (via capillary tube) are collected
      from allergic, non-allergic, and AKC subjects undergoing an reaction induced either by
      seasonal allergen or topical allergen provocation (specificity and dose determined via skin
      testing). Ocular surface cells are evaluated for surface activation markers. Tears are
      evaluated for mediator content. Tears are also incubated with peripheral blood eosinophils
      and lymphocytes to see effects on adhesion to conjunctival epithelial cells.
