      neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease. Once the skin is broken, healing is frequently
      delayed and the ulcer develops the biology of a chronic wound. The factors underlaying
      delayed healing in chronic wounds are not well understood but include the effects of repeated
      trauma, tissue ischemia, infection, defective white cell function, altered immune processes,
      and altered expression of tissue cytokines and enzymes.

      Management is based on regular cleansing and debridement, off-loading and treatment of
      intercurrent infection with antibiotics. There are no interventions in routine use, which
      target aspects of chronic wound biology directly.
