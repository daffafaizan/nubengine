      according to a randomization schedule supplied by the Sponsor before study initiation. The
      randomization scheme did not include assignments for replacement subjects.

      Subjects reported to their respective clinical research unit (CRU) on Admission/Day -1 for
      pre-randomization procedures and confirmation of eligibility (and continued eligibility for
      Periods 2 to 4). The unblinded pharmacist prepared and dispensed the nebulizers, according to
      the randomization schedule for each of the 4 periods. Dosing occurred in the morning,
      generally between 7 am and 9 am. For Periods 2 to 4, dosing occurred within Â±30 minutes of
      the dosing time established in Period 1.

      Study drug was administered in the respective CRU under the supervision of study personnel.
      Single doses of TD-4208, ipratropium bromide, and placebo were administered in the clinical
      research unit (CRU) under the supervision of study personnel. Care was taken to avoid eye
      contact with study drugs. Residual drug solution remaining in the nebulizer (ie, in mL) was
      measured and recorded.

      The investigator or designee was responsible for maintaining accountability records for all
      study drug(s) in accordance with applicable government regulations and study procedures.

      The accountability record included entries for receipt, distribution or dispensing, and
      destruction of the material(s). Unused and expired study drugs were to be disposed of in
      accordance with written instructions from the Sponsor.
