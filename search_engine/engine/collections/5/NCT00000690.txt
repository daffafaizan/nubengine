      is absorbed into the bloodstream and can be used by the body when DS is taken by mouth.

      On 2nd day of hospitalization, each volunteer receives an oral dose of DS. Over the next 24
      hours, 15 blood samples are obtained (from 15 separate needle sticks). On 4th day, each
      volunteer is given an injection of DS into vein. 18 blood samples are obtained. Blood is
      withdrawn before the infusion, at the end of the infusion, and 30 and 60 minutes after the
      infusion. All urine is collected.
