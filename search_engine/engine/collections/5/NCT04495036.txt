      health care from a distance, has become an increasing role in basic medical care
      internationally. Telemedicine is particularly suitable for skin diseases. In order to improve
      the use of evidence-based telemedicine, the Swiss patients' preferences regarding
      teledermatology versus face-to-face consultations and the patients' and physicians'
      determinants of acceptance for teledermatology are investigated in this study. Dermatology
      patients are asked to complete a newly-created 21-items-survey; Swiss dermatologists, other
      physicians and medical staff on telemedicine will complete a similar newly-created,
      23-items-questionnaire. A descriptive statistical analysis (e.g. gender, age, place of
      residence (city or country), waiting time) will be performed.
