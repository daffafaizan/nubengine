      I. To assess safety, tolerability, and identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      entinostat given in combination with MK-3475 (pembrolizumab).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To obtain a preliminary estimate of efficacy of entinostat in combination with MK-3475
      (pembrolizumab).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the dynamic quantitative change in measurable immunological biomarkers
      (proportions of myeloid-derived suppressor cells [MDSCs], and programmed death protein-1
      [PD-1] expression in bone marrow) with the combined epigenetic-immunotherapy and correlation
      with any observed clinical responses.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of entinostat.

      Patients receive lower dose entinostat orally (PO) on days 1 and 8 or higher dose entinostat
      PO on days 1, 8, and 15, and pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 of
      cycle 2 and cycles thereafter. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve an objective
      response or maintain a stable disease (SD) status after the first 4 cycles may continue to
      receive entinostat and pembrolizumab for up to 1 year.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 6 months.
