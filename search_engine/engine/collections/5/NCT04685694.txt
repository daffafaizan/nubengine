    
      An open label randomized controlled trial (RCT) of all women diagnosed with retained product
      of conception (RPOC) after first trimester medical TOP in a single university affiliated
      medical center. All consecutive women who underwent medical TOP by mifepristone and
      misoprostol at gestational age under 63 days from last menstrual period and were diagnosed
      with RPOC in a routine 3-week ultrasound follow-up are offered to participate. RPOC is
      defined as thick irregular endometrium (over 12 mm) with positive Doppler flow. Following
      recruitment, patients are randomized into either expectant arm or medical arm (800 mcg
      misoprostol). The primary outcome measure is RPOC rate in repeat ultrasound scan performed 5
      weeks after randomization.
