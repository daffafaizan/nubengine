    
      This Phase IV, randomized, double-blinded study in volunteer subjects to evaluate the
      tolerability, safety, and flow rates of different solutions subcutaneously (SC) infused and
      preceded by human recombinant hyaluronidase (hylenex) 150 units. The study will be conducted
      in two sequential stages.

      In Stage 1, the comparison will be NS solution to LR solution. Each subject will receive
      simultaneous SC infusions of 500 mL (from a 500 mL bag) of solution in each anterior thigh,
      consisting of NS in one thigh and LR in the other thigh. The thighs (left vs. right) to
      receive NS and LR will be randomized and double blinded. Immediately prior to the infusions,
      each thigh will have 150 units of hylenex simultaneously injected.

      Tolerability will be assessed based on the subject's self-assessment of discomfort on a
      visual analog scale (VAS). Safety will be assessed by physical examination targeted at
      infusion sites, vital signs, and adverse events. The amount of fluid infused will be assessed
      by weighing the infusion bag, fluid and tubing at designated time points, and allowing the
      determination of flow rate.

      Stage 2 will be conducted only if the observed Stage 1 VAS mean maximum pain score is at
      least 25 mm higher for one solution compared to the other. Stage 2 will evaluate the
      tolerability, safety, and flow rates of subcutaneously infused NS solution and buffered NS
      solution.
