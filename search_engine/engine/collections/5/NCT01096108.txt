      and contest lengths. All participants receive a 2 week supply of nicotine replacement therapy
      (NRT) and weekly support emails. Follow-up assessment surveys occur at 1, 3, 4 and 6 months
      post enrollment.

      Participants who have completed the follow-up assessment surveys and self-reported that they
      are tobacco-free will be asked to provide a urine sample in order to verify abstinence.
