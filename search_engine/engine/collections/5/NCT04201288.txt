      high as 50%, with 31-46% of patients dropping out after the first visit. People Living with
      HIV (PLWH) who are not consistently retained in care are at risk for: delayed antiretroviral
      treatment (ART) initiation, reduced ART adherence, unsuppressed viremia, and mortality.
      Moreover, poor retention means effective ART cannot be leveraged to prevent further HIV
      transmission. The objective of this study is to conduct a fully powered, randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) to assess the efficacy of a brief, 2-session acceptance-based
      behavioral therapy (ABBT) intervention to enhance retention in HIV care.

      The aims of this proposal are: (1) To test, in a 2-arm RCT, the efficacy of the ABBT
      intervention on retention in care and virologic suppression (primary outcomes); and, ART
      adherence, disclosure of HIV status, perceived social support, HIV stigmatization (secondary
      outcomes), relative to an Enhanced-Treatment-as-Usual condition; and, (2) To examine the
      degree to which retention in HIV care and virologic suppression are mediated by (a) increased
      HIV acceptance (and decreased HIV experiential avoidance) and (b) increased willingness to
      disclose HIV status. The sample will consist of 270 HIV patients who are new to care.
