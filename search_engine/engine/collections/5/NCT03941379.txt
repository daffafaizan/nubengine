    
      This is a multi-center long-term observational Registry of patients with Primary Choroidal
      Melanoma (CM) or Indeterminate Lesions (ILs) The Registry will initially be open to patients
      who have previously participated in an Aura Biosciences sponsored clinical trial for their
      primary Choroidal Melanoma or Indeterminate Lesions.

      All patients will be followed for a minimum of 5 years (including time enrolled in an Aura
      sponsored clinical trial), until withdrawal of consent, or until death whichever comes first.

      No interventions will be required as part of the Registry. Data collection will be based on
      information anticipated to be available based on the standard of care for patients with CM or
      IL; these patients are routinely followed at 6-month intervals by their treating physician.
