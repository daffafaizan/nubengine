      dexamethasone for carfilzomib-refractory multiple myeloma. Phase I is designed to evaluate
      overall maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ruxolitinib in combination with carfilzomib and
      dexamethasone in the following cohorts: Cohort 1) 5mg ruxolitinib, Cohort 2) 10mg
      ruxolitinib, Cohort 3) 15mg ruxolitinib. Phase II is designed to evaluate 4-month
      progression-free survival (PFS) in the following cohorts: Cohort A) non-responders to Phase I
      regimen, Cohort B) responders to Phase I regimen. Up to 18 evaluable subjects will be
      enrolled in Phase I over approximately 12 months. An additional 30 evaluable subjects will be
      enrolled in Phase II over 24 months.
