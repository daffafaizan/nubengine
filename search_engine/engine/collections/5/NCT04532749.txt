    
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, serious, recurrent disorder. Seltorexant
      (JNJ-42847922) is a potent and selective antagonist of the human orexin-2 receptor (OX2R)
      that is being developed for the treatment of insomnia disorder and adjunctive treatment of
      MDDIS. The hypothesis for this study is that adjunctive treatment with seltorexant is
      superior to placebo in treating depressive symptoms, as measured by change in Montgomery
      Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score from baseline to Day 43 in adult and
      elderly participants with MDDIS who have had an inadequate response to treatment with a
      SSRI/SNRI. The study will be conducted in 3 phases: a screening phase (up to 30 days), a
      double-blind (DB) treatment phase (43 days), and a post treatment follow-up phase (7 to 14
      days after DB treatment phase). Total duration of study is up to 12 weeks. Efficacy, safety,
      pharmacokinetics, and biomarkers will be assessed at specified time points during this study.
