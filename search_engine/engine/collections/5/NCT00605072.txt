      population, accelerates cognitive decline and increases the risk of functional disability
      among older individuals. Hypertension is also associated with cerebral blood flow reduction
      and dysregulation which contribute to further cognitive and functional impairment. Drugs that
      inhibit angiotensin II (ACEI and ARB) are commonly used antihypertensives and may have a
      protective effect on cognitive function, cerebral blood flow and physical function compared
      to other antihypertensives such as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).

      A total of 100 individuals will be recruited for this pilot 3-arm randomized study to
      investigate the effects of: (i) 12 months treatment with candesartan (ARB) compared to
      hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) and (ii) 12 months treatment with lisinopril (ACEI) compared to
      HCTZ and (iii) to estimate the effect size difference between lisinopril and losartan on
      cognition, cerebral blood flow regulation, and functional measures in a sample of elderly
      hypertensive individuals with objective evidence of cognitive impairment.
