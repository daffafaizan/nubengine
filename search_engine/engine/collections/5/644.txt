a fatal septicemic disease of infant puppies caused bycytopathogenic organisms with characteristics of mycoplasma.pathogenic organisms were iso-lated from 2 outbreaks of a fatal septicemicdisease of infant puppies and from dog kidneycells that degenerated spontaneously.  the iso-lates were indistinguishable serologically andpossessed characteristics of mycoplasma.  thepathogenic organisms were cytopathogenic fordog kidney cell cultures, and in inoculatedpuppies, produced pathological changes thatresembled those seen in natural cases.  le-sions consisted principally of necrosis andhemorrhage.  the isolates were culturally andserologically distinct from recognized caninemycoplasma species.
