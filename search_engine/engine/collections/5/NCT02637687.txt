    
      The primary objectives are to determine the safety and efficacy of oral larotrectinib in
      pediatric patients with advanced solid or primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors.

      The secondary objectives comprise e.g. the determination of the pharmacokinetic properties,
      the maximum tolerated dose/ recommended dose and the tumor-type specific efficacy of
      larotrectinib. In addition, pain status and health-related quality of life of the pediatric
      patients will be assessed.
