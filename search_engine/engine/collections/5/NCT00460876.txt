    
      Patients with bilateral retinoblastoma who have relapsed after attempts of conservative
      therapy with standard regimens such as carboplatin, etoposide, vincristine and external beam
      radiotherapy who face immediate enucleation of their single remaining eye are eligible for
      this protocol. Starting dose of topotecan will be 0.5 mg and dose escalation will be done by
      the accelerated titration method. Any Grade 3 ocular toxicity or grade 4 non ocular toxicity
      will be designed as the dose limiting toxicity. Grade 2 scleral toxicity will be considered
      for DLT. In case of grade 2 ocular toxicity or grade 3 systemic toxicity, the escalation dose
      will be 0.25 mg. Maximal dose will be 2 mg.
