    
      Purpose: Determining the likelihood of prostate cancer detection in men taking dutasteride
      when biopsy is performed 'for cause'.

      Population: The population of interest is the REDUCE Biopsied population, that is, all
      subjects in the Efficacy population who have at least one post-baseline biopsy reviewed by
      the Central Pathology Laboratory.

      Analyses: Initial interest will be focused on data from the Year 1-2 time period, to avoid
      the potential effect of the cancer diagnoses from the Year 2 scheduled biopsies on the
      assessments utilized in the "for cause" definitions. Only PSA data from Years 1-2 and
      baseline will be utilized in the computation of the various PSA metrics, and only Central
      Pathology results from Years 1-2 will be utilized to establish post-baseline diagnoses. PSA
      values on or within 42 days after date of biopsy will be excluded from the analyses, to avoid
      potential effects of biopsy on the PSA value.

      For each of the 2 groups of subjects, the following will be summarized: number of subjects
      meeting the corresponding criteria, number and % of subjects diagnosed with prostate cancer,
      number and % of such subjects diagnosed with Gleason 7-10, and number and % of subjects
      diagnosed with either prostate cancer, HGPIN or ASAP. Summaries of the numbers of subjects
      meeting each of the specific criteria for group 1 (a through e) and Group 2 (a through h)
      will be provided.

      In addition, summaries investigating the effect of baseline variables (such as age, family
      history of prostate cancer, prostate volume, percent free PSA, number of cores at the entry
      biopsy) on the occurrence of prostate cancer diagnoses and Gleason 7-10 diagnoses may be
      developed.
