      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of SJG-136 in patients
      with metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.

      II. Determine the safety and dose-limiting toxic effects of this drug in these patients.

      III. Determine, preliminarily, the efficacy of this drug in these patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this drug and its metabolites in these
      patients.

      II. Correlate pharmacokinetic parameters with clinical effects of this drug in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive SJG-136 intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes once daily on days 1-3. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of SJG-136 until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
