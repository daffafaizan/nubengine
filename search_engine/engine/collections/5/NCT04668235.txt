    
      Hypothesis:

      AZVUDINE has therapeutic potential and safety profile for the treatment of patients infected
      with SARS-CoV-2.

      Goals:

      Primary objective • To assess the efficacy and safety of AZVUDINE (FNC) in relation to
      placebo, in patients infected with SARS-COV-2 in moderate to severe stage;

      Secondary objective

      • To evaluate the clinical outcome of the AZVUDINE group (FNC) compared to the placebo group
      in patients infected by SARS-COV-2 in moderate to severe stage;

      Pharmaceutical form of the experimental medicine:

      AZVUDINE 1 mg tablets

      Comparators:

      AZVUDINE placebo

      Statistical planning:

      The analyzes will be performed by FAS, PPS and SS and should be stratified by the severity of
      the disease (moderate, severe) and age (<60 years, ≥ 60 years), to assess the following
      parameters:

        -  Progression of the disease (moderate to severe, severe type);

        -  Negative viral load conversion rate;

        -  Time of negative conversion of viral load;

        -  Temperature recovery time;

        -  Time necessary to improve diarrhea, myalgia, fatigue, and other symptoms;

        -  Time to improve the pulmonary image;

        -  Frequency of supplemental oxygenation or non-invasive ventilation;

        -  Frequency of AEs;

        -  Mortality rate.

      All statistical tests will be bilateral tests. If the P value is ≤0.05, it is considered that
      there is statistical significance between the difference in the tests.
