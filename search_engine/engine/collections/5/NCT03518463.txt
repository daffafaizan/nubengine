      challenges including surgical complications, shortage of beds, and consequently long waiting
      time for operations. Enhanced recovery programs are composed of preoperative, intraoperative
      and postoperative strategies combined to form a multi-modal pathway. ERAS requires a
      multidisciplinary team of anesthetists, surgeons and nurses for successful implementation and
      realization of its advantages. ERAS has been seen to reduce duration of hospital stay,
      complications and costs. Although many of the elements of enhanced recovery after surgery are
      similar, it has not been tested in emergency CS and there is limited data about its
      applicability in low income settings like Uganda where 95% of CS are emergencies. The aim of
      this study was to assess the impact of ERAS protocols following emergency caesarean delivery
      in a low resource setting.
