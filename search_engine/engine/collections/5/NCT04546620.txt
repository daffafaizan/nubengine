    
      Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common of the non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.
      Whilst the majority of patients will respond well to conventional treatment (R-CHOP -
      rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone), a significant number
      of patients lymphoma will not respond to initial therapy or their disease will return after
      completion of therapy. In a number of B-cell diseases an enzyme called, Bruton tyrosine
      kinase (BTK) prevents death of tumour cells, including in DLBCL. Acalabrutinib is an orally
      active BTK-inhibitor and it is thought that stopping BTK being activated may help in treating
      B-cell diseases. It is hypothesised that the addition of Acalabrutinib to standard R-CHOP
      immunochemotherapy may improve outcomes of patients with DLBCL.

      REMoDL-A is a randomised, phase II, open label, multicentre study that will be open in up to
      50 centres. Up to 553 patients (453 randomised) will be recruited.

      Following informed consent all patients will receive 1 cycle of conventional R-CHOP
      chemotherapy. At the same time the diagnostic pathology block will be sent for molecular
      profiling by the Haematological Malignancy Diagnostic Service (HMDS). The delivery of the
      first cycle of R-CHOP will allow a sufficient interval for real time determination of
      molecular phenotype. Patients whose biopsies yield sufficient tumour material for profiling
      will be randomised 2:1 in favour of the experimental arm (R-CHOP + acalabrutinib).

      The primary objective will be to establish if combining acalabrutinib with R-CHOP improves
      efficacy, compared to R-CHOP alone, for the treatment of previously untreated patients with
      DLBCL to a degree that justifies further development of this approach.
