    
      Children's National Heart Institute (CNHI) with major contractual support from the National
      Institutes of Health / National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has installed a combined
      X-ray / Magnetic Resonance Imaging cardiac catheterization lab suite allowing for experts in
      the fields of cardiac MRI, interventional cardiac MRI and clinical pediatric interventional
      electrophysiology to work together to make substantial advancements in the development of
      novel techniques and applications to reach the goal of improved survival and care for the
      congenital heart disease population. The CNHI X-ray/MRI suite will allow for streamlined
      transfer of patients from fluoroscopy directly to the MRI scanner under the same sedation
      thereby allowing for immediate post procedure imaging and minimizing risk to the patient.
