      pulses in the brain for improving the symptoms of cerebral palsy. The proposed treatment will
      deliver radiofrequency pulses to the brain of patients in a non-invasive manner. The duration
      of the treatment will be 1 hour per day, for 28 days. After treatment, participants will be
      monitored for two months to detect potential adverse events and any signs of symptoms
      improvement. The study will be closed once 48 subjects complete the study. At the end of the
      study, the placebo group will have the opportunity to receive treatment with the
      Neurocytotron, based on the benefits shown by study results.
