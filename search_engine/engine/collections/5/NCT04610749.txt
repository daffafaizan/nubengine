    
      A cross sectional study will be performed to determine correlation between retinal endpoints
      in persons with type 2 diabetes and cognitive impairment. 200 patients with type 2 diabetes
      without diabetic retinopathy and non to severe diabetic retinopathy.

      Primary objective:

      To determine whether structural and/or metabolic retinal markers are able to differentiate
      people with minimal cognitive impairment (MCI) within persons with type 2 diabetes (T2D).

      Secondary objective

        1. To assess whether retinal metabolism measured by oximetry can identify individuals with
           MCI among people with T2D.

        2. To assess whether retinal metabolism measured by oximetry can identify individuals with
           depressive symptoms among people with T2D.

        3. To determine whether retinal structural markers can identify people with depressive
           symptoms among people with T2D.
