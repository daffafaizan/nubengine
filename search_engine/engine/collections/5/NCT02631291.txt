      because these conditions are highly prevalent and have lasting adverse consequences for the
      well-being of the bereaved survivor. The proposed research will evaluate the feasibility and
      acceptability of a healthy lifestyle intervention that uses a technology-based behavioral
      self-monitoring protocol to encourage engagement in physical activity, healthy eating, and
      good sleep practices following spousal bereavement. Data from 10 participants will be used
      for the development of a prevention intervention manual (Aim 1). A small pilot study will be
      conducted (Aim 2) in which 50 participants will be randomly assigned to 12 weeks of (1)
      behavioral self-monitoring using a smartphone (n=20), (2) behavioral self-monitoring using a
      smartphone + motivational interviewing-based lifestyle coaching (n=20), or (3) enhanced usual
      care (n=10). Blood samples will be collected to explore inflammatory cytokines as a potential
      mediator/moderator of mental health risk.
