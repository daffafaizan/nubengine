      the skin and connective tissues. It usually begins with a few dry patches of skin on the
      hands or face that begin getting thicker and harder. These patches then spread to other areas
      of the skin. In some cases, systemic sclerosis also affects the blood vessels an internal
      organs. Systemic sclerosis is one of a group of arthritic conditions called connective tissue
      disorders, a person's antibodies are directed against their own tissues.
