      or as a direct anesthesia method. Nowadays, these regional blocks can be applied more safely
      with the widespread use of ultrasound in daily clinical practice. Also, by identifying
      individual variations with ultrasound, the risk of block failure and possible complications
      has been minimized. Femoral nerve block and pericapsular nerve group block are now almost the
      first techniques used in hip and lower extremity surgeries or different indications. (1)
      Besides, these methods have become more advantageous in many aspects compared to spinal
      anesthesia in high-risk patients. However, to apply safe and successful regional anesthesia,
      both gross anatomy and sonoanatomy of the relevant region must be known well.

      There are sufficient clinical and anatomical studies on these anesthesia methods applied in
      the inguinal region in adults, and there is no anatomical and anthropometric study in
      children. (2,3) However, well-known anatomic reference points for performing these blocks in
      adults may be different in children. (4) Therefore, with this study, we planned to develop
      appropriate anatomic reference points for these blocks in children by evaluating the
      relationship between sonography and inguinal region structures (such as distance, diameter
      measurement) in children's age groups.
