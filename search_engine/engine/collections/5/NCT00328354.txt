      imaging the breast using rotating multi-segment slant-hole (RMSSH) collimators. The
      motivation is the requirement of a low cost RMSSH collimator and a conventional
      Large-Field-Of-View (LFOV) camera. It is believed that RMSSH SPECT is particularly suitable
      for applications in breast imaging.
