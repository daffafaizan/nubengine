    
      In this prospective, consecutive, observational cohort study we examine:

        1. Patient related problems in the PACU after hip and knee arthroplasty simply to answer
           the question "Why in PACU?", using a modified version of the national guidelines for
           patient observation in PACU.

        2. The time spent in PACU with the modified version of the national guidelines for patient
           observation in PACU.

        3. If the modified version of the national guidelines for patient observation in PACU
           results in patient related problems in the ward afterwards.
