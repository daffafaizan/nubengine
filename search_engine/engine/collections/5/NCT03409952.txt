      subjects and two treatment groups. Subjects will be enrolled first into Group A, then Group
      B.

      Group A: LaseMD 100 Tip Random Mode vs. DUAL 1927nm (n=12) Group A subjects will receive a
      split treatment of the décolleté, with LaseMD treatment on one side and DUAL 1927 treatment
      on the other side. Post-treatment follow-up visits (Days 4, 7, 14, 28, 90) will be conducted
      to assess adverse events, expected treatment effects, capture digital images, and assess
      efficacy.

      Group B: LaseMD Optimized Treatments (n=8) Based on safety and efficacy data captured from
      Group A, subjects in Group B will be treated with the LaseMD optimized treatment parameters
      for benign pigmented lesions on décolleté, arms, hands, face, and/or neck. A phone
      follow-up will occur at Day 4 for the assessment of adverse events and expected treatment
      effects. Post-treatment follow-up visits (Days 4, 7, 14, 28, 90) will be conducted to assess
      adverse events, expected treatment effects, capture digital images, and assess efficacy.
