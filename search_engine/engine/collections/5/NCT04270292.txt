      for hemodialysis will be punctured twice each dialysis treatment or at least 312 times per
      year. To allow healing of the tissues damaged during each cannulation, optimal cannulation
      practice is required by rotation of the needle insertion sites each dialysis treatment.
      Vascular access (VA) has been justly described as both the lifeline and the Achilles' heel of
      hemodialysis therapy, making blood purification itself possible while simultaneously often
      constituting a limiting factor in treatment adequacy.
