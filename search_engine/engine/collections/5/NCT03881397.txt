      Qualtrics:

      Time 1: Baseline

      Participants (teen and parent dyads) will be randomized into one of two tracks:

      Track A: Family Media Use Plan intervention Track B: Awareness intervention (delayed start
      intervention)

      The track A group will complete a survey regarding technology rules, tech use, and health
      behaviors, as well as the Family Media Use Plan embedded into the survey. Track B group will
      only complete the baseline survey.

      Time 2: Follow Up Survey: 4-6 weeks after baseline

      Track A group will complete a follow-up survey similar to the baseline with additional
      follow-up questions around their use of the family media use plan.

      The track B group will complete a similar survey and receive the Awareness Intervention,
      providing resources available regarding youth and media use .

      Time 3: Follow Up Survey: 3-4 months after baseline

      All participants will be asked to complete their corresponding tracks (track A or track B)
      survey again to understand use media use and health behaviors change over time.

      Track A or B designated questions are labeled within each uploaded survey.
