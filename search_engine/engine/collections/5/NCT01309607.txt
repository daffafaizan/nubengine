    
      -  Pathologic complete response following neoadjuvant chemotherapy has been shown to be an
           independent, strong predictor of disease-free and overall survival in operable breast
           cancer

        -  The addition of neoadjuvant trastuzumab to chemotherapy results in a 2-3 fold increase
           in pCR rates in operable ErbB2-positive breast cancer

        -  Lapatinib is being explored as an alternative to trastuzumab in large clinical trials in
           operable ErbB2-positive breast cancer

        -  In a randomised phase III adjuvant trial, BCIRG 006, non-anthracycline chemotherapy
           (docetaxel and carboplatin) has been shown to be as effective as conventional sequential
           anthracycline-containing chemotherapy and docetaxel, in combination with trastuzumab,
           but with improved cardiac safety

        -  Weekly paclitaxel has been shown in a randomized phase III study to be the optimal
           adjuvant taxane regimen

        -  Weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin, in combination with lapatinib, has demonstrated
           safety and efficacy in Phase I/II clinical studies of metastatic breast and ovarian
           cancer

        -  The investigators aim to assess the efficacy of a non-anthracycline containing regimen,
           weekly paclitaxel and carboplatin, in combination with lapatinib in inducing pCR in the
           neoadjuvant treatment of ErbB2-positive non-metastatic breast cancer. The investigators
           hypothesize that this combination will achieve pCR rates of at least 35%
