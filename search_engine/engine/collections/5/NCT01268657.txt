      the consequences include reduced mobility, difficulty performing basic self-care, social
      isolation, deteriorating health, or even death. Most interventions for falls do not address
      anxiety in the aftermath of falling.

      After an initial study assessment, participants will complete 8 home-based sessions of a
      Cognitive-Behavioral therapy (CBT). The sessions will be led by a study clinician who will
      cover the 5 intervention components:(a) education (learning about anxiety and the rationale
      for treatment); (b) relaxation training (learning skills to reduce tension); (c) cognitive
      restructuring (learning skills needed to cope better with distressing thoughts); (d)
      behavioral activation (learning to initiate healthy activity); and (e) exposure (coaching in
      how to confront avoided thoughts, situations, and people).

      Participants will also complete assessments following completion of the intervention and 3
      months after completion of the intervention.
