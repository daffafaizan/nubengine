      inflammation (e.g., serum CRP values) and accumulation of proinflammatory monocyte
      populations in the circulation. The level of inflammation is highly predictive for
      cardiovascular disease and mortality. Physical activity has been shown to improve dialysis
      efficacy by improving the elimination of retention solutes. In healthy individuals, sports
      activity influences inflammatory immune parameters. The study will observe the influence of
      moderate physical activity (using a bed mounted cycle for 30min during dialysis thrice
      weekly) on circulating monocyte subpopulations and inflammatory proteins over a 9 month
      period in 16 chronic hemodialysis patients.
