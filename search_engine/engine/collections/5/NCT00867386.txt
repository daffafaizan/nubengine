      discretion of the care physician. The study investigators will ONLY be performing data
      collection and analysis.

      Post transplant all patients will receive one additional cycle of plasma exchange with a
      moderate dose of Intravenous Immunoglobulin (IVIg) (0.4 mg/Kg). Antibody titers will be
      monitoring prior to plasma exchange and immediately following the treatment. At this point,
      since donor antigens are known, only antibodies to these antigens will be tested to minimize
      cost. We anticipate that in some patients, especially if the original titer of donor-specific
      antibody (DSA) was high (> 1:128), a rise in DSA will be observed following transplant. If
      indeed DSA will be present, additional monitoring will be initiated and the patient will be
      treated further with plasma exchange/IVIg cycles, with antibody monitoring before and
      immediately after each cycle. If no DSA are detected, patients will be monitoring on a every
      other day schedule for the first week; weekly for the next 3 weeks and monthly up to 6 months
      post transplant. Additional testing will be performed in the event of any clinical evidence
      of graft dysfunction, or following sever infection events.

      Patient will be followed to 12 month post transplant or until one of the end points is
      reached:

        1. pancreas graft failure: defined by return of hyperglycemia and resume of insulin
           therapy;

        2. patient death due to all causes with functioning graft
