      supported by Burkina Faso's Minister of Health, used blood samples from the 2010 Demographic
      and Health Survey (DHS) to document the country's national and regional prevalences and
      highlighted a localized HCV epidemic in the Southwest Region with a prevalence of 13.2% which
      was 4 times higher than the national prevalence. This high prevalence of HCV was found in
      both adults and youth.

      Given the particular epidemiological situation of the South-West region and the limits of the
      2010 DHS, we aimed to carry out a thorough investigation of this HCV epidemic in the
      South-West region of Burkina Faso in order to control it.

      A mixed methodology (quantitative and qualitative) will be used including: (i) a
      cross-sectional survey to estimate the prevalence of HCV infection in the South-West
      population in Burkina Faso; (ii) a case-control study among individuals less than 20 years of
      age to identify factors associated with current HCV transmission; (iii) a qualitative survey
      to provide additional information explaining the high prevalence of HCV infection (historical
      events, for example); (iv) a cohort study to evaluate a pilot treatment management strategy
      to be implemented by the national program in the South West Region
