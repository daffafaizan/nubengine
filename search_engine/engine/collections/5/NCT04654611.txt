    
      Importance: Glaucoma medications are often preserved with agents such as benzalkonium
      chloride, which commonly lead to ocular surface diseases.

      Background: To investigate the effect of switching to a preservative-free prostaglandin
      analogue, tafluprost 0.0015% on treatment tolerability and ocular surface diseases.

      Design: This was a prospective, open label, non-randomised, observational study performed in
      a single hospital.

      Participants: Patients of Asian descent who have primary open angle glaucoma and ocular
      hypertension (n = 28), who received preserved prostaglandin monotherapy for longer than 3
      months, and has a National Eye Institute ocular surface staining scale score higher than 1.

      Methods: Patients were switched from preserved prostaglandin monotherapy to preservative-free
      tafluprost 0.0015%. Patients were analysed at baseline (Visit 0), 1 month (Visit 1) and 3
      months (Visit 2).

      Main Outcome Measures: The main parameter measured is the change in the fluorescein staining
      score at Visit 2.
