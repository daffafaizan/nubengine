      condition. Its prevalence is high among hospitalized elderly patients and is generally
      underdiagnosed. Delirium is associated with prolonged hospitalization, increased mortality,
      institutionalization, falls, cognitive and functional decline and also with higher economic
      costs. The etiology of delirium is multifactorial, including excessive sensorial stimulation
      and disruption of the sleep-wake cycle as triggering factors.

      The aim of this study is evaluate the effect of earplugs and eyemask for delirium prevention
      among elderly in-patients of a brazilian university hospital. This will be a partially
      blinded clinical trial, in wich both control and intervention group will receive information
      about orientation to time and space every evening, and intervention group will also receive
      earplugs and eyemask for use during the night. The primary outcome will be the occurrence of
      delirium.
