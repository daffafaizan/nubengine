    
      This study was a 2:2:1:1 randomized, double-blind, 14-week comparison of two dose levels of
      GWP42003-P (10 milligram/kilogram [mg/kg]/day and 20 mg/kg/day) versus placebo (10 mg/kg/day
      dose-volume equivalent and 20 mg/kg/day dose-volume equivalent; presented as pooled placebo
      in the study). A 28-day screening period prior to randomization (to establish baseline
      parameters) preceded the treatment period, which consisted of a 2-week titration period
      followed by a 12-week maintenance period. The study aimed to determine the efficacy, safety,
      and tolerability of GWP42003-P compared with placebo. 20 mg/kg/day was recommended by the
      Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC) after assessment of safety and pharmacokinetic data
      from Part A of study GWEP1332 (NCT02091206). The first participant did not enroll into this
      study until the DSMC reviewed the safety data from Part A of study GWEP1332 (NCT02091206).

      Following study completion, all participants were invited to continue to receive GWP42003-P
      in a separate open-label extension study (GWEP1415; NCT02224573).
