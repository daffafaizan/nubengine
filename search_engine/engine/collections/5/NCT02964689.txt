      RAS/MEK/ERK pathway. These tumors are generally aggressive, are almost exclusively of
      non-squamous histology, and represent the largest group of patients with advanced NSCLC
      harboring specific driver mutations in Western populations.

      Based on recent preclinical and clinical evidence, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase
      (MEK)-inhibition plus first-line chemotherapy is a promising new treatment for patients with
      NSCLC and KRAS [v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog] mutations.

      Binimetinib is a medication without marketing authorization. Pemetrexed and cisplatin have
      marketing authorization in Switzerland and in EU for the treatment of non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) and will be administered as standard backbone treatment according to their
      Swissmedic-approved indication, dose and route of administration. Binimetinib, pemetrexed and
      cisplatin are IMP in the context of this phase I trial.
