      independent risk factor of cardiovascular disease. TMAO is formed through interaction between
      gut microflora and the ingested carnitine from food. Studies have shown that plasma TMAO
      concentration and TMAO productivity of gut microbiota in vegetarians are significantly lower
      than omnivores. This is probably due to a lack of carnitine in the diet of vegetarians.
      Therefore, it is worth investigating whether carnitine supplementation could induce TMAO
      productivity of human gut microbiota as well as to reveal TMAO producers from gut microflora.
      Therefore, the investigators plan to recruit 20 vegetarian and 10 omnivore volunteers to
      receive carnitine supplement for weeks, and study the change of plasma TMAO and gut
      microbiota. The plasma TMAO concentration will be measured by the LC-MS, and the gut
      microbiota composition will be analyzed by the next generation sequencing. Through
      bioinformatics analysis, the potential TMAO-producing bacteria might be discovered. The
      change of plasma TMAO level and gut microbiota composition after carnitine supplementation
      can provide more understanding on the relationship between carnitine supplement, TMAO and gut
      microflora.
