      diagnostic FFPE blocks and assayed to find lymphoma specific variants and immunoglobulin
      heavy chain gene rearrangements. Blood samples collected at baseline will be compared to see
      if variants and rearrangements can be detected in tumor specific DNA based on previous
      studies. Participant data will be collected, and clinical outcomes will be assessed to
      determine effect of mutation profiles on outcomes over 2 year follow up.

      Blood samples will be prospectively collected at scheduled follow up and if primary
      objectives of this study are met, will be assessed for presence of cfDNA and impact of
      variation on clinical outcomes.
