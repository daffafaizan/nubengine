      reporting VAS > 60 during active flexion of the knee can be included. All included patients
      will receive 2 blockades at the same time - an ACB and a FNB, one blockade with 30ml
      ropivacaine 0,2% and the other with 30ml saline according to randomization.

      Prior to, and after, the blockades VAS pain scores will be obtained, muscle strength
      (quadriceps and adductors) will be measured using a handheld dynanometer and a Timed Up and
      Go test will be performed.

      The study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov after inclusion of the first patient. The
      reason for this is that we recently became aware of that some journals do not accept a
      EudraCT registration. The study was registered at EudraCT (2012-004554-28)prior to enrollment
      of patients.
