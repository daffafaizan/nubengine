    
      A participant with an established diagnosis of EoE who is undergoing Standard of Care
      treatment with a four or less food elimination diet (not including or counting foods
      restricted at time of EoE diagnosis) OR is on topical swallowed steroid therapy with any
      number of foods eliminated from the diet, is in histological remission, and has been
      recommended as part of Standard of Care to start a single new food introduction OR remove the
      swallowed steroid treatment by the subject's clinical allergist or gastroenterologist will be
      enrolled in the study. 14-17 days after the introduction of the clinically recommended single
      food antigen, a TNE will be performed to assess the esophageal mucosa. TNE will be performed
      every 2 weeks for six weeks (3 total TNE) to evaluate recurrence time of mucosal eosinophilia
      (>15 eos/HPF), other histological changes, and patient tolerance to serial TNE. At week 6 a
      sedated esophagoscopy will be offered as an alternative choice to TNE if the participant
      chooses.
