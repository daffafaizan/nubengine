      When red blood cells (RBC) become infected with malaria, a sticky parasite-derived knob
      protein, termed PfEMP-1, erupts on the RBC surfaces. PfEMP-1 attaches to several blood group
      molecules, including those found on other RBC, on blood vessels, and on the cells that
      normally help to stop bleeding (platelets). The cellular sticking results in a dangerous
      interruption in blood flow to vital organs, causing brain injury (cerebral malaria), systemic
      shock (lactic acidosis), and death. Depending on an individual's inherited blood groups of
      relevance, adhesion may be extensive or limited. In the laboratory, PfEMP-1 adheres to RBCs
      via the A or B (but not the O) antigens of the ABO blood group system, and to platelets and
      blood vessels via platelet glycoprotein IV (CD36) and ICAM-1. Consistent with the expected
      evolutionary advantage of being deficient in these binding targets, blood type O and
      low-expression of CD36 are found more frequently among Africans. The "Cytoadherence in
      Pediatric Malaria" (CPM) project is determining the distribution of adhesive blood group
      molecules in a cohort of 2000 Ugandan children according to the extent of malaria severity
      and death, and thus their ultimate clinical and evolutionary significance in malarial
      survival. This knowledge may serve as the grounds for developing targeted
      cytoadhesion-interruption therapies in our fight against malaria.
