        -  Determine the clinical response in patients with stage IV melanoma when treated with
           anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody combined with
           gp100:209-217 and gp100:280-288 peptides emulsified in Montanide ISA-51.

        -  Determine a safety and adverse event profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine improved immunologic response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 monoclonal antibody IV over
      90 minutes immediately followed by gp100:209-217 and gp100:280-288 peptides emulsified in
      Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously on days 1, 22, 43, and 64. Treatment repeats every 12 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 68 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
