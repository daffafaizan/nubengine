    
      In this trial the investigators will randomize 4,953 individuals with previously unoperated
      trichiasis on a 1:1:1 basis to bilamellar tarsal rotation trichiasis surgery with an incision
      height of 3 mm, bilamellar tarsal rotation trichiasis surgery with an incision height of 5
      mm, or Trabut surgery. Participants will receive trichiasis surgery then will be followed at
      1 day, 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 12 months after surgery. Some participants may be asked to
      attend a follow-up visit at 3-6 months. The primary outcome is development of post-operative
      trachomatous trichiasis (PTT) within 12 months after surgery. Logistic regression analyses
      will be performed to compare the rates of PTT in the 3 versus 5 mm incision BLTR groups, in
      the 3 mm BLTR versus Trabut group, and in the 5 mm BLTR versus Trabut group, adjusting for
      demographic characteristics and pre-operative trichiasis severity.
