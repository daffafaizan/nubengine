    
      The clinical trial is a Phase 1/2a, open-label, multi-center, dose-escalation study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic profile of RGI-2001 in patients
      undergoing AHSCT, with radiation or non-radiation myeloablative preparative treatment.

      In Part 1 (Phase 1: Dose Escalation Phase), patients will receive a single intravenous
      administration of RGI-2001 approximately 30 minutes after completion of the transplant
      (either allogeneic PBSCs or allogenic bone marrow transplantation (unmodified)) with the
      dosage based upon the assigned treatment cohort. Eligible patients will be enrolled in five
      to seven centers in the United States. Patients who are undergoing AHSCT will be enrolled in
      a sequential group dose-escalating fashion to determine the safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic profile, and the MTD or MFD of RGI-2001. It is anticipated that up to six
      dose levels will be evaluated in Part 1, with an option for an additional cohort (Cohort 7)
      if the MTD is not reached and pharmacodynamic markers suggest higher doses are warranted.

      In Part 2 (Expansion Phase), one or more doses below the MTD or MFD will be selected based on
      a potential correlation between GvHD and biological activity to further assess safety and
      biologic activity. Approximately 30 patients who are undergoing either allogeneic PBSCs or
      allogenic bone marrow transplantation (unmodified) will be enrolled in Part 2 of the study.

      Patients will be monitored for safety for 29 days after the transplant procedure.

      All patients will be followed for 100 days following transplant procedure for the incidence
      of acute GvHD, according to the Modified Keystone Criteria for grading acute GvHD (Przepiorka
      D, et al)
