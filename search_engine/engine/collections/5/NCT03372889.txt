    
      The present study aims to compare the efficacy and caregiver satisfaction between two modes
      of patient education materials (PEMs): media based and print based. The PEMs are designed to
      education caregivers on how to manage their child's On-Q catheter pain block at home. After
      caregivers have enrolled in the study and have been randomized to an education group, study
      interventions take place in the private family waiting room. Immediately after viewing their
      assigned PEM, the caregiver completes a 10 question standardized assessment, formatted as a
      multiple-choice quiz, of their understanding and knowledge of the information conveyed in
      both modes of PEM. The following day, caregivers are contacted by phone call to answer a
      number of questions to assess their satisfaction with the PEMs they received, the mode of PEM
      they preferred, and how comfortable they felt managing their child's pain pump at home.

      All information is stored in a secure database (REDCap).
