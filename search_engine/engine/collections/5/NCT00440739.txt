      narcotics for postoperative pain relief is not without serious side effects such as
      respiratory depression and sedation.There are other alternatives for postoperative analgesia
      as NSAIDs especially COX2-inhibitors. For some specific operation such as TURP which Foley's
      catheter needed to be retained for a few days,urinary anti spasmodics may help the patients
      to be more comfortable.

      Comparison(s): There is a difference in postoperative morphine consumption in the first 24
      hours after transurethral prostatectomy between patients who received etoricoxib or flavoxate
      or both and placebo.
