      patients. Comparative studies of complications between dialysis lines can help physicians and
      patients choose the best CVC type. In addition determining a type of dialysis line that can
      deliver good blood flows from the outset can minimise length of hospital stay for access
      creation. This study aims to perform a head-to-head comparison of two very similar (twin
      catheter) dialysis lines and examine short and long-term function as well as complication
      rates at our centre.
