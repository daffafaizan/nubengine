      questionnaire (AACQ) at improving child understanding and enhancing a positive attitude to
      participate in biospecific nonspecimen specimen donation. A prospective, multicenter,
      randomized, and controlled trial will be performed at some hospitals in China. Three hundred
      children will be randomly asked to participate in our survey to investigate the participants'
      willingness and attitudes for donating biospecific nonspecimen specimen.The participants will
      be randomly allocated to the AACQ group and the text questionnaire (TQ) group. A separate
      knowledge test to assess the amount of knowledge acquired is included in the questionnaires.
      Additionally, participants' demographic data and basic information will be also collected. In
      our present study, we aim to test whether an audio and animated cartoon could help the child
      to understand the information about our research of biospecific nonspecimen specimen
      donation, reduce differences in their understanding, and use that information to make an
      appropriate decision for themselves. Meanwhile, we will exam factors that may influence a
      Chinese child's willingness to donate biospecific nonspecimen specimen before pediatric
      surgery.
