    
      The duration of the dose reduction phase will be 12 months. This phase will have two stage of
      6 months, respectively.

      The dose of imatinib, nilotinib, dasatinib or bosutinib will be reduced by 25-50% on the
      first stage, and by another 25% on the second stage.

        -  The initial dose of imatinib will be 400 mg daily. The dose will be reduced by 300 mg
           daily on the first stage, by 200 mg daily - on the second stage.

        -  The initial dose of nilotinib will be 300 or 400 mg twice daily. The dose will be
           reduced by 400 mg daily on the first stage, by 200 mg daily - on the second stage.

        -  The initial dose of dasatinib will be 100 or 140 mg daily. The dose will be reduced by
           50 mg daily on the first stage, by 25 mg daily - on the second stage.

        -  The initial dose of bosutinib will be 500 mg daily. The dose will be reduced by 300 mg
           daily on the first stage, by 200 mg daily - on the second stage.

      All patients with stable deep molecular response (at least 2 years) will be included in
      treatment free remission phase (TFR-phase). The duration of TFR-phase will be 24 months.

      The CML patients can enter the study already on reduced doses TKI, if they will meet the
      inclusion criteria.

      It is possible to include patients, who have already received therapy with reduced doses of
      TKI. The duration of TKI therapy with reduced doses of 1 stage should be at least 6 months,
      if TKI doses meet of stage 1. The duration of TKI therapy with reduced doses of 2 stage
      should be for at least 6 months and the general duration of TKI therapy with reduced doses
      should be for at least 12 months, if TKI doses meet of stage 2.
