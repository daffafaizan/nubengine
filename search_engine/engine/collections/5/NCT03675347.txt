      rate, predictors and outcomes of an adverse event in this population has been already
      investigated. However, to the best of our knowledge, only two papers took specifically in
      analysis rates of recurrence after a first event; the first is a recently published article
      by Giustino et al; it took in consideration recurrent events in a selected population of
      patients with ST-elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) participating in the HORIZONS-AMI
      Trial, discharged on Aspirin and Clopidogrel, analyzing their incidence in the first year of
      follow-up. The second is a paper by Fanaroff et al which primarily focused on the factors
      leading to a DAPT intensification in patients with recurrent events.

      The aim of our study is instead to analyze in detail the rates of recurrent events, but also
      their predictors and impact on outcomes, in a population of unselected real life patients
      treated with PCI for ACS discharged on either Clopidogrel, Prasugrel or Ticagrelor who
      already experienced an adverse event during the first year of follow up.
