      Center to characterize the expression of LPL in CLL. Peripheral blood from CLL patients will
      be analyzed by flow cytometry to detect the expression of LPL and to investigate if LPL
      expression correlates with a more aggressive type of CLL. The investigators propose that LPL
      protein expression on CLL cells is prognostic and that LPL and other proteins involved in
      fatty acid metabolism are critical for CLL cells to survive.
