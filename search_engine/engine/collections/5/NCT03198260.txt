        1. MTSS is associated with altered lower extremity kinematics.

        2. There is an association between tibial fascia tightness and forces acting along the
           tibial crest due to alterations in the transfer of energy from foot proximally in the
           closed kinematic chain.

        3. Fascial manipulation is found to be effective in improving the pliability of connective
           tissues in the management of musculoskeletal conditions.

        4. Therefore there is a need to determine the influence of fascial manipulation on MTSS.
