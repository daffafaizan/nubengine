      of benzonatate in Chinese healthy male and female subjects. The study was designed to be
      single-center, open, and parallel, there are 3 groups A, B, C, each group will be enrolled in
      12 healthy adult subjects. Single-dose of pharmacokinetics will be carried out in group A and
      C, single-dose and multiple-dose of pharmacokinetics will be carried out in group B. Subjects
      in group A and C will be given benzonatate of 100mg and 400mg respectively, Subjects in group
      B will be given benzonatate of 200mg. Subjects in group A and C will be given benzonatate
      once after a 10-hour fast in the first day of the trail. Subjects in group B will be given
      benzonatate once after a 10-hour fast in the first day of the trail, and they will be given
      benzonatate thrice in the second and third day of the trail, in the fourth day, they will be
      given benzonatate once after a 10-hour fast. After completing blood collection and safety
      inspection at the appropriate time points, subjects can leave the test center. The main
      pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated, to fully reflect the characteristics of drug
      absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion in human body. The main pharmacokinetic
      parameters include Tmax, Cmax, Css, AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, λz, t1/2, Vd/F, CL/F, and so on.
