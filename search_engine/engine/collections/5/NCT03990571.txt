    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the objective response rate (ORR) to axitinib and avelumab combination according to
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria patients with recurrent or
      metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) who have evidence of disease progression within 6
      months prior to study enrollment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess ORR to axitinib and avelumab combination according to immune-related (ir)RECIST
      criteria patients with recurrent or metastatic adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC).

      II. Evaluate median progression free survival (PFS), PFS rate at 6 months after start of
      treatment.

      III. Evaluate median overall survival (OS), OS rate at 6 months after start of treatment.

      IV. Evaluate duration of response (DoR). V. Evaluate safety and toxicity.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess molecular markers associated with response and resistance to the study combination
      using tissue and/or plasma obtained from study participants.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive axitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and avelumab
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days and then
      every 6 months thereafter.
