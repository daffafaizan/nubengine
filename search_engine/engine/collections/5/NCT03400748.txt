      effectiveness of the ANET Electrosurgery Applicator in up to 10 subjects.

      Subjects who consent to participate in this study will have a lung tumor that is scheduled to
      be removed surgically as part of their normal treatment. During the surgical procedure, just
      prior to resection the subject's tumor will be treated with the ANET device. The ANET device
      uses a bronchoscope to reach the tumor. Ultrasound on the bronchoscope, CT, and X-rays are
      used to make sure the ANET device is in the tumor. Once in the tumor, the ANET device uses
      radio-frequency (RF) ablation to treat the tumor. After standard surgical resection the tumor
      and surrounding tissue is evaluated to characterize the effect of the ANET.
