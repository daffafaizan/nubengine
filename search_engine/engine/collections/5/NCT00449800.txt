      patients allows the development of the model and a second group of 20 patients will be used
      for the validation of the model.

      Septic patients treated with ceftriaxone according to standard procedure of our ICU could be
      included before the second administration of the drug. In the development group, patients
      will underwent five determination of serum concentration of ceftriaxone during the 24 hours
      following the second administration. The timing of samples will be randomised in three
      groups. A second phase of sampling will take place during the fifth day of ceftriaxone
      therapy for sepsis and severe sepsis patients and after 48 hours catecholamine- free for
      septic shock patients.

      For the validation group, ten samples will be obtained at the same periods. This study will
      not induce any change in the care of patients.

      Samples will be centrifugated immediately after collection and conserved at - 20 Â°C.

      Ceftriaxone will be assayed in the department of pharmacology, university of Marseille
      France, usig HPLC method.
