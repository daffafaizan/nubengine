    
      Pharmacogenetic testing of uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 (UGT1A1) *6/*28 is
      recommended in clinical practice prior to the administration of irinotecan (CPT-11)-based
      regimens, such as FOLFIRI regimen in patients with advanced colorectal cancer. To avoid
      severe toxicity of irinotecan, such as severe neutropenia and diarrhea, patients with UGT1A1
      *6/*28 mutation often start with a reduced dose of irinotecan. However, it remains unclear
      whether high-dose CPT-based regimen (FOLFIRI) could increase clinical efficacy in CRC
      patients when compared with standard-dose FOLFIRI or FOLFOX-6 regimens. This trial aims to
      compare the efficacy, safety of high-dose FOLFIRI and standard-dose FOLFIRI or FOLFOX-6 in
      advanced colorectal cancer patients with UGT1A1*6 G/G and *28 TA6/6.
