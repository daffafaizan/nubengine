      undergoing high-dose chemotherapy and hematopoietic stem cells transplantation, who will be
      randomized into two groups. The results of muscle strength in the lower limbs, general
      mobility, fatigue and clinical symptoms will be compared between the control group and the
      experimental group.

      The control group will perform an exercise program based on the standard protocol of the
      physiotherapy service, where exercises are performed to gain strength in muscle groups of the
      upper and lower limbs, range of motion, balance and functional movements. The experimental
      group will perform the same exercises as the control group, added to a training program using
      a bicycle ergometer, with an incremental load (from 60% to 70% of the maximum heart rate) for
      20 minutes.
