    
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
      procedure of a microneedle injection of triamcinolone acetonide (TA) into the SCS. The
      subjects enrolled in this study will be chosen from subjects with non-infectious
      intermediate, posterior and pan-uveitis. The injection will only be administered to a single
      eye via the Clearside Biomedical proprietary microneedle into the SCS. The dose of TA to be
      injected is 4 mg of currently approved TRIESENCE® (triamcinolone acetonide injectable
      suspension 40 mg/mL). The study design includes 10 clinic visits over 27 weeks. Subjects will
      be followed for 26 weeks following treatment with TRIESENCE®.
