      international Cardiology guidelines, baseline demographic data is collected. Age, gender,
      NYHA functional class, comorbidities, QRS width on ECG, presence of left bundle branch block
      pattern on ECG, presence of atrial fibrillation, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) on
      echocardiogram, ventricular dimensions, 6 min walk test distance are collected. In addition,
      during the CRT implant procedure, blood is drawn from the vascular access and analysed for
      NT-pro BNP levels and other biomarkers of heart failure. The echocardiographic and ECG
      parameters and blood biomarkers are reanalysed at 6 months and 12 months following CRT
      implant. Response to CRT is defined as a reduction in the iLVESV (left ventricular
      end-systolic volume index to body surface area) of >/= 15% and/or an increase in the LVEF of
      >/= 10%.
