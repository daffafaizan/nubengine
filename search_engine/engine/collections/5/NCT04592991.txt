      characterized by transmural aortic macrophage infiltration, elastin degradation, and
      reduction of smooth muscle cell content. AAAs occurs later in life and are especially
      prevalent in men over the age of 65. Patients typically remain asymptomatic until rupture,
      which is associated with high mortality. Currently, surgical repair is the only approach for
      AAA treatment, and there is no pharmacological intervention. Clinically, ultrasound and
      computed tomography measurement of aneurysm diameter represents the mainstay of management
      and the principal determinant of timing for elective surgical repair. However, this
      anatomy-based approach fails to provide useful information about the cellular and molecular
      processes associated with aneurysm expansion and rupture. Therefore, developing translatable
      molecular biomarkers, specifically expressed by aneurysms, is necessary to determine
      associated status and progression, capture the risk of rupture, and deliver personalized
      treatment.
