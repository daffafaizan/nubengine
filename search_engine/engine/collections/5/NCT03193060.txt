      prostate cancer. It is also increasingly used in patients with high-risk localized prostate
      cancer or in patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse after local therapy.

      The luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists, such as goserelin
      acetate(Zoladex速), have provided an effective and reversible means of suppressing androgen
      level. Zoladex速 was originally formulated as a 3.6mg depot injection. Goserelin acetate
      10.8-mg depot, given once every 3 months, is pharmacodynamically equivalent to 3 consecutive
      monthly injections of the goserelin acetate 3.6-mg depot, offers a more convenient and
      cost-effective dosing regimen for patients.

      Goserelin acetate 10.8-mg depot has been available in China since 2012. However, data on the
      effectiveness and safety of the long-acting depot of Zoladex速 (goserelin acetate depot)
      10.8mg specifically in a Chinese population is limited. A "real-world" observational study is
      proposed to establish the effectiveness and safety profile of Zoladex 速 10.8mg in Chinese
      patients with localized or locally advanced prostate cancer.
