    
      The following evaluations will be performed the day prior to the endoscopic evaluation :1)
      calculation of a clinical score based on the diurnal and nocturnal respiratory and
      nutritional tolerance of the UAO, 2) evaluation of the importance and the localisation of the
      UAO assessed by the acoustic reflection method, 3) measurement of the work of breathing, 4)
      recording of nocturnal gas exchange during at least 6 hours by s single monitor (Sentec™)
      which measures pulse oximetry (SaO2) and transcutaneous carbon dioxide (PtcCO2), and
      evaluation of sleep quality by actigraphy (recording of patient's movements by an
      Actiwatch™).

      All the patients will be re-assessed after 3 months. If no treatment is required, a second
      clinical evaluation with an acoustic reflection examination will be performed. If a surgical
      treatment or a noninvasive positive pressure ventilation will be necessary, a second complete
      evaluation will be performed with an endoscopic examination, the calculation of the clinical
      score, an acoustic reflection examination, the measurement of the work of breathing, and the
      recording of the nocturnal gas exchange and sleep quality. This second endoscopic examination
      will be performed only for medical purpose and not for research only.

      The study will last 24 months, comprising 21 months for the inclusion of the patients and 3
      months for the analysis of the data.
