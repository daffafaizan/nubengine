        -  Determine the response rate in women with metastatic breast cancer treated with two
           different dose schedules of doxorubicin HCL liposome.

        -  Assess the side effects of these treatment regimens in this patient population.

        -  Determine the duration of response in these patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Assess the concentration of doxorubicin in tumor tissue in patients with easily
           accessible metastases.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      participating center, performance status (0-1 vs 2), visceral disease (yes vs no), available
      lesions for biopsy (yes vs no), prior adjuvant anthracyclines (yes vs no), and prior
      chemotherapy for advanced disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin HCL liposome IV over 1 hour every 6 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin HCL liposome IV over 1 hour every 4 weeks.
           Treatment continues for at least 36 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
           unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 64-100 patients (32-50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study.
