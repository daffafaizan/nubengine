      think of the services they and their children receive and how these services affect their
      psychosocial outcome. MPOC exists in two versions: the 56-item version was published in 1995
      and the MPOC-20 in 2004. The20-item version was developed due to disadvantage of the longer
      version, because its completion can be very time consuming and the consequences of low
      respondent percentages . King and colleagues assert that the56-item MPOC is useful for
      research, while the MPOC-20 is better applied as a measure of parents' perceptions of the
      elements of FCS. The 20 items in the short version are distributed among the same ﬁve scales
      as in the MPOC-56. This ensures that the MPOC-56/20 captures aspects of care and services
      that have most importance for parents. The items are included in one of the following ﬁve
      scales:

      1 Enabling and partnership; 2 Providing general information; 3 Providing speciﬁc information
      about the child; 4 Coordinated and comprehensive care; 5 Respectful and supportive care.

      The Measure of Processes of Care for Service Providers (MPOC-SP) was developed to assess FCS
      from the perspective of professionals. The MPOC-SP has also been used in many different
      studies with different populations.
