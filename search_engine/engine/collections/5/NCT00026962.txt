      function. However, the day-to-day variations in these levels necessitates serial blood
      sampling or elaborate efforts to time blood draws within specific phases of the menstrual
      cycle. A noninvasive method for assessment of the levels of sex steroids on a daily basis
      using saliva has been developed. This study will assess the levels of estradiol and
      progesterone during 3 menstrual cycles (pre-drug and after 3 and 12 months of raloxifene
      therapy) in pre-menopausal women participating in a pilot chemoprevention trial of
      raloxifene.
