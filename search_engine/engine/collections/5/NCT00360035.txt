      2-week cycles as a 24-hour infusion every 2 weeks at a fixed dose of 60 mg to patients with
      myelofibrosis. Infusions may be administered on an outpatient basis. No investigational or
      commercial agents or therapies other than those described in the protocol may be administered
      with the intent to treat the patient's malignancy. Supportive care measures including those
      directed at controlling symptoms resulting from myelofibrosis (blood products, growth factor,
      hydroxyurea, etc.) are allowed.
