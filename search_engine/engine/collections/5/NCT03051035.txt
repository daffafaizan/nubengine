      dose (MTD) of KO-947 in subjects with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic, relapsed
      and/or refractory, non-hematological malignancies. If an MTD cannot be identified, a
      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined. In addition, two tumor specific extension
      cohorts may be conducted to further characterize the safety and tolerability of KO-947 and
      provide preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity. Three dosing schedules will be executed
      (Schedule 1, 2, or 3).

      Screening evaluations will be completed following signing of informed consent and within
      either 21 days or 28 days of Cycle 1 Day 1. Evaluations performed as part of the standard of
      care within 21/28 days of dosing but prior to consent do not need to be repeated. By signing
      the consent form, study subjects agree to the collection of standard of care health
      information.

      The study will consist of three parts: dose escalation, MTD expansion and tumor specific
      extension.
