      assessments of skeletal muscle mass, muscle strength, and muscle endurance. Weeks 2-11 will
      be comprised of the resistance training intervention wherein participants will train thrice
      weekly at the Chan Gunn Pavilion research laboratory at the University of British Columbia.

      Resistance training sessions will include unilateral knee extensions and unilateral dumbbell
      bicep preacher curls with each being performed for three sets. Limbs assigned to train with
      higher-loads will perform between 8-12 repetitions per set and limbs assigned to train with
      lower-loads will perform between 20-25 repetitions per set. Participants will rest 90 seconds
      between sets and 120 seconds between exercises. Each exercise will be performed in its
      entirety before moving on to the next.

      Participants will also be supplemented with whey protein which will be ingested twice daily
      during the resistance training phase.
