    
      The physicians and nurses responsible for the individual patient's care will be given a
      questionaire. They are asked to estimate the functional and cognitive status as well as
      quality of life of their patient. The patient with intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid
      hemorrhage is examined and assessed with respective established and validated prognostic
      scores and models at the same time points.

      The actual prognosis is assessed by telephone interview and questionaires at 3 and 6 months,
      either from the patient or his/her caretaker.
