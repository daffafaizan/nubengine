    
      This study is a phase I, open-label, non-randomized study to evaluate safety of BC2059
      administered intravenously to subjects with proven primary or recurrent desmoid tumor that is
      unresectable and symptomatic or progressive. This study will utilize single patient cohorts
      for the first two dose levels in order to minimize sub-optimal drug exposures, followed by a
      conventional 3+3 dose escalation phase to achieve MTD or RP2D determined by pharmacokinetics
      or biologically relevant activity. Once MTD or RP2D is determined, that dose level cohort
      will expand to 14 patients enrolled to collect additional safety PK and PD data. If at least
      1 patient has clinical benefit, the dose expansion phase will be expanded by a further 11
      patients (25 total in at RP2D). The total duration of study for each subject will be
      dependent upon the safety, tolerability and efficacy of BC2059
