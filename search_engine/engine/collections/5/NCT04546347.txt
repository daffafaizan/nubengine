      oestrogen receptor (ER) positive breast cancer. ER-positive breast cancer is where the cancer
      cells grow in response to the hormone oestrogen. The study will try to identify and compare
      how much of the test medicine formulations (recipes) are taken up into the blood when given
      as a tablet, a solution and as an injection directly into the vein. The dose given directly
      into the vein will be radiolabelled, meaning that it contains a radioactive component in
      order to track where the drug is in the body. This study will also look at the effect of food
      when taking the test medicine in the form of the tablet. The test medicine safety and
      tolerability will also be assessed. This is a one-part study involving up to 32 healthy
      post-menopausal female volunteers aged 50 to 70. Volunteers will be randomly assigned to a
      group of up to 8, two groups will partake in four study periods and two groups will partake
      in three study periods. Volunteers will be admitted to the clinical unit on the day before
      dosing (Day -1) for each study period. On Day 1 of each study period, volunteers will receive
      either a single oral dose (tablet or solution) of AZD9833 or a single oral dose (tablet) of
      AZD9833 co-administered with a single radiolabelled IV dose of [14C]AZD9833, in either the
      fed or fasted state. There will be a minimum 7 day washout between periods. Volunteers will
      remain resident until 72 hours post dose (Day 4) of each study period. A follow-up phone call
      will take place 5 to 7 days post-final dose to ensure the ongoing wellbeing of the
      volunteers.
