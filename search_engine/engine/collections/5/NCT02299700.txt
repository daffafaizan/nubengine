      are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes) and prospective (study following participants
      forward in time) study to determine JAKE in children and adults with ASD. The study will be
      conducted in 2 stages and each stage consists of 2 parts: Screening Phase (14 days), data
      collection Phase (Stage 1: 1 week and Stage 2: 4 weeks) and, stage 2 has follow-up Phase (up
      to 4 weeks post-data collection). The maximum study duration for each participant will not
      exceed 1 week for stage 1 and 8 weeks for stage 2. Primarily, the usability of JAKE as a
      system to monitor clinical outcomes in ASD will be assessed. Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
