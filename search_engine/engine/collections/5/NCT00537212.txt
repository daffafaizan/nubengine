      psoriasis who are eligible for and willing to undergo phototherapy. Subjects undergoing
      phototherapy alone will be compared to subjects randomized to receive phototherapy and
      dietary modification with the goal of weight loss. The primary objective is to determine the
      success rate of weight loss programs in the setting of psoriasis. Secondary objectives
      include evaluating the effect of weight loss on efficacy of narrow band ultraviolet B
      phototherapy, and assessing the efficacy of lower carbohydrate and low fat diets in psoriatic
      patients.
