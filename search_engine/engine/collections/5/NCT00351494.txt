      included prospectively in our study and evaluated with sonography before and after injection
      of Sonovue (2.4 ml) (Bracco Int Milano Italy). Pelvic ultrasound with contrast enhancement
      will be done the day after and six months after the procedure.

      Microvascularization of the myomas and the endometrium will be described. Some tiny myomas
      which are not visible on conventional sonography could be identified for a perfect matching
      with MRI detection.
