      intratumoral injection of autologous CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myeloid dendritic cells in combination
      with intratumoral injection of the CTLA-4 blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) ipilimumab and
      the PD-L1 blocking mAb avelumab. Concomitantly, nivolumab (a PD-1 blocking mAb) will be
      administered intravenously.

      CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myeloid dendritic (myDC) cells will be obtained by immunomagnetic isolation
      from PBMC obtained by leukapheresis. The CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC will not be substantially
      manipulated prior to autologous intratumoral injection, immediately following the isolation
      and concentration (isolation and administration will be performed in the same procedure). The
      investigators consider that the isolation represents a non-substantial manipulation of this
      somatic cell therapy product. The intended use of CD1c (BDCA-1)+ myDC in this clinical
      protocol is to enrich their presence within the injected metastasis where they should execute
      their physiological role of coordinating the anti-tumor immune response. Based on recent
      preclinical data, absence of myeloid dendritic cells in the tumor microenvironment is an
      important immune escape mechanism of malignant tumors.
