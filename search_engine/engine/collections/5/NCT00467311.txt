      after cardiac catheterization. During the last 30 years, because of the increasing use of
      contrast medium for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures, this has become the third
      in-hospital cause of acute renal failure (12%). That's why, it is necessary to establish an
      earlier marker of renal dysfunction that can help us in the diagnosis and allow us to
      initiate the appropriate therapeutics, because depending on the severity of the renal damage,
      it can increase the cardiovascular risk and morbidity.

      The risk of contrast medium nephropathy is still present even with the use of low osmolarity
      contrast media, and many patients increase their in-hospital days, costs and hemodialysis
      requirement.

      Cystatin C is a non glucosylated protein produced in nucleated cells in a constant rate, and
      because of its low molecular weight it's filtered through the glomerular membrane without
      restriction and it's fully reabsorbed in the proximal tubule, that's why it's considered an
      excellent marker evaluating the glomerular filtration rate in patients with acute renal
      failure during the first 24-48 hours.

      We propose that Cystatin C can be useful as an earlier and superior marker of
      contrast-induced nephropathy in high and intermedium cardiac catheterization patients.
