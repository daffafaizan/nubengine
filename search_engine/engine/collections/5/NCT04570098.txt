      causing a limiting prognosis. The new interventional therapies have given more relevance to
      the questions of the prognostic significance of severe TR in the various heart failure
      entities.

      Important but currently unanswered questions for the establishment of successful,
      interventional therapies of TR are:

        1. What effect does TR have on patients with heart failure?

        2. Which patients at which stage of the disease benefit from interventional TR-therapies?
           In order to answer these questions, the aim of the study is to prospectively record the
           prevalence of TR (including quantification) in all heart failure patients at the
           Charit√©, followed by long-term observation to assess its prognostic relevance.

      In addition to answering the above-mentioned questions, the project will allow a central
      registration of all symptomatic heart failure patients. A comparative outcome analysis per
      propensity score matching with the untreated patients of the registry would allow to give
      first considerations which patients are ideal candidates for interventional therapies.
