    
      This is a multi-center, randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing primary total hip
      arthroplasty. This study will be focused on enrollment at a single site with possible
      expansion to additional centers should patient enrollment occur at a slower than expected
      rate. Decision to expand the study to additional centers will be mutually agreed upon by both
      the clinical site and the study sponsor.

      Patients will be randomized to two study groups:

        1. Zimmer Avenir cementless, HA-coated femoral hip stem with matching Trilogy IT cup;

        2. DePuy-Synthes Corail cementless, HA-coated, non-collared femoral hip stem with matching
           Pinnacle cup Patient allocation to the study groups will occur following a randomized
           4-block design.
