      patients with primary cutaneous melanoma with Breslow thickness > 2mm or 1-2mm with
      ulceration (pT2b-pT4b, AJCC 8th edition), treated with either a 1cm excision margin or 2cm
      margin. The study is designed to be able to prove or disprove that there is no difference in
      risk of the tumour recurring around the scar or anywhere else in the body between the two
      groups of patients. If the study shows no risk of tumour recurrence then we will also be able
      to determine how much of an impact the narrower excision has on patients in terms of improved
      quality of life and reduced side effects from the surgery and melanoma disease. This trial
      will also evaluate and determine the economic impact of narrower excision margins on the
      health services and society in general.
