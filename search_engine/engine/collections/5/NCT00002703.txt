      boost produces a 20% increase in the proportion of Stage I/II prostate cancer free from local
      failure and biochemical relapse at 5 years when compared to results of conventional-dose
      radiotherapy. II. Determine whether high-dose radiotherapy produces a 33% reduction in the
      cumulative incidence of a rising PSA (second hormone failure) following hormone therapy given
      at the time of first PSA/clinical failure when compared with conventional-dose radiotherapy.
      IV. Assess the relative rectal, bladder, and sexual morbidity of conformal photon doses of
      70.2 and 79.2 Gy in these patients. V. Collect, in a prospective manner, paraffin biopsy
      blocks for subsequent analysis of emerging molecular pathologic predictors of outcome in
      three patients.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Boost to the prostate using high-LET protons
      followed by irradiation of the prostate, periprostatic tissues, and seminal vesicles using
      conformal photons with energies greater than 6 MV. Conventional dose. Arm II: Radiotherapy.
      As in Arm I. High dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 390 patients accrued into this study over 3 years. An
      additional 3.5 years will be required for follow-up.
