      Group 1: Boostrix + Menactra on Day 0, blood samples at Month 0 and Month 1 Group 2: Boostrix
      on Day 0, Menactra at Month 1, blood samples at Month 0, Month 1, and Month 2 Group 3:
      Menactra on Day 0, Boostrix at Month 1, blood samples at Month 0, Month 1 and Month 2
      Treatment allocation: randomized 1:1:1 Type of study: self-contained Duration of the study:
