      Time-limited cohort study involving serial measurements of Bilateral Anterior Thigh Thickness
      (BATT) using ultrasound, handgrip strength, physical performance, and physical function
      measured using the Patient Reported Outcome Measures Information System (PROMISÂ®). We aim to
      fully characterise changes in these patients, and will perform a comprehensive evaluation of
      clinical factors including nutrition and physical activity, and measure immune-endocrine
      markers of inflammation.

      Study Participants

      Elective colorectal surgery, emergency abdominal surgery, and medical patients aged 70 years
      and older

      Planned Size of recruitment target

      56 elective colorectal patients, 56 emergency abdominal surgery patients, and 56 medical
      patients with acute infections

      Follow up duration

      3 months

      Primary research question

      Does acute change in quadriceps muscle thickness, handgrip strength and/or physical
      performance within one week of hospitalisation predict change in patient reported physical
      function at three months?
