      attention to optimize the secondary prevention and improve the prognosis. Secondary
      prevention has been showing the effects of improving symptoms, preventing disease
      progression, improving prognosis, and reducing mortality in patients received coronary artery
      bypass grafting (CABG) surgery. In this study, we are trying to evaluate the effectiveness of
      artificial intelligence (AI) assisted follow-up strategy on secondary prevention for patients
      received CABG surgery. And we are trying to find out whether there is difference in secondary
      prevention of coronary heart disease between urban and rural patients.
