    
      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind study. Patients are stratified by
      participating institution.

      All patients are treated with intravenous acyclovir for 14 days. Patients are then randomly
      assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups if the following criteria are met: no systemic disease
      involvement, documented by negative cerebrospinal fluid exam, brain computerized tomography,
      and magnetic resonance imaging; and entry criteria continue to be met.

      Randomized treatment begins 8 hours after the final dose of intravenous acyclovir. One group
      is treated with oral acyclovir, while the control group receives an oral placebo.

      Treatment continues for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, systemic disease,
      and 2 or more recurrences of skin lesions. Patients are followed at 6 months, then yearly for
      at least 4 years.

      The study duration is estimated to be 4 years.
