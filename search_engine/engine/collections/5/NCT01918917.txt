      Status class I-II, who were scheduled for arthroscopic knee surgery, were enrolled in a
      randomised comparative clinical trial. Blinding or masking began in the preoperative holding
      unit. Exclusion criteria were psychiatric illness, younger than 18 yo, who has analgesic
      treatment before the surgery and known hypersensitivity to relevant drugs. All patients
      received a standard anaesthetic protocol; ECG, heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure,
      oxygen saturation and temperature were monitored. After preoxygenation, general anaesthesia
      was induced with sodium pentothal 4 to 7 mg/kg, 1 mcg/kg fentanyl and neuromuscular block was
      achieved with rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg and trachea was intubated. Anesthesia was maintained with
      desflurane 6% and 50% oxygen in the medical air.

      Randomised patients were achieved dexmedetomidine and levobupivacaine or levobupivacaine
      intra-articularly 10 minutes before medical tourniquet deaerated.

      Postoperative analgesia was maintained with morphine in patient-controlled analgesia.
      Patients postoperative VAS values and analgesic consumptions were recorded in postoperative
      24 hours.
