      hoped that IL-2 treatment can help restore CD4 cell counts and immune function in people
      whose immune systems have been damaged by HIV. Over the last 10 years, NIAID has sponsored a
      number of important studies of IL-2 in HIV infected people; many of these trials are ongoing.
      This study was developed in an effort consolidate these separate, smaller trials into one
      larger study so that results between the trials can be shared and used to develop future
      protocols. This study is an umbrella study that will provide long-term administrative
      support, treatment, and monitoring for ongoing Phase I and II IL-2 trials and their
      participants. It is primarily intended for patients in the extension phases of any previous
      NIAID Clinical Center HIV Program (NIAID/CCMD) intramural research protocols in which IL-2
      therapy continues to be offered. Blood collection will occur through a patient's
      participation in this study.

      Participants will continue to follow the protocol in which they originally enrolled. A
      desired therapeutic goal or "CD4 plateau" will be used in most cases to help clinicians
      determine when a participant requires additional IL-2. In general, if a participant has two
      or more consecutive CD4 counts below the CD4 plateau, additional IL-2 will be administered to
      that patient. In maintaining uniformity among the many trials being consolidated under this
      trial, the frequency and nature of study visits will be solely dictated by this umbrella
      study. Participants will also be asked to join an optional substudy: Interrupted Versus
      Continuous Antiretrovirals Involving Randomization from the Umbrella Study (ICARUS).
