      The diagnosis of ADHD is based on clinical psychiatric evaluation in different clinical
      situations the differential diagnosis is not straight forward and the clinician considers a
      common co-morbid conditions and common differential diagnoses.

      With the expanding knowledge regarding the neurobiological basis in ADHD the scientific
      community have learned that attention is not a general property of the whole brain, but
      involves several coordinated networks. This knowledge promoted us to the stage in which
      scientists can recognize different types of attention domains. this knowledge raises the
      question - can the clinician use this knowledge to make the correct diagnosis based on
      specific attentional profile?

      In the current study, the investigators use computerized battery in order to separate between
      the different attention abilities and provide specific attentional profile. in this study the
      investigators aim to characterize different attentional profiles in children who are
      diagnosed with ADHD versus children who diagnosed with other mental condition (which are
      common differential diagnoses of ADHD)
