      with repetitive movements (things that people do over and over again) and difficulty
      communicating with other people (problems with talking to, understanding, or just being in a
      relationships with other people). The investigators are trying to find out why these brain
      areas are working differently in people with developmental disorders, such as Autism and how
      the investigators can one day improve them with new brain stimulation techniques.

      The investigators will do screening to make sure that you are eligible for the study. After
      screening, the investigators will do functional MRI. In this procedure the subject or the
      control will be looking at videos developed to understand their social communication and
      language skills. The investigators will be able to understand differences of brain activation
      between patients and control. The investigators will also use TMS to identify the difference
      of motor excitability between patients and healthy control.
