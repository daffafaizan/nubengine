      in the study. After obtaining written informed consent from all the patients, they were
      randomly allotted to either Study (TAP) Group or Control group. Standard general anesthesia
      with endotracheal intubation was performed in all the patients. Preoperatively all patients
      received information about Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for Pain Score from 1 to 10 depending
      on intensity of pain and about the use of Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA) Pump. After the
      end of surgery and before extubation bilateral Ultrasound guided Transversus Abdominis Plane
      (TAP) block was performed with 16 G Tuohy needle and 18 G Braun Perifix epidural catheter was
      placed about 6-8 cms in situ. Bupivacaine 0.25 % 20 ml was given bilaterally and repeated 8
      hourly in the Postoperative Anaesthesia Care Unit (PACU) for first 24 hours. The PCA Pump was
      set to deliver bolus Intravenous Morphine 1 milligram ( mg ) with lock out interval 10
      minutes. In the PACU heart rate, Non invasive blood pressure, Visual Analogue Score at rest
      and on knee flexion, Sedation score, nausea and vomiting, any side effects as itching was
      noted by care provider at 0, 2, 4, 6, 12, 18 and 24 hours. Total and good PCA demands upto 24
