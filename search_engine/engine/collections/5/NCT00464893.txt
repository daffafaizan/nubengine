    
      An open-label, multi-center phase II study in surgically resectable patients after
      neoadjuvant ECX-chemotherapy, with confirmed diagnosis of gastric adenocarcinoma and with a
      high risk of disseminated tumor cells due to serosal infiltration or positive lymph nodes
      after curative gastrectomy.

      Treatment with catumaxomab will consist of an initial dose of 10 µg given intraoperatively as
      an intraperitoneal bolus and of four postoperative ascending doses (10-20-50-150 µg)which
      will be administered as an i.p.-infusion using an installed abdominal i.p.-port on the
      postoperative days 7, 10, 13 and 16.

      Catumaxomab is a trifunctional antibody targeting EpCAM on tumor cells and CD3 on T cells.
      Trifunctional antibodies represent a new concept for targeted anticancer therapy. This new
      antibody class has the capability to redirect T cells and accessory cells (e.g. macrophages,
      dendritic cells [DCs] and natural killer [NK] cells) to the tumor site. According to
      preclinical data, trifunctional antibodies activate these different immune effector cells,
      which can trigger a complex anti-tumor immune response.
