      areas in patients with cervical dystonia (CD) with the goal of improving symptoms and
      reducing unwanted side effects. The knowledge gained in this proposed research will identify
      a specific premotor area to be targeted with rTMS that is expected to result in a novel
      intervention that could enhance or replace current treatments for CD. rTMS could be included
      as an adjunct treatment to botulinum toxin that could sustain treatment effect and decrease
      the frequency of re-injection, potentially resulting in cost savings without a decrease in
      symptom control. In addition to medical cost reduction, improved quality of life could be
      expected with the successful development of therapies that extend dystonia symptom control.
      rTMs has been FDA-approved for the treatment of depression and our proposal uses an even
      lower stimulation rate, suggesting continued use within clearly safe parameters. Successful
      completion of this research could lead to rapid adoption of this therapeutic modality.

      We will test the hypothesis that rTMS of a distinct premotor site will provide more effective
      treatment of CD than non-specific activation of the entire premotor region. This will be done
      by performing a randomized, observer-blinded exploratory pilot study to determine the optimal
      site of rTMS over various sites of the premotor and motor cortex to improve the symptoms of
      cervical dystonia. Completion of this aim should lead to development of targeted TMS therapy
      for CD.
