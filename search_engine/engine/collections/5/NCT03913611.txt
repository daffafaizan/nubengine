    
      This is a randomised controlled trial involving patients who have a double-row arthroscopic
      rotator cuff repair. We wish to compare clinical and radiological outcomes for patients
      undergoing standard rehabilitation protocols versus accelerated rehabilitation.

      A double-row repair will be used in this study as it has been shown in laboratory testing to
      be stronger and withstand significantly more cyclical loads before failure.

      Patients who have failed conservative treatment for their rotator cuff tears will be offered
      inclusion in the study. Baseline scores and measurements will be taken prior to surgery.
      After a successful surgical repair has been confirmed, patients will be randomised to one of
      two rehabilitation programmes. One programme will mandate use of a sling for 6 weeks, and
      another will not require use of a sling after the immediate postoperative period.

      All patients will be followed up for one year, at intervals of 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months
      and 12 months, using subjective outcome measures, objective measures of movement and an MRI
      scan to assess the integrity of the repair at 6 months.
