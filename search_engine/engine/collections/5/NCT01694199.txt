      Provant Therapy System (test device) to an identical sham device (placebo) in subjects
      experiencing post-operative pain following first metatarsal bunion surgery. The study
      hypothesis is that, over the first 72 hours (3 days) after the initial test device treatment,
      subjects treated with an active test device will show a statistically significant difference
      (reduction) in pain intensity scores when compared with subjects treated with a sham
      (placebo) device. Treatment with the test device will continue through the 168 hour (7 day)
      timepoint. Safety will be followed through 28 days.
