      receiving OST therapy on a daily basis from a pharmacist. Newer therapies for HCV have
      recently become much simpler to initiate and supervise with much improved effectiveness and
      as described below it is now proposed to extend the role of community pharmacists into
      initiating HCV therapy alongside the existing OST The SuperDOT-C study will utilise this
      existing environment and relationship to smooth the pathway into HCV therapy with
      co-administration of OST alongside the anti-HCV therapy under the supervision of the
      pharmacist compared with the established pathway of referral to another site and treatment
      with a nurse led ant-HCV treatment program. This new pathway may have positive effects on the
      movement towards HCV cure at multiple levels. The planned pathway is different to current
      care at each point, from testing and diagnosis through adherence to cure. In the planned
      pathway, the patient interacts with the pharmacist on a daily basis, as compared to
      intermittent interaction with a secondary care team member. The result being that the patient
      has a shorter care pathway, with less travelling and better access to anti-HCV treatment. The
      daily interaction with the pharmacy provides opportunities to assess and support the patient,
      provide sound advice and care, with the added benefit of being able to directly observe
      treatment, (DOT), thus potentially improving adherence.
