      parathyroidectomy by an endocrine surgeon for SHPT. All were submitted to a bilateral neck
      exploration with a subtotal parathyroidectomy. Three IOPTH determinations were withdrawn: at
      anesthetic induction (PTH0), 15 minutes (PTH15), and 30 minutes (PTH30) after completion
      gland resection. Another sample was taken 24 hours after the procedure (PTH24), values
      <150pg/mL defined a successful surgery and patients were assigned to the successful or
      unsuccessful group. IOPTH drop was analyzed to predict successful surgery with drops of 70%
      and 90% at 15 and 30 minutes.
