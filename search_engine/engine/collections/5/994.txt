intra-arterial chemotherapy for cancer metastatic to liver.twenty-two patients with cancer metastaticto the liver were treated by the intra-arterialinfusion of cancer chemotherapeuticagents.  the drugs were introduceddirectly into the hepatic artery in 10 patientsand into the aorta to the level of theceliac axis in 12 patients.  no significant differencesin results were observed in the2 groups.  of the 10 patients who received cancerchemotherapy via the hepatic artery,one remains alive 2 mth. after treatment;3 died in the immediate posttreatmentperiod; 7 survived from 1-17 mths aftertreatment, an average survival of6.1 mth.  all 12 patients who were treated bythe intra-aortic administration of cancerchemotherapy have died; 3 patients diedin the immediate posttreatment period; thesurvival time of the remaining 9 averaged3.7 mth.  an objective significant shrinkageof the metastases in the liver wasobserved in 6 patients (3 treated by the intra-hepaticartery route and 3 via the aorta);this lasted from 1-10 mth.  subjective palliationwas observed in 12 patients (5treated by the intrahepatic artery route and 7by the intra-aortic route).  the majorcomplication noted was leukopenia; to a lesserdegree, hepatic failure.  in those patientswith poor metabolic reserve and inthose who had received chemotherapy,irradiation or both in the immediate past,the complications were severe.  the needfor critical screening for the proper selectionof patients as candidates for cancerchemotherapy is discussed.
