      endovascular coiling or surgical clipping. Intervention is applied once a day, 6 days a week
      for 2 weeks(total 12 sessions) in addition to standard treatment such as prophylactic HHH
      therapy and nimodipine. Sterile disposable, stainless steel acupuncture needles are used.

      Primary outcome measurement is the occurrence of delayed ischemic neurological deficit
      between the study group and the control group. Moreover, the incidence of angiographic
      vasospasm, TCD vasospasm, and vasospasm-related infarct on CT or MRI, the change of nitric
      oxide(NO) and endothelin-1 in plasma, mortality and participant's functional status using mRS
      will be compared.
