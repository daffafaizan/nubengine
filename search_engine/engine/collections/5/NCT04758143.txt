      disease that occurs most often in young people with active social activities, and it occurs
      in about 100,000 people in 14 cases. The recurrence rate is as high as 17% to 54%, and the
      delay of the rehabilitation by the ambulatory with the treatment and prolongation of the
      hospitalization becomes a problem. It becomes a large failure for the youth who requires
      early rehabilitation. According to the latest report from the Japanese Society of Surgery,
      approximately 12,000 pneumothorax surgeries are performed annually in Japan. Many of them
      applied absorbent material to the surgical stump (coverage technique). However, there are no
      prospective studies, and efficacy does not appear adequately tested. It is necessary to
      accumulate prospective data from multiple centers to investigate the coverage technique's
      real effect.
