      resection system that utilizes a high-pressure saline stream to resect and remove prostate
      tissue in males suffering from LUTS due to BPH. The primary objective of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and performance of obtaining hemostasis using balloon catheters with and
      without hemostatic agents following prostate resection using AQUABEAM for the treatment of
      LUTS resulting from BPH. Up to 50 participants will be included in the trial at one clinical
      study site. All patients will be followed up for 3 months for safety assessment prior to
      study exit. The trial is a dual-arm prospective, interventional clinical trial.
