    
      This is a prospective, open-label, multicentric phase II single-arm trial in which patients
      with initially unresectable and previously untreated RAS wild-type mCRC will receive
      induction treatment with mFOLFOXIRI plus cetuximab and avelumab up to 12 cycles followed by
      maintenance with 5-FU/LV plus cetuximab plus avelumab until disease progression, unacceptable
      toxicity or patient's refusal. The second- and subsequent lines of treatment will be at
      investigators' choice.
