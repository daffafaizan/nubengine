      effect of a 16 weeks 3-weekly supervised and adapted physical exercise program that combines
      muscle strength and aerobic training with progressive intensity. The benefits of physical
      exercise programs in breast cancer survivors is well known. However, the studied programs
      usually are not generalizable because of needs of specialized exercise professionals and
      materials. The investigators aim to evaluate if it is possible to obtain the same benefits in
      HRQoL, physical activity, cardiopulmonary fitness, upper limb strength and lower limb
      functionality when the program is applied in group classes by trained fitness instructors
      with exercise strategies based in limited material. Maximum participants of each group class
      is 20. Each participant will pass through a 16 weeks control phase, during which should
      maintain the usual physical activity and, then, through a 16 weeks study phase, during which
      undergoes the physical exercise program. In each phase, the participants will be serially
      evaluated. During the 32 weeks, each participant will pass through 5 evaluation moments: at
      baseline, at 8 weeks, at 16 weeks before beginning the study phase, at 8 weeks of physical
      exercise and 16 weeks of physical exercise at the end of the program. After, investigators
      aim to evaluate each participant at 3, 6 and 12 months ant, then, yearly.
