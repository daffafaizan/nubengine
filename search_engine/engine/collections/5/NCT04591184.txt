    
      Phase I portion of the study:

      Study design:

      ENTVAX01-101 is a phase I/II, placebo-controlled, randomized, observer-blind, dose ranging
      clinical trial in males and non-pregnant females, 18 to <55 and 65 to <85 years of age, who
      are in good health and meet all eligibility criteria. This clinical trial is designed to
      assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of Covigenix VAX-001 manufactured by
      Entos Pharmaceuticals. Covigenix VAX-001 is a novel plasmid DNA-based vaccine that encodes
      for the full-length Spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 (VAX-001 encapsulated in a proprietary
      Fusogenix Proteo-Lipid Vehicle (PLV)).

      Enrollment for the phase I portion of the study will occur at one Canadian site. Seventy two
      subjects will be enrolled in a staggered manner into one of two cohorts (0.100 mg & 0.250 mg
      vs. placebo) in stage I, where Adults (18 to <55 years) will be enrolled first and Older
      Adults (65 to <85 years) will be enrolled if safety data permit. Subjects will receive an
      intramuscular (IM) injection (0.5 milliliter [mL]) on Days 0 and 14 in the deltoid muscle of
      alternating arms and will be followed through 12 months post booster vaccination (Day 379).
      Follow-up visits will occur at Days 7, 14, 17, 21, 28, 42, 196, and 379.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of a 2-dose vaccination schedule of the
      Covigenix VAX-001 vaccine, given 14 days apart. The secondary objectives are to evaluate the
      humoral immune response as measured by Immunoglobulin G (IgG) ELISA to the SARS-CoV-2 S
      protein and by pseudo-viral neutralization assay to pseudo-virion following a 2-dose
      vaccination schedule of Covigenix VAX-001.

      Clinical safety data will be collected at the Day 0 of the study and at defined intervals
      (Dose 1: Days 7, 14; Dose 2: Days: 21, 42).

      Clinical safety lab testing • Hematology & Biochemistry:

      Immunogenicity testing:

        -  ELISA and pseudo-viral neutralization tests

        -  % of responders or individuals who seroconvert (with 95% CI): develop immune response
           defined as a 4-fold or greater rise.

        -  Geometric mean concentration/geometric mean titers (with 95% CI) and
           pre-/post-vaccination ratios (geometric mean ratios) provide absolute values and
           increase in antibody titers at defined time points after each vaccination.

        -  Reverse cumulative distribution (RCD) curves display percentage of participants versus
           antibody levels.

      The following immunogenicity tests will be performed as exploratory objectives:

        -  SARS-CoV-2 neutralization antibody responses at Days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 42, 196, and 379.

        -  Antigen-specific B&T cell interferon (IFN)-γ cell responses measured by ELISPOT up to
           Day 379.

        -  Antigen-specific T cell responses measured by flow cytometry up to Day 379

        -  Antigen-specific T cell responses including cluster of differentiation (CD)4+ and CD8+
           cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), through ICS up to Day 379

        -  Whole blood immunophenotyping (B and T cell repertoire (BCR and TCR) as measured by high
           throughput sequencing of lymphocyte antigen receptor genes, SCS, and RNAseq to identify
           all genes regulated by the vaccine) up to Day 379

      Enrollment plan:

      Enrollment plan: Study participants will be enrolled in a staged manner at each age level
      (Adult and Older Adult) and dosage level (Low and Intermediate), as described below:

      First, three participants of the Adult cohort will be randomized (2:1; Groups 1 and 3) to the
      low dose of Covigenix VAX-001 or placebo, a minimum of one hour apart. Once three
      participants have received treatment there will be a 72-hour waiting period, and if no
      holding rule is met then the remaining participants from Group 1 and 3 will be vaccinated.
      Similarly, once 7-day safety data are available on a minimum of 75% (n=14) of participants in
      Groups 1/3, 1) participants of the Adult cohort will be randomized (2:1; groups 2 and 3) to
      the intermediate dose of Covigenix VAX-001 or placebo (up to 6 participants per day), and 2)
      participants of the Older Adult cohort will be randomized (2:1, groups 4 and 6) to the low
      dose of Covigenix VAX-001 or placebo (up to 6 participants per day).

      Once 7-day safety data are available on a minimum of 75% (n=14) of participants in Groups
      4/6, participants of the Older Adult cohort will be randomized (2:1; groups 5 and 6) to the
      intermediate dose of Covigenix VAX-001 or placebo.

      After review of day 42 data (Day 28 post second dose) on participants in Groups 1/3 (Adults,
      low dose) and Groups 4/6 (Older Adults, mid dose), it will be decided whether these cohorts
      will be enrolled in the Ph II of the study.

      Infection during the study: During the observation period of the study, if fever and
      respiratory symptoms with cough develop in a participant, he/she should immediately follow
      local procedures for care of suspected COVID-19 illness and contact the study team. The
      participant's nasopharyngeal and throat swab/sputum will be collected and tested for
      SARS-CoV-2 at a designated provincial testing center. If a COVID-19 infection is found during
      the study, a case investigation will be undertaken. Careful monitoring for vaccine-related
      enhanced disease will be undertaken in conjunction with the participant's primary physician.

      In addition to the real-time PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2, the collected nasopharyngeal
      swab/sputum will be tested for other respiratory pathogens.

      Participants testing positive for SARS CoV 2 between IP Dose 1 and Dose 2 will not receive
      Dose 2, but will be followed for safety.

      Study duration: 7 months

      Study Design for the phase II portion of the study:

      For the Phase II part, enrollment will occur at sites in Canada and the US. Approximately 500
      participants will be enrolled into 1 of 5 groups (approximately 100 per group) as safety data
      emerge from the Phase I portion . Participants will receive an IM injection (0.5 mL) on Days
      0 and 14 in the deltoid muscle of alternating arms and will be followed through 12 months
      post Dose 2. Follow-up visits will occur at Days 14, 28, 42, 196, and 379.

      The total duration for an individual participant in the Phase II part will be approximately
      13 months.
