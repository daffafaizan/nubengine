      surgery. Study involved 3 treatment groups: One with 30 eyes of 15 patients, corneal flaps
      were created with the microkeratome femtosecond laser 15 KHz 100μm (Intralase Corp, Irvine,
      Calif.), one with 30 eyes of 15 patients, corneal flaps were created with mechanical
      microkeratome (Hansatome 160μm (Chiron Vision Corp, Claremont, Calif) and one with 26 eyes of
      13 patients, corneal flaps were created with mechanical microkeratome K3000 130μm ( BD
      Ophthalmic Systems, Waltham, Mass) . A central scan of the total corneal thickness was taken
      with the confocal microscope (Confoscan 4, Fortune Technologies, Italy) before and at 2 weeks
      and 1 month after surgery. Corneal epithelial thickness and the Anterior stroma morphology
      were analyzed by using the NAVIS software V. 3.5.0 (NIDEK, Multi-Instrument Diagnostic
      System, Japan).
