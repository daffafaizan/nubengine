      laryngoscope. However, to date, a direct laryngoscope has been the standard equipment for
      tracheal intubation. Recently, it seems that use of the video laryngoscope has increased.
      However, the advantage of the video laryngoscope over a direct laryngoscope has not been
      measured quantitatively. In this study, the glottic view by the use of video laryngoscope
      will be compared with that of the direct laryngoscope simultaneously, by using C-MAC S-imager
      installed with a disposable Macintosh blade. Intubating anesthesiologists will use it as if
      it is a direct laryngoscope. Simultaneously, the glottic views visualized on the monitor of
      the video laryngoscope will be recorded and evaluated later. For quantitative comparison, the
      glottic view will be scored with the Percentage of glottic opening scale, for both direct
      laryngoscopy and video laryngoscopy. Also, the glottic view will be compared by
      Cormack-Lehane grade.
