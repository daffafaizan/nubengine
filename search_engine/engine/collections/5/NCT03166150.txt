      aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program with pelvic floor muscle training and will help
      to characterize changes in pelvic floor and lower extremity muscles in older women with
      urinary incontinence.

      The study focuses on a patient-centered approach to improve overall physical function in
      older women. The study will evaluate the incremental benefit of endurance and lower extremity
      muscle strengthening in addition to benefits from pelvic floor muscle training. We anticipate
      that this approach will decrease rates of urinary incontinence because the proposed
      intervention will focus on prevention of functional decline through endurance, strength, and
      balance training among older women.

      The study will evaluate the pathophysiology of urinary incontinence in older women through
      evaluation of pelvic floor and lower extremities muscles with an innovative MRI protocol.
