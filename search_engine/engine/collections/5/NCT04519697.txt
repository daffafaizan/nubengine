      allogeneic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of rectovaginal
      fistulas in the setting of Crohn's disease. The study will randomize 20 participants.
      Enrolled participants will be randomized to treatment group with MSCs versus placebo in a 3:1
      fashion. Participants in the treatment group will have a direct injection of MSCs at a dose
      of 75 million cells. This will be given as a direct injection in and around the fistula
      tract. Participants will be evaluated for complete healing at three months. If complete
      healing has been achieved patients will continue to be followed for one year. If complete
      healing has not been achieved at three months, participants will be eligible for a second
      injection of MSCs at the same dose of 75 million cells. Control participants without complete
      healing from placebo will cross over at the six month visit to receive an injection of MSCs,
      and will be followed for one year after treatment for a total duration of 18 months.
