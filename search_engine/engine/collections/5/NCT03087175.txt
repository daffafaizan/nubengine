    
      GUARDIANCORY study is a multicentre, prospective, randomized, non inferiority, open-label
      trial with a planned inclusion of 52 patients with STE and NSTE ACS and prescribed PCI.
      Patients will be randomized to benefiting either DES /BMS implantation (n=26) or MGuard stent
      (n=26) on the culprit lesion. Assessment of coronary microcirculation will be done by IMR
      immediately after PCI by using a pressure-temperature sensor-tipped coronary wire,
      thermodilution-derived.
