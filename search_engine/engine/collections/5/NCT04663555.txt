      number of patients develop hyperinflammatory state affecting lungs, which may lead to the
      need of oxygen therapy. In most severe cases, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
      develops and high flow oxygen therapy or invasive mechanical ventilation is necessary (Wu et
      al., 2020). Therapeutic options in Covid-19 associated ARDS patients remain limited and
      mortality is still excessive. Systemic corticosteroids have potential to limit
      hyperinflammatory response by modulating immune system. This effect is mediated mainly by
      binding to glucocorticosteroid receptor α (GRα)(Meduri et al., 2020). Their effectiveness was
      proved in heterogeneous ARDS patients recently (Villar et al., 2020). In patients with
      Covid-19 pneumonia in need for oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation, dexamethasone 6 mg
      per day is currently recommended. This therapy is mandated by the results of RECOVERY trial
      (Horby et al., 2020). After this trial was published, three randomised trials comparing
      hydrocortisone (Angus et al., 2020; Dequin et al., 2020) or dexamethasone (Tomazini et al.,
      2020) against placebo were stopped prematurely. All these studies were included in the
      subsequent IPD metaanalysis (Sterne et al., 2020). However, dose of 6 mg of dexamethasone is
      currently being reappraised. The aforementioned study in non Covid-19 ARDS patients (Villar
      et al., 2020) used 20 mg of dexamethasone per day, which is roughly equivalent to the
      methylprednisolone regimen (1mg/kg/day) studied in early severe ARDS patients (Meduri et al.,
      2007). Only these moderate doses (80-100 mg of methylprednisolone, equivalent to 15-19 mg of
      dexamethasone) have full potential to modulate immune response by saturating GRα receptors
      (Meduri et al., 2020). Importantly, prematurely stopped CoDEX trial (Tomazini et al., 2020)
      comparing dexamethasone against placebo in Covid-ARDS patients, used initial daily dose of 20
      mg of dexamethasone versus placebo.

      In the light of these facts, 6 mg of dexamethasone given to COVID-19 patients with different
      severity of illness (WHO classification group 5-10) may miss important therapeutic potential
      or may prevent a potential deleterious effects of a full dose therapeutic corticosteroid.
      Authors hypothesize that the patients with moderate to severe ARDS undergoing mechanical
      ventilation may benefit from higher doses of dexamethasone (Villar et al., 2020; Tomazini et
      al., 2020; Meduri et al., 2007).

      The primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that administration of
      dexamethasone 20 mg is superior over 6 mg in adult patients with moderate or severe ARDS due
      to confirmed COVID-19.

      Primary endpoint: Number of ventilator-free days (VFDs) at 28 days after randomisation,
      defined as being alive and free from mechanical ventilation (more than 48 hours).

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. Mortality from any cause at 60 days after randomization;

        2. Dynamics of inflammatory marker (CRP) change from Day 1 to Day 14;

        3. WHO Clinical Progression Scale at Day 14 (range 0-10; 0 = no illness, 1-9 = increasing
           level of care, and 10 = death);

        4. Adverse events related to corticosteroids (new infections, new thrombotic complications)
           until Day 28 or hospital discharge;

        5. Independence at 90 days after randomization assessed by Barthel Index The long-term
           outcomes of this study are to assess long-term consequences on mortality and quality of
           life at 180 and 360 days through telephone structured interview using Barthel Index.
