      especially during pregnancy. During the last decade there was no monitoring of the iodine
      status in pregnancy in Hungary.

      Since urinary iodine concentration (UIC) only reflects recent iodine intake and carries
      limited information on individual existing iodine stores, another biomarker e.g. measurement
      of serum thyroglobulin concentration, would be useful to gain comprehensive information. In
      the present study, the purpose of the investigation is to compare UIC, UIC normalized to
      creatinine concentration and serum thyroglobulin as biomarkers of iodine supply in pregnant
      women in a geographical region where previously iodine deficiency had been found.

      UIC, serum thyroglobulin level and thyroid function are measured, and information about
      iodine supplementation and smoking before and during pregnancy are recorded.
