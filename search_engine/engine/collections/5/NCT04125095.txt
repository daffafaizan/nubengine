      image guidance, post-correction CBCT, weekly post-treatment CBCT, and 2D orthogonal
      radiographs. Setup uncertainty will be estimated for head and body cohorts separately,
      further divided into different anatomic sites. The usefulness and necessity of daily
      volumetric image guidance for pediatric proton therapy patients will be determined. Knowledge
      gained from this study will provide a basis for reducing patient positioning uncertainty and
      designing optimal treatment plans for pediatric patients receiving proton therapy.
