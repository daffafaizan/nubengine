      multiple doses of chronic SPL therapy compared with placebo in maintenance hemodialysis
      patients and to assess the feasibility of conducting a full-scale, mortality-powered trial of
      SPL. The effects of SPL compared with placebo on multiple cardiovascular efficacy parameters
      will also be analyzed. The primary efficacy parameter will be the change in the E'
      measurement on tissue Doppler echocardiography (TDI) as an index of diastolic function and a
      surrogate for myocardial fibrosis. Secondary cardiac parameters of interest that will be
      studied in the overall population or in sub-studies include heart rate variability,
      circulating markers of fibrosis, and coronary flow reserve (CFR) as an index of microvascular
      function. These parameters are designed to broaden insight into the potential effects of SPL
      on cardiac structure and function in individuals with dialysis-dependent ESRD and to assess
      the feasibility of conducting a full-scale, mortality-powered trial.
