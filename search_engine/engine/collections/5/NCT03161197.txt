      Institute Dialysis Center to take part of a mindfulness-based stress reduction intervention.
      The intervention consists of meet with a researcher and/or research assistant on a weekly
      basis. Dialysis patients will receive the intervention individually while on dialysis.
      Dialysis is an optimal time for conducting interventions as patients are there for 3-4 hours
      every 3 days. For 8-10 weeks (which will begin the week after the baseline interview).
      Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) patients will receive the intervention in group setting. Key
      components of what the intervention consists relate to stress management, breathing, and
      meditation exercises, as well as, techniques aimed at improving relations with others, sense
      of mastery and purpose in life. Additionally, during every point of contact, will be asked
      how often they utilized the strategies they were taught. This information will be helpful in
      understanding each person's individual level of mastery and proficiency in Mindfulness-Based
      Stress Reduction (MBSR). All subjects will complete a baseline interview, one follow-up at 3
      months and the close out interview at 5 months.
