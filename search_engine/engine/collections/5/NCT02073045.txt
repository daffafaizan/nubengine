      I. To assess the patient's increased knowledge of lymphedema signs/symptoms after education.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The participant may detect lymphedema signs/symptoms at an early stage by having a
      pre-surgery comparison of bilateral upper extremities (BUE) circumferential measures to the 3
      month post-surgery measures.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete a five question survey, designed by the Occupational Therapy staff, as
      an instrument to assess a patient's knowledge of lymphedema signs/symptoms before surgery. An
      Occupational Therapist (OT), Physical Therapist (PT), and/or Certified Lymphedema Therapist
      (CLT) provide written handouts to participants on the pathophysiology, signs, symptoms, and
      treatment of lymphedema. Participants repeat the survey at 3 months post-surgery. BUE
      circumferential measurements are also collected before surgery and at 3 months post-surgery.
