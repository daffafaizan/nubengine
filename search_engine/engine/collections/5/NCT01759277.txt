      endpoint data) having tri-compartment knee arthroplasty. In addition, the investigators will
      enroll up to 70 subjects having uni-compartment knee arthroplasty as a pilot study in
      preparation for a subsequent larger, definitive trial. These two groups will not be analyzed
      together--they represent two distinct studies: one a definitive RCT for tri-compartment knee
      arthroplasty; and, one a pilot study for uni-compartment knee arthroplasty.
