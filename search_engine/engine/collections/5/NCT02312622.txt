    
      Primary Objective:

      For cohort A and Cohort C, to determine the central nervous system (CNS) disease control rate
      (number of patients with stable disease or partial response or complete response / total
      number of treated patients) at 12 weeks following treatment with etirinotecan pegol in
      patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or with metastatic brain cancer
      (mBC) with refractory brain metastases

      Secondary Objectives:

      Cohorts A and C:

        -  To measure the overall disease control rate and response rate for patients receiving
           study therapy

        -  To measure the systemic (non-CNS) disease control rate and response rate for patients
           receiving study therapy

        -  To observe the progression free survival of the study population

        -  To observe the overall survival of the study population

      Cohort B:

      • To observe CNS and systemic disease control in small cell lung cancer (SCLC)

      Cohorts A, B and C:

      • To determine the safety profile of etirinotecan pegol
