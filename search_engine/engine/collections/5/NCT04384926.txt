    
      The rapid emergence of the COVID-19 virus has led to a global impact on elective surgical
      care.

      We have very little evidence to guide us. The magnitude and effects of these changes are
      uncertain. The safety of operating on patients electively with the risks of COVID-19
      postoperative pneumonia is unknown.

      High-quality data will allow policy planning at regional and hospital level for both this
      outbreak and future pandemics. CovidSurg-Cancer will run in parallel to CovidSurg (which is
      capturing outcomes of patients undergoing surgery for all indications with concurrent
      COVID-19).

      The primary aim is to evaluate the 30-day COVID-19 infection rates in elective cancer surgery
      during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      Secondary aims include; comparison of the 30-day postoperative mortality rate in cancer
      surgery patients that develop COVID-19 infection versus those who do not; an exploration of
      the scale of resource constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic, and their impact on
      outcomes of elective cancer surgery; to explore variation in the selection of patients for
      continuing elective cancer surgery during the COVID-19 pandemic; to evaluate the impact of
      the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment pathways for cancers with a decision for surgical
      resection with curative intent.

      This investigator-led, non-commercial, non-interventional study is extremely low to zero
      risk. This study does not collect any patient identifiable information and data will not be
      analysed at hospital-level.
