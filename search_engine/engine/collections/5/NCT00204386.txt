      of prevalence and morbidity, at least in the United States and probably world-wide. The
      magnitude of the public health impact of PTSD is highlighted by recent epidemiologic
      findings. Kessler, et al, estimated a 7.8% lifetime prevalence for PTSD in a representative
      national sample of 5877 persons aged 15-54. In part, this high prevalence is due to the high
      occurrence of trauma exposure over a lifetime. Common types of Civilian PTSD include serious
      physical attack or assault, rape, sexual assault, transportation accidents, exposure to
      death/homicide or serious injury, life-threatening accidents, threats of injury with fire,
      floods, weapons, natural disasters and civilian exposure to military attacks. Persons with
      PTSD are usually unaware that they have this disorder and because treatment professionals
      have been inadequately sensitized to high prevalence of this condition, the condition is
      markedly undiagnosed and thereby undertreated. The risk of PTSD is not restricted to the
      psychiatric population. In general, persons with PTSD seek help in general medical and not
      mental health settings. Individuals with PTSD are at increased risk of co-morbid psychiatric
      disorders including depression, alcohol and drug abuse, panic disorder, agoraphobia and
      personality disorders. It is associated with a substantially higher suicide risk,
      hospitalization rates, and increased utilization rates of non-psychiatric medical services as
      well as mental health services.
