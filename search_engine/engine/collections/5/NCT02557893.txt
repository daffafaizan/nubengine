      randomly assigned (in blocks of 3) to 12-weeks of wait list, bi-monthly pregnancy education
      classes or twice weekly low-to-moderate intensity resistance training. Resistance training
      involved one abdominal exercise with no external load and five exercises with an external
      load that gradually progressed (leg extension, leg press, arm lat pull, leg curl, and lumbar
      extension). Several outcomes were assessed including physical function, quality of life and
      mood.
