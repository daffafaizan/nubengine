    
      Atrial fibrillation(AF) patients who had undergone PCI with DES implantation at 12-18 months
      ago will be enrolled in this study. Decision for the antiplatelet agent discontinuation would
      be determined by randomization. Apixaban would be prescribed to reduced the risk stroke or
      systemic embolism evoked by AF, and the administration of Warfarin, a vitamin-K dependent
      anticoagulant, would also be allowed according to attending physician's decision. The
      following criteria should be followed for the reduction of dosages according to the patient's
      renal function and other systemic conditions. Warfarin is administered to patients with
      creatinine clearance of 15 ml / min or dialysis. The drugs used in this study correspond to
      the international treatment guidelines after coronary intervention in patients with atrial
      fibrillation.NOAC and antiplatelet agents would be prescribed upon an outpatient visit.
      Clinical outcome would be followed for 2 years after study enrollment and randomization.
