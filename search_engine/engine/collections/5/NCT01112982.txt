      chronic inflammatory arthritis. This tells us that at some point the inflammation associated
      with gout does not abate. Our group recently completed an advanced imaging study in patients
      with early gout that suggested nearly 60% of subjects had synovial pannus during
      intercritical gout. This is likely more prevalent in patients with more advanced gout. The
      presence of synovial pannus also likely correlates with serum urate levels. The primary aim
      of this study will be to determine the percentage of patients with known gout who have
      evidence of chronic ongoing synovial-based inflammatory disease, determine the degree of this
      inflammation, and correlate it with their serum urate levels. Secondary endpoints will
      include assessments for the presence of other characteristic findings of gout on these MRI
      (i.e. erosive changes, intraosseous tophi, soft tissue tophi, joint effusion, bone marrow
      edema, and soft tissue edema). We will also be checking serum high-sensitivity CRP levels to
      evaluate for any correlation with synovial pannus, and assess baseline radiographs of the
      "index" joint for the presence of erosive changes, which will be correlated with the presence
      and severity of synovial pannus in that same joint. Analysis will also be performed to see if
      there is a correlation with serum urate levels. A sub-study will be performed assessing the
      effect of aggressive serum urate lowering therapy (specifically with febuxostat [Uloric]) on
      this chronic inflammation; i.e. synovial pannus.
