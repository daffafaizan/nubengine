    
      This study is designed as a multicentre, exploratory phase IIa, open label, single
      intravenous (IV) dose, escalating treatment regimen (Treatment regimen = a single dose of
      WST11 associated with a particular laser light energy) with a one month follow-up.

      Six escalating treatment regimens will be followed: 3 WST11 doses (5 mg/kg; 7.5 mg/kg and 10
      mg/kg) combined with 2 light energies (200 Joules/cm and 300 Joules/cm)

      The patient will be treated under local anesthesia. The light is produced using a specific
      laser at a wavelength of 753 nm at a fixed power of 250 mW/cm and locally delivered to the
      obstructing tumor through an optical fiber placed, during endoscopy, in the endoscope
      operating channel with visual control, possibly video-transmission assisted. The fiber
      illuminating diffusion length is fixed (2 cm).
