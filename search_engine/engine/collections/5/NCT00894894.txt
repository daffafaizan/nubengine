    
      Multicenter, open-label, dose-ranging study in two parts: MTD Segment (the first 28-day
      course of MP 470) followed by Long-Term Safety Segment

      MTD Segment: follows standard oncology phase-I design; within-patient dose level adjustments
      prohibited; each patient participates in one of three stages:

      Accelerated Titration Stage: 1 patient per dose level; first patient receives MP 470 at 100
      mg/day; subsequent patients assigned higher dose levels based on modified Fibonacci sequence;
      stage stops when any first-course DLT is observed or when grade-2 or greater MP 470-related
      toxicity is observed at 2 dose levels; dosing next patient prohibited until previous
      patient's MTD-Segment result is confirmed Dose Escalation/De-Escalation Stage: 3 patients per
      cohort; two additional patients enrolled to receive last dose level studied during
      Accelerated Titration Stage (first 3-patient cohort); subsequent 3-patient cohorts assigned
      dose level conditional on number of patients with first-course DLT in previous cohort; new
      cohorts enrolled until MTD is defined; dosing next cohort prohibited until previous cohort's
      MTD-Segment results are confirmed Dose Confirmation Stage: an additional 6-10 patients
      enrolled to receive MP 470 at the established MTD; patient accrual stops following Dose
      Confirmation Long-Term Safety Segment: patients continue receiving 28-day courses of MP 470
      until experiencing unmanageable toxicity or disease progression; within-patient dose level
      adjustments based on toxicity; DLT during preceding 28-day course mandates one-level dose
      reduction; one-level dose increase possible in absence of grade-3 or greater MP 470-related
      AEs during preceding 28-day course
