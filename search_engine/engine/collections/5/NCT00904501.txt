      included. A bone marrow harvest (500 mL under general anaesthesia) is performed and BM-MNC
      are separated and concentrated (30 mL) for all included patients. For half of them, the
      BM-MNC are implanted on the same day whereas the others are implanted with a placebo
      cell-product (30 mL saline with 4 ml peripheral blood). For these patients the BM-MNC are
      cryo-conserved. Only the cell therapy unit, neither the patient, nor the clinician, know
      whether BM-MNC or placebo is implanted. The main end point is the survival without major
      amputation 6 months after implantation. After this delay it is possible to use previously
      cryo-conserved BM-MNC. Likewise biological studies are performed on BM-MNC: flow-cytometry
      analysis of progenitor cells content, proteins and mRNAs expression, induced angiogenesis in
      animal models.
