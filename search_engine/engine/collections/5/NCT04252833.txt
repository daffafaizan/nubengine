    
      The food effect study will be an open-label, 2-sequence, balanced crossover design in 12
      subjects previously untreated with CT-044.

      Eligible subjects will be admitted to the Clinical Trial Unit on the day prior to dosing and
      remain in house until Day 3. Each subject will receive CT-044 single oral dose once under fed
      conditions (i.e., a high fat meal per FDA recommendations) and once in the fasted state.

      9 Subjects will return to the Clinical Trial Unit on an outpatient basis for follow-up.
      Subjects will return to the Clinical Trial Unit to be treated by the second sequence after a
      washout period of at least 7 days, but no more than 14 days. All procedures will be repeated
      for the second treatment sequence. When possible, the procedures conducted at the 144-hour
      follow-up visit for the first sequence may serve as baseline for the second sequence of the
      crossover.
