      find it difficult to take their anti-rejection medicines as intended. It is hoped that if the
      investigators can improve their understanding of why some patients struggle with their
      anti-rejection medicines, the investigators will be able to find better ways to help our
      transplant patients and so fewer patients may develop problems with their transplant. This
      study will collect qualitative data from a series of focus groups with kidney transplant
      recipients to explore their beliefs, understanding and experience of anti-rejection
      medication adherence. The focus groups will also explore the support that participants have
      received to help them with their medication adherence and what support they feel should be
      available to them and to others in the future to optimise anti-rejection medication adherence
      in transplant patients. Five focus groups will be undertaken. Each focus group will include
      six patients and will last for approximately 1.5 hours. All participants will be kidney
      transplant recipients transplanted and followed up at Imperial College Renal and Transplant
      Centre.
