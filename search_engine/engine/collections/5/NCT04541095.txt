      and this has been linked to reduced neurodevelopment scores.

      Several enriched infant milk formulas are available for preterm infants who cannot be fed
      human milk. The use of infant milk formulas (IMF) enriched with triglycerides similar to
      human milk lipids have shown to be associated with better fatty acid and mineral intestinal
      absorption.

      In this multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial, preterm infants (gestational age
      lower than 32 weeks), who can not be fed human milk, will be randomized to receive IMF with
      high or low amounts of beta-palmitate (about 60% vs 10%, respectively). A non-randomized own
      human milk-fed group will be included as a reference. Patients will be on the study diet as
      soon as possible after birth and till 36 weeks of gestation. Neurodevelopment follow-up will
      be performed at 24 months corrected age.
