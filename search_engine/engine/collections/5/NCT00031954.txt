        -  Determine the tolerability and toxicity of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and gemcitabine in
           patients with previously untreated stage IC-IV ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, or
           peritoneal carcinoma.

        -  Determine the response rate of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and
      gemcitabine IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at 3 and 6 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study.
