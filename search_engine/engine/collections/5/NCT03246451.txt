    
      Aim: To evaluate the contribution of metformin-induced GLP-1 secretion on the
      glucose-lowering effect of metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with metformin
      for 14 days. Furthermore, the investigators aim to elucidate the mechanisms by which
      metformin-induced GLP-1 secretion may affect glucose levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      Fifteen patients with type 2 diabetes treated with lifestyle intervention and/or metformin as
      the only glucose-lowering drug will be enrolled in the study. The effect of a 14-day
      metformin treatment course on postprandial glucose tolerance will be examined with and
      without infusion of the GLP-1 receptor antagonist exendin9-39 in 15 patients with type 2
      diabetes.

      The double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomised, cross-over study consists of four study
      days with concomitant infusions of A) placebo + placebo, B) placebo + exendin9-39, C)
      metformin + placebo and D) metformin + exendin9-39.
