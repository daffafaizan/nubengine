      greater proportion of advanced colonic neoplasia or cancer would be missed if colonoscopy was
      not performed for older patients. So if we develop a mixed strategy to offer sigmoidoscopy
      for younger patients and reserve colonoscopy for older patients, we might be able to detect
      more APN with fewer colonoscopic procedures. We aimed to determine an optimal cut-off age and
      choose an appropriate distal sentinel lesion for subsequent colonoscopy.
