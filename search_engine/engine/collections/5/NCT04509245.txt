    
      24 patients with type 2 diabetes from the German Diabetes Study (GDS) with less than 4 years
      disease duration and not receiving insulin were included in this study. Before the start of
      the intervention, participants documented their dietary intake by recording a food diary.
      During the 12-week intervention participants were asked to adhere to a real food-based
      low-calorie diet supported by an app-guided digital education program as well as a
      low-calorie recipe book and received weekly coaching calls by nutritionists. Patients were
      instructed to adhere to a balanced low calorie diet during the intervention. Nutritionists
      provided structured behavior change focusing on dietary advice, adherence to logging dietary
      intake and tracking weight. At first visit, patients installed the Changing Health App
      (Changing Health, Newcastle, UK) and completed an app-based digital education program. This
      program focused on type 2 diabetes education and behavioral change in combination with weight
      tracking and dietary monitoring. Patients used the app throughout the study and adherence was
      monitored via logins. Comprehensive testing before and after the intervention comprised a
      mixed-meal tolerance test and liver fat.
