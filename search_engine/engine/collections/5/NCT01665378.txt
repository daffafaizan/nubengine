      considerable efforts to address them. Intervening with just prenatal iron-folate (IFA)
      supplements may not be the best approach given the substantial demands for iron by maternal
      and fetal tissues. Therefore, there is an urgent need to evaluate the additional contribution
      of prepregnancy interventions.

      The study evaluates the efficacy of providing weekly iron-folate (IFA) supplements or
      Multiple Micronutrient (MM) supplements before pregnancy in increasing birth weight and
      duration of gestation as well as maternal and infant iron status.
