      rates are major public health problems. Hispanics need more kidney transplants, yet receive
      fewer living donor kidney transplants than they need. Factors known to contribute to
      Hispanics' low rates of living donation kidney transplantation include cultural beliefs, lack
      of knowledge, and negative attitudes about living kidney donation. Web-based interventions
      are promising as Hispanics are using the Internet at increasingly greater rates. However, few
      websites about transplantation are tailored to potential Hispanic kidney transplant
      candidates or the Hispanic community. This study aims to develop, test, and evaluate the
      effectiveness of a bilingual web-based educational resource targeted to Hispanic patients and
      the public, which can serve as a low-cost, convenient, and culturally competent tool to
      enhance knowledge about living kidney donation. Improving Hispanics' understanding about
      living kidney donation will promote their autonomy and self-determination by helping to
      ensure that Hispanic patients and public are fully informed of the treatment options for
      end-stage kidney disease.
