      (1). Macrophages are pivotal members of the inflammatory cells and the innate immune system
      within the tumor stroma. Tumor-associated macrophages can release growth factors, cytokines
      and inflammatory mediators that may facilitate cancer cell invasion, migration, angiogenesis,
      tumor progression or metastasis (1-5). A lot of studies showed TAM encounter factors that
      most frequently polarize them toward M2 type macrophage (1,4-5). It is interesting that in
      vitro studies macrophages have the potential to kill tumor by appropriate stimulation but
      these macrophage belonged to M1 and were not present in most tumor tissue (6). Some drugs
      target to suppress TAM have the promising results in animal models (7-9). Switching the TAM
      phenotype from M2 to M1 may promote anti-tumor activity (10). In this study we will correlate
      TAM M1/M2 ratio and patients' prognosis, the gene expression pattern of TAM.
