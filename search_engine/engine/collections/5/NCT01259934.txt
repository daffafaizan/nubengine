    
      This is an open multicenter, prospective randomised phase III trial evaluating the efficacy
      of two different schedules of Interferon-alpha2b (IFN-alpha2b) administered in an adjuvant
      setting after adequate surgery in high risk cutaneous melanoma patients (T4N0M0/TxN1-2M0).
      The patients have been operated for either a thick primary melanoma (> 4 mm) without evidence
      of distant metastasis or have undergone surgery for regional lymph node metastases.

      The study consists of a control arm (A) and two treatment arms, B and C. The outcome in arms
      B and C with adjuvant treatment with IFN-alpha2b will be compared to the outcome of arm A in
      which the patients will only be observed after the surgery. The primary endpoint is overall
      survival. Secondary endpoints are relapse-free survival, safety-toxicity and health-related
      quality of life.
