      brings together a team from UCL Division of Medicine, Computer Science and University College
      London Hospital. The aim is to develop Magnetic Resonance (MR) sequences and mathematical
      algorithms to reduce the distortions in MR images, especially of the prostate. Current NICE
      guidelines include a type of MR imaging called Diffusion Weighted MRI for the detection of
      tumour within the prostate, and for active surveillance of low risk confirmed disease.
      However, approximately 40% of prostate diffusion images suffer from severe localised
      distortions and this is most marked in the peripheral zone of the prostate where 75% of
      prostate cancers occur. The source of these distortions is magnetic field imperfections due
      to the presence of rectal gas or metallic hip implants.

      The research study will ask both healthy volunteers and patients to undergo research MR scans
      and use the acquired data for analysis. For patients, the scans may be either additional
      sequences acquired during an extended clinical session, or a separate additional session
      entirely for research.

      The output from the research will be modified ways to run an MR scanner and compute the final
      images.

      The work should lead to improved diagnostic accuracy and a reduced number of non-diagnostic
      studies. It will have broader impact through application to diffusion imaging of other body
      sites, including whole-body diffusion MRI and non-cancer applications. If successful, the
      results would provide evidence for a larger trial with the eventual outcome being
      manufacturers incorporating modified MR sequences and data processing into clinical systems
      worldwide.
