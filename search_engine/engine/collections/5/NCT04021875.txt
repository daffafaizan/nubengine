      These cells are regenerated from cells known as limbal stem cells (LSCs) that grow
      continuously and proliferate from the limbus. Failure or damage at the limbal zone can occur
      from hereditary or acquired causes such as ocular burns, trauma, or diseases such as Stevens-
      Johnson syndrome, leading to limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). The treatment of LSCD
      includes transplantation of healthy limbal tissue or cultured limbal epithelial cells. In the
      last two decades, cultivated limbal epithelial transplantation (CLET) has been a widely used
      technique. In 2012, Sangwan and coworkers proposed a novel technique that they named simple
      limbal epithelial transplantation (SLET) for the treatment of unilateral LSCD1. SLET could
      have benefits for those centers that do not have the ability to perform cultivated limbal
      epithelial transplantation (CLET) preparation and could be especially useful for those
      countries that cannot afford a GMP center. Therefore, SLET is quickly gaining popularity in
      countries like India. As it is a relatively new technique, its long-term clinical
      effectiveness (similar to what is observed in CLET) must be noted before determining its
      actual benefits.Our study aims to prospectively evaluate the therapeutic effects of
      autologous simple limbal epithelial transplantation for patients with limbal stem cell
      deficiency. The change of visual acuity, quality of life and so on will be monitored before
      and after surgery. In this study, the effects of autologous simple limbal epithelial
      transplantation will be investigated.
