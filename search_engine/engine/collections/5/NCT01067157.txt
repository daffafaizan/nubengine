    
      In Germany, as in other countries, overweight and obesity affects a growing number of
      children and adolescents. Obesity-related diseases such as arterial hypertension, disorders
      of glucose and lipid metabolism and an increase in inflammation markers are associated with
      higher morbidity and mortality in early life, therefore effective therapy concepts are
      needed.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of a 4-6 week inpatient obesity lifestyle
      therapy program over 10 years and the genetic influence on the short-, middle- and longterm
      outcome.

      The lifestyle intervention consists of physical exercise, nutrition education and behaviour
      therapy based on the criterions developed by the German Obesity Group (degree of weight
      reduction, improvement of comorbidity and health behaviour, minimising of side effects).
