      clinical trial in patients with known rotator cuff tears. Pragmatic or effectiveness clinical
      trials reflect real world settings and thus have greater external generalizability than
      efficacy trials. The evaluation component in this trial will be three-fold: first, the study
      team will compare the success of patients undergoing operative versus non-operative
      management and identify which variables predict success in each group; second, investigators
      will attempt to predict which patients end up choosing, along with their care giver(s),
      operative versus non-operative management by examining the predictive capability of a
      selection of variables; third, investigators will evaluate the clinical research site(s),
      personnel, and implementation processes for their capability to implement clinical trials
      with the intent of planning for a future large multi-site clinical trial building on the
      results of the present study.
