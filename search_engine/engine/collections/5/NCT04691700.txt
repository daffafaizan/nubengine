      improve HF symptoms regardless of left ventricular ejection fraction. Loop diuretics,
      however, are known to activate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and the sympathetic
      nervous system, which could accelerate HF progression. Loop diuretics could also cause
      worsening renal function and electrolyte disturbance, and it is desirable to have an
      alternative drug to loop diuretics to effectively relieve congestive symptoms. Goreisan
      (TJ-17), a traditional Japanese medicine composed of five herbal medicines, has long been
      used in Japan to treat impairments of the regulation of body fluid homeostasis, including
      edema, and has been less likely to cause renal dysfunction and electrolyte abnormalities. We
      therefore planned a multicenter, randomized, interventional, parallel assignment, open-label
      treatment trial to evaluate the long-term effect of in-hospital initiation of Goreisan, when
      added to standard therapy, in patients with worsening congestive heart failure and clear
      signs of volume overload.
