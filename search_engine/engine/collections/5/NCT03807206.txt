      results in a good neurologic discharge in 9.1% - 30.0% of patients. Therefore it is
      recommended to engage in advanced care planning with patients, to discuss do-not-resuscitate
      (DNR) directives. In current knowledge, there are no published data about the prevalence of
      these DNR orders and associated factors in hospitalized patients in the Netherlands. Also,
      the conversation about DNR are sometimes perceived as awkward or untimely by patients.

      Objective: The primary goal is to estimate prevalence DNR order in Dutch hospitals. A
      secondary goal is to assess what geographical, patient and disease factors are associated
      with DNR status. Furthermore patient experience in the conversation leading to DNR-orders is
      of interest.

      Study design: A cross-sectional point prevalence study, in 10 participating hospitals of the
      ROUTiNE project.

      Study population: Patients who plan to be admitted for more than 24 hours to the
      participating hospitals, aged 18 or older, who are responsive and conscious.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The prevalence of DNR orders, expressed as number per 1000
      beds.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: There is no risk. Only one ten-minute interview per participant. Therefore the
      benefit of this study (as described in the objectives) outweigh the potential risks.
