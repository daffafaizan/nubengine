      pulmonary complication after esophagectomy. However, the postoperative complications relative
      to gastric conduit reconstruction are still common issues after esophagectomy. The ischemia
      of the proximal portion of the graft predisposes these patients to a high incidence of
      anastomotic complications after esophagectomy. Less commonly, severe graft ischemia can lead
      to transmural necrosis. Thus, early diagnosis of ischemic reaction may provide the suitable
      postoperative management and therapeutic intervention to prevent leakage, strictures and
      necrosis. Thus, the purpose of this study is the safety and efficacy of endoscopic evaluation
      about reconstructive organs after esophagectomy. The investigators evaluate endoscopic
      predictions using classifications in acute phase after esophagogastrostomy.
