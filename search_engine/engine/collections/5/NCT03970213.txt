      tranexamic acid has any effect on rhytidectomy surgery, or the subsequent postoperative
      sequelae. Intraoperative bleeding is rated on a scale of mild, moderate, or severe and given
      a score of 1-3. Postoperative ecchymosis and edema are subjectively rated by both patient and
      surgeon on postoperative days 1, 6, and 9 using a similar mild/moderate/severe scale and
      scored 1-3, respectively. Any surgical or postoperative complications are noted. Scores are
      aggregated for statistical analysis.
