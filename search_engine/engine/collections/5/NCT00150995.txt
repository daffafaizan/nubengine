      bloodstream. Copper is a key factor in angiogenesis (blood vessel growth)- a process that
      occurs normally in the body but becomes uncontrolled in cancerous cells. Tetrathiomolybdate
      essentially wages war against copper, which serves to choke off tumor growth. Realizing the
      key role of copper in angiogenesis, researchers have begun exploring treatment with
      Tetrathiomolybdate for different types of cancers. This clinical trial will evaluate the
      effectiveness of Tetrathiomolybdate in the treatment of patients with hormone refractory
      prostate cancer. Hormone refractory prostate cancer refers to advanced disease in which the
      patient no longer responding to conventional hormonal treatment.
