      adults who suffer from six or more migraine days per month. The study will enroll 690
      patients across approximately 60 sites in the United States, Canada and Australia. Study
      subjects will be divided evenly across a low dose group receiving 150 units of ABP-450, a
      high dose group receiving 195 units of ABP-450, and a placebo group. All patients will
      receive two treatment cycles utilizing the Company's novel treatment paradigm involving fewer
      injections than the current botulinum toxin treatment option for chronic migraine.
