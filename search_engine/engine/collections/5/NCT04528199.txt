      (FC303) is safe and well-tolerated in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

      Participants in this study will have tests, exams and procedures that are for study purposes.
      Participants will be in this study up to one month which will include up to three clinic
      visits.

      Eligible patients diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer will undergo a [18F]FLOR (FC303)
      PET-CT scan. This is the imaging procedure to assess where [18F]FLOR (FC303) has accumulated
      in the body.
