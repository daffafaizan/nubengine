      ASLAN001 in combination with fixed dose of Oxaliplatin/Capecitabine (CAPOX) or
      5-FU/leucovorin (mFolfox6).

      MTD of ASLAN001 in combination with CAPOX will first be determined followed by the
      combination with mFolfox6.

      The recommended Phase II dose will be the highest dose of the combination therapy that is
      considered to be tolerated in 6 patients.
