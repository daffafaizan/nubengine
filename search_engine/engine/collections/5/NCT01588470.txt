    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES

        1. To quantitate myocardial insulin sensitivity using positron emission tomography (PET)
           with 18F-deoxyglucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and control subjects.

        2. To quantitate pericardial fat using magnetic resonance spectroscopy in T2DM and control
           subjects.

        3. To quantitate cardiac function using magnetic resonance imaging and echocardiography in
           T2DM and control subjects.

        4. To examine the effect of pioglitazone on myocardial insulin sensitivity, pericardial fat
           content, and cardiac function.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES To examine the relationships between myocardial insulin sensitivity,
      pericardial fat content, and cardiac function.
