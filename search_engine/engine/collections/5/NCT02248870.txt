      pain.

      Femoral nerve block as a means of preoperative analgesia for these patients has proven
      effective in multiple trials for the majority of the patients. Still some issues remains to
      be investigated in order to optimize the preoperative analgesia for this group.

      One of the issues that reduces the feasibility of the femoral nerve block is the relatively
      shorter analgesic duration of the nerve block compared to the often longer time from the
      hospital admission to the actual operation. From the literature and our own experience the
      mean analgesic duration of a femoral nerve block approximates 15 hours.

      Many studies have shown a prolonged analgesic duration of different nerve blocks when
      Dexamethasone was added to the local anesthetics. Some studies show a 100 percent increase in
      duration.

      To our knowledge no studies have been published regarding prolongation of the analgesic
      effect of the femoral nerve block with Dexamethasone, and also none regarding the group of
      patients with hip fracture.

      The clinical impact of a femoral nerve block with an analgesic duration of 20 hours compared
      to the present 15 hours would be less patients waking up in wards during the night time with
      pain and a terminated femoral nerve block.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate if more patients with hip fracture experience a
      lasting preoperative analgesic duration of at least 20 hours or until the time of operation
      after a femoral nerve block with Bupivacaine with adrenaline and the addition of
      Dexamethasone compared to the same nerve block done with only Bupivacaine with adrenaline.
