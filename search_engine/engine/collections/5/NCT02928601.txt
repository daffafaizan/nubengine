      cardiovascular collapse. If doesn't treated precipitously, It can cause maternal hypotension,
      nausea and vomiting and fetal acidosis. Recently norepinephrine has been proposed for the
      prevention and treatment of spinal hypotension with less tendency to decrease HR and CO. It
      has been reported that ondansetron can be used for prophylaxis and treatment of nausea and
      vomiting, may also reduce the vasopressor requirement in patients undergoing caesarean
      section with spinal anesthesia. The aim of the present study is to assess the effect of
      prophylactic ondansetron on norepinephrine consumption and incidence of spinal hypotension,
      and side effects such as maternal nausea, vomiting and bradycardia.
