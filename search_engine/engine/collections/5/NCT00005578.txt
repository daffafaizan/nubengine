      prednisone and cyclophosphamide (DBVE-PC) with filgrastim (G-CSF) followed by consolidative
      radiotherapy in children with advanced stage Hodgkin's disease. II. Tailor therapy based on
      rapidity of response in order to minimize cumulative drug dosages. III. Compare the efficacy
      of dexrazoxane in reducing pulmonary and cardiac toxicity of DBVE-based therapy without
      compromising response.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.
      All patients receive 3 courses of chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin and etoposide on
      days 0 and 1, bleomycin and vincristine on days 0 and 7, cyclophosphamide on day 0, and
      prednisone on days 0-6. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered on days 5-6 and 8-19. Each course
      is 21 days in length. Patients assigned to arm I receive only these drugs. Patients assigned
      to arm II receive dexrazoxane on days 0, 1, and 7 in addition to therapy as in arm I.
      Patients who exhibit a complete remission (CR) or provisional CR then receive radiotherapy to
      the regional field 5 days a week for 2.8 weeks. If the disease is not responsive, 2 more
      courses of chemotherapy are given. Patients whose disease remains nonresponsive or progresses
      go off the study. Radiotherapy may follow for others. Patients are followed every 3 months
      for the first year, every 4 months for the second year, every 6 months for the third year,
      and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 277 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
