      [14C]-CC-122 following a single oral dose of [14C]-CC-122 in healthy male subjects. It is
      planned for 6 subjects to be enrolled; each subject will participate in a screening phase, a
      baseline phase, a treatment phase, and a follow up phone call. Blood, urine and fecal samples
      will be collected for analyses.
