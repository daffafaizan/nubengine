      junction in the oesophageal epithelium in patients with GORD symptoms. In addition these
      patients will be characterized for their reflux especially by pH-impedancemetry, Bilitec and
      oesophageal acid perfusion test. Correlations between the characteristics of the reflux and
      the biological results will be calculated.
