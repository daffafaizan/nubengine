      ≥50 years in community health service centers in Nanjing. The investigators will propose
      mpMRI for those met our criteria of PSA values between 2.5 and 4.0 ng/ml. Transperineal
      systematic biopsy and MRI/ultrasound fusion targeted biopsy will be offered for those who
      scored ≥3 points on the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System Version 2 (PI-RADS v2).
      Follow-up examinations annually will be offered for those with a PI-RADS score <3. Sequences
      obtained while conducting mpMRI included T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging, and
      dynamic contrast-enhanced using a 3.0-T system.
