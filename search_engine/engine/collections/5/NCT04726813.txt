      daily life functioning. The availability of evidence-based psychological interventions for
      adults with ADHD is poor. Interventions delivered over the Internet might help to increase
      the availability of effective psychological interventions for this group. The primary aim of
      this study is to examine the efficacy of a self-guided Internet-delivered intervention for
      coping with ADHD. The secondary aim is to investigate the effects of individual adaptation of
      the intervention on adherence, satisfaction and clinical outcomes. A minimum of 118
      participants with a self-reported ADHD diagnosis will be included in the study. In phase 1 we
      will conduct a randomized controlled trial with two arms, 1) self-guided Internet-delivered
      intervention for coping with ADHD (N=59), 2) self-guided online psychoeducation (control
      group, N= 59), with a 3 month follow-up. After 3 months the second phase of the study starts.
      In this phase (II) the control group participants will receive an adaptive version of the
      Internet-delivered intervention. This includes adaptation of the order of the modules to the
      individual participant needs, with the use of rule-based and machine-learning based
      adaptation. Clinical outcomes in both phases are inattention, hyperactivity, quality of life
      and stress. Uptake, usage, adherence and satisfaction will be explored. Repeated measurers
      are at baseline, weekly during the intervention period, post-intervention and 3 months
      follow-up.
