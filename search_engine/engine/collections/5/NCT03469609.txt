      enterostomy the regular stool transfer is interrupted as the distal part of the bowel (the
      part following the enterostomy) does not participate in the circulation of stool. Therefore
      it does not contribute to the resorption of enteral contents. As a consequence these children
      need additional parenteral nutrition. Due to the negative side-effects of parenteral
      nutrition all patients should return to enteral nutrition as soon as possible. Consequently,
      many pediatric surgical centers worldwide routinely perform mucous fistula refeeding (MFR)
      into the former unused bowel after enterostomy creation because case reports and
      retrospective analyses show low complication rates and faster postoperative weight gain.
      Several providers, however, shy away from this approach because to date there is still no
      high quality evidence for the benefit of this Treatment.The aim of this study is to assess
      the effects of mucous fistula refeeding in a randomized, prospective trial. We hypothesize
      that MFR between enterostomy creation and enterostomy closure reduces the time to full
      enteral feeds after enterostomy closure compared to the group without refilling. Moreover,
      the side effects of parenteral nutrition may be reduced and the postoperative hospital care
      of infants undergoing ostomy closure shortened.
