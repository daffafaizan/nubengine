      cognitive testing software as part of the screening process. Eligible subjects will be
      assigned a normal diet or a ketogenic diet (a diet high in fat/protein and low in
      carbohydrates) for three days before testing. Subjects will be immersed in water to the
      shoulders, inside a hyperbaric (high pressure) chamber while breathing 100% oxygen at
      increased atmospheric pressure, and doing cycling exercise. Testing on the cognitive
      software, as well as blood sampling and physical monitoring will be done while in the
      chamber. All tests and procedures will be completed again at least one week later with the
      diet not assigned for the first session.
