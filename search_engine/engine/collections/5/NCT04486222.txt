      treatment, showing good therapeutic effect to medicine treatment-refractory patients. Recent
      studies suggested bilateral DLPFC might be effective to geriatric depression. Accelerated
      treatment course was reported to have similar therapeutic effect and safety profile with
      traditional course. The investigators hypothesize accelerated bilateral rTMS is effective to
      geriatric depression and comorbid anxiety.

      Cognitive impairment and decreased parasympathetic tone are common in patients with major
      depression. The investigators hypothesize cognitive function and physiological indicators
      improve after accelerated bilateral rTMS.

      In this single-center, prospective double-blind, randomized, sham-controlled trial, the
      investigators aim to recruit 100 patients older than 60 years, without neurocognitive
      disorders, and refractory to one or more antidepressants. The experimental group would
      receive an rTMS course with high-frequency stimulation at left DLPFC followed by
      low-frequency inhibition at right DLPFC, two sessions daily, five days a week, and two weeks
      in total. The standard treatment group would receive an rTMS course with high-frequency
      stimulation at left DLPFC as standard treatment parameters. The control group would receive a
      sham-probe course. Mood, cognition and physiological markers would be monitored every week.
      The primary outcome is response and remission rate of major depression measured by Hamilton
      Rating Scale for Depression.
