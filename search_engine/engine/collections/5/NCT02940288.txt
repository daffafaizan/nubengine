      representation of the homunculus in the ear. This acupuncture technique is similar, in
      theory, to reflexology where stimulation of a reflex point in the ear is presumed to relieve
      symptoms in another part of the body. It is hypothesized that this technique works to
      decrease pain through the reticular formation, the sympathetic and the parasympathetic
      nervous systems.

      The increasing use of laparoscopic surgery has significantly diminished the dosing and
      duration of postoperative opioid consumption compared with open surgery. However, adverse
      events related with opioid use (nausea & vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention, sedation) may
      cause delays in hospital discharge and can be especially problematic for certain sub-sets of
      high risk patients such as those with obstructive sleep apnea or prior histories of
      addiction. Investigators hypothesize that auricular acupuncture using the Battlefield
      Acupuncture Protocol will decrease opioid consumption and postoperative pain after
      laparoscopic surgery with minimal or no adverse events.

      The primary aim of this study is to assess the effects of the BFA protocol on postoperative
      analgesic consumption and the secondary aims are to assess pain scores and time to discharge
      from Post Anesthesia Care Unit following laparoscopic surgery.
