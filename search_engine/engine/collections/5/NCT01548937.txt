      Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequent cause of dementia and about 20% of them have
      depression. Depression subjects are associated with more rapid cognitive decline, a poorer
      response to treatment. Post mortem study showed close relationship between AD and disruptions
      of the serotonergic system, including loss of serotnergic neurons at brain stem. However, the
      alternations in presynaptic serotonin function relative to demented or non-demented subjects
      remain to be investigated in living subjects. In this study, the investigators will collect
      40 elder subjects (i.e., age above or equal to 50 years old). The serotonin transporter
      activity will be compared between subjects with or without dementia using I-123 ADAM images.
      The single photon emission tomography (SPECT) will be compared to recent (within 6 months)
      F-18 FDG PET images for further investigation.
