      levels of WRAIR's AMA1 malaria antigen (FMP2.1) adjuvanted in GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals'
      AS02A compared to rabies vaccine in malaria-experienced Malian adults aged 18-55 years
      inclusive. Secondary objectives are to: (1) measure the magnitude and duration of antibody
      response to FMP2.1; (2) measure cellular immune responses to FMP2.1 at baseline and after
      immunization; (3) measure the inhibition of parasite growth by the in vitro GIA; and (4)
      determine the specificity of the antibodies to diverse AMA1 genotypes in addition to 3D7, by
      measuring by ELISA, and GIA on parasites with typed AMA1. A double-blind controlled dose
      escalation trial will allow assessment of vaccine safety in each of three groups, one group
      each to receive medium and full dose levels of the experimental vaccine, and one group to
      receive the comparator vaccine. Thirty adults will be randomized to receive the medium dose
      level of FMP2.1 (n=20) or rabies vaccine (n=10) and thirty to receive the full dose level of
      FMP2.1 (n=20) or rabies vaccine (n=10). The division of the rabies group into two groups of
      ten is done to maintain blinding at each immunization time point, and all participants who
      receive the rabies vaccine will be analyzed as a single group. The sample size of the groups,
      however, will not allow detection of anything other than very large differences in the
      occurrence of adverse events among the three groups. The advantage of double blinding is to
      remove the potential for investigator and participant prejudgment about the effects of the
      vaccines in the reporting of adverse events.
