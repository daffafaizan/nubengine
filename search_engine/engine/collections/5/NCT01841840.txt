    
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of one acute bout of low and high
      frequency passive vibration on blood pressure, heart rate, arterial stiffness, wave
      reflection, and autonomic function in post-stroke patients.

      The specific aim of this study is:

      -To evaluate the effects of an acute bout of both high (40Hz/low amplitude) and low frequency
      (25Hz/high amplitude) passive vibration on arterial function and aortic hemodynamics by
      assessing blood pressures (systolic, diastolic, mean, pulse pressure), arterial stiffness
      (aortic, systemic, leg), aortic wave reflection (augmentation index), and autonomic function
      (heart rate variability).
