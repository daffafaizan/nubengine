      intervention consists of two system-level interventions (chart reminders to prompt providers
      to ask about in-home smoking and a State Quit-line referral system), and a provider-level
      intervention (training in the PHS Guidelines, in motivational interviewing, and on how to use
      the system-level intervention). Investigators will implement the study in the Bellevue
      Pediatric Asthma Clinic and the pediatric clinic at Lincoln Hospital using a two group (pre
      intervention control group / post-intervention treatment group) pilot study to test the
      feasibility and preliminary effects of a multi-level (i.e., system and provider)
      intervention. The primary outcome is provider adherence to tobacco use treatment guidelines,
      which will be assessed by conducting parent exit interviews with 200 smoking parents (100
      pre-intervention [control group] and 100 post-intervention [treatment group]). Preliminary
      intervention outcomes will be collected through the parent exit interviews (i.e., baseline)
      and 2-month post-baseline interviews with the control and treatment parents. Providers will
      also be interviewed regarding their satisfaction with the intervention.
