    
      This is a prospective multi-national non-interventional study that includes two components of
      Cohort Event Monitoring (i) Short-term safety surveillance with a follow-up of 6 months after
      each Dengvaxia® dose administration and (ii) a long-term safety surveillance with a follow-up
      of five years after the first dose.

      No vaccine will be provided as part of this study.

      Study population will be identified in a convenient sample of sites as representative as
      possible of vaccination centers in each country. Subjects who received their first dose of
      Dengvaxia® at participating sites during the recruitment period and who meet the eligibility
      criteria will be asked to participate. After enrollment, vaccinees will be contacted
      periodically by telephone, e-mail, or Short Message Service (SMS) during follow-up for the
      identification of outcomes and Dengvaxia® vaccination status.
