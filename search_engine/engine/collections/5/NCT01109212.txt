    
      This is a pilot phase II, double-blind, multicentre, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel
      groups study in patients with DN undergoing irbesartan therapy.

      According to screening urinary albumin excretion, at baseline and before randomization, all
      patients will be categorized into 2 strata:

      Stratum 1: microalbuminuria (20 to 200 μg/min, in at least 2 of 3 consecutive overnight urine
      samples collected at the screening) Stratum 2: macroalbuminuria (>200 μg/min, in at least 2
      of 3 consecutive overnight urine samples collected at the screening).

      Within each stratum, patients will be randomly allocated on a 1:1 basis to the 2 treatment
      arms (after one month induction period):

        -  bindarit 600MG twice a day

        -  placebo All patients will be treated with irbesartan 300 mg/day as background therapy.
           After 12 months of treatment albuminuria will be evaluated as primary endopoint.
