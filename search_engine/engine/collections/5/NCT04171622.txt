      I. Demonstrate the efficacy (overall survival [OS]) of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab in
      treatment naive patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the response rate and progression-free survival (PFS) in patients treated with
      lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.

      II. Establish safety for concurrent administration of lenvatinib plus pembrolizumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Translational endpoints: cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) changes and immune
      biomarkers will be studied.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients also receive lenvatinib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Cycles repeat
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.
