      lipid for intravenous use in Canada. In 2010, ClinOleic, a new, predominantly olive oil based
      emulsion, has been approved by Health Canada as an alternative lipid.

      There is an increasing need for hospitals to do quality-assurance studies for in-patient
      parenteral nutrition (PN) to assess indications, PN prescription, complications, clinical
      outcomes and costs. The only in-patient population that is well studied is the intensive care
      unit (ICU) population. Several meta-analyses showed that PN was associated with higher
      infection rate, longer length of stay and higher mortality when compared with enteral
      nutrition. Results from these and other studies were the basis for the Canadian ICU
      Guidelines.

      The aim of this study is to determine if PN prescribed in in-patients is indicated,
      appropriately following existing guidelines in terms of timing of nutrition support,
      prescription and monitoring and, whether it is associated with complications. In addition,
      clinical outcomes such as length of stay and mortality will be assessed. Also, we will
      evaluate metabolic, nutritional, infectious and inflammatory parameters in patients receiving
      soybean oil-based lipid emulsion compared to those of patients receiving olive oil-based
      lipid emulsion.
