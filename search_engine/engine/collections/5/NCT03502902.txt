    
      Single-dose, sequential-group design incorporating a food-effect evaluation. Each subject
      will participate in 1 treatment period, except for Group 5, where each subject will
      participate in 2 treatment periods. In each group, 6 subjects will receive HEC68498 and 2
      subjects will receive placebo. Subjects in Group 5 will receive the same dose level of
      HEC68498 (or placebo) in both treatment periods. All doses will be administered either after
      an overnight fast of at least 8 hours or, for subjects in the food-effect evaluation,
      approximately 30 minutes after starting a standard high-fat breakfast. The first 2 subjects
      in each group will be dosed (1 subject receiving HEC68498 and 1 subject receiving placebo) 48
      hours prior to the remainder of the subjects. There will be a minimum of 7 days between dose
      escalations. The washout period for subjects in Group 5 will be determined following review
      of available PK data.
