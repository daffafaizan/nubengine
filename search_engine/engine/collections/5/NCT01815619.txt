      This translates to the need for performing repeat procedures to establish a diagnosis and
      therefore delays patient treatment. The biopsy specimen obtained at cholangioscopy are
      usually processed offsite in the pathology lab. We believe that if a pathologist can assess
      the tissue sample during the procedure itself (onsite) and provide feedback, the diagnostic
      accuracy rate will improve. This translates to better (faster) diagnosis and early treatment.
      Therefore, we will be comparing onsite versus offsite evaluation of bile duct biopsy
      specimens to determine which method yields a better diagnosis.
