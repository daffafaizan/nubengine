      prescribe to all patients the same drug (ramipril) at the same dosage (5 mg/day). All
      patients were examined every 2 months during the first year of follow-up and every 6 months
      thereafter. At each visit, they underwent a complete physical examination. If the target
      blood pressure of <140/90 mmHg was not achieved with ramipril monotherapy, addition of other
      antihypertensive drug(s) was allowed. Patients complaining adverse side effects attributed to
      ramipril were switched to losartan (50 mg/day). The patients were also prescribed a normal
      protein (1 gram/kg/day) and moderately salt-restricted (6-8 grams/day) diet throughout the
      study.
