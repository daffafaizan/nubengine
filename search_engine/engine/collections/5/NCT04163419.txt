    
      Schwannomatosis is characterized by the predisposition to develop multiple schwannomas and,
      less commonly, meningiomas. Pain is the most frequent symptom reported by these patients,
      with 68% experiencing chronic pain.

      The investigators propose to test the efficacy and tolerability of tanezumab as a treatment
      for schwannomatosis patients with chronic pain who have had inadequate pain relief in a
      randomized, placebo-controlled trial, which could form the basis of a larger, randomized
      controlled trial in the future.

      The study is designed with a total duration of 281 days (40 weeks) and will consist of four
      periods: Pre-treatment, Double-Blind Treatment, Single Arm Treatment, and 24-Week Safety
      Follow-up. The Pre-Treatment Period lasting up to 30 days, followed by a Double-Blind
      Treatment Period lasting up to 8 weeks, followed by a Single Arm Treatment Period lasting up
      to 8 weeks, and a 24-Week Safety Follow-Up Period ending with the End of Study Visit at Week
      40.
