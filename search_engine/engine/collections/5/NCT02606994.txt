      accelerated healing of their oral mucositis by brushing with Oral Defense Toothpaste.

      In this study, participants experiencing up to grade 2 chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis
      will be split into two arms. The first arm (test arm) will receive Oral Defense Toothpaste
      and be required to brush three times per day, for 8 days. The second arm (control arm) will
      receive Crest Toothpaste and be required to brush three times per day, for 8 days. Patients
      in the control arm will be provided Magic Mouth Rinse, if needed. Healing of oral mucositis
      lesions will be evaluated at days 1 and 8. Quality of life assessment (determination of
      pain/loss of oral function) will be determined using a daily questionnaire.
