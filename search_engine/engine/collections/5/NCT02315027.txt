      autologous MSCs in a dose escalation study in patients with MSA. Safety secondary goals
      include to monitor changes in peripheral blood and in components of CSF, and monitor for any
      changes of nervous system structures using MRI. Efficacy secondary goals include evaluating
      potential efficacy by providing a number of studies and instruments that will detect changes
      in the course of the disease in terms of autonomic and neurologic symptoms and deficits.
