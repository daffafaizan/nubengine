      deleterious changes in left ventricular (LV) architecture including increased LV mass. In
      dialysis patients, increased LV mass is associated with death. Recent randomized trials have
      demonstrated that increasing small solute clearance is not associated with improved outcomes
      - hence an increased interest in the management of volume control in ESRD patients.
      Bioimpedance analysis is inexpensive, safe and easy to use and appears to be more useful than
      other techniques to assess volume status in dialysis patients. In addition, dialysis patients
      are vitamin D deficient and this is also associated with an increased LV mass and its
      inherent complications.

      This study will evaluate the use of bioimpedance analysis versus usual care to assess and
      manage volume status and the use of vitamin D versus placebo in peritoneal dialysis patients
      and its effect on LV mass as measured by cardiac MRI.
