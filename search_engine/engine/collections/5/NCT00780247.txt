    
      Purpose of the study: To determine the effect of environmental influences on Vitamin D
      status.

      Specific Aims

        1. To measure the prevailing 25D and Vitamin D levels in communities at diverse latitudes
           (Alaska and Hawaii).

        2. To collect information on variables that influence Vitamin D status such as skin color,
           history of sun exposure and sunscreen use, diet history, vitamin and calcium supplements
           used, and BMI.

        3. To collect typical food samples from the region for future analysis of their Vitamin D
           and 25D content.

        4. To collect a blood sample for DNA analysis of inter-individual differences in Vitamin D
           metabolism (Gc or Vitamin D binding protein alleles).
