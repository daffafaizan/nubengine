      Primary

        -  To assess whether there is a difference in abdominal recurrence-free survival between
           retroperitoneal soft tissue sarcoma patients undergoing curative intent surgery alone
           and those undergoing preoperative radiotherapy followed by curative-intent surgery.

      Secondary

        -  To assess whether there is a difference in metastasis-free survival, abdominal
           recurrence-free interval, and overall survival between these patients.

        -  To assess tumor response in patients undergoing preoperative radiotherapy.

        -  To assess toxicity of preoperative radiotherapy given prior to curative-intent surgery
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to institution and
      WHO performance status (0-1 vs 2). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo surgical resection of the tumor mass within 4 weeks following
           randomization.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (RT) or
           intensity-modulated RT within 8 weeks after randomization. RT continues 5 days a week
           for approximately 5.5 weeks. Patients undergo surgical resection of the tumor mass
           within 4-8 weeks after the completion of RT.

      Tumor tissue, normal abdominal wall fat, and peripheral blood may be collected during surgery
      to identify new prognostic factors for translational research.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at day 60 post-surgery and every 6
      months thereafter.
