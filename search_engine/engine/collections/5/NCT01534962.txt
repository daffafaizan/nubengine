      cardioversion (DCC). If DCC is successful (defined as persistence of sinus rhythm 2 h
      post-DCC) patients meeting all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria are
      randomly assigned to the treatment arms (Ranolazine low, intermediate, high dose or placebo,
      given BID).

      Transtelephonic ECG devices (TT-ECG) are used for recording of AFib recurrence to be read by
      a Central ECG Core Laboratory. Any symptoms indicative of AFib have to be recorded by the
      patient in a diary.

      Study Visits are held for screening (Visit 1), at DCC and randomisation (Visit 2), one week
      post DCC (Visit 3), after 8 weeks of treatment (Visit 4), and at end of treatment (Visit 5).
      A safety follow-up telephone call is held 2 weeks after end of treatment.

      12-Lead ECGs are performed at every visit.

      Safety evaluations include regular safety laboratory blood and urine tests, 12-lead ECGs and
      the continuous recording of adverse events.

      A double-dummy technique is used to ensure double-blind conditions.
