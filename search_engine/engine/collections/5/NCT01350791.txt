      specifically for coronary stents. This alloy, coupled with a new stent architecture, is
      designed to enable thinner struts, increased flexibility and a lower profile while improving
      radial strength, recoil and visibility. In addition, the PROMUS Element Stent System
      incorporates the new Apexâ„¢ Dilatation Catheter technology, designed to enhance deliverability
      to complex lesions.

      Currently, there have been limited data regarding comparison of PROMUS Element stent with
      first-generation DES in routine clinical practice. Therefore, we perform large-scale
      real-world registry of PROMUS Element stents.
