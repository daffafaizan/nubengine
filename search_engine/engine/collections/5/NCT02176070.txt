      invited via email to participate in this study. The Contract Registry includes people who
      self-identify as having one of 6 vasculitities: Wegener's Granulomatosis, Microscopic
      Polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss Syndrome, Polyarteritis Nodosum, Takayasu's Arteritis, and Giant
      Cell Arteritis. People voluntarily enroll in this Registry with the understanding that they
      will receive information about clinical studies for which they might be eligible. The
      introductory email included basic information about the study and all of the required
      elements for informed consent in a brief format. By clicking the link to the reproductive
      health questionnaire, participants gave their consent to be included in the study.
