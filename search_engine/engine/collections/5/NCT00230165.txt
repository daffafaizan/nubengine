      Research Center by the Principal Investigator or another physician. A detailed history is
      obtained, a physical examination is performed, and blood is obtained for further tests.
      Occasionally patients and family members are requested to return for additional tests. If an
      abnormality is identified with tests conducted in our research laboratory, we advise the
      volunteer to have the studies repeated in a laboratory certified to conduct tests on
      patients.
