      The study was conducted in response to a program announcment issued in 1991 on obesity and
      tests the hypothesis that atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), hypertension,
      and/or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) develop in Japanese Americans when
      there is a truncal pattern of weight gain (central adiposity), which is in turn accompanied
      by insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, and lipid abnormalities. This cluster of
      abnormalities has been called 'Syndrome X'. It is postulated that 'Syndrome X' develops in
      Japanese Americans in response to environmental (behavioral) factors, many of which reflect
      'westernization' in this ethnic group. The research plan focuses upon the relationship
      between central obesity and metabolic changes and disease outcomes associated with 'Syndrome
      X' along with the behavioral variables that potential risk factors for the development of
      this cluster of abnormalities.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The cohort was re-examined for diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart, disease, peripheral
      vascular disease, and a number of potential coronary heart disease risk factors including
      medical history, health practice, social history, diet, glycosylated hemoglobin, insulin,
      proinsulin, c-peptide, glucose, anthrometric measurements, lipids, and computed tomography on
      the thorax, abdomen, and thigh.
