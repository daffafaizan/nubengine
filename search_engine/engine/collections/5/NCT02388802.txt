      psychological assessments. The selected patients will undergo egg retrieval and subsequent
      freezing of embryos to enable IVF treatment following transplantation. Following uterine
      transplantation, using deceased donor allografts, the patients will be closely monitored for
      12 months clinically, radiologically and immunologically until embryo transfer. Following
      successful embryo transfer the patients will continue to be monitored antenatally until they
      are delivered by Caesarean section.
