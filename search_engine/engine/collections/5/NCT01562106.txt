      the standard of care surgical treatment. Sentinel nodes are the first lymph nodes to which
      cancer cells are likely to spread from a primary tumor. Removal of a sentinel node for
      examination accurately predicts whether the cancer has spread to other nodes further along in
      the nodal chain. Fluorescence imaging with ICG dye (Indocyanine Green) has been used to
      detect lymph nodes in patients with gastric, colorectal and breast cancer. To date, the use
      of this technique in endometrial cancer has not been reported.
