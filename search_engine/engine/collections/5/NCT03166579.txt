      base which demonstrates its effectiveness in treating individuals with Borderline Personality
      Disorder (BPD). Nine randomised controlled trials have been completed at six independent
      sites. These trials have found a reduction in suicidal behaviours, intentional self-injury,
      depression, hopelessness and other difficulties associated with this mental health diagnosis.

      While the efficacy of DBT has been demonstrated through multiple RCTs, few studies have
      examined the effectiveness of DBT in community mental health settings. In particular, no
      study to our knowledge has evaluated the standard 12-month DBT programme for adults with BPD
      in an Irish community setting. "Standard" DBT is delivered by a team of multidisciplinary
      mental health professionals, and comprises of individual therapy sessions for each patient,
      group skills training sessions, phone coaching and consultation meetings for the clinicians
      on the DBT team.

      The current study thus aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the standard 12-month DBT
      programme (The Endeavour Programme) in an Irish community setting.
