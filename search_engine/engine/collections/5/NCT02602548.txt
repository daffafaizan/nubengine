      treatment. Indolent infections, such as those involving Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes),
      pose a diagnostic dilemma as they present differently than the acute symptoms typically
      associated with most postoperative bone and joint infections. The workup of these suspected
      infections is also somewhat difficult, as these colonies are slow growing, necessitating that
      cultures be kept for an extended period of time. Previous studies have shown that positive
      cultures are typically identified between 7 and 13 days. In a recent study of patients
      undergoing primary shoulder arthroplasty, 41.8% of patients were found to have P. acnes
      growth from their joint fluid at a mean of 7 days (range 5-9 days). All of these patients
      were then treated immediately with 4 weeks of dual oral antibiotic therapy1.

      As the incubation of laboratory cultures increases, there is the potential concern of false
      positive growth. Timely identification is critical in order to avoid performing unnecessary
      treatments on patients in whom no infection is actually present.

      The investigators will enroll patients undergoing primary shoulder surgery for a clearly
      identified mechanical dysfunction, in which there is no clinical suspicion for infection.
      Infection should not exist in this population, making it an appropriate clinical sample in
      which to study results that the investigators would consider to be false positives.
