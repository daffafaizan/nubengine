      multi-site to compare the clinical equivalence of the test formulation of mometasone furoate
      monohydrate, 50 mcg/actuation nasal spray (Lek Pharmaceuticals d.d.) with the reference
      formulation NasonexÂ® nasal spray (Schering) in the relief of the signs and symptoms of
      seasonal allergic rhinitis. Participants who met the inclusion/exclusion criteria entered a
      7-day placebo lead-in period. Following this placebo lead-in period, on Day 1 participants
      who continued to meet eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in a 2:2:1 ratio to one of
      three treatment groups (Test Product:Reference Product:Placebo) for 14 days of treatment. In
      all treatment groups, participants were instructed to administer the study drug once daily at
      approximately the same time each day. A single dose of 200 mcg was 4 actuations, each
      containing 50 mcg per actuation. Patients were instructed to administer the 4 actuations
      alternating between right and left nostril, such that 2 actuations were not administered back
      to back to the same nostril.
