      medications and their frequency is estimated to be nearly 20%, mainly under dopaminergic
      agonists (AD). They constitute a major public health issue due to their sometimes dramatic
      socio-occupational and judicial consequences. Most often the therapeutic strategy is to
      reduce or even stop AD, which can lead to withdrawal symptoms, apathy or aggravation of motor
      signs.

      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) may have an interest in the treatment of ICD. This molecule reduces
      "craving" in addictions by substance abuse, but also in behavioral addictions, with as a
      potential mechanism a reduction in levels of plasma alphasynuclein.

      The main objective of this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter
      controlled trial is to demonstrate that a 10-week NAC add-on treatment, compared to placebo,
      improves the behavioral addictions of Moderate in the MP. The main endpoint will be the
      variation of the subdivision of the hyperdopaminergic behaviors of the Ardouin Parkinson's
      Disease Behavioral Assessment (ECMP) scale between the baseline and after 10 weeks of
      treatment.
