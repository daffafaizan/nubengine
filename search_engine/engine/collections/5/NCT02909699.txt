      increase the risk for cardiovascular (CV) disease and premature death in older adults.
      Structural changes to the arterial wall and cardiac muscle are indicated as a cause and
      appear to be induced by age-related oxidative stress and inflammation and reduced levels of
      autophagy, the cellular "house-keeping system". Pre-clinical studies indicate that
      resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenol present mostly in grapes and red wine, may improve left
      ventricular cardiac muscle and endothelial vasodilator function. Although, RSV has been shown
      to induce autophagy and improve CV function in animals, evidence for its effects on the CV
      system in humans is lacking, and there is a need for clinical trials to better understand the
      effects of RSV on CV function in humans. Because older adults are most likely to have
      impairments in the central and peripheral CV systems, they represent an ideal population to
      test the effects of RSV on CV function. Therefore, the central hypothesis is that RSV
      supplementation will improve age-related left ventricular cardiac muscle function and
      arterial vasodilation in older adults (> 65 years). The participants will undergo 90 days of
      RSV treatment (n=12) (1,000mg/day), or (n=12) (1,500mg/day) or placebo (n=12). Before and
      after the intervention, investigators will non-invasively investigate left ventricular and
      arterial vasodilator function. Additionally, investigators will examine cardiac muscle damage
      and inflammatory biomarkers in blood and autophagy and endothelial function protein levels
      and in skeletal muscle to better understand molecular mechanisms that may underlie the
      hypothesized beneficial effects of RSV on cardiovascular health in older adults.
