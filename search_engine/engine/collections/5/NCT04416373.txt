    
      This is a cohort study of pregnant women confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Data
      will be collected in Portuguese maternities that agreed to collaborate in this study.

      Pregnant women are tested during hospital admission by using nasopharyngeal/oral swabs for
      SARS-CoV-2 RT PCR as part of a universal testing policy. Maternal demographic data (age,
      comorbidities, parity, smoking habits), COVID-19 related data (symptoms, diagnostic tests,
      therapy used and ICU admission), gestational age at SARS-CoV-2 confirmed infection, pregnancy
      outcomes (gestational complications, gestational age at birth, mode of delivery) and neonatal
      outcome (birthweight and Apgar score, RT PCR neonate results) and breastfeeding strategies
      will be evaluated.
