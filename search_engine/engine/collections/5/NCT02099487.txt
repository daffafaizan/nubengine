      rapidarc approach, followed by adjuvant temozolomide on survival and quality of life in
      elderly, poor performance status patients with newly diagnosed HGG. The potential advantage
      of this approach is deliver a more selective irradiation to tumor's target with reducing the
      dose to normal brain and to allow the delivery of a higher dose, optimizing the therapeutic
      window.
