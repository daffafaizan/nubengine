    
      This is a single arm open label trial that will assess the safety and efficacy of retreatment
      with CTL019/CTL119 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T cells in patients who have late
      relapse of diffuse large B-cell or follicular lymphoma after achieving complete remission
      from prior CTL019/CTL119 treatment. Patients eligible for this protocol will have been
      treated initially with CTL019/CTL119 under UPCC13413/NCT02030834, have experienced a durable
      complete response (defined as â‰¥ 6 months duration), and have a residual manufactured
      CTL019/CTL119 product available. This protocol will serve subjects with no available
      potentially curative treatment options (such as autologous or allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation) who have a limited prognosis (months to < 2 year expected survival) with
      available therapies.
