      (trazadone) in subjects experiencing non-restorative sleep. Sentra PM taken with trazadone
      works better than either product alone. Twenty-six subjects will be randomized to a two week
      ingestion of Sentra PM at bedtime, twenty-six subjects will be randomized to a two week
      ingestion of trazadone at bedtime, twenty-six subjects will be randomized to a two week
      ingestion of Sentra PM with trazadone at bedtime and twenty -six subjects will be randomized
      to a two week ingestion of placebo at bedtime. Each morning after ingestion of either active
      product or placebo, the subject will fill out sleep questionnaires. On the fourteenth day of
      ingestion, a repeat 24-Hour ECG examination will be performed on all one hundred and four
      subjects and each subject will give a second blood sample for analysis. On the morning of the
      14th day of ingestion the final sleep questionnaires will be completed.
