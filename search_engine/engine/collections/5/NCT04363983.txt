    
      The study aims to explore relationship between the molecular subgroups (DNA and RNA
      analysis), tumor microenvironment, host (immunity system, premetastatic niche, microbiota,
      metabolism) and survival (prognostic value), response (predictive value) and tolerance
      (toxicities) to conventional treatments or immunotherapies in digestive cancers, in
      particular, in colorectal cancer and pancreaticobiliary cancer.

      This is a prognostic monocentric study which includes 2 parts:

        -  one retrospective observational cohort for which 150 eligible patients (who have being
           diagnosed between 1998 to 2020) will be entered in the cohort per year during 22 years
           targeting 3300 patients and

        -  one prospective interventional cohort in which 3000 patients (diagnosis will be done
           between 2020-2030) will be enrolled during 10 years. 10 years of follow-up for all
           patients. This cohort is non comparative, non randomized, non control.

      The enrollment will last 10 years in Digestive Surgery Department, Ambroise Par√© Hospital,
      APHP.

      There is any change in management of patients' care who will participate to the study, all of
      the treatment modalities (i.e. surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy,
      intra-arterial treatments and supportive care) are possible and choice of treatment will be
      made by investigator physician, after multidisciplinary meeting validation, and according to
      referential and recommendations of practice in department.

      Statistic analysis

      The statistic analysis will be performed and reported according to the international
      guidelines STROBE for the observational studies.
