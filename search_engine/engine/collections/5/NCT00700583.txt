      well-being, and an increased risk of falling at night, it is among the most bothersome of the
      lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). Nocturia is related to a variety of conditions such as
      aging, overactive bladder (OAB), benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH)/LUTS, medications,
      diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, anorexia nervosa, and sleep disturbance. In a previous
      study, we suggested that treatment with terazosin can reduce episodes of nocturia, both
      subjectively and objectively, in some men with LUTS. Other study showed that in men with
      nocturnal polyuria, furosemide resulted in a significant reduction in night-time frequency
      and percentage of the voided volume.
