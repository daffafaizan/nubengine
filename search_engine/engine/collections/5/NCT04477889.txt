      patients who are treated at MHS facilities for COVID-19. Data including, but not limited to
      demographics, comorbidities, medications, treatment, and clinical outcomes will be collected
      from February 2020 to December 2025. Subjects will undergo no additional tests or procedures
      as part of this registry study. All patient data will be obtained from the patient's
      electronic health records (EHR) of the hospital or clinic in a retrospective manner. The
      process for gathering the data will not influence treatment decisions. There will be no
      direct patient contact associated with inclusion in this registry study.
