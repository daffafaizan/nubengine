    
      In this study, acute chest pain (ACP) patients will be selected from chest pain center of
      nine large tertiary hospitals in China from November 1, 2019 to October 31, 2021. All the
      selected patients will sign the informed consent.

      Patients' characteristics, the first vital signs at the time of consultation, the first
      arterial blood gas, complete blood count, coagulation markers, blood biochemical results and
      myocardial injury markers, imaging examinations and electrocardiogram will be collected
      within 30 minutes at admission. Meanwhile, whole blood and plasma samples will be collected
      and stored in - 80 â„ƒ refrigerator. After diagnosis according to the gold standard examination
      or related guidelines, patients will be admitted to different department for standard
      treatment. Medication, surgical procedures and complications will be recorded carefully.
      Plasma and whole blood will be used to detect proteomics and/or genomics biomarkers
      associated with early evaluation of ACP.

      Screening early evaluation indicators using novel protein biomarkers and easy-to-obtain
      clinical indicators, and establishing evaluation models for high-risk ACP by data analysis
      methods. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUROC), net
      reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) and decision
      curve analysis (DCA) will be used to evaluate the prediction ability of the model.
