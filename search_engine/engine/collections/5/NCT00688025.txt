      event related potential components that reflect basic sensory processes (P1 and N1), and will
      not impair attention and memory processes, whereas the benzodiazepine receptor agonist
      zolpidem will significantly reduce (relative to placebo) the amplitude of these event related
      potential components throughout the cerebral cortex and 2) show that ramelteon reduces the
      abnormal hyperarousal in insomnia as reflected through a reduction in the contingent negative
      variation component of the event related potential across frontal and parietal brain regions.
