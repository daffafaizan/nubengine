      the hepatitis D virus (HDV), a small RNA virus that requires farnesylation of its major
      structural protein (HDV antigen) for replication. Up to forty-five subjects with chronic
      delta hepatitis will be randomized to receive one of nine different doses of lonafarnib.
      Dosing will occur over 12-48 weeks, and during that time, evidence of antiviral response will
      be assessed by frequent measurements of HDV-RNA. The primary therapeutic endpoint will be an
      improvement in quantitative serum HDV RNA levels after treatment with lonafarnib therapy. The
      primary safety endpoint will be the ability to tolerate the drug at the prescribed dose for
      the treatment duration. Several secondary endpoints will be measured, including side effects,
      ALT levels, and symptoms. Therapy will be stopped for intolerance to lonafarnib. This study
      is designed as a phase 2a study assessing the safety, tolerance and antiviral activity of
      nine dosing combinations of lonafarnib with ritonavir boosting with and without PEG
      IFN-alpha.
