      The purpose of the protocol is to localize the neural regions and systems mediating the forms
      of knowledge representations hypothesized by the principal investigator to be stored in the
      human prefrontal cortex. We suspect that political attitudes can also be viewed as a type of
      stored knowledge. Religious attitudinal and event knowledge are also expected to be similarly
      represented and stored. Utilizing a variety of experimental neuropsychological tasks during
      functional MRI, we will investigate hypotheses regarding the role of the dorsolateral and
      ventromedial prefrontal cortex in social cognition and emotional processing. We will
      ascertain the relationship between so-called "cold" cognition such as event knowledge and
      "hot" social cognition such as attitude formation and specific brain regions within the
      prefrontal cortex.

      Study Population

      Normal adult volunteers will participate in experiments dealing with processing of event
      knowledge, general attitudes, political stereotypes and attitudes, and religious attitudes,
      using fMRI.

      Design

      All the experiments will employ within-subject event-related fMRI design to determine whether
      activations of different cortical areas correspond to different kind of stored knowledge.

      Outcome Measures

      The data that we collect in this protocol will consist of fMRI activation images
      corresponding to varying neuropsychological tasks. The will be of value in (1) identifying a
      set of neural regions and distributed networks mediating the forms of knowledge
      representation stored in the prefrontal cortex and (2) developing functional MRI screening
      measures for subjects at-risk for developing a neurological disorder.
