      systematic treatment based on gemcitabine plus cisplatin is recommended as the current
      standard chemotherapy for unresectable or metastatic BTC. There is no standard recommendation
      for second line therapy.

      Apatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting vascular endothelial growth factor receptor
      2(VEGFR-2).

      This study was conducted to assess the efficacy and safety of Apatinib in patients with
      advanced refractory BTC who had received first-line chemotherapy.
