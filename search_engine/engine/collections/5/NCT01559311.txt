      in the study, and then randomized 1:2 to either the Control Group or Echo-guided Group.
      Patients randomized into the Control Group were implanted with a dual chamber pacemaker
      (DDDR) device (St. Jude Medical) standard therapy. Patients randomized into the Echo-guided
      Group were implanted with a cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemaker (CRT-P) device (St.
      Jude Medical), which was programmed to DDDR pacing mode (CRT-P OFF) at implant. For each
      Echo-guided Group patient, presence of RVA pacing induced ventricular dyssynchrony was
      assessed within 24-hour of implant using the standardized criteria of Doppler
      echocardiography. The Echocardiography Core Laboratory (Echo Core Lab) then analyzed each
      image and the treatment allocation of the Echo-guided Group was done within 72-hour post
      implant based on the Echo Core Lab outcomes:

        -  Patients with the presence of RVA pacing induced ventricular dyssynchrony were allocated
           to the CRT-P standard therapy with CRT-P turned ON

        -  Patients with the absence of RVA pacing induced ventricular dyssynchrony were allocated
           to the DDDR standard therapy with CRT-P remained OFF

      Patients meeting all the inclusion criteria and not meeting any of the exclusion criteria
      were eligible for the study. Data was collected at the following study visits:Enrollment,
      Implant & Randomization, Pre-discharge (PDH) (≤ 72 hours post implant), Month 1 follow-up
      visit: 30 ± 14 days post implant, Month 3 follow-up visit: 90 ± 14 days post implant, Month 6
      follow-up visit: 180 ± 14 days post implant and Month 12 follow-up visit: 365 ± 14 days post
      implant
