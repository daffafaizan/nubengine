      the worst outcome. The major cause of LA-HLH is aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma(NHL),
      especially T/NKT cell lymphomas. Until now, there is no recommended therapeutic schedule for
      this fatal disease. Dose-adjusted(DA) EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine,
      cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) shows effective activity in patients with aggressive NHL,
      which also contains the critical drugs for HLH of HLH-94/04. The investigators therefore
      developed DA-EPOCH regimen to treat non-Hodgkin's lymphoma with hemophagocytic
      lymphohistiocytosis and assess its clinical outcome including safety and efficacy.
