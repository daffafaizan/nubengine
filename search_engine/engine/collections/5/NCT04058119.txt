      Users of PDHC with perceived distress (PSS-10), aged 18 years or over, will be recruited and
      randomly assigned into experimental and waiting list control group, in a 1:1 ratio. The
      recruitment of participants will be held in PDHC by health professional (e.g., family
      medicine doctors, nurses, nutritionists, psychologists, etc). After signed informed consent
      and baseline measures, experimental group will participate in body-mind sessions (yoga,
      qigong or pilates), oriented by certified instructors, during 6-months. Each participant
      should attend only one of the therapies, in order to guarantee a differentiated evaluation.
      In every session, it will be evaluated the participants' adherence and theirs perceived
      enjoyment and exertion. The other outcomes (primary and secondary) will be analyzed through a
      face-to-face contact, in three different moments: baseline (T0), post-intervention (at month
      6, T1) and 6-month follow-up (at month 12, T2). The control group will not participate in any
      specific intervention, but will receive the body-mind intervention after the experimental
      period. An intention-to-treat and per protocol analysis will be performed to analyze
      intervention effectiveness and efficacy.
