    
      This is a single arm open label trial that will assess the safety and tolerability of mature
      dendritic cell (mDC3/8) vaccine (primer and booster) in subjects with stage III and stage IV
      melanoma, followed by treatment with pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 therapy).

      Eligible patients that provide written informed consent will undergo apheresis to collect
      blood mononuclear cells for vaccine production approximately 1 week prior to vaccine
      infusion. Each study subject will receive cyclophosphamide 300mg/m^2 intravenously or by
      mouth 3 to 4 days prior to the vaccine dose, to deplete regulatory T cells. For each vaccine
      dose, all subjects will receive autologous dendritic cells pulsed with melanoma
      tumor-specific peptides. On Day 1, the subject will receive the primer vaccine dose; this
      will be followed by two booster vaccine doses at 6 weeks apart. Peripheral blood will be
      taken weekly to monitor the immune response to each peptide by tetramer assay. Re-staging
      will occur after the 3rd vaccine dose, along with tumor biopsy and second apheresis. Anti
      PD-1 therapy (standard of care) will commence 7-8 weeks after the subject's last dendritic
      cell vaccine.
