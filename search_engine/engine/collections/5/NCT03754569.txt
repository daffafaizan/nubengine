      ovarian cancer (EOC) is a cornerstone in the knowledge and the comprehensive management of
      the disease, as PM will occur in the majority of patients. Indeed, the goal of cytoreductive
      surgery (CRS) in these patients is to completely remove all visible peritoneal invasion
      because the absence of residual disease after surgery is known to improve the prognosis.

      Despite clinical remission after the completion of complete surgery and platinum-based
      chemotherapy, 60% of patient develop peritoneal recurrence. This suggests that microscopic
      lesions may be present that are not eradicated by surgery, not controlled by systemic
      chemotherapy and that may be one of the mechanisms leading to peritoneal recurrence.
      Peritoneal carcinomatosis is responsible for the greatest morbidity and mortality in women
      with EOC.

      There are very few studies in the literature on microscopic peritoneal involvement in EOC,
      its detection and potential role in the progression of cancer. The peritoneum should be
      considered an organ in its own right and the surgeon must treat peritoneal metastases with
      the intent to cure. To follow the recommendations, this microscopic disease must be managed,
      because complete CRS is now a skill that can be mastered skill and its uses is a validated
      guideline. Moreover, "complete CRS" should be defined as "without macroscopic residual
      disease" thus highlighting the presence of microscopic disease.

      The goal of this study is to add scientific evidence for the existence of Microscopic
      Peritoneal Metastases (mPM) and to justify the need for additional diagnostic and therapeutic
      approaches.
