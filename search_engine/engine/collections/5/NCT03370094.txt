      accelerate further diagnostic and treatment pathways after patient arrival at the emergency
      room or the dedicated stroke center. Interactive video and audio streaming connecting on-site
      paramedics to a stroke center based stroke physicians can help to overcome these hurdles.
      Patient evaluation by simple, pre-defined assessment measures and a standardized
      questionnaire may enable a pre-hospital decision on the need of expedited diagnostic and
      treatment procedures after arrival at the dedicated stroke center.
