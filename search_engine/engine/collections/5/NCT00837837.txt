    
      This is a single-group, single-center, open-label, one period, bioavailability study. This
      study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of chlorpheniramine in a population of
      children aged 2 to <12 yrs and adolescents aged 12 to <18 yrs. Twelve blood samples (3.0 mL)
      for chlorpheniramine analysis will be drawn at time 0 (pre-dose), and at 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6,
      8, 12, 24, 48, and 72 hours after dosing. Plasma levels of chlorpheniramine will be
      determined. The following primary, single-dose PK parameters for chlorpheniramine will be
      determined using noncompartmental methods: AUCL, AUCI, and Cmax. The following PK parameters
      will also be determined to provide a complete profile of the drug, as appropriate: oral
      clearance (CL) and volume of distribution (Vd) and adjusted for body weight (per kg); time to
      reach Cmax (tmax), and apparent elimination constant (Kel) and half-life (t1/2). The PK
      parameters will be summarized using descriptive statistics.
