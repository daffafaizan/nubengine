      risk assessment, and other testing related to physical parameters including body mass index,
      glycosylated hemoglobin, lower extremity nerve conduction study, and ankle range of motion,
      proprioception and strength. After testing, subjects are interviewed to determine fall status
      (faller or non-faller). A "faller" is defined as someone that has fallen at least 2 times in
      the past year. Data Analysis: The validity of the fall risk assessment tools will be compared
      using sensitivity and specificity analyses. Variables related to ankle function, neuropathy,
      glycemic control and general activity will be analyzed for association with recent fall
      history through multivariable logistic regression. Variables related to falls, neuropathy and
      activity level will be analyzed for association with health-related quality of life through
      multivariable linear regression.
