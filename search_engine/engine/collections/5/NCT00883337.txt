      study (maximum of approximatively 118 weeks). The two doses of teriflunomide were
      administered in double-blind fashion, whereas interferon beta-1a (RebifÂ®) was open-label.

      The opportunity to continue with the highest dose of teriflunomide in open-label fashion was
      offered to the participants who successfully completed treatment in the core study.

      The overall treatment period was followed by a 4-week elimination follow-up period.
