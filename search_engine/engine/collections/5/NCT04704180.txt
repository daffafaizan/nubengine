      neonates and neonates. Those positions should be comfortable and safe to promote
      physiological stability and optimal neuromotor development. The facilitated tucking position
      is the position of the baby in its mother's womb. It calms the neonate and helps it feel safe
      and maintain body control. It also improves sleep quality, stabilizes physiological
      parameters, gives a sense of security, supports motor development, and optimizes energy use.
      The facilitated tucking position makes it easier for preterm neonates to undergo invasive
      procedures (heel blood collection, aspiration etc.). However, there is no published research
      examining the effect of the facilitated tucking position in the early postpartum period on
      physiological parameters, comfort, and breastfeeding performance in preterm neonates.
