    
      This Randomized Control Trial will be conducted to compare the effects of various heights of
      anterior power arm on maxillary anterior dentition following en masse retraction with
      mini-implants by participation of thirty patients meeting eligibility criteria. The
      participants will be divided in three groups through software generated randomization table.
      Group I (control group; height of anterior power arm 6 mm), Group II and Group III
      (experimental groups; height of anterior power arm 3 mm and 9 mm, respectively). Ten patients
      will be allocated in each group. En masse retraction with mini implants and various heights
      of anterior power arm will be carried out immediately after bilateral maxillary first
      premolar extractions using continuous arch sliding mechanics. Horizontal, vertical and
      angular dimensions will be measured on lateral cephalograms while the transverse effects will
      be measured on maxillary dental cast. Both lateral cephalograms and dental casts will be
      obtained at two different point of time; T1, before retraction and T2, after complete
      extraction space closure. The data will be assessed with-in and among groups.
