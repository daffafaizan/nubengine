    
      Patients admitted on this protocol will have, or be suspected of having, a Leishmania
      infection. The major objectives of the protocol are to diagnose and classify the Leishmania
      infection and to provide species-based therapy to study the natural history of the treated
      infection. As part of the standard evaluation of these patients, infecting parasite isolates
      will be obtained when possible and the host response before and after therapy will be
      assessed to address broader questions related to diagnosis, disease pathogenesis and response
      to therapy. Careful observations of the patients' clinical and immunologic responses to
      therapy will be made, as well as long-term follow-up of these changes. It is anticipated that
      the patients will receive optimal clinical care for their infections and that the specimens
      collected from them will prove to be valuable reagents for the laboratory studies of the host
      responses unique to leishmanial infections.
