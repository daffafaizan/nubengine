      alternation with three control sessions (casual talking with the therapist). In order to
      perform HRV-analysis and BRS determination blood pressure and ECG were continuously recorded
      during the sessions. Changes in subjective well-being and perceived health were assessed by
      questionnaire before and after the various sessions (mood questionaire).

      Thirty-one patients participated in this study, the majority diagnosed with arterial
      hypertension (22 out of 31).
