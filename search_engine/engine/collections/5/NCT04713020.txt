      and control group by random allocation. The experimental group was given a mobile device
      education program, and the control group was routine nursing care. Two groups of stroke were
      discussed. Whether there are significant differences in knowledge, depression assessment, and
      self-efficacy assessment.

      Hopefully, the intervention of mobile device education program can provide patients with a
      health education method that is accessible and can be repeatedly watched for learning.
      Hopefully, this education program may replace traditional health education leaflet, as well
      as reduce the workload of clinical nurses. It is hoped that this education program can
      effectively improve the self-care knowledge of patients with stroke, enhance self-efficacy,
      reduce depression symptoms, increase satisfaction with educational instructions, and
      ultimately prevent patients with stroke from experiencing any relapse to coexist with their
      stroke and enjoy a good quality of life.
