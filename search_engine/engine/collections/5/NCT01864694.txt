      system (TLC [Telephone Linked Communications]-DIET) for affecting dietary behavior change.
      These interventions will target the same dietary behaviors (consumption of fat and fruits and
      vegetables). The behavior change strategies and content will be derived from the same
      behavior change theory (the Transtheoretical Model [TTM]). A representative sample of ~1200
      adults from a large urban area will be recruited through a list-assisted telephone list which
      will be bought by the University of Rhode Island so that subjects can be randomized into one
      of three groups: a Web-based system (WEB- DIET), a computer telephone system (TLC [Telephone
      Linked Communications]-DIET), or assessment only control. The study hypotheses, which will be
      evaluated both at the end of the 6-month intervention period and at the end of 18-month
      follow-up (post-baseline) observation period, are: 1. TLC-DIET> Control 2. WEB-DIET> Control
      3. WEB-DIET> TLC-DIET.
