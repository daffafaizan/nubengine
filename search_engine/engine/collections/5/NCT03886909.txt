      functional (reduced aerobic capacity, reduced muscle strength) and psychosocial (e.g. reduced
      quality of life, increased fatigue) detriments.

      Evidence shows that exercise is considered to be an effective treatment approach in
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients during and after treatment with regard to the
      above mentioned side-effects. Also, prehabilitative exercise in colon and lung cancer
      patients was shown as feasible and effective. However, no experience exists with regard to
      prehabilitation exercise in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients.
