      and the relative risk of the lesion. HER-2/neu over-expressing DCIS represents a group of
      patients with significant risk for development of invasive breast cancer. In this proposal we
      will continue to evaluate the development of type I polarized DC for the treatment of DCIS by
      evaluating whether further improvements in therapeutic response can be achieved by
      intratumoral administration of HER-2/neu pulsed DC1 compared with our current intranodal
      administration. Women who are diagnosed with Her-2/neu over-expressing DCIS with no invasive
      carcinoma will be eligible for this study. Patients will receive DC1 vaccines by intranodal,
      intralesional, or both routes of administration. The primary objective will be safety and
      administration with secondary objectives of immune activation and clinical response. We will
      also develop a novel assay to monitor ongoing immunity to HER-2/neu, and lastly will begin to
      develop these vaccines for patients with invasive breast cancer as well. Fifty-four subjects
      will be randomized to one of three treatment arms: intranodal injection, intralesional
      injection, or intranodal and intralesional injection of the vaccine. Upon entering this
      study, the subjects' blood will be drawn in a way that collects only the white blood cells.
      Subjects then receive six vaccines over a six week period. They will then undergo the
      standard surgical procedure to remove any remaining DCIS in the breast.
