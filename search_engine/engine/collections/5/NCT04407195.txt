      facing a critical situation and are subject to increased psychological distress. Those
      directly involved in the diagnosis, treatment and care of patients with COVID-19 are at
      significant risk of developing physical, psychological, and psychosocial distress.

      The data examined in this study will further clarify the mental distress experienced by
      healthcare workers and lead to the development of peer-support and educational initiatives to
      improve these findings. The central hypothesis of this research is that high levels of mental
      distress will be associated with caring for patients with COVID-19.

      This study will use an observational, cross-sectional on-line survey design. Participants
      will complete a 15 minute self-administered questionnaire. All data will be de-identified.
