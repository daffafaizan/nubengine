      1977 through 1987, the valve was used as the only valve of choice and inserted in a total of
      1,104 consecutive patients at our department.

      The MH valve is made of a single piece of titanium with no welds. The disk is made of
      tungsten impregnated graphite with a carbon pyrolytic coating. The tungsten renders the disk
      radiopaque. In the aortic position the maximal opening is 75Ëš. A central aperture in the disk
      allows free rotation. The valve is rotatable in the sewing ring. The sewing ring is made of
      Teflon. Aortic sizes are 20-31 mm (outer diameter).

      The initial clinical results were published in 1979 (1). The cohort of patients has been
      followed-up and analysed at 5, 10 and 15 years (2-5). In the present study we report our
      25-year follow-up data for the 816 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement (AVR) with
      special reference to survival, functional status, valve-related complications and the impact
      of concomitant surgery.
