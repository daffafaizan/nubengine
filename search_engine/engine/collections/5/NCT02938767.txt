      endothelial thickness and coronary microvascular function could be useful for detecting ED.
      Endothelial dysfunction could be assessed by coronary flow reserve (CFR), carotid intima
      media thickness (IMT). Repeating measurement of IMT and CFR could be predictor of
      cardiovascular events and mortality in peritoneal dialysis patients.
