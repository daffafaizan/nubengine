    
      1.1 Background (I)

      1.1.1 10%~50% of the patients who previously underwent cholecystectomy experience recurrent
      abdominal pain with or without diarrhea, abdominal distention, enzymatic changes, etc., and
      sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) accounts for about 13% of such cases;

      1.1.2 Sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD):

        -  It refers to biliary kinetic abnormality of the sphincter of Oddi (SO), often
           accompanied by pain, hepatic and pancreatic enzyme elevation, common bile duct (CBD)
           dilation or onset of pancreatitis.

        -  Pain caused by SOD affects the quality of life (QoL).

      1.1.3 The diagnosis of SOD is still being disputed, and there has been no optimal solution so
      far.

        -  The diagnosis of SOD is largely based on clinical judgment

        -  The gold standards ERCP and SOM are invasive diagnostic criteria

      1.2 Background (II)

      1.2.1 If biliary-type abdominal pain after cholecystectomy is considered as SOD, most of the
      patients are classified as SOD II and SOD III according to Rome III Criteria-modified.

      Biliary SOD Type I: moderate or severe biliary-type abdominal pain; transient ALT / AST/ALP
      elevation > 2ULN; CBD dilation > 8mm as evidenced by ultrasound or other non-invasive
      examination Type II: biliary-type abdominal pain; One or two of above items Type III:only
      biliary-type abdominal pain

      1.3 Background (III)

      1.3.1 Treatment of SOD is being disputed: currently, the main method is to relax sphincter of
      Oddi (SO).

        -  Medications: antispasmodic drugs, nitrates, calcium ion antagonists, modulators of
           gastrointestinal (GI) motility

        -  EST(endoscopic sphincterotomy): postoperative complications and mortality

      1.3.2 EST is not well effective in the treatment of SOD type II and type III, which are
      mostly caused by functional abnormalities

      -ASGE guideline 2015 points out that EST is not recommended for patients with SOD type III.
      Endoscopic stents are not recommended, either.

      1.3.3 Danshu Capsules: contains the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and has the
      effects of fighting infection, alleviating pain, promoting bile secretion and lifting muscle
      spasms; literature showed that Danshu Capsules effectively improved the symptoms of biliary
      disorders, such as pain, nausea and abdominal distension.

      1.3.4 Pinaverium Bromide: able to improve the spasms of SO; literature showed that it treated
      biliary disorders effectively.Â·10%~50% of the patients who previously underwent
      cholecystectomy experience recurrent abdominal pain with or without diarrhea, abdominal
      distention, enzymatic changes, etc., and sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (SOD) accounts for
      about 13% of such cases.
