      clinic standardized pre-vasectomy medications to determine which has better outcomes at
      improving pre-procedural anxiety and procedural pain relief and medication usage in adult
      male patients following vasectomy. In this efficacy trial, the investigators hypothesize that
      acupuncture will provide therapeutic anxiety and pain relief during and after vasectomy. The
      investigators will measure anxiety immediately before and prior to the procedure and before
      and after the intervention via a standardized anxiety scale (comparative). The investigators
      will also measure pain control immediately after the procedure using Defense and Veterans
      Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS). At the post op check (2-4 days after procedure) subjects will fill
      out a patient satisfaction survey. During the recovery period over 2 weeks, a medication
      usage diary will be kept by the subject including the time when the patient returns to full
      duties.
