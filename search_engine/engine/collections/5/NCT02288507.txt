      be administered safely at 400mg twice a day (BID) when initiated 14 days following
      radioembolization (RE). However, the ideal sequence of RE and sorafenib may not be completely
      elucidated, the two treatments given concurrently may be more effective than the sequential
      approach studied in the Asian trials. Preclinical models have demonstrated that sorafenib
      acts synergistically with radiation, increasing apoptosis. Furthermore, case reports suggest
      profound responses in patients who have received sorafenib concurrent with transarterial
      radioembolizatoin (TARE) as evidenced by improvement in symptoms, >80% decrease in alpha
      fetoprotein (AFP), and conversion from unresectable to resectable. Sorafenib concurrent with
      TARE may take advantage of the synergistic relationship between the two therapies and prove
      to be a more effective treatment strategy than sequential administration of TARE and
      sorafenib.
