      5,6 g to 72 g in 4 induction/consolidation courses) in parallel with anthracyclines dose
      reduction (from 630 mg/m2 to 285 mg/m2)did not improve survival, but decreased feasibility.
      In the ongoing trial we try to learn whether anthracyclines dose escalation (up to 720-660 mg
      m2) will or will not equivalise the standard (5,6 g in 4 induction/consolidation courses) and
      high (14,8 g) ARA-C doses.
