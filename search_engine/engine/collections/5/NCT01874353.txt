      already improved by taking platinum based chemotherapy. The patients must also have a fault
      in their DNA which codes for the BRCA protein. The BRCA protein helps mend broken DNA in the
      cells of the body; if this protein doesn't work properly it can increase the chance of
      getting cancer. The aim of this study is to see whether patients taking olaparib tablets last
      longer until their cancer gets worse, compared to those taking the placebo tablet. The study
      is also looking to see if there is an overall improvement to how long the patients survive
      whilst taking olaparib tablets compared to the placebo tablets; and the quality of their life
      whilst living with ovarian cancer.
