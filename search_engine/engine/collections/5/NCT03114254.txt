      (5FU) and there is currently no United Kingdom standard second line agent. Carbazitaxel has
      been shown to kill both taxane resistant and sensitive cells. JAVA-P is a phase two, single
      arm study of the use of carbazitaxel for relapsed, locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma
      of the penis. Seventeen patients will be recruited over two years, with adverse events and
      progression free survival being assessed. Results may indicate the need for larger studies to
      evaluate carbazitaxel as a first line agent.
