      well-established anesthetic methods for caesarean section. CSEA combines the advantages of
      spinal anesthesia for the surgery, and epidural anesthesia for postoperative pain management.
      However, it is more time-consuming, and adds potentially risks of both single techniques.

      The aim of this randomized trial was to compare analgesia and patient satisfaction with CSEA
      continuous epidural administration of local anesthetics versus SSSA with oral pain medication
      in the postoperative period.
