    
      Prospective, multicentric interventional study to optimize the cutoff value of NPY
      methylation in liquid biopsies in metastatic colorectal cancer patients treated with
      first-line FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab.

      Inclusion is possible after histologically or cytologically proven colorectal adenocarcinoma
      with metastatic lesions according to RECIST 1.1 at the start of first-line treatment using
      FOLFOX/FOLFIRI and panitumumab. Patient must have a proven RAS and BRAF wild-type tumor.

      Patients will be followed by study protocol up to and including the first CT scan following
      the last liquid biopsies taken, or when a follow-up period of 11 months is reached, until
      death, until metastasectomy, until lost to follow-up or until (consent) withdrawal.
