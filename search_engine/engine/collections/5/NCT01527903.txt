      mortality associated with delirium, the specific sedatives and analgesics used in the ICU is
      an issue of interest. Recent studies have focused on comparing sedatives, but interpretations
      are often confounded by the fact that in most studies, different analgesics were used when
      comparing two sedative medications. The role of remifentanil as the main analgesic in the ICU
      is being recognized. Pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profiles of remifentanil makes it an
      ideal analgesic in the ICU setting. The investigators therefore designed this randomized
      study to compare sedation with propofol and midazolam in a remifentanil-based sedation and
      analgesia.

      The purpose of this study is to compare propofol-remifentanil sedation with
      midazolam-remifentanil sedation in regards to extubation and weaning time, length of stay in
      the ICU, as well as the incidence of delirium. Primary end-points were weaning time and
      extubation time, and secondary end-points were the incidence of delirium and length of stay
      in the ICU.
