      with methotrexate (MTX) in patients with breast or ovarian cancer who are known to have a
      BRCA (breast cancer gene) mutation. 6MP is used instead of thioguanine(6TG) as it is
      converted to the same cytotoxic moiety as 6TG, ie. thioguanine nucleotides, but with reduced
      toxic effects. Low dose methotrexate is used in combination with 6MP as it promotes the
      formation of thioguanine nucleotides.
