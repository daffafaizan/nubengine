    
      The Neurogenic Dysphonia/Dysphagia Registry is a 510K post-clearance multicenter,
      observational, open-label registry of the benefits and risks of management and outcomes of
      patients with neurogenic dysphonia/dysphagia who have received vocal fold augmentation (VFA).

      Enrollment is open to all eligible patients meeting all of the inclusion and none of the
      exclusion criteria, with a target of 400 patients. Up to 100 sites in the US and abroad will
      be a part of the registry. Sites will provide retrospective data for active patients who have
      undergone VFA within the past 24 months at the site and also begin to prospectively enroll
      patients who are receiving VFA as a part of their usual care. Patients will be followed for
      up to five years prospectively, until lost to follow-up, or death.
