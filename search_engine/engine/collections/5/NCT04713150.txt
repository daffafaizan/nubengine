      neurodevelopmental outcomes, including deficits in cognition and socioemotional development.
      The principal goal of this project utilizes Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI),
      Electroencephalography (EEG), and a variety of behavioral measures to assess brain maturation
      and neurodevelopment among infants exposed prenatally to COVID-19 and associated high levels
      of stress. The planned experiments are effective in determining measures of stress response
      in relation to a maternal COVID-19 diagnosis and characterize the neurodevelopmental sequelae
      of those infants born to mothers with a COVID-19 infection.

      Specific goals include:

        1. To determine the prevalence of psychological distress in pregnant women with a confirmed
           COVID-19 diagnosis and to examine the extent to which existing high risk environments
           play a role in the susceptibility of heightened psychological distress.

        2. To examine the effects of prenatal distress and maternal illness/inflammation related to
           a maternal COVID-19 diagnosis on early structural and functional brain development.

        3. To characterize neural networks that may have been impacted by a maternal COVID-19
           infection and related stress during pregnancy.

        4. To assess the early neurodevelopment outcomes of infants exposed to elevated prenatal
           stress and trauma related to a maternal COVID-19 diagnosis during pregnancy.
