      evaluate the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioral group therapy (CBGT) in reducing
      problematic vasomotor symptoms, reducing daily interference and improving quality of life.
      The study will include two homogenous peri- or post-menopausal cohorts (African-American and
      Caucasian) with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder. The intervention will be
      delivered in groups of 6 to 10 participants per group of both race/ethnicities in an
      outpatient setting during a 6-week time period. The participants will be assessed on the
      degree of hot flash problem rating, hot flash related daily interference, and menopause
      quality of life at screening, baseline, and post-treatment. Participants will also be
      assessed using the following predictor variables at the same time points: body mass index
      (BMI), level of perceived stress, severity of depression, severity of anxiety level of
      pleasure, severity of mania, hot flash beliefs and severity of couple's conflict.
