      temsirolimus is already used to treat some adult cancers in Canada. Temsirolimus has been
      shown to slow the growth of tumours in animals but it is not known if it can also slow tumour
      growth in children. Laboratory studies suggest that giving both vinblastine and temsirolimus
      may offer better results than giving vinblastine alone.
