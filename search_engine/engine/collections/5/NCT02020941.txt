      I. To assess the overall response rate of carfilzomib after 8 cycles of treatment in patients
      with first-relapsed myeloma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall response rate to single agent carfilzomib after 4 cycles of
      treatment.

      II. To assess progression-free survival (PFS). III. To assess time to progression (TTP). IV.
      To assess duration of response (DOR). V. To assess toxicities.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine the effect of carfilzomib alone or in combination with dexamethasone on the
      following biologic end points and their correlation with response: measurements of bone
      remodeling (sodium fluoride F 18 positron emission tomography [PET], serum markers of bone
      remodeling and the bone marrow osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation and function)
      with the measurement of disease response and proteasome activity in the bone marrow
      microenvironment.

      II. To describe recapture of response after progression in the maintenance phase.

      OUTLINE:

      TREATMENT PHASE (COURSES 1-8): Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 8 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving less than partial
      response (PR) also receive dexamethasone orally (PO) or IV weekly in courses 4-8.

      MAINTENANCE PHASE (COURSES 9-14): Patients receive carfilzomib IV over 30 minutes on days 1,
      2, 15, and 16. Patients who received dexamethasone in the Treatment Phase continue to receive
      dexamethasone PO or IV weekly. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 3
      months.
