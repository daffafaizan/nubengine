    
      This study will be a factorial-design, cluster-randomised trial with a comparison group to
      assess the impact of (i) malaria prevention, based on screening and treatment, and (ii)
      enhanced literacy instruction by teachers on the health and educational achievement of
      healthy schoolchildren.

      The target population in this study includes children attending primary schools in Kenya. The
      accessible population includes the children attending the participating primary schools in
      classes 1 and 5 in Kwale district. Schools will be randomized to one of four groups,
      receiving either the screening and treatment intervention alone, the education intervention
      alone, the malaria and education interventions combined, or neither intervention. The unit of
      analysis is the school, but individual-level analysis using suitable generalised linear
      models, adjusted for clustering by school, will also be undertaken to explore differences in
      impact of the interventions according to child age, sex, home environment, school quality as
      well as differences in the uptake of each intervention.
