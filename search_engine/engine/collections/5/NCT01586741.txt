      training for 3 months,and all groups wearing girdle for 3 months.

      abdominal muscle strength.

      self-reported physical and mental health) and VHPQ (ventral hernia Pain Questionnaire).

      Two-thirds of patients receive surgery and followed up with a 3 month and 1-year control.At 1
      year of control, all go through a CT scan and a Biodex measurement of muscle strength.

      The control group followed up after one and half months and 3 months. In the surgery group,
      patients may not know what reconstruction they received before the final assessment after 1
      year.
