      older men with age-associated hypogonadism and subsyndromal depression. Men will receive
      either 7.5 gm/qd of testosterone gel or a placebo gel for 12 weeks. The double-blind phase
      will be followed by a 12 week open-label extension in which all subjects will receive 7.5
      gm/qd of testosterone gel.

      Procedures: Depressive symptoms will be assessed with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale
      (HDRS) and the SCL-20, a 20-item self-report depression scale that has been shown to have
      high reliability and validity and to be sensitive to changes in depressive symptoms in
      outpatients in primary care settings. The short form (16 item) Endicott Quality of Life
      Enjoyment and Satisfaction Scale will be used to assess quality of life changes. The Medical
      Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) will be used to assess changes in functional status.
      Demographic information, medical history and current medications will be determined at
      baseline and follow up, via patient interview and chart review. Overall medical morbidity
      will be ascertained with the Cumulative Illness Rating Scale. All outcome measures (SCL-20,
      Endicott Quality of Life Scale, HDRS,SF-36) will be assessed at baseline, week 12 (end of the
      double-blind phase)and week 24 (end of the extension phase). Blood draws will be done at
      baseline, week 12 and week 24. Laboratory assays for testosterone leves at baseline, week 12
      and week 24 will be performed at the same time to minimize interassay variability.
