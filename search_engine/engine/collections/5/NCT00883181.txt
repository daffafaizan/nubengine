    
      This is a multi-center international observational study of patients receiving myelotoxic
      regimens, with an investigator assessed risk of febrile neutropenia â‰¥ 20%, for the treatment
      of solid tumors (breast, ovarian and lung).

      This is an observational study in which patient risk factors were qualitatively (but not
      quantitatively) assessed, and adherence to G-CSF primary prophylaxis was at the discretion of
      physicians and not mandated by the protocol.
