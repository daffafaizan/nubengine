      FANCG knockout mice are similar. They grow up and develop normally, without any severe blood
      disease or tumor. However, they show chromosome instablity and highly sensitivity to MMC. And
      they have gonadal dysfunction and fertility defects. From this we conclude that the severe
      physical deformity of FA patients might be induced by other mutations. By comparing among the
      FA patients and between FA patiens and normal people, we look forward to find the mutated
      genes and verify their relationship with the physical deformity.

      Even in 90% of FA patients the bone marrow failure will eventually occur, but the starting
      age ranges from 8-84. And Immuno-inhibition therapy has no effects on FA. Other DNA repair
      dysfunction diseases have higher rate of tumor, but not so high rate of bone marrow failure
      as FA does, which implies that the FA protein has the key role in hematopoietic stem cell
      maintainance. In FancC-/- mice, young mice is insensitive to DNA crosslinks with comet assay,
      but not adult mice, indicating that the accumulation of DNA damage during time leads to DNA
      repairment defects. by comparing the exome of FA patients and their parents, the mutations
      that were accumulated in FA patients could be found, and these genes might be sensitive to
      repairment and be important for hematopoiesis maintainance.
