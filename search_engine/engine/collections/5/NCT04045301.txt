    
      This is a phase 2b, multi-center randomized controlled trial comparing 2 doses of omalizumab
      to placebo in subjects 6 to 25 years old with multiple food allergies undergoing a
      symptom-driven multi-food OIT protocol.

      Subjects will undergo a screening period involving a DBPCFC to a mix of three allergens which
      will determine their eligibility and eliciting dose.

      Eligible subjects will be randomized to one of 2 omalizumab dosages or placebo at a ratio of
      2:2:1 for a total period of 20 weeks.

      They will undergo initial food escalation (IFE) to determine their starting food treatment
      mix dose for three simultaneous food allergens after a pre-treatment period of 8 weeks with
      the study drug.

      Subjects will undergo up-dosing OIT visits at the clinic every two weeks, until a maintenance
      dose of 1500mg of protein (500mg per food) is reached (primary endpoint).
