      depression, or have no mood symptoms. The adults will undergo a diagnostic interview, the
      Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) for the diagnosis. The subjects will
      also complete the Adverse Childhood Events Scale to evaluate for a genetic x environmental
      interaction in detecting bipolar disorder at initial assessment. Genotyping will be done by
      SNaPshot genotyping method and genetic sample will be collected via buccal swab.
