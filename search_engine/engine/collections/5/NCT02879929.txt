      validity of a questionnaire in French; and (2) validity testing, including construct validity
      by factor analysis, reproducibility by intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland and
      Altman plots, and sensitivity to change by standardized response means, on a large sample of
      patients in a prospective multicenter study. DyNaChron, a questionnaire with 78 items divided
      into six domains and exploring both the physical and psychosocial repercussions of CND, was
      developed. In total, 759 patients completed the questionnaire at a first visit to a clinic,
      and 539 again 19.5 days later, on average.
