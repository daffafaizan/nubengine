      caregivers learn effective coping methods during their loved one's transplant process and
      make the experience of being a caregiver more manageable.

      Phase 1 of the project entails using qualitative interviews with caregivers to further refine
      the intervention. The psychological intervention will take place over the course of a patient
      transplant in a series of eight sessions. A trained behavioral psychologist will meet with
      the participant or talk with them over the telephone for 30-45 minutes at a time to discuss
      the caregiver experience and to help develop effective skills to support the patient as well
      as the participant over the course of the transplant.

      Upon the completion of the sessions, the investigators will have a short, audio-recorded exit
      interview to obtain the participant's feedback on the intervention. At the participant's
      convenience, this interview will be conducted in-person or over the phone. The investigators
      will use the feedback to improve the intervention before further testing its efficacy in
      phase 2, a randomized clinical trial.
