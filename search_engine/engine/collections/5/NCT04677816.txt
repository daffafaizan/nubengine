    
      Primary Objective: To determine if pathologic complete response in vitamin D deficient
      patients receiving vitamin D supplementation during neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable
      triple negative breast cancer is greater than or equal to 60% or less than or equal to
      pathologic complete response in historical controls (30%) using a one-stage phase II design.

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To estimate the proportion of patients with residual cancer burden (RCB) classes I, II,
           and III in vitamin D deficient patients receiving vitamin D supplementation during
           neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable triple negative breast cancer.

        -  To estimate pathologic complete response reaction in the observational arm of vitamin D
           sufficient patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy for operable triple negative
           breast cancer.

        -  To determine the feasibility of delivery of vitamin D supplementation with standard of
           care chemotherapy.

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of vitamin D supplementation
           with standard of care chemotherapy.

        -  To estimate the change in vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression from pre- and
           post-neoadjuvant treatment breast tumor tissue samples of vitamin D deficient patients.

        -  To estimate the change in VDR expression from pre- to post-neoadjuvant treatment breast
           tumor tissue samples in a sample of 5 vitamin D sufficient patients.

        -  To estimate the changes in the fecal microbiome and mammary gland microbiome of vitamin
           D deficient patients from pre- to post-neoadjuvant treatment, and to explore the
           concordance in the changes between the mammary and fecal microbiome.

        -  To estimate the changes in the fecal microbiome and mammary gland microbiome in a sample
           of 5 vitamin D sufficient patients from pre- to post-neoadjuvant treatment.
