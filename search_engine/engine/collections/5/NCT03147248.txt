      to the intravenous regimen where subcutaneous infliximab injection typically takes less than
      2 minutes. The availability of a subcutaneous formulation of infliximab would increase the
      treatment options available to patients, particularly those wishing to self-administer their
      therapy. This Phase I/III Study randomized, double-blinded (Part 2 only), multicenter,
      parallel-group study was designed to evaluate Efficacy, Pharmacokinetics and Safety between
      Subcutaneous CT-P13 and Intravenous CT-P13 in Patients with Active RA.
