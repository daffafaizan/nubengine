      -To establish the response rate of pembrolizumab in metastatic cutaneous squamous cell
      carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      -To determine the 6-month progression-free survival and 1 year overall survival of metastatic
      cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma of the skin (cSCC) treated with pembrolizumab.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat
      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 8-12
      weeks.
