      Magnesium is known to dilate cerebral arteries and to block N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors in
      the injured neurons.

      Intravenous magnesium may prevent vasospasm after subarachnoid hemorrhage and may protect
      neurons against damage during established vasospasm.

      The IMASH trial is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, multi-center trial to
      evaluate the effect that intravenous magnesium sulfate infusion on the clinical outcome of
      patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage.

      Methods:

      After obtaining randomisation code:

        -  Start MgSO4 20 mmol over 30 minutes, followed by infusion of 80 mmol/day or equivalent
           volume of saline within 48 h after onset of symptom,

        -  Study drug to be infused for 14 days from the day of hemorrhage (regarded as day 0).

        -  Measure plasma magnesium concentration daily and perform transcranial Doppler to monitor
           blood flow velocities of both middle cerebral arteries and extracranial segment of the
           internal carotid arteries.

        -  Plasma magnesium concentration in the IV MgSO4 group should be raised to 2.0-2.5 mmol/L
           or twice the serum baseline level. Patients that are randomized to saline infusion will
           only have their magnesium levels normalized if there is a clinical indication to do so.

      Outcome assessment Primary outcome: Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale at six months Secondary
      outcome: Incidence of clinical vasospasm, Barthel Index; modified Rankin score, modified
      National Institute of Health Stroke Score, MCA velocities, other major complications

      Study duration:

      6 years with a refined sample size of 340 after analysis of pilot study data; with planned
      interim analysis.
