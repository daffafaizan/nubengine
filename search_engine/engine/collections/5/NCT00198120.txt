      autism. The central hypothesis of this project is that D-cycloserine will be efficacious in
      reducing certain symptoms of autism including some aspects of social impairment.

      Autism is a severe neuropsychiatric disorder with a prevalence of at least 0.1 %. Despite
      investigations into the pharmacologic treatment of autism, no drugs have been shown to
      consistently improve the core symptoms of the disorder, namely social and communication
      impairment. Pilot data has suggested that D-cycloserine, a drug that affects the
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor, has efficacy for the symptom of
      social withdrawal in autism. In this study, children with autism will be randomly assigned to
      treatment with either D-cycloserine or placebo for 8 weeks. Both the subjects and
      investigators will be blind to treatment assignment. Subjects will be rated on a variety of
      clinical measures to examine the effects of D-cycloserine on social withdrawal and other
      symptoms of autism. Safety data including side-effects, vital signs, blood tests, and
      electrocardiograms will be performed at the beginning and end of the study. This study will
      provide important information about the effects of D-cycloserine for treating core and
      associated symptoms of autism. It will also greatly expand the knowledge about glutamatergic
      agents in autism and provide crucial information regarding the pathophysiology and future
      design of drug studies in autism.
