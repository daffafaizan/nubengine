      According to the WHO, osteoporosis is a disorder of the skeleton characterized by impaired
      bone strength, primarily reflecting poor integration of bone density and quality {{2042 NIH
      Consensus Development Panel on Osteoporosis Prevention, Diagnosis, and Therapy 2001;}}}.
      There are two types of osteoporosis, the most common is considered primary or idiopathic and
      includes juvenile, postmenopausal and senile osteoporosis. Secondary osteoporosis is
      considered to be that in which the deterioration of bone quality is due to different types of
      systemic diseases or produced by the intake of certain drugs (mainly glucocorticoids,
      anticoagulants and diuretics) {{2164 Maggi, S 2006;}}. Primary osteoporosis can affect both
      sexes, but postmenopausal and older women are more vulnerable to this disease because they
      possess important risk factors such as the same age and estrogen depletion {{2043 Tella, Sri
      Harsha 2014;}}.

      It is estimated that approximately 200 million women worldwide have osteoporosis,
      approximately 10% of women in their 60s, 20% of women in their 70s, 40% of women in their
      80s, and 67% of women in their 90s {{2044 Kanis, John Anthony 2007;}}}. Double beam X-ray
      densitometry (DEXA) is the test to accurately determine bone mass {{2046 Curiel, M Diaz
      1997;}}{{2045 Peris,P. 2000;}} and osteoporosis is considered to be present when densitometry
      values are below 2.5 standard deviations (SD) of peak bone mass {{2081 Kanis, John A 1994;}},
      the maximum value reached in young women.

      The reduced mass and altered microstructure of osteoporotic bone leads to increased bone
      fragility and an increased risk of bone fracture {{2047 Anonymous 1993;}} {{2048 Norohna,
      Judith A 2020;}}. It is estimated that an osteoporotic fracture occurs every 3 seconds and
      8.9 million such fractures are considered to occur worldwide {{2049 Ribagin, Simeon 2016;}},
      accounting in the European continent for 1.75% of noncommunicable diseases {{2051 Johnell,
      Olof 2006;}}. Fragility fractures are estimated to be associated with significant morbidity
      and mortality. Johnell and Kanis estimated that 740,000 deaths per year are associated with
      hip fracture due to osteoporosis {{2052 Johnell, Olof 2004;}}}. Despite advances in
      therapeutic procedures only 30-45% of those who survive a hip fracture recover pre-fracture
      function and 32-80% suffer some form of dysfunction {{2142 Rey-Rodriguez,M.M. 2020;}}} {{2144
      Takahashi, Ai 2020;}}, thus representing a high economic and life cost for the countries that
      suffer from them. It is estimated that in 2050 the United States will spend $131.5 billion to
      treat fractures caused by osteoporosis {{2053 Burge, Russel 2007;}}}.

      Associated with osteoporosis, numerous investigations, have observed a correlation between
      altered bone quality ( osteopenia or osteoporosis) and a decrease in strength and/or muscle
      mass (sarcopenia) thus increasing the frailty and deterioration of the patient suffering from
      it {{2054 Hirschfeld, HP 2017;}} {{2055 Hassan, Ebrahim Bani 2017;}} {{2056 Paintin, James
      2018;}} {{2056 Paintin, James 2018;}}. Tokeshi et al. observed how patients with osteoporotic
      fracture had lower muscle mass compared to those patients without osteoporisis {{2057
      Tokeshi, Soichiro 2020;}}}. Hoo Lee and Sik Gong describe that lower extremity muscle mass
      and loss of grip are closely related to the occurrence of osteoporotic vertebral fracture
      {{2058 Eguchi, Yawara 2019; }} and numerous investigations show the relationship between grip
      strength and osteoporotic fractures in older elderly {{2059 Kärkkäinen, M 2008;}} {{2060
      Denk, Katharina 2018;}} {{2061 Kamiya, Kuniyasu 2019;}} {{2062 Samelson, Elizabeth J 2006;}}
      {{2062 Samelson, Elizabeth J 2006;}}.

      Because of the morbidity, increased associated frailty, and high economic cost associated
      with osteoporosis, different therapeutic strategies have been proposed. Although the number
      of patients treated with pharmacology has been increasing in recent years {{2166 de Felipe,R.
      2010;}} and treatment recommended in most clinical guidelines {{2167 Sanfélix-Genovés, José
      2014;}}{{2165 Tarantino 2017;}}, more global approaches such as exercise and/or nutrition are
      increasingly gaining importance {{2165 Tarantino 2017;}} {{2168 Jang,H.D. 2020;}}

      HYPOTHESIS:

      - A multicomponent exercise program where strength exercises are performed with blood flow
      restriction obtains better values in densitometry and bone mass of osteoporotic patients with
      respect to the same multicomponent exercise program where strength is worked without flow
      restriction.

      INTERVENTION:

      The recruitment of the population will be carried out between July and November 2021, with
      the collaboration of the Consorci Sanitari de Terrassa (CST), which brings together a
      hospital center and different primary care centers (CAP). The primary care physicians and
      rheumatologists of the CST will receive an e-mail from the hospital management, informing
      them of the study to be carried out so that, if they consider it appropriate, they can inform
      their patients.

      Intervention of the intervention and control group:

      Each volunteer will be assigned to an intervention group either to the control group (CG) or
      experimental group (EG).

      The control group and intervention group will receive the same multicomponent exercise
      program, based on specific literature for being an effective, safe and feasible training for
      both elderly people {{2091 Bouaziz, Walid 2016;}} {{2092 Fragala,M. S. 2019;}}, with or
      without frailty {{2093 Cadore, Eduardo L 2014;}} {{2094 Casas-Herrero, Alvaro 2019;}} {{2088
      Fernández-García, Ángel Iván 2020;}} and/or with osteoporosis {{2089 Moradell, Ana 2020;}}.
      The main difference between both groups is that the experimental group (EG) will perform the
      strength exercises with flow restriction (BFR) while the control group (CG) will not have any
      restriction.

      The periodicity of both groups will be 2 sessions per week, with a duration of 65 minutes per
      session and the duration of the intervention of 6 months and a follow-up 12 months after the
      beginning of the intervention (see scheme).

      The training will be supervised at all times by a physiotherapist with more than 10 years of
      experience in multicomponent exercise. The sessions will include both limb and trunk work and
      will have a clear functional objective, focusing on activities of daily living (ADL). Each
      session will work on all the basic physical abilities (strength, balance, endurance,
      flexibility and coordination) and will be divided into:

        -  10 minutes of initial warm-up. This is divided into 8 minutes walking on a treadmill or
           cyclohergometer with an intensity corresponding to 30% of heart rate reserve. Followed
           by 2 minutes of active mobilizations in both upper and lower extremities.

        -  20 minutes of strength exercises. These will be interspersed with the rest of the
           exercises and will include the different extremities and trunk. During the first month,
           training will be carried out with loads corresponding to 20% of 1 repetition maximum
           (RM) and from the second month onwards it will be increased to 30-35% of 1 RM.

        -  10 minutes of resistance exercises. These exercises will be interspersed with the rest
           to make the session much more enjoyable.

        -  10 minutes of coordination and balance exercises. These exercises will be interspersed
           with the rest of the activities.

        -  5 minutes of flexibility. These exercises will be performed interspersed with the
           strength and endurance exercises.

        -  5 minutes of return to calm and relaxation. To facilitate the monitoring of the
           researcher who will apply the intervention, each group will be subdivided into smaller
           groups (ratio of 5 subjects per researcher).
