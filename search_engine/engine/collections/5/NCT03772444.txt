      abdominal surgery, which leads to increased morbidity, prolonged hospitalization and
      increased healthcare cost. The pathogenesis of POI involves inflammation and oxidative
      stress, similar to ischemia/reperfusion injury that can be counteracted with beetroot juice.
      Beetroot juice is a source of inorganic nitrate, which by conversion of nitrate to nitrite in
      the body, exerts its protective effect. We before demonstrated in a preclinical model that
      administration of exogenous nitrite was shown to protect against POI. The aim of this pilot
      study is to investigate the possible protective effect of beetroot juice ingestion on POI
      following colorectal surgery.
