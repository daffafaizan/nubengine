      the first among women in Spain. It is also the type of cancer with the highest mortality.
      Several studies have assessed the effects of exercise performed in the neo-adjuvant period,
      but there is heterogeneity among them.

      Principal aim:

      To assess in women with triple-negative breast cancer receiving neo-adjuvant chemotherapy the
      effects of an intense physical exercise program (intervention group) on physical capacity,
      compared with a control group not meeting the minimum exercise recommendations of the World
      Health Organization (WHO).

      Secondary aims:

      To compare the following outcomes in both groups: body composition, and quality of life and
      depression/anxiety.
