        -  A 5-year, multicentre, prospective, randomized, open-label, controlled study

             -  Group 1: Simulect + cyclosporine + Myfortic + steroid stop at 3 months

                by everolimus) + Myfortic + steroid maintenance.

        -  In both groups MPA AUC monitoring will be done at 5-7 days and at 3 months, to ensure
           sufficient MPA protection.
