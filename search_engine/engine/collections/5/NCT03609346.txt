      treatment of STEMI patients. The objective is to capture patients' outcomes and
      antithrombotic strategies data using one or several BioFreedom Stents in the routine
      treatment of STEMI patients. This will be a fully observational post market registry designed
      to enroll 1000 STEMI patients at about 20 centers in up to 8 Asian countries where the
      BioFreedom BA9 (SS) DCS is available for clinical use.

      The primary endpoint is LTF, which is a composite of cardiac death, target vessel-related
      reinfarction, and ischemia-driven target-lesion revascularization.

      The investigators expect event rates of the composite of cardiac death, target vessel-related
      reinfarction, and ischemia-driven target-lesion revascularization to be 4.3% at one year as
      observed in the COMFORTABLE AMI study. Assuming a one-sided type I error (Î±) of 0.025, and a
      non-inferiority margin of 1.9%, a cohort of 1000 patients will have more than 80% power to
      conclude non-inferiority. The complete data analysis will be described in a Statistical
      Analysis Plan (SAP) that will be finalized and signed before the one year database lock.

      Primary and secondary endpoint related events will be adjudicated by independent
      adjudicators. The study will be monitored per a monitoring plan, data will be collected in an
      electronic data capture system.

      All enrolled patients will be followed up at 1, 4 and 12 months to collect information on
      their current status, review of cardiac medication taken and any adverse events that they
      have experienced.

      Both CERC and Biosensors will follow company SOP's which are GCP and ISO 14155:2011
      compliant.
