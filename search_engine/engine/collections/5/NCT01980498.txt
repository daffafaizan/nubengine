    
      Population: In and out patients with head and neck cancer undergoing radiotherapy, regardless
      of the day of the radiotherapy treatment, with or without chemotherapy and taking at least 60
      mg of oral morphine daily or an equianalgesic dose of another opioid to control background
      pain (background pain controlled is defined as NRS <4) but with uncontrolled pain at
      swallowing (moderate/severe intensity: â‰¥ 4 on a NRS 0-10).

      Study design: Patients that have signed the ICF and met inclusion and exclusion criteria are
      randomly assigned 1:1 to receive one of the following predictable BTP at swallowing
      treatments:

        1. Fentanyl pectin nasal spray (FPNS)

        2. Physician choice-Usual Care (PC-UC) Each patient will take the drug no more than 3
           episode a day (at main meals: breakfast, lunch and dinner) for 15 episodes in total in 6
           (-1, +2) consecutive days. At each episode the patients will record the pain at baseline
           (before drug administration), and 10, 20 30 minutes after taking FPNS or PC-UC.

      At each meal, if the administered dose of FPNS or PC-UC is not adequately effective on pain
      control, the patient is allowed to take a rescue medication of IRMS after 30 min from FPNS or
      PC-UC administration.
