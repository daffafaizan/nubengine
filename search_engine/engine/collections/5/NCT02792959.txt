      perspective to exploit multimodal data (fusion MRI/PET). The Sponsor would like to optimize
      the respective performances and to define the early assessment criteria, at the first detox,
      of the treatment efficacy, with and without antiangiogenic agent. It is a single center
      evaluation of the study treatment.
