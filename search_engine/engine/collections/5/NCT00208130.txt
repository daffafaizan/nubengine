      to the recently completed multi-site trials for sertraline conducted by Pearlstein and
      colleagues which found efficacy for women but not men suffering from chronic PTSD, there were
      only a handful of published randomized controlled trials. An overview of this literature
      suggests that tricyclic antidepressants, monoamine inhibitors and selective seratonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) show promise, usually with better responses in civilians with
      PTSD than in male veterans with combat-related PTSD. Although results from open-label studies
      of alpha-2 agonists, beta blockers, anticonvulsants, and mood stabilizing agents appear to be
      promising, at present no one agent has emerged as useful for a broad range of PTSD sufferers.

      This is a single-center, outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel
      group study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of topiramate in treating PTSD in
      civilian trauma. This study will be conducted in up to 60 subjects with a diagnosis of PTSD
      as defined by DSM-IV criteria. Thirty subjects will be assigned to topiramate and 30 will be
      assigned to placebo.
