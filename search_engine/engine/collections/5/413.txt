4088. the use of hypothermia and dehydration in the treatment of severecerebral hypoxiathe rational for using hypothermia orcerebral dehydration is to suppress or re-verse progressive or delayed cerebraldamage after hypoxia.  it is suggested thatdamage of this nature results from injuryto the astroglia and oligodendroglia,especially the former.  experimental andclinical evidence favors lowering of thebody temperature immediately after anyepisode of hypoxia accompanied by impor-tant damage to the brain.  the rationalfor using dehydration is insecure and itsresults are uncertain.  this treatmentshould probably be reserved for cases inwhich a raised cerebrospinal fluid pressurehas been proved, and in which othermeasures, especially hypothermia,are either not available or have failed.
