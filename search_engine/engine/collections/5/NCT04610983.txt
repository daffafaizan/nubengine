      docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) is associated with many health benefits including improved brain,
      heart, joint and eye health. However, <20% of the world's population consume adequate amounts
      of these fatty acids. Individuals who don't consume fish (major dietary omega-3 source) and
      particularly vegans/vegetarians are at greatest risk of omega-3 deficiency. Convenient
      strategies empowering consumers to increase their omega-3 intake have potential to
      significantly impact health outcomes. CSIRO's Food Program has developed a novel
      vegetable-based omega-3 encapsulant to be used as ingredient in various food products. Using
      algal oil as omega-3 source provides vegan/vegetarian options. However, it is unknown whether
      the vegetable-based carrier matrix will affect omega-3 bioavailability. As these products are
      intended for global markets, it is also unknown whether ethnic differences may affect omega-3
      bioavailability. This project forms part of a larger project aiming to develop sensorially
      and culturally acceptable food products that incorporate vegetable-encapsulated omega-3 oils
      to assist Australian and Singaporean consumers to achieve their omega-3 LCPUFA intake. This
      component of the project aims to compare the bioavailability of omega-3 from two test foods
      containing vegetable (cauliflower)-encapsulated algal oil (the "ingredient") against a
      control test product (algal oil gel capsules) across two ethnicities (Australian European vs.
      Chinese Singaporean). To achieve this, two clinical trials, following the same protocol, will
      be executed in both Australia (Australian European) and Singapore (Chinese Singaporean).
