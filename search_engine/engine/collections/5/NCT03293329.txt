    
      This study is a randomised controlled trial evaluating clinical effects of a diaphragm
      treatment, via manual release or active mobilization, comparing with a standard treatment of
      shoulder myofascial trigger points release.

      A description of the 3 groups of treatment:

        1. - Experimental group 1: 3 diaphragm stretching techniques according to Chaitow, Ward and
           Ricard, performed by a physical therapist are employed in this experimental group during
           10 minutes. The participants are situated in a seated, supine and side bending position.

        2. - Experimental group 2: diaphragm mobilization through active hipopressive gymnastic
           exercise according to Caufriez in two different postures.

        3. - Active comparator group: A ischemic compression technique in most painful myofascial
           trigger points in the infraespinatus and supraespinatus muscle during one minute each
           one.

      The shoulder flexion, abduction and external rotation range of motion will be assessed pre
      and postinterventions, as well as the pressure pain threshold with an algometer and the pain
      experienced by the individual in shoulder mobility with a Numerical Rating Scale.
