      (KMC) is a safe and effective method of warming; however, it is not always feasible, for
      example in settings such as resuscitation or clinical instability. Electric warmers are the
      standard of care in developed countries, but are extremely costly, complicated with risk of
      causing both hypo and hyperthermia with misuse, and often not reliable in settings without
      stable electricity. The Infant Warmer the investigators propose to study has previously been
      tested in 2 pilot studies totaling 204 uses, occurring in 2 district hospitals and 4 health
      centers in rural Rwanda.

      The combined results of these pilot studies were extremely encouraging. This study will be a
      stepped wedge prospective controlled trial in hospital setting to assess safety and efficacy
      of the Infant Warmer based on clinical observation, and feasibility based on observer audits.
      A total of 10 district hospitals will participate in the study. All 10 hospitals will start
      with a 2 week period of observation in which "pre" data will be collected. Hospitals will
      then receive the warmer and be transitioned to the "post" period at a rate of one every two
      weeks. The primary study aim is to assess the safety, efficacy and feasibility of the Infant
      Warmer as an addition to KMC, and to achieve and maintain euthermia when KMC is inadequate or
      unavailable. The study will be conducted across a wide range of district hospitals with
      control data coming from pre-intervention period and treatment data coming from post
      intervention period, with the intervention being the introduction of the Infant Warmer.
