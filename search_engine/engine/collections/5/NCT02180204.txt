    
      Patients presenting with symptoms of acute ischemic stroke (AIS) who present within 3 to 4.5
      hours of symptom onset and who meet the inclusion criteria for intravenous (IV) thrombolysis
      will receive, in a randomized, double-blind fashion, either IV Alteplase at 0.9 mg/kg per
      standard protocol or IV Tenecteplase at 0.25 mg/kg with saline infusion over one hour.
      Patients must also have no exclusion criteria for IV thrombolysis within the 3 to 4.5 hour
      window. The only required imaging is non-contrasted CT of the head. Patients will be
      monitored according to standard post-thrombolytic care. A CT of the head will be performed at
      24 hours based on standard protocol or if there is any neurological change. Neurological
      function at 24 hours using NIHSS and at 3 months based on modified mRS and the NIHSS.
