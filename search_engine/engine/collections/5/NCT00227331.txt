      (lower chest indrawing [LCI]). Oral amoxicillin, if found equally effective, could reduce
      referral, hospitalization, and treatment costs. We aimed to determine whether oral
      amoxicillin and parenteral penicillin were equivalent in the treatment of severe pneumonia in
      children aged 3-59 months.

      METHODS This multicentre randomized, open label equivalency study was conducted at tertiary
      care centres in 8 countries. Children aged 3-59 months with severe pneumonia were
      hospitalized for 48 hours and, if improved, discharged with a 5-day course of oral
      amoxicillin. Follow-up evaluation occurred at 5 and 14 days after enrolment. The primary
      outcome was treatment failure (persistence of LCI or new danger signs) at 48 hours. Analyses
      were by intention to treat and per protocol.

      RESULTS 1702 children were randomized to receive either oral amoxicillin (857) or parenteral
      penicillin (845) for 48 hours. Treatment failure was 19% in each group (risk difference -0.4;
      95% CI -4.2 to 3.3) at 48 hours, 22% (cumulative) in each group at 5 days, and 25% in each
      group at 14 days. Relapse at day 5 and 14 occurred in 45/1375 (3.4%) and 65/1330 (4.8%) of
      the children, respectively. Infancy (OR 2.72, 95% CI 1.95-3.79), very fast breathing (1.94,
      1.42-2.65) and hypoxia (1.95, 1.34-2.82) at baseline predicted treatment failure by
      multivariate analysis.

      CONCLUSIONS Injectable penicillin and oral amoxicillin are equivalent in the treatment of
      severe pneumonia in developing world areas in a controlled environment. Additional research
      is needed in a public health setting in rural and urban areas before these finding can be
      recommended for widespread implementation. Potential benefits of oral therapy for pneumonia
      include a decrease in the 1) the risk of needle-borne infections; 2) need for referral or
      hospitalization; 3) administration costs and 4) costs to the family. (word count 294).
