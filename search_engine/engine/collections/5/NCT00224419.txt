      over-the-counter (OTC) nicotine replacement therapy, choice of gum, lozenge or patch, (NRT)
      to promote prepartum smoking cessation. Proposed is a two-arm design. Eligible pregnant women
      (N=300) will be randomized to either: Arm 1, Tailored Cognitive Behavioral Treatment (TCBT,
      n=100) that provides women with customized risk information about smoking and nicotine, the
      potential harms to the fetus and encouragement of appropriate behavioral skills building; or
      Arm 2, TCBT + NRT - the tailored intervention incorporating NRT information plus choice of
      patch or gum (n=200). The intervention will include 5 face-to-face contacts as part of
      prenatal visits and 1 telephone counseling session. Primary outcome measures will be
      biochemically validated 7-day prevalent abstinence rates at the 19-27th and 29-37th week of
      pregnancy. Secondary outcomes will include 7-day prevalent abstinence rates at 12 weeks
      postpartum, serious quit attempts, compliance with NRT, and use of materials. Saliva cotinine
      will be measured among all women at baseline, the 27-35th week of pregnancy, and 12 weeks
      postpartum. The significance of this project is that it relies on transdisciplinary
      collaborations to extend the science in nicotine replacement therapies to a population that
      could derive substantial health benefits. Moreover, the study results have immediate
      potential to inform clinical recommendations for integrating nicotine replacement into
      prenatal care.
