      occurs in diverse ethnic groups worldwide. There is paucity of data on the use of topical and
      systemic medications in dark-skinned individuals. Unique issues in skin of color (SOC)
      populations, including increased risk of dyspigmentation (hyperpigmentation and
      hypopigmentation), make studies dedicated to darker skin types essential for treatment of
      psoriasis in these populations.

      This will be a single-center, open-label clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety
      of secukinumab in adults with skin types IV-VI with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. A
      total of 20 subjects (ages 18+, male and female, BSA ≥10%, PASI Score ≥ 12, IGA mod 2011
      score ≥ 3) are expected to complete this study, which will run for a total of up to 28 weeks.

      The study consists of two periods: Screening (from 0 to 4 weeks) and open-label treatment
      period (24 weeks). During the second period, a total of 20 subjects will receive secukinumab
      300mg subcutaneously. Those who meet all of the inclusion/exclusion criteria and are enrolled
      in the study will receive study drug for the entire treatment period.
