      prevalence has been estimated to range between 16.7% and 75.1% 2. In Chile, the prevalence is
      estimated to be 30% in Men and 50% in women, increasing as age increases. It is estimated
      that, of these cases, 44% have a duration of 6 months or more, giving rise to difficulties
      not only at work but also in daily life, at home, economically, even in emotional aspects.

      The most common symptom is pain in the neck region, which may be associated with restricted
      movement, dizziness, and manifestations of stress. A large proportion of movement of the
      cervical spine takes place in the C1-C2 segment, where up to 50% of the total rotation of the
      cervical spine occurs. There are several techniques to restore cervical mobility, but few of
      them comply with the guidelines of the IFOMPT (International Federation of Manual Orthopedic
      Therapists) on the safety and efficacy in the treatment of hypomobility of the upper cervical
      spine, avoiding positions at the end of the cervical range of motion, especially rotation and
      extension, and there is also limited scientific evidence of its effectiveness.

      The C0-C1 dorsal mobilization technique complies with these recommendations and have been
      used in previous studies, although there is no evidence of its effects on range of motion,
      activation of deep cervical musculature and pressure threshold in patients with chronic
      mechanical cervicalgia. Therefore, the objective of the present investigation is to determine
      the effects of the dorsal mobilization technique of the atlanto-occipital joint (C0-C1) as
      adjuvant treatments for Kinesitherapy in users with chronic cervical pain of mechanical
      origin and rotation deficit in the upper cervical spine.
