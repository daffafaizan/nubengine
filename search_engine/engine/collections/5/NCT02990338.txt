      days (or up to 28 days for women who can become pregnant). Participants continued study
      treatment until disease progression, unacceptable adverse reaction, participants' wish or
      other reason of discontinuation.

      During follow-up, participants who discontinued the study treatment due to progression of the
      disease were followed every 3 months (12 weeks) for survival (or until cut-off date), and
      participants who discontinued the study treatment prior to documentation of disease
      progression were followed-up every 4 weeks until disease progression, and then every 3 months
      (12 weeks) for survival (or until cut-off date).
