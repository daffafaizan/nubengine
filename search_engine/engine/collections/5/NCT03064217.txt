    
      The purpose of this prospective study is to evaluate clinical and radiographic outcomes of
      single unsplinted fixed restorations made with digital intraoral imaging in conjunction with
      clinical crown lengthening procedures (CLPs) compared ones fabricated by the conventional
      protocol.

      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate the clinical outcomes between the experimental group (the digital
      impression taking at clinical crown lengthening procedures) and the control group (the
      conventional protocol) Hypothesis: There will be no differences in clinical parameters around
      the teeth between the two groups.

      Approach: The investigators will conduct a prospective clinical study and will compare the
      changes in gingival recession, the width of keratinized gingiva, and pocket depths around the
      teeth between the two groups.

      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate the radiographic outcome between the experimental group and the
      control group Hypothesis: There will be no difference in crestal bone level around teeth
      between the two groups.

      Approach: The study will investigate the difference in crestal bone level around the teeth at
      baseline and 12 months between the two groups.
