    
      This was a double-blind, randomized, parallel group, dose-ranging, single-dose study. The
      study was conducted in male and female patients â‰¥40 years of age with OA of the knee.

      Approximately 300 patients with OA of the knee were randomized, using a centralized
      randomization procedure, to 1 of 3 treatment groups (1:1:1) and treated with a single IA
      injection of:

        -  16 mg FX006,

        -  32 mg FX006, or

        -  normal saline (placebo).

      Each patient was evaluated for a total of 24 weeks following a single IA injection. Following
      screening, safety and efficacy were evaluated at 7 out-patient visits (Days 1 [Baseline],
      Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, and 24).

      The study was expected to enroll over approximately 6 to 7 months.
