      Federal de São Paulo), Schizophrenia Program of Institute of Psychiatry PROJESQ (Universidade
      de São Paulo), CAISM (Centro de Atenção Integrada à Saúde Mental) from Irmandade Santa Casa
      de Misericórdia de São Paulo, and CAPS Luiz da Rocha Cerqueira, all in the city of São Paulo.
      Participants were randomly assigned to an intervention group or a standard care group using
      table of randomization from web site www.randomization.com. The patients' weights were
      recorded monthly. All patients were weighed in the morning, on the same scale, without shoes,
      with the individuals wearing light clothes. Waist was considered at the level of the navel.
      Measures were collected by the same investigator in all assessments. Body mass index (BMI)
      was calculated as the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters. The
      investigators recorded sociodemographic data, clinical data and physical exam (weight,
      height, BMI, waist circumference and blood pressure). Patients were diagnosed as having
      schizophrenia by the SCID-P (REF). Severity of the disease was assessed using PANSS, Calgary
      Depression Scale, CGI-S and CGI-I. GAF, ILSS-BR, and he following self-rated scales:
      WHOQoL-BREF, Rosenberg self-esteem scale, IPAQ, DINE and Fagerstrom were used to evaluate
      functionality (GAF), independent living skills (ILSS-BR), quality of life (WHOQoL-BREF), self
      esteem (Rosenberg self-esteem scale), physical activity (IPAQ- short version), fat and fibers
      ingestion (DINE), and smoking (Fagerstrom). Raters were kept blind for patient's treatment
      condition. Fasting glucose, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, triglycerides, insulin, and HOMA-IR
      index were assessed at baseline, and 3 months.
