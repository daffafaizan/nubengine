    
      This trial began as a 2-arm study with a docetaxel-alone arm. When bevacizumab became widely
      available, it was converted to a 1-arm open-label trial of docetaxel/bevacizumab. Patients
      enrolled in the docetaxel-alone arm were permitted to cross over to docetaxel/bevacizumab.
      Patients received bevacizumab 15 mg/kg and docetaxel 75 mg/m2 intravenously (I.V.) every 3
      weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or consent withdrawal.
