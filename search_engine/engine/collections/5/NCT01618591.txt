      ambulatory deployed personnel. Patients presenting for care will be clinically assessed and a
      determination made as to whether they have acute watery diarrhea (AWD) or acute
      dysentery/febrile diarrhea (ADF). For the AWD arm, patients will be randomized to receive 1
      of 3 regimens: (1) rifaximin 1650 mg as a single dose plus loperamide 4 mg initially followed
      by 2 mg after each unformed stool, not to exceed 16 mg/day for 2 days (120 subjects); (2)
      azithromycin 500 mg as a single dose plus loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after
      each unformed stool, not to exceed 16 mg/day for 2 days (120 subjects); or (3) levofloxacin
      500 mg as a single dose plus loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after each unformed
      stool, not to exceed 16 mg/day for 2 days (120 subjects).

      For the ADF arm, patients will be randomized to receive 1 of 2 regimens: (1) azithromycin
      1000 mg as a single dose plus loperamide 4 mg initially followed by 2 mg after each unformed
      stool, not to exceed 16 mg/day for 2 days (75 subjects); or (2) azithromycin 1000 mg as a
      single dose without loperamide (75 subjects).

      Study Procedures (Brief): Baseline exam as well as blood and stool samples will be collected
      at initial clinic visit. Clinical assessments will be performed at 24 hours, 72 hours, and 7
      days. In addition, microbiological cure will be evaluated at 7-d post initiation of
      treatment. Subjects will have blood drawn to assess for serological conversion to common
      enteric pathogens, and stool collected at 7- and 21-d . Subjects may also opt in for
      long-term follow-up at time of enrollment, which will assess for development of
      post-infectious functional bowel disorders. All subjects will complete a baseline assessment
      at 7-d visit, and those who opt for the additional follow-up will complete a series of
      web-based surveys at 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-m post enrollment.
