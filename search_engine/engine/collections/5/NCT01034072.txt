      order to enhance their quality of life. Studies have shown that many of these patients will
      go on to develop chronic issues within different organ systems. Because of the iron burden of
      the frequent transfusions required to care for these patients, iron overload may indeed be
      one of the problems these survivors potentially face. Research primarily in thalassemia and
      bone marrow transplant patients who were extensively transfused has shown that iron overload
      can have a significant impact on their overall health. Complications from increased iron
      burden can include growth retardation, gonadal dysfunction, hypothyroidism, impaired glucose
      metabolism, cardiac arrhythmias and failure, hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis, and increased
      susceptibility to infections. However all of these conditions related to iron overload can be
      prevented with the use of either phlebotomy or chelation therapy. Based on this knowledge,
      our objective is to determine if pediatric oncology and transplant patients heavily supported
      with transfusions develop consequential biochemical and clinical evidence of iron overload.
