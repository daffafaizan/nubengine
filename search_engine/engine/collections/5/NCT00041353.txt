        -  Compare specific biomarkers, including cellular morphology (cytology), proliferation
           index (Ki-67), p53 expression, and LOH in chromosome 9p at locus DS9157, in fine needle
           aspirate specimens from women at increased vs normal risk of breast cancer.

        -  Determine whether these specimens are adequate to perform the biomarker assays and
           whether this technique could be used in the general outpatient setting.

        -  Determine whether biomarker levels in these patients are concordant or discordant with
           individual clinical risk of breast cancer.

        -  Determine whether 1 or more biomarkers can distinguish high-risk from control patients.

        -  Correlate specific biomarkers and changes in biomarker levels with pathologic diagnosis
           from the breast biopsy.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo fine needle aspiration of normal appearing breast tissue prior to
      the beginning of elective surgery. Specimens are analyzed for the presence of specific
      biomarkers.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 156 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years.
