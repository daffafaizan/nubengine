      facilitate exposure of operative field during elective distal gastrectomy, however, whether
      it should be retained post-operatively is controversial. Nasogastric decompression tube helps
      to drain the gastric remnant in case there is edema around the gastrojejunostomy, ileus and
      delayed gastric emptying, which can theoretically relieve nausea and abdominal distension.
      However, nasogastric intubation could cause patients discomfort; also it has been shown that
      it would cause gastroesophageal reflux which may be associated with pulmonary complication.
