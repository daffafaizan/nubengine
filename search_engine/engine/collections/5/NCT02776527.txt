      and histologically verified as stage ⅢB or ⅢC according to the seventh edition of the TNM
      classification for gastric cancer. When these patients have completed 8 cycles of Xelox as
      adjuvant chemotherapy without any recurrence, they will randomly assigned to group A or B.
      Each group possesses 20 gastric cancer patients finally. Patients in group A will receive the
      best supportive care，and take Apatinib 500mg/qd orally, 28 days as a cycle, till disease
      progresses. Patients in group B will receive the best supportive care. Through follow-up and
      statistics, the investigators will observe whether Apatinib can improve the disease free
      survival (DFS) of gastric cancer patients with stage IIIb&IIIC. Meanwhile, the investigators
      also will observe whether the Apatinib can improve the overall survival (OS) and estimate the
      quality of life of patients have taken the Apatinib.
