      procedures and surgeries had leftover opioid medications with a mean use of about half the
      medications prescribed. A similar study in thoracic surgery patients reported similar results
      with 71% of patients admitting to taking half or less of their prescribed opioid medications.
      Recent advancements in cystectomy protocol have already shown promise with reducing hospital
      length of stay from eight to four days, including the simultaneous reduction of opioid
      analgesics for pain management, with 4.9 mg morphine equivalents per day when using enhanced
      recovery techniques compared to 20.67 mg in traditional care. Results of the current
      prospective study could further support these results and include low to no risk assessments
      and follow-up phone calls. This study is observational and involves consenting adult patients
      undergoing cystectomy to pre-operative assessments including the Self Administered
      Gerocognitive Exam (SAGE) questionnaire, a cognitive test to identify mild-moderate cognitive
      impairment, and collection of demographic data and medical history. Phone call follow-ups
      include assessments of post-discharge pain and opioid consumption, and completing verbally an
      adapted Activities of Daily Living questionnaire. No additional risks have been identified by
      participating in this study. Participants may not directly benefit from participating in this
      trial, but the data collected could provide valuable insight into the discrepancy between
      required opioid pain medications and opioid pain medication prescription for adequate pain
      management. This insight could then be applied to reevaluate post-discharge pain management
      procedures and standards of care, therefore curbing opioid use and abuse trends
