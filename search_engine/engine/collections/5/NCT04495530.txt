      and is usually given when a person does not have a working gut. This type of nutrition is
      managed by a team of healthcare professionals and requires regular monitoring, such as bloods
      tests, to allow the team to provide the right balance of nutrients to the individual patient.
      This is an important decision, and the benefits, risks and consequences of having this type
      of nutrition should be fully explained to the patient and carer, to make sure they can make
      an informed decision. The aim of this study is to find out what information both patients and
      carers feel they need to be able to make a decision to start, and a later date stop,
      parenteral nutrition, with a diagnosis of advanced (incurable) cancer.

      It is not clear if patients and carers get all the information they need before making this
      decision, and often the decision is made by a doctor and other healthcare professionals.
      However, patients and carers have a right to make decisions about their care. We will
      therefore interview patients and carers who have experience of making this decision, or in
      the process of making this decision, to find out what information is important to them. Our
      aim is to use the results from this research to improve the experience that patients and
      carers have in the future.
