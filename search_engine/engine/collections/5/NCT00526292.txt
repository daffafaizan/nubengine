    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the anti-leukemic efficacy of allogeneic HLA-haploidentical related natural
           killer (NK) cell infusion following a cytoreductive regimen with cyclophosphamide and
           fludarabine in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), myelodysplastic syndromes
           (MDS), or blastic CML who have relapsed following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
           transplant, where efficacy is defined as the achievement of complete or partial
           remission at one year following NK cell infusion.

      Secondary

        -  To assess treatment efficacy, as defined by achievement of complete or partial
           remission, at 3 and 6 months following HLA-haploidentical related NK cell infusion.

        -  To assess the effects of an HLA-haploidentical related NK cell infusion on the sustained
           engraftment and recovery of an HLA-matched stem cell allograft.

        -  To assess the risk of inducing graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) or altering its severity.

        -  To provide preliminary evidence that specific donor KIR-recipient HLA ligand
           combinations relating to missing self-MHC class I ligand or missing class I ligand are
           associated with higher NK alloreactivity and improved outcome.

        -  To monitor the extent and duration of NK cell donor chimerism.

        -  To monitor NK cell reconstitution through NK receptor cell surface phenotyping
           (CD94/NKG2A, ILT-2, KIR expression) and function (intracellular IFN-Î³, cytotoxicity) on
           day 15, 30, 60, 100, and 200 following the NK infusion and to correlate with outcome.

        -  To correlate the magnitude of NK effect with disease and known survival risk factors
           (time from allogeneic HSCT to relapse; < 6 months vs > 6 months).
