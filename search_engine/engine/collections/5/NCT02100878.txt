      have to complete one of the experimental condition: 1) a cycling exercise or 2) remaining
      sitting fpr one hour. after the one hour sitting station or the exercise bout, they will be
      asked to complete a computer task while and electroencephalogram will be recorded. This
      computer task consists in visual recognition of rare pictures compared to frequent ones
      (oddball method). at 1215 they will be offered ad libitum meals. At regular intervals through
