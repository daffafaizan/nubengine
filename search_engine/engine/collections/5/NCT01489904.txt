      bulbar amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, idiopathic hypersalivation,
      head and neck carcinomas, etc) frequently have lifelong issues with oral motor control that
      may present as eating, drinking difficulties, drooling and/or speech problems.

      Inadequate saliva control occurs in approximately 30% of patients with CP. Drooling usually
      caused by swallowing dysfunction and can lead to choking, salivary aspiration, pneumonia,
      chest infections,chronic irritation of the facial skin, and /or dehydration, in some cases
      the person loss of self esteem and impede community inclusion.

      Numerous therapies, anticholinergic medication, surgery, etc, have all been used to reduce
      drooling with varying side effects and degrees of success, but none with optimal results.

      Systemic anticholinergics may reduce salivary secretion but are frequently not tolerated by
      the patients because they have multiple side effects. Recently Botulinum toxin type A has
      been used in the treatment of sialorrhea, in clinical studies have found that botulinum toxin
      type-A may have a good response with fewer side effects.
