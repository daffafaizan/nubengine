      outpatient clinics. Three different methods have been planned to identify suitable patients
      in this study: from the outpatient clinics, through advertisements and therapist referrals to
      the study. All willing participants will be screened against the study selection criteria.
      Eligible participants will be provided with a pre-approved information sheet and verbal
      explanation about the study before obtaining written consent. The consenting patients will be
      requested to fill in the baseline questionnaire. The patients will be requested to fill the
      follow up questionnaire after six months from their baseline data collection via an online,
      telephone or paper-based questionnaire depending on their preference. Data required for the
      necessary agreement between paper-based and online or telephone survey, will be collected
      from up to 60 participants within two weeks from their baseline data collection. All patients
      will receive and continue their normal treatment as recommended by their primary care team. A
      participant may be withdrawn by the investigators, involved in major trauma or undergoes
      surgery, or a female participant becomes pregnant during the course of the study. Sample size
      was estimated using G*Power (version 3.1.5). The statistical analyses will be performed using
      a statistical software (IBM SPSS 22) with statistical significance set at p<0.05 for the
      entire analysis, unless mentioned. Descriptive statistics, interclass correlation
      coefficients, Bland-Altman limits of agreement plots, significance testing, correlations and
      regression analyses will be employed.
