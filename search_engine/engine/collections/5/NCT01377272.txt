      programs focusing on risk groups and behavior have been undertaken. However, the risk factors
      of HIV transmission are not only at individual level (eg: demographic, behavior, and genetic
      risk factors), socioeconomic and environmental factors also take important roles. In Taiwan,
      few researches explored the spatial distribution of HIV infection. Studies in other countries
      observed a significant geographic variation in HIV infection. To understand the spatial
      pattern of HIV infection in depth, the present study aims to retrospectively investigate the
      epidemiological and geographic characteristics of HIV infection using the medical records
      database of National Taiwan University Hospital. A Geographic information system (GIS) and
      spatial statistics will be used to analyze the geographic patterns to determine whether
      spatial dispersion or clustering. There are two aims of this study. One is to investigate the
      epidemiology of HIV infection in Taipei City. The second is to analyze the spatial
      characterizes of HIV infection, including disease mapping, geographic correlation studies,
      and identifying the presence of HIV clusters and their potential spatial risk factors. In
      addition, we want to examine whether there are different distributions between different
      classificatory groups. Finally, we hope that our findings would give some direction for local
      health and policy planners to improve the HIV intervention and prevention strategies
