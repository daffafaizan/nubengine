      TAK-788 following single microdose of 50 mcg [14C]-TAK-788 and single oral administration of
      160 mg TAK-788 and will assess the mass balance and metabolic profile of TAK-788 in plasma,
      urine, and feces following a single oral administration of 160 mg [14C]-TAK 788 solution, and
      will characterize the PK of TAK-788 and its metabolites in plasma, whole blood, and urine,
      and total radioactivity concentration equivalents in plasma and whole blood following a
      single dose of 160 mg [14C]-TAK-788.

      The study will enroll approximately 6 participants. The study is designed to consist of 2
      periods: Period 1 (ABA study period) and Period 2 (ADME study period). In Period 1, all
      participants will receive single unlabeled oral 160 mg dose of TAK-788 as capsules. Post oral
      dosing, participants will receive 15-minute intravenous infusion of a microdose of 50 mcg
      (approximately 2mcCi) [14C]-TAK-788. In Period 2, participants will receive single dose of
      160 mg (approximately 100 mcCi) [14C]-TAK-788 as an oral solution.

      This single center trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to
      participate in this study is approximately 65 days including screening period. Participants
      will be contacted approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug for a follow-up
      assessment.
