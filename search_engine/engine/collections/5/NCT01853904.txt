      will be wedged in the airway leading to that segment and 100mL of saline will be instilled
      into the selected segment and collected via the syringe based or channel based suction. Prior
      to unwedging, another 100mL of saline will be instilled into the same segment and will be
      collected using the alternative method. There will not be randomization, but the
      investigators will alternate which method is used first to eliminate confounding variables.
      All patients will receive both modalities of suctioning. The wall suction used for the
      channel suction will be set at 80 mm Hg. Syringe based suctioning will be performed with 20mL
      syringe. Total amount of fluid collected will be recorded and samples will be sent for cell
      count and differential as well as Gram stain and culture. Results of the two techniques will
      then be compared to determine which is the superior suctioning modality for BAL.
