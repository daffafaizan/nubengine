      service integration package (BRIDGE) that may be scaled up in Kazakhstan's vast network of
      needle-syringe programs (NSPs) for PWID. This package includes low threshold strategies of
      peer-driven recruitment, HIV counseling and rapid testing (HCT) in NSPs conducted by HIV care
      clinic nurses, and ARTAS, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's highly effective case
      management strategies for linking PWID to HIV care. BRIDGE is systematically designed to
      address specific service barriers to testing PWID for HIV, linking them to HIV care, and
      promoting ART (antiretroviral therapy) initiation. This study will employ an innovative
      stepped wedge design to evaluate implementation and effectiveness of BRIDGE on improving
      linkage to HIV care and initiation of ART in 24 NSPs located in 4 geographically disparate
      Kazakhstani cities using site-level data collected from NSPs and HIV clinics. Investigators
      will conduct a longitudinal panel study with a random sample of HIV-positive PWID (N=600)
      from four cities in Kazakhstan using repeated assessments at baseline, 6-, and 12-months
      follow-up. This study will employ mixed methods to identify multi-level structural,
      community, and organizational factors that influence the implementation and effectiveness of
      BRIDGE and the cost of BRIDGE, examining implications for cost-effectiveness, feasibility of
      expansion, and sustainability. The study builds on the investigative team's extensive HIV
      intervention research among PWID in Kazakhstan in collaboration with the Republican AIDS
      Center over the past decade. It addresses implementation research questions to improve and
      integrate HIV service delivery systems for PWID that are not only important to the region,
      but have relevance to other countries that have concurrent injection drug use and HIV
      epidemics.
