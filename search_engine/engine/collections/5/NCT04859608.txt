    
      Eculizumab is a very expensive drug (450 000 euros per year per patient). According to the
      usual administration scheme, the eculizumab is administrated by intravenous infusion, every
      14 or 21 days in hospital. Studies have shown the possibility of extending the administration
      intervals in patients with a high concentration of eculizumab.

      A personalized spacing of eculizumab infusions, based on a therapeutic drug monitoring, is
      expected to improve the patient's quality of life and lead to substantial savings.

      For these reasons, the objective of this study is to explore the efficiency of a personalized
      spacing of eculizumab infusions compared to the usual administration scheme (without
      personalization) from the French health Insurance perspective. The efficiency will be
      assessed by estimating the incremental cost per QALY (Quality-Adjusted Life Year) gained at
      18 months (duration of follow-up in the clinical trial) and at 5 years thanks to a Markov
      model.

      The total duration of the study is 24 months (6 months of enrolment and 18 months of
      follow-up).
