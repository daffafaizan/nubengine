      transplant including extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), busulfan, and fludarabine in
      patients with leukemia, lymphoma, and certain non-malignant diseases. The current reduced
      intensity protocol includes busulfan, fludarabine, and anti-thymocyte immunoglobulin. ECP is
      currently used in diseases such as chronic GVHD and cutaneous T cell lymphoma. The mechanism
      of ECP has not been defined. It is hypothesized that exposure of white blood cells to
      ultraviolet light with 8-methoxypsoralen initiates an apoptotic cellular cascade. Apoptotic
      cells are recognized and removed by the reticuloendothelial system, initiating the secretion
      of anti-inflammatory cytokines and the reduction of proinflammatory cytokines. Antigen
      presenting cells then regulate immune responses through the induction of tolerance.

      Here we incorporate the use of ECP, fludarabine, and busulfan in the preparative regimen,
      followed by ECP as prophylaxis for acute graft versus host disease. We hypothesize that
      photopheresis is safe and feasible, and patients will have similar rates of engraftment with
      less GVHD as those treated with current reduced intensity protocols. The use of ECP prior to
      transplant provides immunosuppression promoting host engraftment. Furthermore, the
      introduction of ECP following transplant may be able to induce tolerance thereby reducing
      rates of GVHD.
