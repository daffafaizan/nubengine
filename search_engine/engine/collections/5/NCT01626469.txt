      (OA) blood flow. In addition, we will study both the eye and kidney response to ACE
      inhibition compared to placebo while controlling salt intake in subjects with Type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.

      We hypothesize that salt intake will affect OA blood flow.

      We will initially look at both eye and renal response to subjects on a low salt diet (10mEq
      Na/day) followed by response to high salt diet (200mEq Na/day). In addition, we may look at
      eye response while subjects consume their regular diet.
