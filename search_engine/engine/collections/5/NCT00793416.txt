      study. Patients will be enrolled if they have Hydrocephalus or IIH, present with symptoms of
      shunt obstruction and will need to undergo shunt patency test and an MRI along with standard
      of care radionuclide study. The ShuntCheck study will be conducted in a clinic, doctor's
      office or in an emergency room by the treating physician or by trained health care
      professionals.

      Also, patients who are found with shunt obstruction as diagnosed by Radionuclide study will
      undergo shunt revision and the findings of the study will be correlated with operative
      findings. Post Shunt replacement patients who also receive adjustable valve will be evaluated
      with shunt Check, before and after adjustment of valves to detect changes in flow as detected
      by shunt check.

      This is an exploratory study to determine how a non-invasive device can assist in detection
      of presence of flow in these patients.

      Approximately 20 subjects will be enrolled in a single site in this proof of concept,
      physician sponsored study. An approved, commercial device will be available to the site prior
      to start of the study.
