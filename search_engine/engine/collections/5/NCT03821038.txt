    
      Lymphopenic sepsis Patients will be randomized 3:1 to receive either:

      a) Intravenous (IV) administration of CYT107 at 10 Î¼g/kg twice a week for 3 weeks or b) IV
      placebo (normal saline).

      The effect of CYT107 on Lymphocyte and various T cell populations will be documented with a
      focus on the first 29 days.

      Stopping rules will apply if ALC increases to >2.5 times the upper limit of normal range.

      The IRIS-7C & D studies will be conducted at multiple sites in France and the United States.
      All sites will use the same study design and similar study protocol for a common statistical
      analysis of 40 evaluable participants.
