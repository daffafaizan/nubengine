    
      The Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway plays a prominent role in controlling several key cellular
      functions including growth, proliferation and survival. B-Raf is a member of the
      Ras/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway and is frequently mutated in melanoma resulting in activation of the
      MAPK pathway. RAF265 is a novel, orally active, small molecule with potent inhibitory
      activity against B-Raf kinase and additional antiangiogenic activity through inhibition of
      vascular endothelial growth factor receptor type 2 (VEGFR-2) in non-clinical studies.

      The primary objectives of this study are to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), dose
      limiting toxicities (DLTs), and the safety profile of RAF265 when administered orally to
      subjects with locally advanced or metastatic melanoma; to determine the plasma
      pharmacokinetics (PKs) of orally administered RAF265; and to evaluate potential
      pharmacodynamic effects of RAF265 using tumor biopsies, peripheral blood samples, and tumor
      imaging.
