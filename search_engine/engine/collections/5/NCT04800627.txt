      I. Determine safety and phase II dose of pevonedistat in combination with pembrolizumab.
      (Phase I) II. To assess the efficacy of pevonedistat in combination with pembrolizumab in
      patients with dMMR/MSI-H cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess additional efficacy endpoints of the combination of pevonedistat and
      pembrolizumab in dMMR/MSI-H cancers.

      II. To assess the safety of pevonedistat and pembrolizumab in the dMMR/MSI-H patient cohort.

      III. To assess the pharmacodynamics impact of pevonedistat and pembrolizumab on tumor and
      immune-related components.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Immune context evaluation of tumor microenvironment. II. Determine clinical benefit. III.
      Evaluate pevonedistat pharmacokinetics and resistance mechanisms in combination therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of pevonedistat followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive pevonedistat intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on days 1, 3, and 5, and
      pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3-6 months.
