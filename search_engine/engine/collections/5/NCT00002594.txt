        -  Determine the response and progression-free survival in patients with recurrent
           medulloblastoma or CNS germ cell tumors treated with intensive melphalan and
           cyclophosphamide followed by autologous bone marrow and/or peripheral blood stem cell
           rescue.

        -  Determine the acute and delayed toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Autologous bone marrow and/or peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested.
      Patients then receive intensive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -8 to -5 and
      melphalan IV over 15 minutes on days -4 to -2. Bone marrow is reinfused on day 0. PBSC are
      reinfused on day 0 if used alone or on day 1 if used after autologous bone marrow
      transplantation (ABMT). Sargramostim (GM-CSF) is administered IV over 2 hours daily beginning
      4 hours after ABMT and continuing until blood counts recover.

      Patients are followed every 6 months through year 4 and then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
