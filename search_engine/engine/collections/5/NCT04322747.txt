      surgeries (Hilmi et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2014). Recently, it has been shown that surgical
      drilling may have a temporary effect on the amplitude of the otoacoustic emissions of the ear
      contralateral to the surgical site (Baradaranfar et al., 2015; Shenoy et al., 2015), however
      the temporary effects of surgical noise or vibration on the hearing of the non-surgical
      related ear needs to be better quantified. This study aims to to measure the potential
      effects of surgical drilling noise and/or vibration exposure on the hearing in the non
      operative ear, during surgical site during skull-based or mastoid surgeries. As part of the
      study patient will receive Audiometry for extended high frequencies, DPOAE, ECochG before and
      after the procedure.
