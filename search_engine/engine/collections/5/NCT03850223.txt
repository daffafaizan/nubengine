      during intrauterine development, irrespective of the age at presentation. The cause of most
      congenital heart defects is still unknown. Many cases of congenital heart disease are
      multifactorial and result from a combination of genetic predisposition and an environmental
      stimulus. A small percentage of congenital heart lesions are related to known chromosomal
      abnormalities, in particular, trisomy 21, 13, and 18 and Turner syndrome. Of all cases of
      congenital heart disease, 2-4% are associated with known environmental or adverse maternal
      conditions and teratogenic influences, including maternal diabetes mellitus, phenylketonuria,
      systemic lupus erythematosus or congenital rubella syndrome; and maternal ingestion of drugs
      (lithium, ethanol, warfarin, antimetabolites, vitamin A derivatives, anticonvulsant agents).
