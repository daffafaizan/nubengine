      allow for hypothesis generation in future research as well as give NICHD investigators and
      trainees hands on experience related to the diagnoses, management, treatment and follow-up of
      reproductive endocrine disorders. Such disorders include but are not limited to Polycystic
      ovarian syndrome, Endometriosis, Primary ovarian insufficiency, Recurrent pregnancy loss,
      Primary amenorrhea and Infertility. This information will be taken from standard medical
      care/procedures and follow up of patients and healthy volunteers. It allows investigation
      into the problems of these patients for the purpose of furthering general knowledge and
      teaching.
