      groups as exercise and control. Balance and walking exercises consisting of 3 days a week for
      6 weeks will be given to both groups as a home program. In addition, the exercise group will
      receive TOT-based telerehabilitation via video conferencing 3 days a week for 6 weeks. TOT
      will be formed from daily life activities such as reaching out, grasping, writing, and manual
      skills, which are frequently used in daily life. As the outcome measures, disease severity
      and disability, finger and hand function, hand strength, and quality of life will be
      evaluated.
