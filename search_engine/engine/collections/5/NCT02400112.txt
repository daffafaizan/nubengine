      Local administration of 1 gram of vancomycin powder at the site of primarily closeable
      Gustilo-Anderson Grade I-IIIA open fractures at the time of surgery, in addition to
      clinically accepted open fracture management (intravenous antibiotics, surgical irrigation
      and debridement and stabilization), will significantly decrease the postoperative infection
      rate in comparison to the current treatment algorithm.

      Methods:

      Study subjects will be randomized to one of two groups prior to surgery (parallel group
      design): standard treatment (control group) versus vancomycin powder treatment (experimental
      group). Each group will have an equal number of subjects. Once randomized, the intervention
      is then un-blinded to facilitate treatment.

      Post-operatively, all patients will receive intravenous antibiotics, such that all patients
      receive a total of 24 hours of intravenous antibiotics. The surgical drain will be removed at
      the patient's bedside approximately 24 hours after the surgical procedure. Patients will
      follow up with their surgeon for routine scheduled visits at approximately 2 weeks, 6 weeks,
      12 weeks, and further until aseptic union or resolution of infection. There will be no
      additional appointments solely for the purpose of research follow-up.
