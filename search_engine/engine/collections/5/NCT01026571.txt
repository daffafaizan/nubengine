      aortic valve disease and why individual genetics seem to play such an important role in
      generation of this disease.

      If you have, or have had, a bicuspid aortic valve, we seek your help in this effort by
      volunteering to donate DNA to the BAV Registry, so that this disease can be better understood
      and therapies for it can be developed.

      The BAV Registry is comprised of patients who have donated DNA collected from saliva (spit)
      and have provided us with personal health information that tells us about their bicuspid
      aortic valve.

      Individuals in the Registry have signed the consent form, filled out the medical history
      questionnaire and the authorization form, and provided DNA via our saliva sample kits.

      We will send you the requisite forms so that you receive the most up-to-date information
      about the study as older forms may be outdated. We also need paper copies of the forms;
      therefore, we send all the forms via ground mail along with a pre-paid return envelope for
      your convenience.
