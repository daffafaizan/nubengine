      to improve these results with therapy intensification have shown modest effect on disease
      free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). Recent studies with addition of sorafenib and
      cediranib revealed promising effect on tumor response with acceptable toxicity. Regorafenib
      is a multi tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) with a broad mechanism of action. Therefore this
      trial investigates if similar results can be achieved as with sorafenib or cediranib.

      The objective of the dose escalation part is to determinate safety, tolerability and the
      recommended dose. The objective of the expansion cohort is to assess the efficacy and to
      further characterize safety and tolerability of the therapy.
