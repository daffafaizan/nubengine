      will be performed with cryoprobe (ErbokryoÂ®). The patient undergoing the procedure will be
      intubated, sedated and relaxed under continuous monitoring (pulse oximetry, blood pressure,
      heart and respiratory rate), oxygen therapy with high flows and surveillance by
      anesthesiologist. The site where the biopsies will be performed will be determined based on
      an imaging study (chest x-ray and / or CT scan). The procedure will be performed according to
      the conventional technique, keeping the patient in apnea during the time that the
      cryobiopsies are taken to reduce the risk of pneumothorax. At most 6 samples will be
      obtained, and each one will be placed in an individual container listed in order of
      extraction. Bronchoalveolar lavage (3 aliquots of 30 mL sterile saline solution) will be
      performed in the same hemithorax. The samples obtained will be evaluated morphologically and
      sent to a microbiological and histopathological study, which will include a cell count. The
      data obtained will be coded.
