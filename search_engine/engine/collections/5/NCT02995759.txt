    
      The purpose of this study is the creation, implementation, and analysis of a seizure action
      plan, an intervention aimed to guide daily medication use, outline pre-hospital seizure first
      aide and rescue medication use, and direct emergency personnel in patients' individualized
      status epilepticus medication algorithm, with implementation through the electronic medical
      record. After creation of the action plan, the primary neurologist and patient/caregiver will
      create a patient-specific plan. The action plan will be reviewed and updated as necessary at
      each regularly scheduled primary neurology clinic visit. Two studies will aim at analyzing
      the effectiveness of this intervention. A prospective observational cohort study of patient
      care process and outcomes 18 months before and 18 months after initiation of seizure action
      plan will analyze patients with status epilepticus requiring hospital admission and/or status
      epilepticus that occurs during admission at BCH and measure rescue medication prescription
      and application patterns, timeliness of medication administration during SE, use of
      appropriately dosed AEDs, rate of intubation, significant hypotension, allergic reaction, and
      other adverse events, and hospital length of stay and rate of ICU admissions. A second
      prospective observational cohort study of patient outcome variables 18 months before and 18
      months after initiation of a seizure action plan obtained through parent-reported ICISS
      (Integrated Clinical Information Sharing System)/Trivox data, a web-based platform for
      tracking symptoms and response to therapy, will measure rescue medication prescription and
      application patterns, interval seizure frequency, effect on patient and parent quality of
      life, parent knowledge of AED regimen, and parent self-reported medication adherence.
