      recipients on Tac, MMF, prednisone maintenance immunosuppression will undergo renal biopsy at
      3-4 months post-transplantation and will be randomized to either a) Remain on Tac, MMF and
      prednisone (CNI-maintenance) or b) switch the Tac to SRL and continue MMF and prednisone. We
      will then compare biopsy derived measures of allograft fibrosis (CADI, Sirius Red, Banff
      Chronicity Index) and GFR in the two groups
