    
      This is a blinded, single-center, prospective study in patients during surgery, requiring use
      of neuromuscular blockade. Neurostimulation will be used to monitor objective responses, as
      per current clinical routine. Data collection of Tetragraph EMG responses will be unavailable
      to the clinician for clinical decision-making, as per current clinical routine, but will be
      stored on the interfaced SD card.
