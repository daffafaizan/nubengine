      anesthesiologists usually pay attention to maintain adequate cuff pressure, especially just
      after completion of tracheal intubation. Recently, esophageal stethoscope is widely used for
      exact monitoring of patient's body temperature. However, inserting of foreign body in
      esophagus could affect on the cuff pressure.

      The goal of this prospective observational study is to investigate the effect on esophageal
      stethoscope insertion on tracheal cuff pressure.
