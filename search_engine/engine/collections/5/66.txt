urinary steroid estimations in the prediction of response toadrenalectomy or hypophysectomy .a clinical trial has been carried out to test the use of thediscriminant in assessing the suitability of patients with advancedbreast cancer for hypophysectomy or adrenalectomy .patients with positive discriminants submitted to hypophysectomy havea much better prognosis than patients with negative discriminantssubmitted to adrenalectomy .patients selected for adrenalectomy because of negative discriminantshave a significantly worse response to the operation than patientsselected by random sample .patients selected for hypophysectomy because of positive discriminantstend to have a better response to the operation than do patientsselected by random sample, but the difference is not significant .adrenalectomy is not recommended for patients with negativediscriminants .
