      prevalent in middle age.33 It is usually accompanied by a substantial effect on daily life,
      resulting in an extensive use of health care resources.

      Several physical therapy applications such as massage therapy, kinesio taping, thermal and
      electrophysiological agents, hydrotherapy/spa therapy, and therapeutic exercises especially
      neck stabilization exercise are used to manage FM. Both massage therapy and kinesio taping
      have a favorable effect on clinical symptoms. However, it is not clear which method is more
      effective. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the effectiveness of massage and Kinesio
      taping on pain, range of motion, disability and quality of life in patients with chronic neck
      pain.
