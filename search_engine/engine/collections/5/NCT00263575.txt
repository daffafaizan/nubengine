      long-term safety of EN3267 in the treatment of BTcP in opioid-tolerant cancer patients. The
      study was conducted in 2 parts:

        1. A Titration Period during which patients had up to 2 weeks to determine a single,
           effective dose of study medication (EN3267) for adequate treatment of BTcP, and

        2. A maintenance Period of up to 12 months in which episodes of BTcP were treated with
           study medication.
