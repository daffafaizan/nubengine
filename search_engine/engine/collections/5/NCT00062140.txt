        -  Determine a safe and reproducible method of adjusting the dose of cyclophosphamide based
           on its metabolism when given in combination with total body irradiation and
           hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancy.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Preparative regimen: Patients undergo total body irradiation twice daily on days -6 to
           -4. Patients then receive dose-adjusted (based on metabolism) cyclophosphamide IV over 1
           hour on days -3 and -2.

        -  Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) infusion: Patients undergo allogeneic HSC transplantation
           on day 0.

      Patients receive graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, CNS prophylaxis, and testicular
      irradiation as per institutional standard practices.

      Patients are followed daily until day 80 after transplantation and then regularly thereafter
      for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
