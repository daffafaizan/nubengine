    
      The purpose of the Lymphatic Anomalies Registry, created at Boston Children's Hospital, is to
      create a database to help current and future patients diagnosed with a lymphatic anomaly. The
      ultimate goal of the registry is to better understand and predict responses to therapies and
      risk factors for complications. Although the Lymphatic Anomalies Registry exists at Boston
      Children's Hospital, patients can be entered into the registry regardless of whether or not
      they visit Boston Children's Hospital, thus increasing the program's accessibility. The
      Lymphatic Anomalies Registry includes patients who have vascular anomalies with a lymphatic
      component across various diagnoses. From the patient's perspective, participation in the
      Lymphatic Anomalies Registry means taking part in a short, thirty minute interview, and
      providing the registry with access to medical records. The interview is conducted verbally
      with study staff of the Lymphatic Anomalies Registry, and can take place either at the
      hospital, or over the phone. During the interview, the registry will inquire about the
      patient's diagnosis, disease features, medical therapies, and procedures. Interested
      prospective patients will receive an introductory packet from the registry with information
      on how to proceed in the registry process. All obtained patient information is housed on a
      secure, HIPPA compliant, internal database, managed by Boston Children's Hospital staff.
      Patient information entered into the external database is de-identified. The research teams
      will also obtain a medical record release form to request the patient's medical record for
      review in our study.
