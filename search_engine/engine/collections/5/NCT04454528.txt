    
      This is a Phase 1b/2 trial employing a Simon Two Stage design to evaluate the safety,
      feasibility, and efficacy (defined as 10% increase in Ki67+ peripheral CD8 T cells
      post-treatment) of a single pembrolizumab infusion with or without radiation boost prior to
      definitive surgery in patients with operable breast cancer. The study has four arms. Arms 1
      and 2 differ by the order of radiation boost and pembrolizumab administration. In arm 3,
      patients will receive pembrolizumab alone. A minimum of 6 patients will be enrolled in the
      safety run-in portion of the study. An additional 30 patients will be enrolled once
      pembrolizumab with the combination radiation is considered feasible and additional funding is
      available. Arm 4 represents our control arm in which patients will follow usual care but will
      be consented for blood/tissue collection using a separate protocol (Penn IRB 801539).
