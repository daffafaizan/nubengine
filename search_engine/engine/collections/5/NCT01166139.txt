      (Tasigna) will be for patients diagnosed with Systemic Sclerosis. Systemic Sclerosis
      (scleroderma) is an autoimmune disease that can involve the skin, the blood vessels, the
      muscles and other connective tissues, and major organs including the lungs, kidneys,
      gastrointestinal tract, and heart. The exact cause of this disorder is not known at this time
      and no drug has been proven to cure scleroderma. Experiments done in animal models and
      "test-tube" models of fibrosis suggest that Nilotinib may be a useful therapy for
      scleroderma. Nilotinib is a medication on the market which has been FDA approved for the
      treatment of a type of leukemia called chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It is an oral
      medication, taken two times a day.

      This is a 32 week, open-label, Phase IIa, single center clinical trial. The primary goal of
      the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of Nilotinib in patients with scleroderma.
      The secondary goal is to assess how effective Nilotinib is in treating patients with
      scleroderma. The clinical tests performed such as the Modified Rodnan Skin Score, Pulmonary
      Function Tests, Echocardiograms, Electrocardiograms, and the blood and skin collected in this
      study will help determine whether this therapy is safe and effective, and also improve our
      understanding of scleroderma.
