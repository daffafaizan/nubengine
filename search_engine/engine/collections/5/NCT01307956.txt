      I. To determine the pathologic complete response rate of a modified FOLFOX-6 regimen
      (leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and oxaliplatin) given with panitumumab at two-week
      intervals x 4 cycles in combination with external beam radiation therapy for patients with
      locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicities and ability to complete the planned treatment. II. To
      determine the achieved steady-state plasma concentrations of 5-FU (fluorouracil) and
      correlate these with clinical toxicity.

      III. To assess the potential importance of polymorphic variations in genomic deoxyribonucleic
      acid (DNA) of pertinent genes whose protein products are the targets of the anti-neoplastic
      drugs used in the clinical protocol on response and toxicity to therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive panitumumab intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive
      oxaliplatin IV and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours, and fluorouracil IV continuously over
      46 hours on day 1 (FOLFOX chemotherapy). Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Within 24 hours of the start of
      chemotherapy, patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients then
      undergo surgery within 6-8 weeks after completion of radiation therapy. Patients with
      residual disease receive 4 additional courses of FOLFOX chemotherapy on days 1, 15, 29, and
      42.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then annually thereafter.
