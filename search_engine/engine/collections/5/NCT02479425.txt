      the mainstay in most preventive measures, there is no evidence to recommend specific turning
      regimen.

      Aim of the study:

      The aim of this study was designed to evaluate the comparative impact of the two points
      repositioning in lateral lying position on the right and left versus the traditional three
      points repositioning on the right, back, and left in the occurrence of bed sores.

      Patients:

      This study was conducted on 150 patients admitted to the critical care department of
      Alexandria Main University Hospital after obtaining an informed consent from their relatives.

      The investigators excluded patients who: have active or healed bed sores.

      Patients were randomly divided into two groups by allocated randomization:

        -  Group 1: traditional three points rotation.

        -  Group 2: two points rotation.

      Methods:

      The studied patients were subjected to:

      Complete history taking, physical examination, primary ICU diagnosis, routine laboratory
      investigation and recording Glasgaw coma scale (GCS), use of sedation, vasopressors and
      mechanical ventilation

      Patients in group 1 nursed by traditional protocol [ two hours on the right side in 30 degree
      lateral position, two hours on the back and two hours on the left side in 30 degree lateral
      position] Patients in group 2 nursed in lateral position with 30 degree two hours on the
      right and two hours on the left with elevation of the head of bed by 30 degree in the two
      groups.

      both groups were monitored for bed sores incidence, timing and sites of occurence
