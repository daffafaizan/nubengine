      marrow transplantation given as consolidation therapy to patients with inflammatory or
      metastatic carcinoma of the breast in complete remission. All patients entered will receive
      induction therapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil with
      hormonal synchronization utilizing tamoxifen and premarin as in a previous Medicine Branch
      protocol (MB-160C). Among patients with inflammatory carcinoma of the breast, pathologic
      complete responders will receive irradiation to the breast and regional lymph nodes;
      convertible partial responders and clinical complete responders with residual disease on
      biopsy will undergo surgical resection of bulk disease followed by irradiation of the chest
      wall and regional lymph nodes excluding the axilla. Both groups of responders will be
      randomized to receive either systemic consolidation therapy with high dose melphalan (180
      mg/M2 total dose over 3 days) and autologous bone marrow transplantation followed by
      maintenance therapy or maintenance therapy alone. Complete responders in this noninflammatory
      group will not receive further therapy since, historically, they have done well following
      induction and local therapy, with maintenance therapy alone.

      Patients with metastatic breast cancer will be assessed for response throughout induction
      therapy. Complete and convertable partial responders will receive consolidative therapy and
      be randomized to ABMT followed by 6 months of maintenance therapy vs. maintenance alone.
