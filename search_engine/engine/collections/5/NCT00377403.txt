      determine the incremental effect of amoxicillin treatment compared with symptomatic
      treatments on disease-related quality of life in adults with clinically diagnosed acute
      bacterial rhinosinusitis. The secondary objective is to determine the incremental effect of
      amoxicillin treatment compared with symptomatic treatments on functional status, symptoms,
      disease recurrence, satisfaction with treatment, and direct costs of treatment in adults with
      clinically diagnosed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. The tertiary objective is to identify
      prognostic indicators for clinical improvement with antibiotic treatment in adults with
      clinically diagnosed acute bacterial rhinosinusitis. Two hundred adult subjects, 18 to 70
      years old, who meet the recommended criteria for acute bacterial rhinosinusitis, will be
      enrolled from 8 practice sites. Subjects will be randomized to receive a 10-day course of
      either amoxicillin or placebo. In addition, all subjects will receive an analgesic, an oral
      decongestant, a nasal saline spray, and an antitussive agent. Subject outcomes will be
      assessed by telephone interview at 0, 3, 7, 10, and 28 days. The primary outcome is the
      disease-specific quality of life at Day 3 measured with the SNOT-16, a validated evaluative
      instrument. Secondary outcomes include change in functional status and symptoms, disease
      recurrence, satisfaction with care and the direct costs of treatment. Tertiary outcome
      measures include possible subject and disease-related factors that predict clinical
      improvement with antibiotic treatment at Day 3 for use in future studies to aid clinical
      decision-making.
