      disease treated with a smoothie designed to emulate formulas used for exclusive enteral
      nutritional therapy. In place of formula, whole-foods based smoothie recipes and the food to
      create the smoothies will be given to each participant/family. The smoothies will be based
      upon the concept of reverse-engineering of exclusive enteral nutrition (RE-EEN). The smoothie
      recipes will involve whole foods that can be blenderized to liquid consistency. Similar to
      the formulas used for EEN, the smoothies will provide calories, protein, fat, and
      carbohydrates in a distribution to support growth and development.
