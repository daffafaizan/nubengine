      aura in adults. Early treatment of a migraine headache, independent of headache pain
      intensity symptoms, may provide the optimal therapeutic response. This is a multi-center,
      open label study to test the efficacy (effectiveness) and tolerability of AXERT when treating
      a migraine at the onset of headache pain versus treating a migraine only after the headache
      pain has reached at least moderate intensity. Patients will self-administer 12.5 milligrams
      of AXERT for the treatment of 2 migraine headaches. Centers will be randomly assigned to 1 of
      2 treatment interventions in which patients will sequentially treat both migraine headaches
      with 12.5 milligrams of AXERT using either the early treatment regimen (ET; ie, at the onset
      of pain) or conditional treatment regimen (CT; ie, after the headache has reached at least
      moderate intensity). Data will be collected regarding treatment response during and after
      each migraine headache. For each headache, patients will record study information and data
      during 3 telephone calls using Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) technology. It is
      expected that patients who take 12.5 milligrams of AXERT at the first sign of pain of any
      intensity due to a migraine headache will experience an overall shorter duration of their
      migraine than patients who take AXERT 12.5 mg when their migraine pain has reached at least
      moderate pain intensity. In addition, it is expected that almotriptan malate (AXERTÂ®) is
      generally well-tolerated.

      AXERT 12.5 milligram tablet orally either at the onset of migraine pain (within 1 hour of the
      start of a migraine-ET regimen) or when migraine pain reaches at least moderate intensity (CT
      regimen).
