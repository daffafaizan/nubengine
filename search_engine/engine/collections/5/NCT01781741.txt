      I. To assess the feasibility/toxicity of combining transcervical extended mediastinal
      lymphadenectomy (TEMLA) with or without video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) and
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess time to initiation of chemotherapy following TEMLA with or without
      video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS)and SBRT.

      II. To assess feasibility/toxicity of combining TEMLA with or without VATS and SBRT with
      various chemotherapy regimens (to be determined by medical oncologist based on patient and
      tumor characteristics).

      III. To estimate survival following TEMLA with or without VATS and SBRT. IV. To define any
      differences in quality of life/toxicity following TEMLA with or without VATS and SBRT based
      on tumor location (peripheral/central).

      V. To assess response for primary tumor control and overall survival in TEMLA only patients.

      VI. To assess progression free survival for TEMLA with or without (VATS) patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo TEMLA to remove the mediastinal lymph nodes followed by a single fraction of
      SBRT to the primary tumor (unless VATS procedure done) and mediastinal lymph node beds (if
      positive on TEMLA), with or without VATS.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6,9, and 12 months, every 6
      months for 2 years and annually for 2 years.
