      resulting in impaired balance, gait deviations, and severe, progressive disability. With no
      available disease-modifying medications, balance training is the primary treatment option to
      improve motor skills and functional performance. There is no evidence, however, that balance
      training impacts DCD at the tissue level.

      Aerobic training, on the other hand, may modify DCD progression as evident from animal data.
      Compared to sedentary controls, aerobically trained DCD rats have enhanced lifespan, motor
      function, and cerebellar Purkinje cell survival. Numerous animal studies also document that
      aerobic training has a direct, favorable effect on the brain that includes production of
      neurotrophic hormones, enhancement of neuroplasticity mechanisms, and protection from
      neurotoxins.

      The effects of aerobic training in humans with DCD are relatively unknown, despite these
      encouraging animal data. A single study to date has evaluated the benefits of aerobic
      exercise on DCD in humans, and this was a secondary outcome of the study. Although
      participants performed limited aerobic training during the study, modest functional benefits
      were still detected.

      The main objective of this project will be to compare the benefits of aerobic versus balance
      training in DCD. We hypothesize that both aerobic and balance training will improve function
      in DCD subjects, but that the mechanisms in which these improvements occur differ. 1) Balance
      training improves DCD individual's ability to compensate for their activity limitations, but
      does not impact disease progression. 2) Aerobic exercise improves balance and gait in DCD
      persons by affecting brain processes and slowing cerebellar atrophy.
