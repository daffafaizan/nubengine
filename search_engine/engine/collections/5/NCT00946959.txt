    
      Cardiovascular invasive interventions (surgery and angioplasty) save thousands of lives every
      year, but questions remain about the neurological complications and in particular cognitive
      deficit. Indeed, cardiac surgery has been associated with cognitive decline in 50 to 70% of
      patients in the first postoperative week and in 20 to 40% of patients 6 months to one year
      after surgery.

      The study will be based on a prospective monitoring during 1 year of a cohort of 400 patients
      who will receive either a cardiac surgery or coronary angioplasty. At inclusion, will be
      collected medical history, risk factors, treatment history, clinical and etiological data
      (imaging, cardiac and vascular balance).

      The results of routine tests performed complementary to hospitalization will be recorded
      (echo-doppler vessels of the neck, cardiac ultrasound trans-thoracic and/or transesophageal a
      holter cardiac).

      In recruiting, we will apply a method of matching based on age (on 5 years) between 2 groups
      in order to compare 2 homogeneous groups.
