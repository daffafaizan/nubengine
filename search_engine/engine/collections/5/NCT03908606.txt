      stimulate an inflammatory response with subsequent formation of inflammatory mediators and
      cytokines. C reactive protein is an inflammatory plasma marker having a role in the systemic
      reaction to inflammation. thus, our aim in the current study was to evaluate serum levels of
      high sensitivity c reactive protein in periodontitis patients with and without type 2
      diabetes in a trial to analyze its prognostic effect following non-surgical periodontal
      therapy. A total of 60 patients were enrolled in this study. ELISA was used for determination
      of hs- CRP. Non- surgical periodontal therapy was carried out for all periodontitis patients.
