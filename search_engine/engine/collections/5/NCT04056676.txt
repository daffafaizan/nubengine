      opioid-sparing strategy, with block of the intercostal supply by thoracic paravertebral block
      (TPVB) becoming a popular technique.

      This prospective randomized controlled trial is aimed to study the proper regional nerve
      block technique to reach the postoperative opioid-free requirement modality for breast cancer
      surgery.
