      affect CVD including diet, genetics, exercise and smoking. It is unclear if Phenylketonuria
      (PKU) and the low-phenylalanine diet (LPD) affect CVD risk.

      CVD risk can be predicted by measuring the thickness of the artery wall in the neck which
      supplies blood to the head. Thickness is measured using a non-invasive, safe ultrasound test
      (similar to pregnancy jelly scans). A wall thicker than normal indicates an increased CVD
      risk. A wall thinner than normal indicates a lower CVD risk.
