      characterized by a decline in memory, learning ability and other cognitive domains (language,
      gnosis, praxis, attention), with a gradual progression of cognitive and behavioral symptoms.
      Because of the difficulties it causes in carrying out daily living activities, it has a very
      significant impact on the autonomy of patients suffering from it.

      To date, there are various non-drug strategies available to manage these difficulties. Thus,
      in recent years, more and more studies have shown the benefits that can be gained by several
      patients care including physical activity, on cognitive function and general quality of life
      of the elderly people without cognitive impairment but also for patients suffering from
      Alzheimer's disease or a related pathology.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of adapted physical activity on
      self-esteem and motivation in patients with neurocognitive disorders. Stimulation groups are
      proposed within the Claude Pompidou Institute. Within these groups we offer an adapted
      physical activity program that we have developed in our department. More specifically, it is
      a study that aims to evaluate the impact of physical activity on the self-esteem and
      motivation of patients who perform these exercises for 12 weeks, at the rate of one hour per
      week.

      The interest of this study lies in the validation of the effectiveness of such patient care,
      which would make it possible to promote its dissemination and strengthen the accessibility of
      this type of non-drug management to elderly people suffering from neurocognitive disorders.
