      I. To determine the 3-year disease free survival in patients with T3, T4 or node-positive
      rectal adenocarcinoma who received regorafenib maintenance therapy following the completion
      of curative-intent standard treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the cumulative incidence of local recurrence, distant recurrence and overall
      survival at 3 years.

      II. To explore for biomarkers associated with anti-cancer effects of regorafenib maintenance
      therapy in curatively treated rectal cancer patients by analyzing tumor and blood samples.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 24 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 4
      months for up to 5 years.
