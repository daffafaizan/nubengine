    
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, observational, multicenter study in which urethral
      length is measured in women with surgically-correctable stress urinary incontinence who
      undergo a suburethral sling operative procedure. Data will be collected from preoperative
      urogynecological testing and medical histories. The urethral length will be measured
      intraoperatively using scaled catheters. Outcome data, including the development of
      postoperative complications, will be collected at several time intervals.
