      In individuals with atopic asthma who are being treated with inhaled corticosteroids with or
      without long acting beta agonists (1 of 6 possible steps of treatment), aggressive
      environmental intervention to reduce exposure to home allergens is more likely to lead to one
      step reduction in asthma controller therapy, improved asthma control and improved biomarkers
      of airway inflammation than is usual care.

      Scientific abstract:

      Environmental exposure to indoor allergens is a major contributor to asthma impairment and
      risk, particularly among asthmatic patients residing in inner cities. The investigators plan
      a randomized controlled trial to assess the effect of individualized, comprehensive,
      multifaceted indoor allergen avoidance measures on ability to step down asthma controller
      therapy in adults and children greater than 6 years with mild to severe persistent asthma.

      Specifically,

      1. To determine via a randomized, controlled trial in allergen sensitized asthma patients
      whether environmental intervention aimed at reducing exposure to indoor allergens and
      irritants is more effective in reducing National Asthma Education and Prevention Program
      (NAEPP) step based therapy than usual care over a 48 week study period.

      2a. To determine if environmental intervention leads to reduction in indoor allergen levels,
      allergen specific serum IgE levels, airway hyper-responsiveness, fractional excretion of
      nitric oxide, asthma symptom score, asthma exacerbations, treatment failures and improved
      lung function compared to usual care over a 48 week study period.

      2b. (Exploratory): To determine if there is an association between reduction in allergen
      specific IgE level and reduction in NAEPP step level required for asthma control among
      subjects randomized to environmental intervention compared with usual care.
