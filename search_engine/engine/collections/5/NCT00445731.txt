      Primary

        -  Compare the effects of a structured walking regimen vs normal standard care on
           functional status at day 100 after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in patients
           with cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the effects of these regimens on patient survival at day 100 and at 1 year after
           transplantation.

        -  Compare patient satisfaction with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.

        -  Arm I: Beginning 2-3 days after allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, patients walk on
           a treadmill or in the hospital hallways twice daily for ≥ 15 minutes. After discharge
           and continuing for up to 100 days post-transplantation, patients walk once daily for ≥
           30 minutes. Patients record their walking times daily in a journal.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive no special instructions regarding exercise other than the
           normal standard of care.

      All patients complete questionnaires at discharge and at day 100 post-transplantation
      measuring daily exercise activities, satisfaction with the recommended walking regimen, and
      functional status.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study.
