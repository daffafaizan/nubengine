      rarely metastatic, it can be locally destructive causing disfigurement and pain. Current
      therapies include surgical removal, local destruction, radiotherapy and others.

      Advances in understanding the molecular basis behind BCCs indicate that mutations in the
      hedgehog signaling pathway can lead to the development of many sporadically occurring basal
      cell carcinomas (BCCs). An oral drug that targets the hedgehog signaling pathway has been
      shown to be effective in treating patients with metastatic and inoperable BCCs. There is
      evidence that itraconazole, a commonly prescribed antifungal medication may also affect this
      pathway. It is not known whether itraconazole ointment applied topically can affect the
      growth of BCCs.
