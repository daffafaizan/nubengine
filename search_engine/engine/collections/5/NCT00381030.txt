      approaches to improving heart failure care is therefore a national health priority. One
      retrospective study suggested that patients taking beta-blockers while hospitalized for heart
      failure had a lower risk of rehospitalization at 6-months. One prospective study suggested
      that starting beta blockers among hospitalized heart failure patients is safe and improves
      compliance. However, improved outcomes of this approach have not been prospectively
      demonstrated.

      Comparison: Inpatient initiation of the beta-blocker carvedilol coupled with outpatient
      follow-up with a nurse manager was compared to usual care by internists and cardiologists.
