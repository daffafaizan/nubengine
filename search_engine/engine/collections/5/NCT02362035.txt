      the first stage, Part 1 of the study will determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of
      acalabrutinib and pembrolizumab in a limited group of B-cell malignancies. In the second
      stage, Part 2 allows for possible expansion cohorts into a wider range of B-cell
      malignancies, and Part 3 will evaluate the combination in subjects with myelofibrosis (MF).
