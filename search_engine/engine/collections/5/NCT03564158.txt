      (n=15) will be used to identify a safe supratherapeutic dose to be used in the TQT study
      (Phase Two). Phase Two will be a randomized, placebo and positive-controlled, 4-way crossover
      TQT study. Thirty-two subjects will receive all 4 of the following treatments in randomized
      sequence.

        1. meropenem-vaborbactam 4 g (meropenem 2 g- vaborbactam 2 g) therapeutic dose infused
           intravenously over 3 hours

        2. meropenem-vaborbactam supratherapeutic dose to be determined infused intravenously over
           3 hours.

        3. Placebo (normal saline) to match meropenem-vaborbactam volume infusion over 3 hours

        4. Moxifloxacin 400 mg positive control (oral; open-label)
