    
      Our secondary objectives include the following:

        1. To describe, in 15 healthy, non-pregnant women changes in plasma concentrations of
           nucleosomes and free DNA over 3 months.

        2. To describe, in 15 pregnant women (without complications), changes in plasma
           concentrations of nucleosomes and free DNA over the last 7 months of pregnancy

        3. To show that plasma concentrations of nucleosomes and free DNA, in patients with
           complicated pregnancies differ according to the nature of the complication

        4. To show that a relationship exists between the concentrations of nucleosomes, free DNA,
           and total granulocyte microparticles (and trophoblast particles for pregnant women)

        5. To evaluate the relationship between nucleosome concentrations, free DNA concentrations
           and circulating leukocyte populations

        6. To evaluate the relationship between nucleosome concentrations, free DNA concentrations
           and hemostasis markers

        7. To describe changes in hemostasis markers throughout pregnancy

        8. To evaluate the relationship between nucleosome concentrations, free DNA concentrations
           and the angiogenic marker CD146

        9. To add to the NÃ®mes University Hospital biological collections.
