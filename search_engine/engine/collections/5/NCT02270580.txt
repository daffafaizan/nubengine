      condition (specialized PN+cancer survivorship program over 6 months versus PN only (control
      condition) as the between-groups factor, and time-point (baseline pre-randomization and
      post-PN at 6 months follow-up) as the within-groups factor. This RCT involves 2 patient
      navigator conditions: PN+ and usual PN in which (condition 1) we will evaluate the efficacy
      of a culturally tailored PN program ("PN+") on improving quality of life (QoL), screening
      practices and treatment follow-up compliance among breast HL survivors. In usual PN,
      participants will receive information brochures on breast cancer survivorship and have a
      minimum of 1 contact with the patient navigator.
