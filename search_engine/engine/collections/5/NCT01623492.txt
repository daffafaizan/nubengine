    
      Approximately 200 male and female adult patients with a history of Eisenmenger will be
      recruited from approximately 50 cardiology practices over a period of 18 months and will be
      followed up every six months for the period of three years. Consecutive patients in each
      practice meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria should be considered for the study.
      Participating sites will be asked to maintain a screening log to identify which inclusion or
      exclusion criteria was not met thus excluding them from the study.
