           operator echocardiography within a HFDP, using AI enhanced analysis of POC handheld
           echocardiography is accurate and safe. This has the potential to improve access to
           timelier echocardiography in order to achieve earlier HF diagnosis and treatment, which
           is known to delay/prevent progression to HF hospitalisation. It will also provide useful
           information regarding the future feasibility of using AI enhanced analysis of POC
           handheld echocardiography in the community, for investigation of people with suspected
           new HF.

        2. Facilitate the digitisation of an NHS Heart Failure diagnostic service in order to
           standardise and improve the quality of data collection and clinical care provided within
           the service.
