    
      A retrospective cohort study design involving secondary data collection was chosen to
      appropriately address the primary objective in a relatively short period of time after
      enrollment phase initiation: in fact, since the Italian Sampling Program on benralizumab was
      active since July 2018, clinical data on patients exposed to benralizumab are already
      available. No treatments will be administered per protocol requirement, but instead according
      to normal clinical practice; since benralizumab first administration occurs before inclusion
      in the study (as per chosen study design), the decision to include the patient in the study
      is clearly separated from the prescription of benralizumab, in accordance with the
      observational nature of the study. In order to be eligible for the study, for each patient,
      the index date shall be at least 3 months prior to enrollment.
