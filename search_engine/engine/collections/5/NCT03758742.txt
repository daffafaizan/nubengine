      hierarchically in descending order of importance as:

        1. Diabetes remission rate (endpoint #1)

        2. Medication effect score (endpoint #2)

        3. Fasting glucose and HbA1c (endpoints #3-4)

        4. Oral glucose tolerance test and continuous glucose monitoring measures (endpoints #5-14)

      while the secondary endpoints (endpoints #15-20) will all be evaluated with equal importance.
