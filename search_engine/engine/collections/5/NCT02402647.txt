    
      Objective: The investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing six
      months (26 sessions) of Cognitive Rehabilitation and Exposure/Sorting Therapy (CREST)
      treatment to a robust comparator, six months of Exposure Therapy alone, in 136 participants
      with HD.

      Research Design: Assessments will be administered at baseline, during treatment (sessions 7,
      13, 21), post-treatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up, thus, all participants will be
      enrolled for one year.

      Methodology: The primary objective is to evaluate whether CREST significantly reduces
      hoarding symptoms and improves functional capacity and quality of life when compared to
      exposure therapy alone. The investigators will also examine the impact of treatment
      mediators; treatment adherence, changes in executive functioning, avoidance, symptom severity
      on outcomes. Age and executive functioning will also be explored as potential moderators.
      Finally, by repeatedly measuring treatment targets, the investigators will examine time to
      maximum treatment effect in an effort to understand mechanisms of change.

      Clinical Relationships: By providing a treatment for many Veterans with HD, the investigators
      can alter the course of their symptom trajectory and negative consequences, resulting in both
      healthcare costs savings and improved quality of life for Veterans.
