      (Visualase® Thermal Therapy System) as an alternative to surgical resection for the treatment
      of focal lesional epilepsy in patients that are considered high risk surgical candidates.
      This system includes the FDA-cleared Visualase Cooled Laser Applicator System (VCLAS), which
      allows delivery of laser energy while the patient is being imaged by an MRI unit. The
      Visualase® System works via real-time MR thermal imaging (MRTI) to provide information on the
      thermal dose delivered to the target, resulting in a more precise and controlled delivery
      which has heretofore not been possible with previous non-image guided laser technology. We
      hypothesize that the Visualase system can be used in patients refractory to medication
      therapy in a minimally invasive procedure to destroy epileptogenic focal lesions in the
      brain.
