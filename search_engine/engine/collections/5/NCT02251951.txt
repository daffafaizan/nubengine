      chemotherapy are considered as an orphan disease with limited (if any) treatment options. The
      promising results of Nab-Paclitaxel derived from preclinical studies and from clinical trials
      conducted in breast cancer patients open the field to develop such therapeutic approaches in
      other cancers types usually treated with taxanes such as gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas. We
      design a phase II study in order to evaluate the effect of nab-Paclitaxel as salvage
      treatment for patients with advanced cancer of the stomach and GEJ previously treated with
      the DCF regimen.
