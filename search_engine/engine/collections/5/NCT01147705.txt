    
      The investigators will recruit 50 patients with peripheral arterial disease for a randomised,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group study to see if allopurinol prolongs time to
      leg pain and maximum walking distance as assessed by treadmill testing and the six minute
      walk test. Recruitment will take place in Dundee, i.e. a single-centre trial. Treatment will
      last for 24 weeks.

      Participants will be recruited from current and past attendees at the vascular laboratory and
      both the intermittent claudication clinic and other outpatient clinics at Ninewells.

      Participants will be allowed to continue all their usual medication throughout. After two
      baseline treadmill tests, they will be randomised to either allopurinol or placebo in a
      parallel group study and in a double blind fashion. Each participant will be on-study for 24
      weeks (which is the standard time for all PAD medical intervention trials). The ultimate dose
      of allopurinol will be 300 mg BD, which is the dose known to work in angina. However, for
      safety purposes, the initial dose will be 100 mg/day for two weeks, rising to 300 mg/day for
      four weeks, followed by 600 mg/day for the next 18 weeks. Participants and their bloods (UE,
      LFT, FBC) will be monitored at weeks 0, 6, 18 and 24 weeks and medication stopped or reduced
      in dose if concerns arise. If study drug dose is reduced, they will stay in study. If study
      drug needs to be stopped, they will stay in study in order to do an "intention to treat"
      analysis.

      Double blind medication (allopurinol or placebo) will be prepared and packaged by Tayside
      Pharmaceuticals. The medication will come labelled as "Participant 1", "Participant 2", etc.
      and will be distributed to the participant by the research fellow according to their sequence
      number. The blinded treatment code will be kept by the Clinical Trials Pharmacy Department,
      Ninewells, who operate a 24 hour emergency unblinding facility (as necessary) and in a sealed
      envelope in a locked fireproof cabinet accessible by a responsible member of University of
      Dundee staff not directly involved in the study.
