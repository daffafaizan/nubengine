      using the hot biopsy forcep. A 0.9% saline solution mixed with epinephrine (1:10,000) and
      indigo carmine dye was injected along the border of the tumor to raise the gastric mucosa.
      Then, a circumferential incision was made along the margin of the targeted lesion, using the
      hot biopsy forceps, and the superficial mucosa was removed. Repeated injection was performed
      into the submucosal layer. The surrounding tissue was then carefully dissected using the hot
      biopsy forceps to the level of the deepest submucosal layer. The adjacent tissue was grasped
      using the forceps and pulled away, forming a "tent". To ensure complete resection, the
      muscular fibers and stalks that connected the tumor to the propria layer were shelled along
      the capsule of the tumor, using the coagulating forceps. The investigators used a coagulating
      forceps when strip the tissue of the outer longitudinal layer. Visible blood vessels in the
      submucosal layer were directly coagulated using coagulating forceps. After the lesion was
      removed, further visible blood vessels were coagulated. The hot biopsy forcep was used to
      apply a forced coagulation current (80 W, Effect 2, VIO300D; Erbe, Germany). However,
      coagulating forceps with a soft coagulation current (60 W, Effect 6, VIO300D; Erbe, Germany)
      were used to cut muscle fibers adjacent to the tumor or hemostasis.
