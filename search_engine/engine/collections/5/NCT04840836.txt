      rates of use among this population and early discontinuation due to method dissatisfaction
      limits their potential to reduce unintended pregnancy. Reducing barriers for obtaining LARCs
      by adolescents who want to use them is key in reducing risk of unintended pregnancy. Data
      will be collected from patients who are receiving same-day LARC as a part of their normal
      care via telehealth services in school-based health centers (SBHCs). This implementation
      model, therefore, has the potential for replication and scale-up with wide reach. The
      findings from this study, given the SBHC setting, have the potential to inform and improve
      LARC service delivery for adolescents far beyond New York City and the SBHC setting.
