      Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are
      chronic debilitating conditions with significant implications of both patients and parents.
      Thus, there is a necessity to address the stress and anxiety derived from parenting a child
      with IBD.

      Mindfulness is the psychological process of bringing one's attention to the internal and
      external experiences occurring in the present moment,which can be developed through the
      practice of meditation and other training. Clinical studies have documented both physical and
      mental health benefits of mindfulness in different patient categories as well as in healthy
      adults and children.

      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of mindfulness based stress reduction (MBSR)
      intervention on stress and anxiety of parents of children with inflammatory bowel diseases
      (IBD). The intervention is consisted of 8 group sessions managed by a certified psychologist.
      30 parents will participate in 4 separated courses. The efficacy of the intervention will be
      assessed by 3 validated questionnaires which will be filled by each participant prior to
      intervention, at the end of intervention and 3 months following interventions: Profile of
      mood states (POMS), The brief symptom inventory (BSI) and perceived stress scale (PSS).
      Differences in questionnaires' scores will be analyzed.
