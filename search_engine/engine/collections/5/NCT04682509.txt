      include 20 patients who are on the kidney transplant waitlist at NYU Langone Health, are
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) negative, are willing to accept an organ from an HCV positive donor,
      and consent to participate in this trial. Study subjects will receive a kidney transplant
      from a deceased donor who tested positive for HCV as confirmed by nucleic acid amplification
      testing (NAT) per standard of care. All study subjects will receive a two week course of
      preemptive therapy with glecaprevir/pibrentasvir (MavyretÂ®), starting on postoperative day
      (POD) 0 prior to the transplant. If HCV RNA is undetectable after 2 weeks of therapy, Mavyret
      will be discontinued and study subjects will be followed with an intensive HCV monitoring
      protocol. If HCV RNA is detectable after 2 weeks of therapy, Mavyret will be continued to
      complete a full course of 8 weeks per standard of care. All patients will undergo close
      monitoring and surveillance for HCV viremia post-transplant to ensure that sustained
      virologic response (SVR) is achieved.
