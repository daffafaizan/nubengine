    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if Yoga for Cancer Survivors (YOCAS) is effective for improving
      patient-reported insomnia (Insomnia Severity Index) compared to Cognitive Behavioral Therapy
      for Insomnia (CBT-I) and a health education control immediately post intervention.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To examine if YOCAS is effective for improving objective symptoms of insomnia (sleep
      latency, sleep efficiency, wake after sleep onset, sleep duration, and daytime napping via
      actigraphy) and global sleep quality impairment (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) compared to
      CBT-I and a health education control.

      II. To examine if YOCAS and CBT-I are effective for maintaining improvements in insomnia
      (Insomnia Severity Index) 3 and 6 months post intervention compared to a health education
      control.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo the YOCAS intervention comprising 18 specific physical postures and
      mindfulness exercises focused on breathing and meditation and meet with the yoga instructor
      over 75 minutes 2 times a week for 4 weeks.

      ARM II: Patients undergo CBT-I intervention comprising sleep education, sleep hygiene, sleep
      restriction, stimulus control, cognitive therapy, and relapse prevention delivered by a
      health professional over 90 minutes once a week for 8 weeks.

      ARM III: Patients attend survivorship health education sessions over 75 minutes 2 times a
      week for 4 weeks based on the American Society of Clinical Oncology cancer survivorship
      educational recommendations delivered by a community health educator. Patients also receive a
      booklet entitled, "Cancer Survivorship Next Steps for Patients and Their Families."

      After completion of intervention, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
