      patients with diabetes. The intervention will use both counseling and technology (a FitBit
      physical activity tracker and smartphone app) to create an individualized, interactive
      program for each patient. The primary aims of the study are to assess the feasibility of
      recruiting patients and implementing the program in the clinical setting, and the
      acceptability of the program for patients and clinicians. Participants will receive a
      counseling session based on the principles of motivational interviewing to help them set
      physical activity and step goals, then the interventionist will help them personalize the
      Fitbit app to their goals. Participants are instructed to continue adaptive goal setting and
      email their goals and activity weekly to their physicians. In addition to assessing
      feasibility and acceptability, we will also evaluate change in activity to explore potential
      efficacy.
