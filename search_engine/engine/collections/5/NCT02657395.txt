      dermis. The acellular porous structure of the membrane permits rapid re-vascularization and
      cellular re-population. The membrane contains a high proportion of type III collagen. Type
      III collagen helps regulate tissue healing by promoting neoepithelialization and
      angiogenesis. Wounds grafted with PriMatrix exhibited significantly faster healing rates
      compared to control wounds while having a minimal foreign body response and early
      repopulation by progenitor cells.

      The ability of PriMatrix to permit neovascularization, reepithelialization, minimal immune
      response, and population by progenitor cells suggests that it may serve as an ideal
      alternative to CTG under CPF for root coverage. In this regard, the current study aims to
      serve as a pilot to test the feasibility of the use of PriMatrix as a graft material under a
      CPF to attain root coverage of Miller Class I & II defects.
