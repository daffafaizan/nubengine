      changes in executive brain functioning prior to and following an 8-week, group-based
      mindfulness meditation intervention within a group of 10 adults diagnosed with
      Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Another group of 10 adults diagnosed with
      ADHD will be placed in the waitlist condition.

      Our primary hypothesis is that adults with ADHD in the treatment group will exhibit improved
      performance on a series of executive functioning tasks and that exposure to task stimuli will
      correspond to changes in neural functioning following an 8-week, group-based mindfulness
      intervention. Brain responses will be measured using blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD)
      fMRI signal in brain regions associated with emotional and executive processes prior to and
      following treatment.
