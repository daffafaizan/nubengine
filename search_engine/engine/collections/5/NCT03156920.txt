      Human experimental models are valuable in early phase development of new anti-migraine drugs
      but useful models have not yet been developed. The investigators' group has shown that
      Cilostazol, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor induce headache/migraine in both healthy volunteers
      and in patients with migraine without aura (MO).

      To validate cilostazol as a model, the headache must respond to specific migraine treatment
      with sumatriptan.

      Hypothesis: Cilostazol induces a migraine-like headache in healthy subjects. The induced
      headache can be pre-treated with a specific anti-migraine drug; sumatriptan.

      Aim: Developing a pragmatic and valid model for the testing of new anti-migraine drugs.
