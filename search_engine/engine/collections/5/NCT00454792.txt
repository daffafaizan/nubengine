      persistent LBP, which typically appears to be resistant to treatment. Furthermore, a
      retrospective study at The Backcenter Funen, Ringe, shows that patients with MC fail to
      improve engaging physical activity. This is unfortunate, because the typical rehabilitation
      for patients with persistent LBP is back exercises and information about keeping physically
      active. This means that this relatively large subgroup of patients with Modic changes
      probably does not improve with the rehabilitation tools used today.

      A randomised controlled trial has therefore been designed to study the specific subgroup of
      patients with Modic changes. In this study we will compare the present "state-of-the art"
      rehabilitation approach to persistent LBP (namely to exercise and keep active) with a new
      concept (restitution). The justification for this is that restitution reduces mechanical
      stress on the vertebrae and therefore would allow heeling of the possible micro fractures in
      Modic changes.
