      great threat to human health. T cells play a critical role in antiviral immunity but their
      numbers and functional state in COVID-19 patients remain largely unclear. The immune response
      against viral infections depends on the activation of cytotoxic T cells that can clear
      infection by killing virus-infected cells, so boosting the numbers and function of T cells in
      COVID-19 patients is critical for successful recovery. However, the factors which might cause
      the reduction in count, and the activation status of T cells in COVID-19 patients, remain
      uninvestigated. Thus demonstration of T cell exhaustion during COVID-19 infection suggest
      that more urgent, early intervention may be required in patients with low T lymphocyte
      counts.
