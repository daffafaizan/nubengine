      I. To assess the confirmed response (complete and partial) probability in patients with
      advanced/metastatic gastric cancer treated with GW572016.

      II. To assess the time to treatment failure and overall survival in this group of patients.

      III. To assess the qualitative and quantitative toxicities associated with this regimen.

      IV. To assess, in a preliminary manner, the relationship of protein expression and gene
      expression of EGFR, HER2 and markers of angiogenesis with clinical outcomes in patients
      treated with GW572016.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral lapatinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.
