      evaluate Epidiolex as a pharmacotherapy for adults with cannabis use disorder. In this
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, cannabis-dependent subjects ages 18-65
      will receive medical management over a 6-week period, with half receiving Epidiolex treatment
      and half receiving placebo. Participants will receive either up to 800 mg Epidiolex or
      placebo over a 6-week treatment period. Following treatment completion, participants will
      have a follow-up visits at 10 and 14 weeks. Primary outcomes will include self-report of
      cannabis smoking and results of quantitative urine drug screens for cannabis. Secondary
      outcome measures will include treatment retention, patient satisfaction, cannabis withdrawal,
      cannabis craving, depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, compliance, and cigarette use.
