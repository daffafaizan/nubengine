    
      This is a multicenter, open label, non-comparator, single arm study to evaluate the efficacy
      and safety of ibrexafungerp in patients â‰¥ 18 years of age with a documented invasive and/or
      severe fungal disease that has been intolerant or refractory (rIFI) to Standard of Care (SoC)
      antifungal treatment. Patients will be treated with ibrexafungerp for up to 180 days.
      Treatment beyond 180 days and combination therapy with other antifungal agents may be allowed
      under special circumstances to be agreed upon by the Investigator and the Sponsor.

      Subjects must have a proven or probable fungal disease and meet all study criteria to be
      considered for enrollment. Eligible subjects must also have documented evidence of failure
      of, intolerance to, or toxicity related to a currently approved SoC antifungal treatment.

      Subjects will also be considered for enrollment if they have an eligible fungal disease and,
      in the judgement of the investigator, the subject cannot receive approved oral antifungal
      options (e.g. susceptibility of the organism or risk for drug-drug interactions) and a
      continued IV antifungal therapy is not desirable or feasible due to clinical or logistical
      circumstances.

      Following a screening visit, there will be up to 15 treatment visits, a follow-up visit and 2
      follow-up contacts.
