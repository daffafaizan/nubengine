      Risk Score. Despite evidence-based guidelines, the appropriate use of lipid-lowering
      therapies in this population remains limited and controversial. Strategies to refine risk
      stratification in primary prevention have been poorly adopted. Dissemination of
      practice-changing trials and closing the care gap in primary care remain a priority and a
      challenge. Considerable confusion remains regarding the optimal application of lipid-lowering
      therapy in primary prevention. Importantly, it remains largely unknown which tools or
      techniques are used by Canadian primary care physicians to identify global vascular risk, and
      what barriers exist to implementing risk reduction therapies in such individuals.

      For primary prevention of patients with normal levels of LDL-Cholesterol who are at increased
      risk on the basis of elevated hsCRP, it remains unproven whether statin therapy will
      effectively reduce vascular event rates. The JUPITER trial was launched in 2003 comparing
      rosuvastatin with placebo in 18,000 primary prevention patients with LDL-cholesterol of less
      than 3.36mM who also have an hsCRP of greater than 2 mg/L. This trial has been stopped early
      due to unequivocal morbidity and mortality benefits in favor of the treatment strategy, and
      the final results will be available in early November, 2008. JUPITER, once published, will
      require a major change in physician behavior with respect to screening and treating
      cardiovascular risk.
