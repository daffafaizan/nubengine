      respiratory mechanics in the ARDS patients. Recently, there were report of decrease in airway
      pressure and improve in respiratory compliance during inverse ration ventilation undergoing
      one lung ventilation. We hypothesized that changes of inspiration and expiration ratio from
      1:2 to 1:1 could improve the arterial oxygenation and respiratory mechanics in the patients
      who undergoing laparoscopic low anterior resection. However, prolonged inspiratory time might
      compromise cerebral perfusion pressure due to an elevation in central venous pressure and
      concomitant reductions in mean arterial pressure.
