      motor system. Recently two new staging systems have been proposed for ALS, based on clinical
      milestones related also to the spreading pattern of the disease (1,2). Furthermore, biomarker
      development is still an essential component of future therapeutic development in ALS. Thus,
      it is also important to acknowledge the value of biomarker research in supporting or
      revealing fundamental pathophysiological mechanisms in ALS.

      The proposed staging systems: have been recently tested in two independent cohorts (3,4) with
      results that were not fully consistent (ii) did not considered the potential value of
      biomarkers.
