    
      introduction : The central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is a major cause of ocular
      morbidity, depending in particular on the occurrence and extent of retinal ischemia by
      capillary occlusion. There is no effective systemic treatment of this condition. An increase
      in the adhesion of erythrocytes to vascular endothelium was observed for patients with CRVO,
      correlated with overexpression of membrane phosphatidylserine.

      Hypothesis : Hydroxycarbamide (HC) by reducing the erythrocyte adhesion to the endothelium
      may prevent or delay the onset of retinal capillary non-perfusion in patients with CRVO.

      Primary objective: To assess the efficacy at 3 months of treatment with HC on retinal
      capillary perfusion in patients with a recent CRVO.

      Secondary Objectives: To evaluate the safety of the treatment, the efficacy to 6 months on
      retinal perfusion of the treatment with HC (HC peak effect on the red cell adhesion in
      vitro), and the biological effects of HC, in particular on adhesion to endothelium and
      erythrocyte hemorheological parameters.
