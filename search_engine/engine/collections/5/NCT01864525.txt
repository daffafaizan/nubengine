        -  Essential tremor of the voice produces regular shaking and hoarseness in the voice,
           making it difficult speech difficult to understand

        -  Several previous studies have found that octanoic acid and octanol, which are related to
           alcohol, can improve tremor in some people without producing many side effects and
           without producing intoxication

        -  Researchers are interested in determining whether octanoic acid can improve tremor that
           affects the voice

      Objectives:

        -  To determine the effects of octanoic voice using voice recordings and listener ratings
           of voice

        -  To determine the effects of octanoic acid on level of voice disability experienced by
           people with essential voice tremor
