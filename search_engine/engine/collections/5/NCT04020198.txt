    
      This is an observational study looking at clinical and biomarker characteristics in patients
      with Parkinson's disease (PD), Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), Rapid Eye Movement Sleep
      Behavior Disorder (RBD), Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (NPH) and matched controls. Saliva,
      plasma, serum, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid samples will be collected from participants.
      Samples will be assessed for levels of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates. Clinical
      characteristics will also be assessed.

      Misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates have the potential to serve as an early biomarker for PD
      and MSA, increasing the ability to diagnose and treat individuals with these diseases
      earlier. This study examines the effectiveness of using a novel technique for distinguishing
      between different parkinsonian disorders by measuring small misfolded Î±-synuclein aggregates
      in different biofluids.
