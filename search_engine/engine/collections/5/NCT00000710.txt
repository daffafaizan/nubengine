      but it produces toxicity in approximately 50 percent of patients. Early data show that ddI
      possesses high antiviral activity and less toxicity than AZT. The most effective route and
      dose of ddI has yet to be determined.

      Patients are given intravenous drug for 14 days with a 1 day washout period, then 76 weeks of
      oral medication. To expedite this safety study and still be able to maintain close monitoring
      of the patient's health, an overlapping dosing regimen is used. After 6 patients have been
      enrolled and at least 4 have completed 4 weeks of dosing without significant toxic effects, a
      second group of patients is started at the next dose level.

      AMENDED: An alternative oral dosing formulation of ddI will be provided as a buffer powder
      blend packaged in sealed foil sachets in several strengths.
