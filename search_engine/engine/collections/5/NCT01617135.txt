      "off" episodes are managed by adjusting the dose interval of their standard oral medications
      or by self-administration of unscheduled doses of oral Parkinson's medication. Due to the
      variability in levodopa absorption following oral dosing, resumption of motor function is
      unreliable and may be delayed for an hour or more. CVT-301 delivers levodopa using a simple
      inhaler, resulting in rapid increases in levodopa blood levels and is expected to result in
      rapid restoration in motor function for patients experiencing "off" episodes.
