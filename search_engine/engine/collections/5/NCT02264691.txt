      particular we are interested in examining why patients with severe asthma have disease that
      is resistant to corticosteroids. While we will be studying patients with severe asthma, we
      also need to study subjects to act as controls. To this end we will recruit subjects into the
      following groups: Normal volunteers; Mild asthmatics not taking inhaled corticosteroids; Mild
      to moderate asthmatics requiring and using inhaled corticosteroids and Severe asthmatics.

      Subjects between the ages of 18 and 65 will be enrolled in this study. We aim to recruit
      enough subjects such that 120 male and female participants (30 in each of the above groups)
      will complete the bronchoscopy.
