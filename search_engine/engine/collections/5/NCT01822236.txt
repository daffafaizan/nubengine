    
      Design: Randomized clinical trial. Objective: to determine the effectiveness of a
      craniosacral therapy program on disability, quality of life, autonomic nervous system, body
      mass, hormonal indicators, spinal projection, and oxidative stress indicators in patients
      with chronic low back pain.

      Participants: Seventy patients with chronic non-specific low back pain will be randomly
      assigned to an experimental and control group.

      Intervention: For 10-week, the experimental group will undergo treatment comprising 10
      sessions (1/week) of a craniosacral therapy program with ten techniques, and the control
      group will receive only one craniosacral technique.

      Main Outcome Measures: disability, quality of life, biochemical estimation interstitial
      fluid, body mass indicators, hormonal indicators, indicators of autonomic nervous system,and
      indicators of oxidative stress will be collected in both groups at baseline, 10 weeks and 15
      weeks after the last intervention in the experimental and control groups, by an assessor
      blinded to the treatment allocation of the patients. Baseline demographic and clinical
      variables will be examined between both groups with an independent Student t-test for
      continuous data. Separate 2x3 model ANOVA with time (baseline, 10 weeks and 15 weeks) as the
      within-subjects factor, group (experimental, control) will be to determine the effects of the
      treatment.
