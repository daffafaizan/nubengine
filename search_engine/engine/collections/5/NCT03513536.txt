      improve quality of life during pregnancy.

      The essential oils used in this study are applied topically to the temples and jaw line every
      4-6 waking hours over a 6-day period. Each application will produce an exposure that lasts up
      to 30-45 minutes before fading. At the end of each day, nausea and vomiting levels will be
      assessed using a validated measurement instrument.

      Quality of life is measured using a 30-question tool that measures both pregnancy-related
      quality of life and pregnancy-induced nausea and vomiting.
