      with high mortality rate in China. But there still lacks of effective therapies in treatment
      of HBV related ACLF, except liver transplantation. Non-bioartificial liver support system
      treatments may be effective due to previous clinical data. Plasma exchange (PE) and double
      plasma molecular adsorption system (DPMAS) are two common ways in clinical practice. This
      study is to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of combination treatment of DPMAS
      and low volume PE in patients with HBV related ACLF. This study will be completed in 6
      medical center. Two hundred patients with HBV related ACLF enrolled in this study are
      randomized grouping into trial group (DPMAS, low volume PE, and comprehensive internal
      medical treatment) and control group (comprehensive internal medical treatment). Symptoms,
      signs, laboratory tests results, adverse events, mortality rates are recorded from treatment
      baseline to 48 weeks.
