    
      Eighty infertile anovulatory patients with PCOS will be allocated in two body mass index
      (BMI)- and age-matched groups (experimental and control groups).

      Forty patients will receive the experimental treatment consisting of six months of 1700
      mg/day metformin administration (experimental group), whereas other forty patients will
      receive CC administered using a traditional incremental-doses protocol (control group). In
      both groups, patients who will ovulate under treatment will continue the therapy for a total
      of six months.

      During the study, the clinical and reproductive outcomes, and the adverse experience will be
      evaluated in each patient.
