      performed in the United States and Europe. The clinical benefit of myocardial
      revascularization is related to freedom of adverse cardiovascular events and to graft
      patency, above all of great saphenous vein, which is nowadays the main autologous vessel used
      for grafting coronaries different from anterior interventricular artery. Unfortunately,
      phenomena leading to early and, above all, late complications and to graft occlusion are not
      fully clarified and it so not possible to explain interindividual and temporary variability
      of progressive stenosis rate only on the basis of classical atherosclerosis risk factors. The
      aim of our study is to prospectively study the role of conventional risk factors
      (preoperative risk factors and clinical features) and of unconventional risk factors (genetic
      polymorphisms, inflammation and coagulation markers) with saphenous late patency and
      postoperative patients outcome, in particular with regard to adverse clinical events
      (myocardial infarction, successive stenting procedures, arrhythmias etc.)and to bypass
      patency.

      Plasma venous samples will be collected the day before surgery, at discharge from the
      hospital, and at follow-up from patients undergoing on-pump and off-pump coronary artery
      bypass grafting and stored at -80Â°C; Patients will be followed-up periodically with visits
      and telephone interviews, and will be also invited to undergo multislice (64 rows) CT scan in
      order to assess graft patency between 12 and 24 months after surgery.

      Finally the relation between conventional and unconventional risk factors with adverse events
      at follow-up will be assessed with multivariable statistical models.
