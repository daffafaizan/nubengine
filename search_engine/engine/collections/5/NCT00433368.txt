      we aimed to check the efficacy and safety of L-ornithine L-aspartate(LOLA). It provides
      critical substrates for ureagenesis and glutamine synthesis, the two primary mechanisms by
      which the body rids itself of excess ammonia. Ornithine is a specific activator of ornithine
      carbamyl transferase and carbamylphosphate synthetase, and, in addition, is a substrate for
      ureagenesis. These reactions are carried out mainly in the periportal portion of the hepatic
      lobules. Aspartate and ornithine, after conversion to alfa-ketoglutarate, are substrates for
      glutamine synthesis, which is performed exclusively by a small population of perivenous
      hepatocytes, the so-called perivenous scavenger cells. The ammonia lowering effect resulting
      from the stimulation of these two basic mechanisms of ammonia detoxification has been studied
      in animals and was confirmed in humans in clinical trials.
