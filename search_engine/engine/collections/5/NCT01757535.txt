    
      This is an international, multicenter, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study with a double-blind,
      randomized, parallel-group design in subjects with de novo AML or AML secondary to prior
      diagnosis of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) aged â‰¥
      55 years, who are in first CR/CRi following induction therapy with or without consolidation
      chemotherapy. The study consists of 3 phases; the Pre-randomization Phase (Screening Phase),
      the Treatment Phase, and the Follow-up Phase.

      The study is amended to include an Extension Phase (EP). The EP allows subjects who are
      currently receiving oral azacitidine and who are demonstrating clinical benefit as assessed
      by the Investigator, to continue receive oral azacitidine after unblinding by Sponsor
      (Celgene Corporation) until they meet the criteria for study discontinuation or until oral
      azacitidine becomes commercially available and reimbursed. In addition, all subjects in the
      placebo arm and subjects who had been discontinued from the treatment phase (irrespective of
      randomization arm) and continuing in the Follow-up Phase will be followed for survival in the
      EP.
