      activity. Pretest-posttest experimental design was used. The study was conducted in the
      research lab of the University. Thirty-four athletes with a mean age of 22.08 years
      participated in the study. For the experimental group Kinesio Tape and for the control group
      Micropore Tape (MT) was applied over Gluteus Medius (GM) muscle. GM muscle's strength and EMG
      activity were noted in supine and during the Single-Leg Squat Test (SLST) respectively before
      and after the intervention. Hip abductor muscle strength measured through a maximum voluntary
      isometric contraction (MVIC) and GM activation measured through EMG. Handheld dynamometer
