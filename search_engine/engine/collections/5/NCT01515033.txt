      indicator in evaluating the ventilation/perfusion relationship in patients over a wide range
      conditions. Variations in PETCO2 have been shown to reflect changes in both cardiac output
      and pulmonary blood flow in animals and humans under constant ventilation. In this regard, it
      has been shown that patients with cardiac disease have an abnormally low PETCO2 during
      exercise, especially those with an impaired response of cardiac output during exercise
