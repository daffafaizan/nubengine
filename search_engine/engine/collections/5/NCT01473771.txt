      compare the Caring Letters intervention (with usual care) to usual care without the caring
      letters. Participants will be recruited from inpatient psychiatry units of collaborating
      military and Veterans Affairs (VA) sites and randomized to either a group that receives
      letters (Caring Letters group) or a group that does not receive letters (Usual Care group).
      The methodology of the intervention is updated with emails instead of postal letters. This
      study fills an important gap in the evidence base for the Caring Letter intervention through
      a methodologically rigorous research design.
