      (AECOPD) pose burdens to the healthcare system and patients. A current gap in knowledge is
      whether a pre-discharge screening and educational tool, administered to patients with COPD,
      reduces readmissions and emergency department (ED) visits.

      A single center, randomized trial of patients admitted with AECOPD. Patients will be
      randomized to control (standard care) or "bundle" group in which patients receive smoking
      cessation counseling, screening for gastroesophageal reflux disease and depression or
      anxiety, standardized inhaler teaching, and a 48-hour post-discharge phone call.
