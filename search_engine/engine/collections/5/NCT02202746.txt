    
      Lucitanib is a selective, orally available tyrosine kinase inhibitor targeting FGFR1-3,
      VEGFR1-3, and PDGFRα and β, with activity in relevant cell lines and animal models.

      The first in human trial of lucitanib demonstrated that daily dosing with lucitanib can
      provide durable clinical responses in patients with FGFR1- or 11q (FGF3, FGF4, Cyclin D1, or
      FGF19)-amplified breast cancer. RECIST partial responses (PRs) were also observed in patients
      not known to have FGF abnormalities.

      Based on these results, this study is designed to explore the safety and anti-tumor activity
      of daily lucitanib in breast cancer patients with and without alterations of the FGF pathway.
