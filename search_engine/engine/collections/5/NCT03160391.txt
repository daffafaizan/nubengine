      local communities in Ontario, Canada. Children with developmental delays, learning
      disabilities, or previous arts training were excluded from the study.

      Participants were randomly allocated to one of two groups

        1. Dance intervention group

        2. Music intervention group

      To establish baseline performance levels and have a comparison, a passive control group was
      collected from the same towns using the same exclusion criteria.

      Data analysis Difference scores were calculated for each measure by subtracting each
      participant's second testing session data from the first. When appropriate, iterative
      trimming with a 3 SD cutoff was used, by subject and by condition, to remove outliers.
      Results for each measure were analyzed using one-way ANOVAs (analysis of variance) for the
      between-subjects factor of training group (music, dance, or control).
