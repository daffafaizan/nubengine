      substantially higher survival rates for those who suffer with chronic illness. Consequently,
      the prevalence of chronic illness has risen significantly in recent years, such that one out
      of every four youth in the United States currently lives with a chronic illness. The health
      and well-being of these youth is directly impacted by the degree to which they adhere to
      their treatment regimen. However, treatment regimens for chronic illness can be highly
      complex, making adherence problematic, particularly when combined with deficits in memory and
      executive functioning concomitant with many chronic illnesses. Adherence also tends to
      deteriorate over time; the youth's motivation or commitment to treatment may decline as
      symptoms improve or negative side effects occur. With low adherence comes worsening symptoms
      and significantly greater risk for serious medical complications and mortality in young
      adulthood. The costs associated with low adherence, such as the need for additional care, are
      also substantial both for the patient and society.

      While a number of factors have been found to impact treatment adherence, risk for
      non-adherence-across varied forms of chronic illness-is markedly elevated when the youth
      lacks disease- and treatment-related knowledge and when parents provide little supervision
      for carrying out regimen tasks. With nearly 90% of youth with chronic illness expected to
      survive and therefore transition from pediatric care into adult-focused healthcare systems,
      it is critically important to empower youth to take ownership of their own healthcare. To do
      so, tools there is a need to provide accessible, affordable tools that can effectively
      increase patients' skills and knowledge for managing their illness and support on-going
      adherence to their treatment regimen.

      The purpose of this project is to test the efficacy of Planet K, a mobile and web-based
      technology infrastructure specifically designed to (a) enhance youths' chronic kidney
      disease- and treatment-related knowledge through interactive and game-based educational
      materials; (b) support adherence to the treatment regimen through customized task prompts via
      mobile and web-based delivery; and (c) promote patient-provider communication through
      real-world data collection and feedback loops. Investigators will examine the effectiveness
      of the Planet K mobile app and website in improving treatment adherence, disease-related
      knowledge, transition readiness, condition management, and the psychological correlates of
      these variables in adolescents and young adults with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

      All participants will complete study measures at pre- and post-assessment time points. In
      total, participants will take part in this study for approximately 2 months from pre- to
      post-assessment. Families will be recruited to participate in either the treatment condition
      or the control group. Families in the treatment condition will receive the Planet K app and
      access to the associated website for the full duration of the study (4 months) between
      pre-test and post-test. Families in the control group will not receive access to the app and
      website but instead will be asked to complete a series of online questionnaires at each of
      the two data collection time points (pre-test, post-test).

      Investigators hypothesize that greater use (i.e., dosage) and prolonged use of Planet K will:
      increase disease-related knowledge, treatment adherence, self-efficacy for management of CKD,
      current CKD self-management behaviors, perceived severity of CKD, readiness to transition to
      independent self-care, and perceived benefits of CKD treatment, while also decreasing
      perceived barriers to CKD treatment. Moreover, investigators believe that improvement of
      these outcomes through use of Planet K will result in more positive mental health outcomes
      for participants, including lower depression and higher reported quality of life.
      Investigators expect that those in the treatment condition will have better outcomes than
      those in the control group on all of these measures at both midpoint and post-assessment time
      points. Finally, investigators expect all participants to report high usability, quality, and
      value of the Planet K mobile app and website and to positively rate their experience with
      Planet K.
