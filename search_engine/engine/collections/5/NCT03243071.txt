      United States. These disparities arise from various factors including unequal access to
      adequate medical care, perceived racial discrimination, and poor health literacy.The Center
      for Healthful Behavior Change (CHBC) has been involved in numerous initiatives to eradicate
      health disparities and have implemented NIH-funded interventions to address inequities in
      health. Interventions targeting patient-centered outcomes have been suboptimal because of
      inadequate infrastructure to support equitable contributions from stakeholders (patients,
      providers, and community leaders) in all aspects of the research process. This is crucial to
      promote sustainable effects regarding minority patients' ability to make informed decisions
      about participating in existing clinical trials. This study will address this gap, bringing
      together academic investigators and important stakeholders to develop a website providing
      access to culturally tailored videos to enhance awareness of clinical trial, health literacy,
      thus promoting participation in existing clinical trials.
