      controversial. Most of this controversy remains regarding the association between
      cardiovascular risk elevation and Testosterone replacement therapy in some studies.

      This protocol is a double blinded randomized placebo trial and 2 groups will be followed. The
      primary end-point of this research is the correlation between the serum testosterone and
      flow-mediated dilatation of the brachial artery (FMDAB), circulating levels of sICAM-1,
      sVCAM-1, E-selectin and progenitor endothelial cells.

      The secondary end-points include:

      (1) the evaluation of metabolic parameters: weight, abdominal circumference, glycaemia, total
      cholesterol, fractions and triglycerides, homeostasis model assessment index (HOMA) and
      bioelectrical impedance parameters; and (2) hormonal parameters: total testosterone levels,
      sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), Luteinizing Hormone (LH) , Follicle stimulating hormone
      (FSH) and Estradiol.
