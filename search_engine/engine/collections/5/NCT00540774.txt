      Hypothesis: microstructural, metabolic, vascular, protein, genomic and metabolomics
      biomarkers of oral pathology can be used to detect, predict and map oral pathology,
      especially neoplasia.

      Researchers of the Beckman Laser Institute (BLI) have developed many non-invasive imaging
      modalities for assessment of oral tissue. This protocol will allow data acquisition with
      these multiple modalities to allow validation of data. Imaging modalities to be utilized
      include:

        1. Coherence and Doppler Tomography (OCT)

        2. Laser Speckle Imaging (LSI)

        3. Photon Migration Spectroscopy (PMS)

        4. Autofluorescence Imaging

      In addition, saliva samples from the patients will be analyzed and the resulting data
      regarding the dysregulation in the activities of genes, proteins and other molecules will be
      correlated with findings from different imaging systems with respect to the stage of oral
      carcinogenesis.
