      weeks, they are paid simply for wearing the Fitbit. After that, they are regularly paid for
      either meeting CDC guidelines for moderate physical activity (PA) or increasing their PA by
      at least 10% from the preceding week. Moderate PA is defined as walking for at least 100
      steps per minute for at least 10 minutes at a time. One minute of vigorous PA, over 175
      steps/minute, counts as two minutes of moderate PA.

      In addition to weekly bonuses, there are also bonuses for achieving all goals in 1 month, 3
      month, and 6 month intervals. In cases where all three team members received a bonus, their
      bonuses are doubled. Individuals also fill out weekly questionnaires about their work
      attendance, as well as longer questionnaires at baseline, three months, and six months.
