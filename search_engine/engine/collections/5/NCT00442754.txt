    
      Vaccination with autologous dendritic cells pulsed with allogeneic melanoma cell lysate
      (MelCancerVac) in combination with the Cox-2 inhibitor of celecoxib for the treatment of
      patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Adjuvant Aldara
      cream will be used as adjuvant for induction of inflammation at the injection site, and the
      lymphocyte growth factor of interleukin-2 (IL-2) will be given as s.c. injection. The
      treatment aims at boosting the patient's specific immune system against the cancer cells.

      Patients with disseminated, inoperable NSCLC after chemotherapy and patients not wanting
      chemotherapy for which no other systemic treatments can be offered.

      Primary objective: to measure the antigen specific immunological reaction between vaccine
      antigens and the patients' immune system in vivo and in vitro.

      Secondary objectives: to estimate the patients' survival time, to estimate response according
      to RECIST criteria, and to estimate the patients' quality of life during the study period.

      The study is designed as an open, phase II, clinical study and will be carried out in
      accordance with the present protocol, ICH/GCP Guidelines and national, regulatory
      requirements.

      The first patient is expected to be included towards the end of 2006. Inclusion period will
      continue for 2 years. Follow-up will continue for approx. 6 months prior to reporting.

      Fifty patients are planned for inclusion. In case none of the first fourteen (14) evaluable
      patients will respond, the inclusion and the study will be discontinued.
