      whether there exist an autoimmune cause. whether the patients receive immune therapy or not
      will depend on the type and titter of the autoimmune antibody as well as the severity of the
      symptom. At 3 and 6 months later, all patients will be followed-up, and the positive
      autoimmune antibody will be redetected. the clinical manifest, clinical data, medication and
      treatment outcome will be recorded and analyzed, to study the diagnostic value of autoimmune
      antibody detection in new and chronic epilepsy
