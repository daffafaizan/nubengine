      Name of Investigational Product: Microgynon 30®; Evotaz®

      Name of active ingredients: Ethinylestradiol, levonorgestrel; atazanavir, cobicistat

      Study title: The effect of atazanavir/cobicistat on the pharmacokinetics of an oral
      contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel (Microgynon 30®) in healthy
      women

      Phase of study: Phase I

      Objectives: The objectives of this study are:

      Primary

      -To assess the pharmacokinetics of ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel and atazanavir/cobicistat
      during co-administration in HIV negative female healthy volunteers

      Secondary

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel and
           atazanavir/cobicistat when co-administered to HIV negative female healthy volunteers

        -  To investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms in drug disposition genes
           and drug exposure

      Study design: 57 days (excluding screening and follow up), open label, cross-over,
      pharmacokinetic study

      Indication: Not applicable

      Methodology: Measurements of steady state pharmacokinetic profiles of plasma
      ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel and atazanavir/cobicistat

      Planned sample size: Up to 30 female healthy volunteers will be enrolled at baseline in order
      to achieve 18 completing the study

      Summary of eligibility criteria: Healthy female participants as determined by medical
      history, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory evaluations
      will be eligible to participate in the study. Women of childbearing potential must not be
      nursing or pregnant. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at
      screening.

      Number of study centres: One

      Duration of treatment: 57 days (excluding screening and follow up visits)

      Dose and route of administration: All participants will be administered Microgynon 30®
      (ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel 30 micrograms/150 micrograms) and Evotaz® (atazanavir 300
      mg/cobicistat 150 mg) as follows:

      GROUP 1:

      Microgynon 30® for 21 days Followed by Microgynon 30® for 21 days plus Evotaz® for 14 days
      Followed by Evotaz® for 14 days

      GROUP 2:

      Evotaz® for 14 days followed by 7 days wash-out Followed by Microgynon 30® for 21 days plus
      Evotaz® for 14 days Followed by Microgynon 30® for 14 days (participants may chose to
      complete a 21 day pack)

      Criteria for evaluation: Pharmacokinetic parameters of ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel and
      atazanavir/cobicistat will be evaluated on blood drawn on day 14, 35 and 56 at 0 (pre-dose),
      1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 24 hours post dose

      Safety and tolerability of medications will also be assessed by questions, physical
      examination and laboratory parameters. These will be performed at regular intervals during
      the drug study.

      Primary Endpoint: Steady state plasma concentrations of ethinylestradiol/levonorgestrel and
      atazanavir/cobicistat during co-administration in HIV negative female healthy volunteers

      Secondary End point: Safety and tolerability of the studied drugs during co-administration

      Relationship between genetic polymorphisms and exposure to the studied drugs
