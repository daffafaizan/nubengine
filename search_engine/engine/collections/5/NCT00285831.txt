    
      This is a multicenter study consisting of a Screen and Retest phase conducted in two separate
      days separated by a two-week period. After providing written informed consent and meeting
      protocol-defined inclusion criteria at Screen, patients will be administered the Wide Range
      Achievement Test 3 (WRAT3) to ensure adequate word reading ability with which to complete the
      self-report forms. Patients who achieve a satisfactory score will be interviewed using the
      Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Afterwards, each patient will first
      complete the 46 item Mood and Anxiety Symptom List in Epilepsy (MAS-E) and then five
      additional questionnaires in random order. Patients will also be given the opportunity to be
      rated by a proxy (e.g., caregiver, family member, friend) who will also complete the MAS-E.

      Patients will return the completed documents to the investigator and be given an additional
      MAS-E to take home. In the Retest phase, patients will be asked to complete the MAS-E again
      exactly 14 days from the date of the Screen visit. The proxy will also be given an additional
      MAS-E and be asked to complete the MAS-E exactly 14 days from completion of the first MAS-E.
      The documents shall be returned to the clinic via U.S. mail on the same day of completion. It
      is not necessary to have a proxy to participate in this study.

      Total study participation takes 2 weeks and approximately one visit to the clinic for the
      screening visit.
