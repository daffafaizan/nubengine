    
      A randomized, controlled, double-blind, clinical trial with intent-to-treat analysis.
      Eighty-four patients with nonspecific chronic low back pain will be randomly into a study
      group and control group. One week following the baseline evaluation, the study group will
      receive a contact total insole made of ethyl vinyl acetate and the control group will receive
      a flat insole made of the same material, color and density. The groups will be evaluated
      after 6, 12 and 24 weeks of insole use. The following assessment parameters will be employed:
      low back pain numerical pain scale; functional capacity (Oswestry and roland morris
      questionnaire, six minute walk test and timed to up and go test); quality of life (Short
      Form-36) and foot pressure analysis using the AMCube FootWalk Pro program.
