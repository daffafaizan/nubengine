      treat people who have prostate cancer. Study assessments will include adverse events,
      prostatic-specific antigen (PSA) levels, and prostate biopsies.

      The study will enroll approximately 120 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to a treatment group that will receive leuprorelin 11.25 mg (as
      one injection) or to an untreated observation group. Patients in the leuprorelin group will
      also receive bicalutamide 50 mg, a non-steroidal antiandrogen, once daily for 15 days to
      prevent a flare-up.

      This multi-center trial will be conducted in France. The overall time to participate in this
      study is 12 months. After the screening visit, participants will make 6 visits to the clinic.
