      I. To assess the efficacy of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) as a single agent in patients with
      metastatic inflammatory breast cancer (IBC) and non-IBC triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the association between biomarkers in the peripheral blood and tumor
      tissue, such as PD-L1 expression, with safety and efficacy for IBC or non-IBC TNBC patients
      treated with MK-3475.

      II. To determine the disease control rate of metastatic IBC or non-IBC TNBC patients who have
      achieved clinical response or stable disease to the systemic therapy.

      III. To investigate the association between biomarkers and efficacy by ribonucleic acid
      (RNA)-sequencing of exosomes in blood and tumor for IBC or non-IBC TNBC patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over approximately 30 minutes on day 1.
      Courses repeat every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at approximately 1 and 3
      months.
