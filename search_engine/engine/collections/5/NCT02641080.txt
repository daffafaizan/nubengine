      a mobile compression device provide equivocal results for preventing Deep Vein Thrombosis
      (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE) after total joint arthroplasty? Participants were
      randomized to either receive aspirin and mobile pneumatic compression devices or aspirin
      alone as outpatient DVT prophylaxis as their standard of care after primary total hip and
      total knee arthroplasty. Participants randomized to the compression device group were asked
      to wear the compression devices for 20 hours a day for 2 weeks along with taking an aspirin
      (325mg once a day), per standard of care. Participants randomized to aspirin alone took 325
      mg per day. Participant usage information from Active Care +S.F.T. mobile devices was
      collected. The information was recorded at the participant's first follow up visit occurring
      between 7-21 days post-surgery. All of the participants were asked to keep a checklist
      indicating aspirin intake compliance each day, which was returned at their first follow up
      visit. Participants randomized to mobile pneumatic compression device and aspirin (325 mg)
      were asked to complete a satisfaction questionnaire about the compression device at their
      first follow up visit. Participants received a phone call from a member of the research team
      approximately 90 days post-op. The call was necessary to assess if any participants have been
      diagnosed with DVT at another hospital.
