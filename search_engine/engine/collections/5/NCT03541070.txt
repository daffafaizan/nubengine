      Classification were included in the study. Balance was assessed by Pediatric Berg Balance
      Test (PBBT), Timed and Go Test (TUGT), and standing on one leg test. Kinesiology taping (KT)
      with facilitation technique was applied on bilateral quadriceps and tibialis anterior muscles
      and the assessments were repeated 1 hour after application. The comparison between before and
      after taping was analyzed.
