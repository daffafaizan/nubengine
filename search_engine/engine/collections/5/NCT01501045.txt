      evaluate the central mechanisms of pain modulation, their location and role in pain reduction
      through enhancement or suppression of activity in the relevant brain regions. In other words,
      cortical regions that may be implicated in CPM will be determined by augmenting or
      interrupting their activity via rTMSapplied to the areas under investigation. The regions
      will be the pain network sites, which are assumed to control the top-down influence on CPM
      and are superficial enough to be stimulated by the magnetic coil. These include primarily
      DLPFC (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and OFC (orbitofrontal cortex), with possible later
      addition of other relevant sites such as ACC (anterior cortex cinguli), insula and
      somatosensory cortices, etc. Since rTMS may be administered in a manner that either reduces
      or enhances the excitability of the stimulated cortical region, it should be possible to
      clarify the inhibitory or excitatory role of these regions in the CPM process. In summary,
      the planned studies should allow for identifying the cortical regions of the descending pain
      system, which are critical as starting points for the top-down modulation of CPM.
