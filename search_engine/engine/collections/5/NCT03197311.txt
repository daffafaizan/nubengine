      application improves adherence to narcotic analgesic use and their disposal and patient
      satisfaction post-surgical extraction of third molars in an outpatient setting. Eligible
      consented subjects will be randomized into either the mobile app group or the control group.
      Both groups will receive standard of care which includes prescription of postoperative
      narcotic and NSAID analgesics and usual postoperative instructions.For the mobile group, the
      Medable Axon Software developed by Stanford University will be used to customize a mobile
      application that will be used one week post surgery to monitor postoperative analgesic
      consumption and disposal practices, pain control, and patient satisfaction, In the control
      group, case report forms will be used to gather data from the electronic medical records and
      a telephone survey will be done one week post surgery to obtain data on patient satisfaction.
      A total of 20 consecutive eligible patients will be enrolled in this pilot trial..
