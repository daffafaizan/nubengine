      site for many of the research team's previous HIV (Human Immunodeficiency Virus) and HCV
      (Hepatitis C Virus) testing studies. Dr. Beaudoin (PI) is an attending physician at the Rhode
      Island Hospital ED. Our multi-disciplinary team consists of researchers with extensive
      experience in HIV and HCV testing research, intervention development and testing, and
      qualitative, quantitative and cost-effectiveness research.

      First, the investigators will examine our primary objective in this R34 pilot RCT( Randomized
      Controlled Trial) of comparing the persuasive health communication intervention to the video.
      Second, the investigators can compare WITHIN study arms (HIV/HCV counselor arm, ED medical
      staff arm) and ACROSS these study arms uptake of HIV/HCV testing among participants. Second,
      the design permits the investigators to obtain initial efficacy data of the persuasive health
      communication intervention when used by HIV/HCV counselors vs. ED medical staff (ACROSS study
      arms), as well as compared to the video (WITHIN study arms). Third, the design replicates our
      subsequent R01 RCT when the investigators compare HIV/HCV screening uptake when conducted
      solely by HIV/HCV counselors vs. ED medical staff.
