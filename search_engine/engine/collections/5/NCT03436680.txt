      I. Examine the feasibility of using a home-based neurofeedback system and dry
      electroencephalography (EEG) cap to treat chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the effects of home-based neurofeedback (HBNF) on symptoms of (CIPN) versus a
      wait list (WL) control group in cancer patients.

      II. Estimate the effects of home-based neurofeedback (HBNF), versus WL, on the cortical and
      subcortical brain regions associated with CIPN.

      III. Estimate the effects of a HBNF on other aspects of pain, cancer-related symptoms,
      quality of life (QOL), and mental health.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Participants complete at least neurofeedback training sessions over 30 minutes 2
      times a week for up to 5 weeks.

      GROUP II: Participants receive standard of care.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 1 week for Group I and 6 weeks for
      Group II.
