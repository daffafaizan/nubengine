      instrumentation of all canals was done. Canal preparation was conducted using a step-back
      technique. The working lengths were determined and confirmed by radiography. Sterile normal
      saline solution was used for intra-canal irrigation. Root canals were obturated with
      gutta-percha and sealer using lateral condensation technique. After placing a cotton pellet
      in the pulp chamber, the access cavity was closed with Cavit.

      In pulpotomy treatment with CEM/MTA (Arm 2): The teeth were anesthetized. Pulpotomy procedure
      of removing inflamed pulp tissue to the stump level was done. Homeostasis was achieved by
      irrigating the cavity with sterile normal saline and application of small pieces of sterile
      cotton pellets. The pulpal wound was covered with an approximately 2-mm-thick layer of
      MTA/CEM cement. Pulp chambers were then covered with a wet cotton pellet and sealed with
      Cavit.
