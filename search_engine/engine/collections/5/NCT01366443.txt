      of care, qualitative immunochromatographic test for the detection (in vitro) of amniotic
      fluid in cervico-vaginal secretions of women with suspected rupture of membranes (ROM) during
      pregnancy. The ROM PLUS detects a specific Combo protein present in amniotic fluid of
      pregnant women in all trimesters of pregnancy. This specific protein combo is unique and
      found only in amniotic fluid, therefore can be used as a specific marker for the diagnosis of
      ROM. This biomarker is an isoform of a similar biomarkers called Amni-Sure and ActimProm and
      was recently approved by the FDA for clinical use. Like these protein markers ( AmniSure or
      ActimProm) which have been used to diagnose PROM, this particular protein isoform tested for
      ROM PLUS is in low concentration in other body fluids such as maternal blood, cord blood,
      urine and semen.
