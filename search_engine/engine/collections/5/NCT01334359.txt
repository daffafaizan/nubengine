      and cognition of school-aged children by examining the effects of a 9-month exercise
      intervention on basic and applied aspects of cognition in preadolescent children. From a
      basic measurement perspective, event-related brain potentials, MRI, fMRI, and behavioral
      indices of cognition will be studied during several tasks aimed at assessing various aspects
      of executive control. Preliminary research has observed faster and more efficient performance
      in high-fit, relative to low-fit, children and adults using neuroelectric measures that
      reflect attentional allocation to environmental stimuli and response monitoring processes,
      along with behavioral measures that reflect response speed and accuracy. These preliminary
      findings indicate greater top-down attentional control may be associated with increases in
      physical activity. From an applied measurement perspective, preliminary research has found
      that children with greater aerobic fitness perform better on standardized achievement tests
      of reading and mathematics, compared to children with lower aerobic fitness, suggesting that
      exercise may be related to academic performance in an applied school setting. To date, no
      causal evidence exists regarding the effects of physical activity on neuroelectric,
      behavioral, or applied school performance indices of cognition in children. Accordingly, this
      proposal investigates an aerobic activity training intervention on these measures of
      cognition using three tasks that require variable amounts of executive control, and on the
      Illinois Standardized Achievement Test using a randomized control design in which
      participants are assigned to an afterschool physical activity program or a wait-list control
      group. Given recent trends identifying decreased levels of physical activity and health
      status in preadolescents, the understanding of the potential benefits of physical activity on
      cognition is of great interest. It is imperative that factors positively influencing
      cognitive function of children be examined to maximize health and effective functioning of
      individuals as they progress through the lifespan.
