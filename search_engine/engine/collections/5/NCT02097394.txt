      clear. The possible reasons for the recurrence of colon polyps include intestinal
      inflammation (e.g., Ulcerative colitis), intestinal flora imbalance (the benefit intestinal
      bacteria reduced, which lead to diarrhea or constipation), long-term indigestion. The
      investigators propose to examine whether digestion enzyme (Combizym) and intestinal flora
      drugs(Bifidobacteria) can decease recurrence rate of colon polyps
