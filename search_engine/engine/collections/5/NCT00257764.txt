      patients. Dysphagia is associated with an increased risk of aspiration pneumonia, dehydration
      and malnutrition. Despite the development and implementation of several strategies of
      managing dysphagia after stroke, Few have been evaluated by means of randomised controlled
      trials.

      Comparisons: This study aims to compare stroke patients with dysphagia assigned to receive
      usual swallowing care, prescribed by the attending physician; standardised low intensity
      intervention comprising swallowing compensation strategies and diet prescription; or
      standardised high intensity intervention and dietary prescription .
