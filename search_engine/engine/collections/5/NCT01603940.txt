      and mortality. Endothelial dysfunction and vascular rigidity are two pathophysiological
      mechanisms that may explain this relationship. Recent publications showed that both ACEi
      (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor-induced) and ARB (angiotensin receptor blocker) were
      capable of improving vascular stiffness and endothelial function, and that these effects
      occurred despite blood pressure reduction.

      This study main objective is to assess if ARB (losartan) effects are different from ACEi
      (benazepril) in endothelial function in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2 and blood
      pressure not controlled by amlodipine and its relationship to statin current use.

      Secondary analysis of vascular stiffness will be measured by pulse wave velocity and
      augmentation index. Echocardiographic parameters, such as indexes of diastolic function, will
      also be measured.
