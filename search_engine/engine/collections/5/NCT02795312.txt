      at Boston Medical Center's oncology clinic to promote engagement of low-income and minority
      smokers with cancer in smoking cessation. This training will follow an adapted MBSR
      curriculum designed by and for Boston Medical Center patients with chronic pain in the
      Integrated Medical Group Visit research program in Family Medicine. The investigators will
      tailor this adapted MBSR curriculum to address smoking cessation. To test the feasibility and
      acceptability of our intervention, the investigators will pilot test it with 30 patients over
      the course of three MBSR training programs (each cohort is 9 weeks). The investigators will
      acquire feasibility data (number of inquiries, number of sessions attended, and satisfaction
      with MBSR). Additionally, pre and post questionnaires will assess readiness to quit, stress
      level, and satisfaction with and acceptability of MBSR after every cohort). The primary
      outcome is engagement in smoking cessation treatment which includes counseling and/or
      pharmacotherapy. Additionally, the investigators will hold a focus group after each of the 3
      cohorts have completed the program to discuss acceptability of study materials as well as
      facilitators and barriers to participation in the training. Data collected from this study
      will generate preliminary data to successfully justify and secure future funding for a larger
      controlled study.
