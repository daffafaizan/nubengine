      Department of Clermont Ferrand University Hospital, who satisfy the Joint Task Force of the
      EFNS and PNS definite CIDP criteria. Two control groups will be studied in parallel,
      including 15 healthy volunteers on one side, and 15 patients with CMT-1A on the other side
      (proven by genetic testing). Using a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, we will obtain
      DTI scans of brachial plexus of these 3 groups, prepare fractional anisotropy (FA) maps, and
      compare these values between groups. Investigator will evaluate MRI imaging findings too
      (coronal STIR, T1-weighted images,and DWIs). MRI studies will be reviewed independently by
      two neuroradiologists, blinded to clinical informations. In all patients with CIDP,
      investigator will also performs clinical evaluation and electroneuromyography. Correlation
      between FA values clinical indices will be examined.
