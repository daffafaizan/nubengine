    
      During the Induction Immunotherapy phase (4 x 21 day cycles) of the study, participants will
      receive Ipilimumab and Nivolumab on Day 1 of each cycle for 4 cycles. Participants will
      receive the p53 vaccine on Days 1 and 15 of cycle 1 and then again on Day 8 of Cycle 2.

      Beginning on Day 1 of Cycle 5 participants will start Maintenance Immunotherapy. During this
      phase of the study, participants will receive Nivolumab only on Day 1 of every 4 week period.
      Participants will also receive the p53 vaccine three additional times (every 4 weeks over a
      12 week period). During Maintenance Immunotherapy you will continue to receive Nivolumab only
      on Day 1 of each additional 4 week period that you take part until your disease progresses.

      The Retreatment phase of the study may be available to participants whose doctor feels they
      would benefit from retreatment and if they qualify for this retreatment. During retreatment,
      participants would receive the combination of Ipilimumab and Nivolumab or Nivolumab alone
      every three weeks for a maximum of one additional year.

      P53 Vaccine production

      The p53 vaccine will be made by inserting the p53 gene (a gene is a hereditary unit of all
      living organism within a cell) into a subset of the participant's own white blood cells. The
      insertion of the gene into their white blood cells will occur in the laboratory, after their
      cells have been extracted from their body through a procedure called leukopheresis (similar
      to dialysis).
