    
      This is an open, randomized 3-way crossover study in 12 healthy volunteers. Subjects will
      receive single oral 30-mg doses of nitisinone as a suspension (fasting and with food) and as
      hard gelatin capsules (fasting only). There will be a 2-week washout period between the
      doses.

      There will be a screening visit within 3 weeks prior to the first dose. During each treatment
      period, subjects will be admitted to the clinic from the afternoon on the day before drug
      administration (i.e., on Day -1) and remain at the clinic until the 48-hour post-dose blood
      sample has been collected in the morning of Day 3. They will then return for ambulatory visit
      in the morning of Day 4 (72-hour sample). A follow-up visit will take place 7-14 days after
      the last dose.
