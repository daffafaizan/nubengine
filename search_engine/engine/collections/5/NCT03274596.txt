      main fat-soluble vitamin responsible for the protection of cell membranes against
      peroxidation, thus, it protects polyunsaturated fatty acids from peroxidation which is a step
      in the pathogenesis of ROP.

      Previous research on the roles of vitamin E, in the prevention of BPD and ROP was halted
      because of complications involving sepsis and necrotising enterocolitis. These complications
      were caused by the compositions of vitamin E oral presentations, which contain polyethylene
      glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol and, polysorbate 80. These substances, which are used as
      excipients, may generate adverse effects in premature newborns. These preparations were not
      used in this project to avoid the development of necrotising enterocolitis, and because these
      formulations are not commercially available in Mexico.

      The infants were randomly assigned to one of two groups using a computerized random number
      generator sequence; this process was handled by the hospital pharmacy staff. The treated
      group, received vitamin E 12.5 IU orally every 12 hours, from 72 h after birth until 28 days
      of age, the first blood sample collected from the newborns before the intervention was
      considered the baseline, and subsequent samples were obtained at 15 and 28 days of age.

      Control group: received orally sterile water (placebo)
