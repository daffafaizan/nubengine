    
      Background: Bismuth quadruple therapy is currently the recommended first-line regimen for
      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection in regions with high clarithromycin resistance.
      Recent randomized trials showed that 7-day vonoprazan-based triple therapy is superior to
      7-day lansoprazole-based triple therapy in Japanese. A recent trial further showed that 7-day
      vonoprazan-based high dose amoxicillin dual therapy was non-inferior to 7-day
      vonoprazan-based triple therapy in Japanese. However, whether vonoprazan based dual, triple,
      and quadruple therapies are superior or non-inferior to lansoprazole based triple or
      quadruple therapy remains unknown.

      Objective: The investigators aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of 14-day
      vonoprazan-based dual therapy, triple therapy, bismuth quadruple therapy, reverse hybrid
      therapy, and lansoprazole-based bismuth quadruple therapy and triple therapy in the
      first-line treatment of H. pylori infection in this pilot study. The long-term changes in gut
      microbiota, antibiotic resistance, trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) levels, and metabolic
      parameters after eradication therapies will also be investigated.

      Methods: Using a block randomization with a block size of 16 in a 1:1 ratio, 320 eligible
      adult subjects aged 20 years or greater with at least two positive tests for H. pylori
      infection will be randomized to receive one of the following regimens: (A) vonoprazan-based
      triple therapy for 14 days (T-V14): vonoprazan 20mg twice daily, clarithromycin-XL 500mg
      twice daily, amoxicillin 1000mg twice daily for 14 days ; or (B) vonoprazan-based triple
      therapy for 7 days (T-V7): vonoprazan 20mg twice daily, clarithromycin-XL 500mg twice daily,
      amoxicillin 1000mg twice daily for 7 days ; or (C): vonoprazan-based dual therapy for 14 days
      (D-V14): vonoprazan 20mg twice daily, amoxicillin 750mg every 8 hour for 14 days; (D):
      vonoprazan-based high dose dual therapy for 14 days (HD-V14): vonoprazan 20mg twice daily,
      amoxicillin 750mg four times a day for 14 days; or (E) vonoprazan-based bismuth quadruple
      therapy for 14 days (BQ-V14) vonoprazan 20mg twice daily, bismuth tripotassium dicitrate 300
      mg three times a day, tetracycline 500mg three times a day, and metronidazole 500mg three
      times a day for 14 days; or (F) vonoprazan-based reverse hybrid therapy for 14 days (RH-V14):
      vonoprazan 20mg twice daily, and amoxicillin 1000mg twice daily for 14 days, plus
      clarithromycin-XL 500mg twice daily and metronidazole 500mg twice daily for the first 7 days
      ; or (G) lansoprazole-based bismuth quadruple therapy for 14 days (BQ-L14) lansoprazole 30mg
      twice daily, bismuth tripotassium dicitrate 300 mg three times a day, tetracycline 500mg
      three times a day, and metronidazole 500mg three times a day for 14 days; or (H)
      lansoprazole-based triple therapy for 14 days (T-L14): lansoprazole 30mg twice daily,
      clarithromycin-XL 500mg twice daily, amoxicillin 1000mg twice daily for 14 days. Subjects who
      fail after first-line therapy will be randomized to receive either vonoprazan-based
      levofloxacin triple therapy (LT-V14) containing vonoprazan 20mg twice daily, levofloxacin
      250mg twice daily, and amoxicillin 1000mg twice daily for 14 days or vonoprazan-based
      levofloxacin reverse hybrid therapy (LRH-V14) containing vonoprazan 20mg twice daily, and
      amoxicillin 1000mg twice daily for 14 days, plus levofloxacin 250mg twice daily and
      metronidazole 500mg twice daily for the first 7 days. The minimum inhibitory concentrations
      will be determined by agar dilution test. 23S ribosomal RNA and gyrase A mutations will be
      determined by PCR methods followed by direct sequencing in a subgroup of patients. The TWB2.0
      SNP array will be used for genotyping of genome wide single nucleotide polymorphism. Fecal
      and oral samples will be collected for 16S and shot-gun sequencing at baseline, week 2, week
      8, year 1, and year 2. Metabolic parameters will be measured at baseline, week 8, year 1, and
      year 2. Modified carnitine challenge test (mCCT) will be done to assess the production of
      urine TMAO at baseline, week 2, week 8, year 1, and year 2 in a subgroup of study subjects.

      Outcome analysis: The primary outcome is the eradication rate in the first-line treatment.
      The secondary outcomes are the compliance, frequency of adverse events, the overall
      eradication rate after two treatments. The long-term outcomes are the cumulative eradication
      rate, the changes of gut microbiota, antibiotic resistance, TMAO production, and metabolic
      parameters at year 1 and year 2.
