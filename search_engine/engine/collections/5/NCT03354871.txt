      consequently, leading to poor task performances and in some cases may cause injury to the
      patients. Medically, fatigue is a non-specific symptom, which means that it has many possible
      causes and accompanies many different conditions. Elevated fatigue is an indication that a
      person may not be fit-to-task (i.e., task efficacy).The investigators main goal is to use
      readily available body-worn sensors, such as an activity wrist-band, to continuously monitor
      for fatigue as a possible antecedent to predictions of task-efficacy in the area of
      Obstetrics and Gynecology. This study is anchored in prior research which established basic
      models that correlate between heart-rate variability (HRV) and fatigue. Specific to this
      study, the investigators would like to further establish the validity of such models at the
      individual level, also with the perspective of fatigue as an early predictor of task
      performance related to practices in Obstetrics and Gynecology. The investigators aim is to
      extend HRV based models with additional personal measures (e.g., age, weight, activity
      level), possibly with the extraction of additional data-driven features, to improve model
      accuracy at the individual level. The investigators will also try to find relationships
      between such measurements and task effectiveness via the gathering of self-reports regarding
      on-the-job task performances.
