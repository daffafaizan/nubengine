      nervous system, resulting in loss of arm function from symptoms including general weakness,
      loss of power, motor control abnormalities and spasticity.

      The Radiofrequency Microstimulator (RFM) System consists of fully implanted, leadless
      stimulators that are injected in a minimally invasive procedure. RFMs measure 16.7mm long,
      2.4mm dia. and can be placed directly at target nerves in the arm to drive specific muscle
      contractions. This system has demonstrated efficacy in arm rehabilitation for stroke patients
      who suffer from loss of arm function similar to that experienced by some TBI patients.

      This feasibility study will evaluate if the RFM system can be used to assist patients in the
      rehabilitation of arm function following TBI. TBI patients that pass screening will have up
      to 7 RFM devices implanted in their disabled arm. After implantation, patients will
      participate in four phases of therapy, each lasting 12 weeks and consisting of standard
      occupational therapy occurring at regular intervals at home and in the clinic. In the first
      phase, therapy will not involve use of the RFM System. In the second phase, occupational
      therapy will be assisted by electrical stimulation using the RFM System. The third and fourth
      phases will repeat the therapies of the first and second phases, respectively. Arm function
      following therapy with RFM stimulation will be compared to arm function after therapy without
      RFM stimulation.
