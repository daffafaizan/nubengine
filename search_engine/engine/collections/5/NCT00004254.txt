      with inoperable malignant mesothelioma. II. Determine the objective response rate and
      duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Within 2 weeks of staging procedures, patients receive
      raltitrexed IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed
      every 6 weeks until disease progression and then every 8 weeks thereafter for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study.
