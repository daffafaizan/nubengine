      identified all patients who underwent hip fracture surgery from January 1 2015, to December
      31, 2016 in the CHU of Montpellier. The exclusion criteria were: multiple trauma victims, two
      hip fractures in the same patient and single shot spinal anesthesia. In our institution the
      investigators used to perform three types of anesthesia: general anesthesia (GA), continuous
      spinal anesthesia (CSA) and combined plexus blocks (CPB). The investigators therefore made
      three groups GA, CSA and CPB and used a propensity score to make these groups comparable. The
      matching criteria were age, arterial hypertension, ASA status, Frailty score, chronic cardiac
      failure and type of surgery.
