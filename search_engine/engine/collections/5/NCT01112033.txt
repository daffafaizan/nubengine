    
      1. To analyze biliverdin reductase (BLVRA) expression in the liver of HVC infected patients
           undergoing liver biopsy followed by standard antiviral treatment (peg-interferon plus
           ribavirin combination therapy) and patients with other forms of liver diseases
           undergoing liver biopsy as controls.

        2. To analyze BLVRA expression in peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) of therapeutically
           na√Øve HCV patients, during/after standard antiviral therapy and healthy controls.

        3. To analyze BVLRA genetic polymorphisms both in HCV infected patients and healthy
           controls.
