    
      Purpose: To investigate the effectiveness of health management of glycemic control and
      physical activity in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) using Smartphone application.

      Hypothesis: Clinical medical personnel can monitor data through the mobile app platform and
      provide personalized lifestyle adjustments based on the information provided by patients,
      thereby improving patient compliance and effectively self-health management in patients with
      T2DM. At the same time, through this system, medical personnel can understand the amount of
      physical activity of the patient during this period, and investigators can promptly encourage
      patients to reach the set goal of physical activity, which can improve the patient's physical
      status, so this study can bring a positive effect in both blood glucose and related
      biomarkers.

      Methods: This study will be a randomized controlled trial. Seventy adults (aged 20 to 60
      years) diagnosed with T2DM by the physician will recruited and randomly assigned to the
      mobile app group and the control group. Both groups will receive education by health
      professionals at Southern Medical Center and participants are required to wear fitness
      watches to record steps. Mobile app group: patients will need to download and use the
      Health2Sync app and report blood glucose data weekly, and be monitored and advised by medical
      personnel. Control group: Patients will be asked to self-manage and there is no intervention
      during the tracking process.
