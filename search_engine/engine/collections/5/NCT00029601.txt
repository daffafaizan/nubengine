      before and during movement in patients with focal dystonia. For a selective movement or task,
      certain muscles are normally recruited and others are inhibited at the cortical level. We
      hypothesize that a disturbance in this cortical inhibitory control could result in a failure
      to focus the desired motor action within the motor cortex (disturbed center surround
      inhibition) and may account for co-contraction of antagonist muscles and overflow into
      extraneous muscles in dystonic patients. Intracortical inhibition (ICI) and silent period
      (SP) are two major cortical inhibitory mechanisms demonstrated by transcranial magnetic
      stimulation (TMS). Alteration in these inhibitory mechanisms have been studied in dystonia at
      rest, however, as dystonic symptoms mainly occur with selective tasks or movements we plan to
      study intracortical inhibitory mechanisms before and during movement using different TMS
      paradigms.
