      exaggerated ovarian androgen response, dairy cream ingestion will stimulate white blood cells
      to generate an inflammatory response, and that there is a relationship between HCG-stimulated
      ovarian androgen secretion and the inflammatory response to dairy cream ingestion regardless
      of body fat status. Thirty (30) women with PCOS (10 normal weight with normal abdominal
      adiposity, 10 normal weight with increased abdominal adiposity and 10 obese) and 30 ovulatory
      control women (10 normal weight with normal abdominal adiposity, 10 normal weight with
      increased abdominal adiposity and 10 obese) will participate over a 3-year period.

      The investigator also hypothesizes that both salsalate and PCE administration for 12 weeks
      will attenuate the ovarian androgen response to HCG administration and the inflammatory
      response to dairy cream ingestion, reduce abdominal adiposity, increase insulin sensitivity
      and induce ovulation in normal weight women with PCOS. A subset of 16 women with PCOS of
      which 8 will receive salsalate (4 normal weight with normal abdominal adiposity and 4 normal
      weight with increased abdominal adiposity) and 8 will receive PCE (4 normal weight with
      normal abdominal adiposity and 4 normal weight with increased abdominal adiposity) will
      participate in this intervention over a 3-year period. This pilot project will help determine
      the feasibility of conducting a larger double-blind, randomized trial in women with PCOS to
      further test the latter hypothesis.
