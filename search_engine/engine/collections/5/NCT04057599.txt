      using two subjective grading systems, namely AGI grade as well as IFEED scoring system. The
      severity of POI after spine surgery thus could be stratified and then an investigation of
      possible risk factors could be identified. In addition, we will also investigate potential
      serum relevant biomarkers such as fatty acid-binding protein (i-FABP) , D-lactate (D-la), and
      lipopolysaccharide.
