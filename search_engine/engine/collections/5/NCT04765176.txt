      of infrarenal aortic aneurysm. The E-tegra Stent Graft will be implanted at the discretion of
      the treating physician.

      Participating physicians will provide their observations collected during routine care for
      patients they have decided to treat with the E-tegra stent graft. Informed consent of the
      patients to the use of their clinical records for study purposes will be obtained before
      their data will be collected in the post-market clinical follow-up study. All patients will
      be asked to complete questionaires focussing on the health status (HS) (SF-12) and Quality of
      Life (QoL) (WHOQOL-BREF).

      The period of data collection will be approximately 60 months from the date of intervention
      for each patient. Source document verification will be performed on 100% of the patients;
      data from all visits will be reviewed and verified against existing source documents.
      Complete DICOM image files of the CT scans as well as other imaging files (e.g. CEUS, MRT)
      will be sent to a CoreLab for independent second evaluation. There is no CoreLab screening
      before inclusion. All adverse events defined prior to study start, will be adjudicated by the
      Clinical Evaluation Committee (CEC).
