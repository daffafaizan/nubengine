      unresectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), although surgery offers the chance
      of cure. With combined-modality therapy with radiation therapy and chemotherapy, the
      prognosis of stage III NSCLC remains poor. Gefitinib has shown great efficacy in NSCLC
      patients with EGFR mutations. This study is to studying neoadjuvant gefitinib followed by
      surgery, followed by adjuvant gefitinib to see how well it works in treating patients with
      unresectable EGFR mutant stage III NSCLC.
