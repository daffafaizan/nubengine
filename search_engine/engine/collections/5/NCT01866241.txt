      than the western world and Post-Partum Hemorrhage (PPH) accounts for the biggest percentage
      of maternal morbidity and mortality (WHO, 2005; WHO, 2010). Maternal Mortality in Uganda is
      one of the highest in the world at 435 for every 100,000 and 25% of these are due to PPH
      happening within 24 hours after delivery. Oxytocin, the standard of care in PPH management
      has registered challenges like requirement of sterile injections, requirement of trained
      personnel, special supply chain/storage conditions like refrigeration and protection from
      light affecting maximum treatment outcomes especially in poorly resourced developing
      countries where these are not realized. It has been argued that any effort or developments
      based on physiological processes towards the reduction of this horrific PPH rate would
      greatly have a significant impact on the lives of families and women worldwide. Several
      scholars have thus stressed a vital need to develop simple, practical and inexpensive
      techniques relevant to prevent and treat PPH in developing countries.
