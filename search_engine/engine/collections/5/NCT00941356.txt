    
      Study Design:

      Double-blind, randomized (1:1 randomization), placebo-controlled, single center Canadian
      study.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the two study products. A randomization schedule
      will be generated by the sponsor for each participating centre. This schedule will link
      patient identification numbers to one of the two study products allocated at random. The
      schedule will be prepared on a 1:1 randomization ratio.

      The study products will be labelled with the patient identification number. Patients have to
      be randomized in the order in which they qualify from the screening phase for inclusion in
      the study.

      Patients withdrawn from the study retain their patient number if already given. New patients
      must always be allotted a new identification number (PIN).

      Study Duration:

      The duration of patient participation in the study will be between 22 and 23 days. The
      overall duration of the study is expected to be approximately 10 months; with subject
      recruitment proposed to start in March 2009, the last follow-up visit is expected in May
      2010. The actual overall study duration or subject recruitment period may vary.

      Number of Sites (inside and outside of Canada):

      One center in the province of Quebec will be involved in the study.
