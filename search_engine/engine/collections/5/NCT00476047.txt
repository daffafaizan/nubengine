      I. To estimate the progression-free survival at 2 years following administration of
      131I-tositumomab (tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab) in patients with CLL/SLL who
      achieve a complete remission (CR) or partial remission (PR) with prior therapy.

      II. To improve the response rate by administering 131I-tositumomab to patients who have
      achieved a PR not a CR after any prior therapy.

      III. To eliminate residual disease (documented by flow cytometry or polymerase chain reaction
      [PCR]) using 131I-tositumomab in patients who have achieved a CR after any prior therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicities of 131I-tositumomab in 1st remission patients with previously
      treated CLL/SLL.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tositumomab and iodine I 131 tositumomab intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes
      on day 0 and then again 7-14 days later over 30-60 minutes.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up weekly for 3 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.
