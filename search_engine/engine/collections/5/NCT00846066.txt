      To compare the addition of Hands on Training (HOT) to Web Based Training (WBT)on residents'
      skills, confidence, opinions and practice .

      Methods: Pediatric residents participated in WBT on preventive oral health. Then the WBT
      subjects were randomly assigned to receive HOT by a dentist, or WBT alone. All subjects were
      assessed on skills in the performance of an oral exam, by direct observation. Residents'
      confidence regarding oral health counseling, and their opinions about the importance of the
      incorporation of oral health into the well child visit, was measured by surveys utilizing a
      Likert scale. Residents' change in practice was assessed by a retrospective chart audit.
