    
      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one of the following treatments: Arm A:
      Trabectedin 1.3 mg/m2 d1 q 21 in 3 hours (central line) Arm B: Pegylated Liposomal
      Doxorubicin 40 mg/mq q 28 or Topotecan 4 mg/ m2 dd 1,8,15 q 28 or Gemcitabine 1000 mg/mq dd
      1, 8, 15 q 28 Weekly Paclitaxel 80 mg/ m2 dd 1, 8, 15 q 28 Carboplatin AUC 5-6 q 21 or 28
      Randomization will be stratified based on platinum-free interval (PFI) (PFI ≥ 0 and ≤ 6
      months vs. PFI > 6 months), presence / absence of measurable disease/number of previous
      chemotherapy lines, germline BRCA mutational status vs BRCAness phenotype.

      Platinum-free interval (PFI) is defined as the time from the last dose of the platinum
      containing regimen until the first date progression.

      Subjects will continue to receive chemotherapy treatment until disease progression (clinical
      progression meant as global deterioration in health status attributable to the disease
      requiring a change in therapy without objective evidence of progression is considered
      progression of disease), intolerability, patient refusal, investigator decision or death from
      any cause.

      Subjects will be evaluated every 12 weeks ± 1 week by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
      Tumors (RECIST 1.1) for objective radiographic response and radiographic disease progression.
