      Radiotherapy in combination with different forms of immune therapy such as anti-PD-(L)1,
      anti-CTLA4,immunocytokines, dendritic cell vaccination and Toll-like receptor agonists
      improved consistently local tumor control and very interestingly, lead to better systemic
      tumor control (the "abscopal" effect) and the induction of specific anti-cancer immunity with
      a memory effect. Moreover, as PD1/PD-L1 is upregulated by radiation and radiation can
      overcome resistance for PD-(L)1 blockage, their combination is logical.

      In small series, it has been shown that a new long-lasting remission can be induced by
      irradiating one tumor site in patients who showed cancer progression after an initial
      response to immune therapy. In these series, the original immune therapy was continued and
      the treatment was very well tolerated. In this study the progression-free survival after
      radiotherapy to a single lesion will be investigated in patients with stage IV non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC), who have at least achieved stable disease with immune therapy alone or
      concurrent immune therapy and chemotherapy.
