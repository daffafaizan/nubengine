    
      A randomized crossover design in 10 overweight/obese (BMI 26-40) men and 10 lean men (BMI
      18.5-25). The control will be water. Each subject will attend the HNU on six separate
      occasions. The five test meal challenges will involve subjects attending the Human Nutrition
      Unit (HNU) in the morning, after an overnight fast. The total time of test meal visits will
      be approximately 4Â½hours. They will be provided with a standardised meal, after which blood
      samples will be collected for the first 2hrs. The following five treatments will be tested:

      Treatment 1 Control - Water + Egg Yolk Mixture + 13C Octanoic Acid Treatment 2 HPL (High
      Protein Liquid): 30% protein; 30% fat and 40% carbohydrate (CHO) Treatment 3 LPL (Low Protein
      Liquid): 15% protein; 30% fat and 55% CHO Treatment 4 HPS (High Protein Solid): 30% protein;
      30% fat and 40% CHO Treatment 5 LPS (Low Protein Solid): 15% protein; 30% fat and 55% CHO
      Test meals will be of fixed nutritional composition for all participants. The liquid meal
      will be a milk/fruit smoothie mixture and the 'solid' will be in a milk jelly (set) form.

      Ad libitum pasta meal: 15% protein; 30% fat and 55% CHO as a homogenous mix and energy
      density of around 400kJ/100g - served in excess as a individual 600g portion to
      'help-yourself'.

      Subjective average appetite will be measured (every 30 min by visual analogue scales) over
      4hr and ad libitum food intake will measured 4hr after treatment consumption. Ad libitum
      lunch will be a homogenous pasta meal with tomato sauce and a bottle of water. Blood samples
      will be collected every 10 min for the first half hour, every 15 min for the second half hour
      and every 30mins subsequently. The breath gastric emptying measurement will be assessed using
      the 13Carbon (13C) Octanoic Acid stable isotopic technique19. This involves mixing the tracer
      into food and taking breath samples and measured by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. 13C
      Octanoic acid is a medium chain fatty acid which is rapidly absorbed in the duodenum and
      metabolised in the liver. Following oxidation, the resulting Carbon Dioxide (CO2) is excreted
      into breath (12 samples will be collected during the 4hr test day).
