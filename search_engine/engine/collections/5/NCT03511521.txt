      treatment of their underlying condition and who become hyperglycemic will be eligible.
      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to one of two arms: (1) to their standard basal
      bolus insulin the addition of NPH insulin given at the time of the steroid adminstration,
      adjusting the dose based on the dose of steroid; (2) an increase in the basal and prandial
      bolus insulin doses based on the dose of steroid. Glycemic control and the incidence of
      hypoglycemia will be assessed over the first 3 days after initiating these insulin regimens.
