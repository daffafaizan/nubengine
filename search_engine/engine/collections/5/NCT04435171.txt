    
      Patients who underwent open or robot-assisted renal transplantation at Bakirkoy Sadi Konuk
      Training and Research Hospital between June 2016 and December 2018 constituted the target
      population of this study. After application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the
      patient group was divided into two groups as per the surgical technique (i.e., open vs.
      robot-assisted). Demographic data, preoperative and postoperative data of all patients were
      collected prospectively. The quality of life of the patients was assessed preoperatively and
      on the postoperative 30th day
