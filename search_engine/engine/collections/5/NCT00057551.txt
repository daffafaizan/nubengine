      with significant functional impairment and high health care utilization. The combination of
      drug treatment and psychotherapy may be most effective in treating depression. This study
      will determine the effects of adjunctive psychotherapy in depressed patients who have failed
      to respond or have responded only partially to an initial trial medication.

      Participants receive an initial trial of antidepressant medication for 8 to 12 weeks.
      Participants who continue to have depressive symptoms are randomly assigned to add Cognitive
      Behavioral Analysis System of Psychotherapy (CBASP) or supportive therapy to their medication
      regimens or to continue pharmacotherapy alone for an additional 12 weeks. Assessments are
      made at 6 and 12 months post-treatment.
