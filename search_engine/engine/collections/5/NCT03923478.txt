    
      This multi-center randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the safety
      of ABI-M201 and its effects on disease activity measures in men and women with
      mildly-to-moderately active UC and ongoing treatment with mesalamine. The study will consist
      of 2 sequential, non-overlapping participant cohorts, separated by intervening interim
      analysis (IA). Both cohorts will involve 8-weeks of study drug treatment. Interim data from
      the initial treatment cohort (Cohort A) will inform decision to advance to the subsequent
      second cohort (Cohort B) and its dose selection. 20 subjects will be randomized to cohort A
      (1:1 allocation) and receive treatment with 1 capsule per day of ABI-M201 versus Placebo. 24
      subjects will be randomized to cohort B (3:1 allocation) and receive treatment with up to 5
      capsules one time a day of ABI-M201 versus Placebo.
