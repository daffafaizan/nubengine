      to initiating ADT and studied at three time points. Baseline (before first does of ADT), and
      at approximately weeks 6 and 24 while receiving ADT for prostate cancer. Study measures will
      be the same during each of three data acquisition time points and include ascertainment of
      venous blood to determine serum biochemical markers of muscle and bone metabolic activity,
      MRI and CT imaging studies to assess muscle strength, volume, composition, bone volume,
      density and strength, and validated tests of muscle strength. Subjects will serve as their
      own controls.
