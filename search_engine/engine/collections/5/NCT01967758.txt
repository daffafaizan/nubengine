    
      This Phase I clinical trial will examine the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a
      novel vaccine approach using a live-attenuated strain of Listeria monocytogenes expressing
      EGFRvIII and NY-ESO-1 antigens to induce proliferation of memory and effector T cells with
      the overall goal of promoting an immune response against high-grade astrocytic tumors.
