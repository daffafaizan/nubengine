    
      Because of the high incidence of toxicity and the relatively short-term follow-up of the
      patients due to the early ending of the Phase II placebo-controlled experiment, it is
      valuable to continue to get information on the long-term toxicity of AZT.

      This study provides AZT for 6 months to AIDS patients who were previously enrolled in the AZT
      Treatment IND protocol and to patients who qualify for AZT under the drug labeling. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 2 regimens for management of toxicity.
