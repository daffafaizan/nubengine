    
      Primary objective:

      To assess the proportion of successful initial phase of tissue expander/implant based breast
      reconstructions (no reconstruction failure or unexpected return to the operating room)
      following post-mastectomy radiation therapy in participants with AeroFormplaced.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To evaluate the rate of successful exchange of tissue expander for implant

        -  To evaluate the rate of reconstruction revisions

        -  To evaluate CTCAE acute and chronic toxicity rates, infections and cosmetic outcomes

        -  To evaluate dosimetry to treatment targets as well as organs at risk (heart, lungs) with
           AeroFormas compared to traditional reconstruction techniques.

        -  To evaluate time to initiation of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.

        -  To evaluate clinical outcomes-local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastases,
           survival

        -  To evaluate participant breast reconstruction related QOL with the AirXpander
           AeroFormdevice

      This is a phase II trial evaluating the use of the intervention in participants with breast
      cancer undergoing post-mastectomy radiation therapy in order to define the toxicity profile
      and associated subsequent successful surgical reconstruction rate
