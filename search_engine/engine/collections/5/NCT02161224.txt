    
      The effect of moderate hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and
      tolerability of a single dose of FG-4592 in male and female subjects is investigated. Data
      obtained from these subjects are compared to data from BMI-, age- and sex-matched subjects
      with normal hepatic function. Both groups consist of 8 subjects.

      Screening takes place from Days -22 to -2 before admission to the clinical unit on Day -1.
      Administration of the trial medication takes place on Day 1 under fasted conditions. Healthy
      subjects are discharged on Day 5 and subjects with moderate hepatic impairment on Day 7, if
      there is no reason to extend the stay. An end-of-study visit (ESV) takes place 5 to 9 days
      after (early) discharge.

      Safety assessments are performed throughout the study.
