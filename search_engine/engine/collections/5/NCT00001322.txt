      central nervous system function. For example, the menstrual cycle may influence the
      occurrence of seizures in some female epileptics and the performance on certain cognitive
      tests. Central nervous system effects of gonadal steroids have been inferred largely from
      changes in behavior occurring in association with presumed changes in gonadal steroids during
      the normal menstrual cycle, during the administration of ovarian hormones, or in a
      gender-specific context. These inferences are, by definition, indirect and associational in
      nature and further are incapable of disentangling the effects of hormones which are
      simultaneously present in women of reproductive age. This study is designed to address those
      problems by comparing measures during Lupron-induced hypogonadism with those during
      replacement with estrogen or progesterone. On the basis of prior findings from our group and
      from others, we will be asking the following questions: 1) Is the decreased r-CBF that we
      observed in the prefrontal cortex during the hypogonadal state confirmed in individual women
      using new imaging techniques; 2) Will variation in genotype (e.g., COMT val/met, BDNF
      val/met) confer differential sensitivity to ovarian steroids in brain circuitry and 3) Are
      the menstrual cycle phase-related changes in reward systems that we previously observed
      related to estradiol or progesterone actions within the brain (1). Additionally, this
      protocol will serve as a control study for protocol # 90-M-0088.
