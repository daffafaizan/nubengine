      a novel therapeutic approach for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). OligoG has been shown to
      release stagnant mucus, modulate sputum rheology and disrupt the biofilm formation often
      typically observed in CF. These properties will in turn facilitate mucus clearance and
      promote effectiveness of antibiotic therapy against the chronic pulmonary infections
      characteristic of CF.

      Patients with CF (age 18 years or older) will be eligible to participate in this study.

      The design will be a randomised, blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study for proof of concept
      that OligoG DPI can improve lung function in adult CF patients. Study medication will be
      given twice daily for twelve weeks on top of standard of care (SOC). Thirty-three patients
      will be included, out of which twenty-two shall receive OligoG, and eleven shall receive
      placebo.

      After all patients have completed the 12 week double blind treatment period, all patients
      will be offered open-label OligoG twice daily, in addition to standard of care, for 12
      months.

      The primary endpoint will be absolute change i percent predicted FEV1

      Exploratory parameters will include sputum microbiology.
