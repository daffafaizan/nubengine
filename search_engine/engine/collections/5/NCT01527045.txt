    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether 2 weeks of donor statin treatment reduces the risk of severe acute GVHD.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether 2 weeks of statin treatment of normal PBSC donors is feasible, tolerable
      and safe.

      OUTLINE:

      DONOR: Donors receive atorvastatin orally (PO) once daily (QD) beginning on day -14 and
      continuing until the last day of stem cell collection.

      NONMYELOABLATIVE PREPARATIVE REGIMEN: If the patient is enrolled on an investigational
      nonmyeloablative hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) protocol or a treatment plan that uses a
      nonmyeloablative preparative regimen with postgrafting cyclosporine (CSP) that does not use
      acute GVHD as its primary endpoint, the preparative regimen and immunosuppression after
      transplant will be according to respective protocol or treatment plan (Protocol 2546 serves
      as adjunct protocol).

      If the patient is not enrolled on an investigational nonmyeloablative HCT protocol or a
      treatment plan that uses a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen, Protocol 2546 serves as an
      independent primary treatment protocol. The preparative regimen and immunosuppression after
      transplant is as follows:

      Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) on days -4 to -2 (except for
      patients who had prior autologous HCT or equivalent high-dose therapy without HCT) and
      undergo low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) on day 0.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo donor PBSC transplant on day 0.

      POST-GRAFTING IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive CSP PO twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 56
      with taper to day 180. Patients also receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) PO BID or IV every
      12 hours on days 0-27.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 year and then annually
      thereafter.
