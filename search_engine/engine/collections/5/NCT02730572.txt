    
      This is a retrospective cohort study based on a health claims database, the Truven Commercial
      Claims and Encounters (CCAE) database. Participants will enter the cohort when, after using
      Concerta continuously for at least 60 days after October 3, 2012, they receive a dispensing
      of the AG or EG formulation within 15 days of the end of the days of Concerta supplied. The
      date of that dispensing of the AG or EG formulation is the participants index date. This
      study will track various events, example, back-switches, and methylphenidate dose changes
      over time (the 60 days before the switch from Concerta to an AG or EG generic compared to the
      60 days after that switch).
