    
      Objective

      The goal of this protocol to explore correlations between lateralized individual differences
      in visual attentional preference and hemispheric asymmetries in functional connectivity
      between the frontal and parietal visual attention areas. To measure functional connectivity,
      resting state functional MRI and electroencephalographic (EEG) potentials evoked with
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) will be used. Protocol research will also attempt to
      validate the TMS-evoked EEG potentials against fMRI resting state functional connectivity.

      Study Population

      Up to 80 right-handed and right-eyed healthy volunteers, aged 18-35

      Design

      TMS evoked EEG potentials (TEPs) and fMRI will be used to measure functional connectivity
      between the posterior parietal cortex and the frontal visual attention area. Various tasks
      will be used to quantify attention and explore their relationship with asymmetries in
      functional connectivity. A qualitative comparison between the value of fMRI and TEPs for
      predicting attentional bias will be made.

      Outcome Measures

        -  Behavioral measures of attention

        -  TEP measures of functional connectivity

        -  fMRI measures of functional connectivity
