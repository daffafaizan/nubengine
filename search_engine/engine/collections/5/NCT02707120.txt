      damage, maintain eye structure and improve the transparency of the cornea. Therapy should be
      initiated early and based on the clinical stage of the disease because it depends on
      epithelial state and in the degree of corneal hypoesthesia.

      Plasma rich in growth factors (PRGF-Endoret) represent a new technology using autologous
      proteins, growth factors and biomaterials as therapeutic formulations for different
      regenerative purposes. Under strict pharmaceutical development, it is possible to develop
      biologically stable eye drops, which have been shown to be useful for treating diverse ocular
      surface diseases. PRGF-Endoret eye drops could be an alternative therapy for patients with
      NK, and thus the objective of this clinical trial is to demonstrate its possible efficacy and
      its safety in patients with NK in stages 2 and 3.
