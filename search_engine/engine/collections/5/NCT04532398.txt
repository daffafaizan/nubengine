      of a standardized dysphagia- screening permits an early diagnosis. This study is to evaluate
      a new GUSS (gugging swallowing Screen) tool with multi-consistency check for intensive care
      patients (GUSS-ICU) with dysphagia. The concurrent validity (in terms of sensitivity and
      specificity) of the GUSS-ICU is analyzed in comparison to the flexible endoscopic evaluation
      of swallowing (FEES).

      The GUSS-ICU with multi-consistency check includes an indirect and a direct swallowing
      attempt. In indirect swallowing, the vigilance is first assessed on the basis of the RASS
      score (Richmond agitation-sedation scale), the presence of a stridor, the effectiveness of
      coughing and screeting, the possibility of swallowing saliva, drooling (saliva) and the
      change of voice after swallowing. If six points are reached, one can immediately proceed to
      the direct swallowing attempt. Unlike the original GUSS, the new GUSS-ICU direct swallowing
      test consists of 4 subtests with pulpy, liquid, solid and mixed solid-liquid consistency. The
      mixed solid-liquid consistency has been supplemented, as mixed consistencies require a more
      complex swallowing function with increased tongue- and lip coordination.
