      range of motion, function and quality of life in individuals with neck pain. These
      physiotherapy approaches have been shown to improve respiratory functions in patients with
      neck pain and also in pulmonary diseases such as cystic fibrosis and chronic obstructive
      pulmonary diseases.

      Studies show that to improve respiratory parameters in patients for chronic neck pain,
      mobilization of thoracic region and exercises for endurance of deep neck muscles are
      beneficial. Despite the proposal given in this study, there are few studies evaluating the
      relationship between respiratory functions and the strength of respiratory muscles in
      patients with neck pain in detail, and also the effectiveness of different
      physiotherapy-rehabilitation methods on respiratory functions on neck pain. In a single study
      on this subject, thoracic region manual therapy, stretching exercise program and both of
      these applications were applied for the subjects. At the end of the treatment, respiratory
      functions developed in all three groups; but both applications group have been shown to more
      effective than thoracic manual therapy group for increasing respiratory functions.Exercises
      and manual therapy for cervical and/or thoracic region frequently used for chronic neck pain
      but there are no studies that compare manual therapy for different region on respiratory
      parameters. Therefore, our aim is to determine the effects of exercises with manual therapy
      methods for cervical and/or thoracic region in chronic neck pain patients on pain, posture,
      quality of life, as well as on respiratory parameters.
