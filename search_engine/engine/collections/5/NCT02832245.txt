      Very often the investigators pose serious doubts on how to manage a specific patient.
      Sometimes because it is a patient with thrombocytopenia, a pregnant woman, a patient with a
      recent cerebral bleeding or cerebral metastasis, a patient with gastroduodenal ulcer or
      hepatic cirrhosis. There is no clinical evidence about how the investigators should manage
      these patients and the investigators have to individualize its management. The bibliography
      available is not of much help. Only if the investigators have a database with a sufficient
      number of cases, they may be able to make evidence based decisions.

      This database on the Internet will allow the investigators to consult and obtain an immediate
      response when taking care of a patient who needs an individualized management. After
      introducing the patient the investigators will automatically obtain the data of all patients
      with similar clinical profiles. And this will help the investigators to identify high-risk
      patients and thus facilitate them preventing possible future complications.
