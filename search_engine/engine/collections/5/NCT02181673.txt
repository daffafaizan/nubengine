    
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), randomized (study drug assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the participant is receiving),
      placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment [with no drug in it] that is
      compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has a real effect) study of
      golimumab compared with placebo in participants with active psoriatic arthritis. The study
      will include 4 phases: Screening phase (up to 6 weeks), Double-blind placebo-controlled phase
      (Week 0 to Week 24), Active treatment phase (Week 24 to Week 52), and Safety follow-up phase
      (8 weeks from last study drug administration). Total duration of the study will be 60 weeks
      per participant. Eligible Participants will be randomly assigned to either Treatment Group 1:
      Placebo or Treatment Group 2: Golimumab. Participants randomized to Placebo Group, will
      receive intravenous infusions of placebo at Weeks 0, 4, 12 and 20. At Week 24, all
      participants receiving placebo will begin receiving intravenous infusions of golimumab (2
      mg/kg) at Week 24, 28 and thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 52. Participants randomized to
      Golimumab Group, will receive intravenous infusions of golimumab 2 mg/kg at Week 0, 4 and
      thereafter every 8 weeks up to Week 52. At Week 24, participants randomized to golimumab
      Group will receive a placebo infusion to maintain the blind. The efficacy will be assessed
      primarily by measuring percentage of participants who achieve a 20 percent improvement from
      baseline in the assessment used in active psoriatic arthritis at Week 14. Participants'
      safety will be monitored throughout the study.
