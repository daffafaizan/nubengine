    
      This is an observational, open-label study to assess the nicotine pharmacokinetic (PK)
      parameters over a 6-hour period in adopters of electronic cigarettes with respect to an
      in-clinic 10-minute ad libitum period following a 12-hour tobacco and nicotine abstinence. In
      addition to PK parameters, subjective effects of urge for product will be assessed over a
      6-hour period concurrently with the collection of the PK blood samples following a protocol
      defined schedule. The results of this study will be compared to historical PK and urge for
      product data obtained from smokers as well as na√Øve and short-term users of electronic
      cigarettes. In addition to the PK parameters and urge for product outcomes, plasma will be
      assessed for cotinine concentration prior to the 12-hour abstinence period.
