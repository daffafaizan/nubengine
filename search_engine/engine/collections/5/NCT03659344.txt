      vicryl plus 4-0 (Vicryl Plus Ethicon,Johnson & Johnson Company, Sommerville, NJ) suture was
      used to close surgical site and Vicryl 4-0 (Vicryl Ethicon,Johnson & Johnson Company,
      Sommerville, NJ) in group II.

      All dental implants were placed through creating subperiosteal flaps. In each group, fresh
      socket placed dental implants were documented. Patients were visited in 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks
      after dental implant surgeries.

      Postoperative infection was defined as local erythematous change in the sutured wound with
      purulent discharge or localized abscess formation on surgical site. If wound dehiscence
      occurred, it was documented.

      Patients were blind about what suture was used.
