      SEER Sonorheometry, an ultrasound-based technology, to characterize the viscoelastic
      properties of a whole blood sample during coagulation. The Quantra QPlus Cartridge was
      developed to monitor hemostasis during major surgical procedures in adult patients. The
      cartridge consists of four independent channels each containing different sets of reagents,
      which provide four measurements performed iin parallel yielding six parameters that depict
      the functional status of a patient's coagulation system.

      The oncologic surgical population presents unique challenges to providers who must
      distinguish between a cancer patient's increased tendency toward both thrombosis and
      hemorrhage. This single site prospective observational study in oncologic patients will give
      an insight into the coagulation status of critically ill cancer patients.
