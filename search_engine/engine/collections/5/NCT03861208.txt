      feelings of hunger/fullness before and after a single test meal. If preschooler's feelings of
      hunger are associated with their ghrelin (hunger hormone) levels is not known. This study is
      designed to assess children's changes in feelings of hunger throughout the day (8 pm to 4 pm)
      and to measure both subjective feelings of hunger and salivary ghrelin levels before and
      after a standardized test meal (lunch).

      An important secondary outcome related to children's feelings of hunger is their ability to
      learn. Currently, there is lack of data on the direct link between perceived hunger/fullness
      and learning processes. This study addresses these gaps using preschooler's perceived
      feelings of hunger and fullness (using a published 4-point scale (Kranz S.et al.

      Better Diet Quality in Low-Income Preschoolers Compared with Their Usual Breakfast" J Nutr
      doi: 10.3945/jn.116.234153, 2017) and a battery of learning tests (HTKS, KRISP, Stroop-style
      tasks, Woodcock Johnson vocabulary test, DCCS, and curisoty measures.)
