      seen in patients with prolonged prothrombin complex (PK-INR). A prolonged (PK-INR) is
      sometimes treated with intravenous vitamin K, even in non-warfarin treated or non-liver
      failure patients. Despite the development of this practice the knowledge about how
      intravenously given vitamin K affects routine coagulation status and other advanced
      laboratory coagulations assays is rare.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of intravenously administered vitamin K
      on routine coagulation status and on advanced coagulation and vitamin K-assays in
      post-operative- and critically ill patients with prolonged PK-INR.

      Patients with spontaneously prolonged PK-INR are routinely given intravenous vitamin K but it
      is largely unknown how this procedure affects the included coagulation assays. This research
      project may contribute to increased knowledge concerning effects of intravenously given
      vitamin K in critical ill patients with spontaneous coagulopathies. Since spontaneous
      coagulopathy is frequently occurring in critically ill and postoperative patients due to
      various underlying conditions and current evidence for vitamin K administration is based on
      scarce evidence more research in this area is motivated.
