      typically manifests as nodules and abscesses that ultimately can progress to form deep sinus
      tracts, fistulas, and scarring. It affects areas of the body with apocrine gland bearing
      tissue, including the anogenital, axillary and inframammary regions. The lesions are often
      very painful and can chronically drain malodorous fluid, which can leave affected individuals
      uncomfortable and self-conscious, or even debilitated. The pathogenesis of this disease
      process is not fully understood, and the HS can be difficult to treat. Measures such as
      topical antibiotic and antiseptic washes are generally thought to be beneficial for the
      treatment of early stage HS. Although there have been no controlled trials for the treatment
      of HS, commonly used topical washes currently include benzoyl peroxide and chlorhexidine
      gluconate.

      Provodine™ topical cream was designed to actively kill microbes on the skin for up to 6 hours
      without resulting in the irritation often associated with repetitive use of antimicrobial
      products. A blinded controlled comparison of Provodine™ versus the current standard of
      benzoyl peroxide wash will not only allow for an alternative treatment for early stage HS but
      also provide an additional tool in the arsenal of treatments for this disease process.
