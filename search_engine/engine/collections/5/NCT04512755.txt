      medical care to expand the reach of integrative care to more chronically and seriously ill
      patient populations. At the AIMS Institute, the core specialties are naturopathy, palliative
      care, psychiatry, physiatry, and naturopathic oncology practiced via coordinated, team-based
      care by allopathic medical and psychiatric specialists, psychotherapists, specialized
      naturopathic physicians, advanced practice nurses, and targeted health educators, with the
      majority of care covered by insurance. Additionally incorporated are novel 'advanced'
      approaches, such as drug-assisted psychotherapy, medical cannabis education, sympathetic
      blocks, and some intravenous therapies.

      This is an uncontrolled, prospective case series outcomes study of health-related quality of
      life outcomes in patients who receive care at AIMS Institute. A clinic-wide chart audit of
      patient characteristics and outcomes will be conducted prior to the start of enrollment.
