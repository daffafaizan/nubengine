      unit patients. As a marker for infection or other disease process, the presence of a fever
      and its temperature peak must be reliably obtained in ICU patients and must be monitored
      closely to optimize effective therapy. Inherent variability of different temperature
      measurement methods can lead to a difficulty in determining the optimal timing of medical
      interventions. Ideally, nurses and medical staff in acute care hospital facilities could have
      a temperature monitoring system that aids recognition of fever and systemic infection that is
      not labor intensive and provides consistent and reliable temperatures. Automatic transmission
      to a data recorder lessens the chances of manual entry error into the medical record.
      Frequent measurements allow establishment of a patient's individual baseline temperature to
      provide individualized guidelines for medical interventions with an increase of 2Â°F above
      baseline as documentation of a fever. Finally, the frequent temperature monitoring should be
      minimally invasive and comfortable to the patient.
