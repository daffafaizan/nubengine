      populations. Evidence on effectiveness of financial incentives for addressing this shortfall
      is limited.

      This study examined effects of USDA's Healthy Incentives Pilot (HIP), which offered financial
      incentives to Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants for purchasing
      targeted fruits and vegetables (TFV).

      A randomized controlled trial of HIP was conducted in Hampden County, Massachusetts. 7,500
      randomly selected SNAP households received a 30% rebate on TFV purchased using SNAP benefits.
      The remaining 47,595 SNAP households in the county received benefits as usual. Adults in
      5,076 households were randomly sampled to complete telephone surveys, including 24-h dietary
      recall interviews. Surveys were conducted at baseline-1-3 mo pre-implementation-and in two
      follow-up rounds, 4-6 mo and 9-11 mo post-implementation. 2,784 adults (1,388 HIP, 1,396
      non-HIP) completed baseline interviews; data were analyzed for 2,009 adults (72%) also
      completing at least one follow-up interview.
