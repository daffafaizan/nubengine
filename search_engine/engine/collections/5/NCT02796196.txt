      I. Evaluate whether prescribed physical activity, as part of standard care, improves sleep
      and functional outcomes in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) (stem cell
      transplantation) patients during a typical 30-day hospitalization period.

      OUTLINE:

      Data including demographics, type of HCT (e.g., allogeneic or autologous), preexisting
      physical conditions (e.g., chronic joint injury), chronic renal failure (CRF), steroid use
      data, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) and Karnofsky performance status (KPS) scores
      are collected from patients' medical charts at time of enrollment. Patients are prescribed
      participation in a primarily self-directed physical activity program which encourages them to
      spend 6 hours out of bed daily and to perform 30 minutes of light-to-moderate daily aerobic
      activity. Patients who are able to maintain independent mobility undergo physical therapist
      assessment 2 times a week until hospital discharge. Patients wear a physical activity
      monitoring device and daily activity and sleep data are collected continuously during
      hospital length of stay (LOS).
