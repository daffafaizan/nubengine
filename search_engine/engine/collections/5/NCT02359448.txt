    
      This is a Phase IIb, open label single-site trial of sustained-release Melatonin 2mg in
      patients with PD, reporting nocturia, defined as getting up regularly at night > twice to
      pass urine. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effects of exogenous
      melatonin on bother related to nocturia. Secondary objectives are to evaluate: 1) Mean night
      time urinary frequency 2)Volume of urine voided at night 3)Incontinence and other lower
      urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) 3)Quality of sleep 4) Quality of life 5) Sleep disturbance of
      partners 6)Safety.

      Patients will be asked to fill out questionnaires, diaries and to wear a wrist actiwatch for
      2 weeks prior to starting melatonin and during the last 2 weeks of the 6 weeks treatment. A
      research nurse will telephone patients weekly whilst the patient is on Melatonin to enquire
      about medication use and any adverse events.

      After taking consent, the investigator will take a history covering urinary symptoms, and
      causes for nocturia, e.g. medications. Participants will be examined and severity of PD
      assessed using Hoehn and Yahr staging and UPDRS (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale).
      Height, weight and supine/standing blood pressure will be recorded.

      Urodynamics will be performed according to ICS Good Urodynamic Practice and will include
      uroflowmetry, bladder scan, filling cystometry and pressure flow study.

      This pilot study aims to evaluate any effect that melatonin may have on nocturia related
      bother in Parkinson's Disease. Chi square test will be used to analyse change in bother
      related to nocturia (primary outcome) and number of nocturia episodes and questionnaire
      scores (Secondary outcomes).
