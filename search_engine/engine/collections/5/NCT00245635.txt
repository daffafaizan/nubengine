      has not been investigated. Recent data suggests that adults with BDD may respond to serotonin
      reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) such as fluoxetine (Prozac). Preliminary findings from case
      reports suggest that SRIs may also be effective in the treatment of BDD in children and
      adolescents. This study is the first large-scale, double-blind, placebo-controlled medication
      trial of fluoxetine for children and adolescents with BDD. Participants should be aged 16 or
      younger. Participation in this trial will last approximately 14 weeks.
