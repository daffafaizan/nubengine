    
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      double-blind (neither the researchers nor the participants know what treatment the
      participant is receiving), placebo-controlled (an inactive substance; a pretend treatment
      [with no drug in it] that is compared in a clinical trial with a drug to test if the drug has
      a real effect) study. The study consists of 3 phases; Screening (up to 8 weeks), Treatment
      phase: placebo-controlled (Week 0 to 24) and active treatment (Week 24 to Week 52), and
      Safety Follow-up (up to 12 weeks). Participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment
      groups: placebo, ustekinumab 45 mg and ustekinumab 90 mg. The total duration of study will be
      up to 64 weeks. Participants will be primarily assessed for Assessment of SpondyloArthritis
      International Society (ASAS) 40 response at Week 24. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the trial.
