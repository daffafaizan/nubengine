      maintenance therapy versus observation following a first line treatment with iv/oral
      Vinorelbine+Docetaxel. Eligible patients will be enrolled in the trial to receive 6 cycles of
      iv(D1)/oral(D8) Vinorelbine + Docetaxel. For responding and SD patients, after the 6 cycles,
      they will be randomized either in observation arm or to receive a maintenance chemotherapy
      with oral Vinorelbine. The oral form of the drug was found to be most appropriate for a long
      term treatment allowing to preserve QoL of the patients. Oral Vinorelbine will be
      administered on D1, D8 every 3 weeks during maintenance treatment, until PD, unacceptable
      toxicity or patient refusal to continue. The trial will assess efficacy/safety of initial
      Vinorelbine-Docetaxel combination as well as the benefits of maintenance chemotherapy with
      oral Vinorelbine.
