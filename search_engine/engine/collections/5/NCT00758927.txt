      the many risk factors of atherosclerosis in diabetic patients, LDL(low density lipoprotein)
      cholesterol is now being regarded as one of the most important modifiable one. Recent
      researches have revealed that the plasma LDL could be sub-divided according to the size of
      the particles into large buoyant LDL and small dense LDL. Small dense LDL is very
      atherogenic. Increased plasma triglyceride and the presence of insulin resistance are proved
      to be positively correlated well with the amount of small dense LDL in diabetic patients.

      We would like to see omega-3 acid(OMACOR) which is now widely used in clinical practice to
      decrease plasma triglyceride could change the amount of plasma small dense LDL in type 2
      diabetic patients with combined hyperlipidemia.

      This trial is consisted of 6 weeks of wash out for the patients already taking statin. After
      that, daily 4 grams of omega-3 acid(OMACOR) will be administered for 10 weeks. Before and
      after the administration of study drug, we will measure the change of the amount of plasma
      small dense LDL via ultracentrifuge/non-denaturing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
      followed by oil red O and coomassie blue staining. As a secondary outcome measure, we will
      also assess the change of HDL(high density lipoprotein) cholesterol sub-type by the same
      method.
