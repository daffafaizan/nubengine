      prostate cancer (mCRPC) undergoing sequential treatment with docetaxel followed by
      enzalutamide. In this study, all participants will receive standard of care treatment with
      docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks up to 10 cycles and after progression, patients will receive
      enzalutamide 160 mg daily until limiting toxicity or disease progression. The participants
      will undergo serial pre- and post-therapy blood collection for biomarker analysis as part of
      the primary objective of the study.
