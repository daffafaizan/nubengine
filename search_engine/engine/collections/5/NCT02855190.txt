      scans at two different stages. At first stage, subsequent FDG PET/CT and Ga68 citrate PET/CT
      scans on different two days will be arranged before infective prosthesis is removed. Eight to
      twelve weeks after the 1st stage operation, patient will receive two subsequent PET/MR scans
      using Ga-68 Citrate and FDG on different two days, respectively. The PET images will be
      visually examined by a nuclear medicine physician and will be reported if any abnormal uptake
      higher than background by their location and standard uptake value (SUV). The CT/MR images
      will be reported by a radiologist using standard reading procedures, respectively. The
      lesions on the PET scan will be correlated to the computed tomography and magnetic resonance
      images, and the final sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy will be calculated according to
      the histopathology results or composite clinical and laboratory data.

      On the scan day using Ga68-Citrate, baseline electrocardiogram, complete blood count (CBC),
      and biochemistry profiles including serum alanine transaminase (ALT) and creatinine (Cre)
      level will be done prior to injection of the radio-pharmaceutical (Ga68-Citrate). Vital signs
      will be measured before the scan beginning. After completing exam, the electrocardiogram and
      vital signs will be measure again, and the subject will be released if there is no
      discomfort. The subject will return to the clinic within 1 week after Ga68-citrate scan. CBC,
      biochemistry profiles will be checked again for safety monitoring.
