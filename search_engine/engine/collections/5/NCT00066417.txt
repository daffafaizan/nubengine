        -  Determine the safety of a preparative regimen comprising total body irradiation,
           cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and fludarabine, but without anti-thymocyte globulin, in
           patients with high-risk leukemia treated with peripheral blood stem cell transplantation
           from partially matched related donors.

        -  Determine the incidence of graft failure, acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and
           treatment-related mortality in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine rates of chronic GVHD and relapse in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine disease-free and overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study.

      Patients receive a preparative regimen comprising total lymphoid irradiation once daily on
      days -13 to -11; cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -8 and -7; thiotepa IV over 4 hours
      every 12 hours on day -6; fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -5 to -1; and total body
      irradiation once on day -1. Patients also receive cyclosporine IV over 12 hours on days -8 to
      -1 and methylprednisolone IV twice daily on days -3 and -2. Patients receive CD34-enriched
      T-cell-depleted allogeneic stem cell infusion on day 0.

      Patients with disease progression or uncontrolled infection but without grade II or greater
      graft-versus-host disease may receive up to 3 donor lymphocyte infusions at least 4 weeks
      apart until disease regression.

      Patients are followed at least weekly until day 100 and then at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-51 patients will be accrued for this study.
