      complications and even death. Studies also suggest that heart failure patients who have high
      glucose or diabetes do not live as long as patients with normal glucose. Glucose fluctuations
      have not been well-studied in patients with heart failure. In this study, we will determine
      whether better control of blood sugar fluctuations in the hospital improve outcomes. We will
      enroll 80 patients with severe heart failure and divide them into 2 groups. We will use
      intravenous (given through the vein) insulin to lower blood sugar levels in group 1, and
      insulin injections (under the skin) in group 2. We will determine whether intravenous insulin
      improves blood markers of inflammation, changes in vital signs, and other tests that predict
      mortality in patients with heart failure.
