      cancers (ABC) the UK ABC-02 study (the largest study by far in this patient group, n=410) is
      likely to define CisGem as the global standard of care for this disease based on a
      significantly improved progression-free survival and overall survival compared to gemcitabine
      alone.

      Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a pivotal stimulus of physiologic and pathologic
      angiogenesis, including the sustained neo-vascularisation required to support solid tumour
      growth. Human biliary tract carcinoma cells have higher expression of VEGF both in cell lines
      and tissues (detected in 75.6% of 33 resected clinical specimens) and this is associated with
      significantly higher levels of microvessel density and the presence of intrahepatic
      metastases.

      Cediranib is a highly potent inhibitor of VEGF receptor 2 tyrosine kinase and VEGF-induced
      signalling in endothelial cells. It has been safely combined with a CisGem regimen in lung
      cancer patients.

      Aims This trial aims to evaluate the effect on progression-free survival of cediranib in
      combination with CisGem chemotherapy compared to CisGem and placebo.

      Summary of study Consenting patients with ABC (inoperable, locally advanced, recurrent or
      metastatic) will receive CisGem chemotherapy and either cediranib (experimental arm) or
      placebo (standard arm) orally. Treatment will continue until disease progression
      (chemotherapy will stop at 24 weeks) with tumour reassessment by CT/MRI scans at 12-weekly
      intervals. All patients will be followed up for survival analysis.
