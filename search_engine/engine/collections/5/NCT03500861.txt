      second most common chronic disease worldwide, with an age-standardized prevalence of 21.75 %
      (1). Although high prevalence of chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) has been reported in
      all world regions, it is also the most neglected disorder and it leads to headaches that are
      difficult to treat (2). Myofascial pain can play an important etiologic role. It has been
      claimed that pain from pericranial head, neck and shoulder muscles is associated with the
      head and experienced as headache (5, 6). Within the cervical musculature, there are several
      head and neck muscles, eg. temporal, masseter, upper trapezius, sternocleidomastoid,
      temporalis, sub-occipital muscles, from which trigger points (TrPs) spread referred pain to
      the head (6). There are several pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies for
      patients with CTTH. Physiotherapy is the most commonly used non-pharmacological treatment of
      CTTH. Although sports and orthopedic physiotherapists have used dry needling (DN) for a long
      time to address the pain and dysfunction associated with myofascial trigger points (11),
      there is insufficient evidence to strongly advocate for use of DN for treatment of CTTH (12).
      In this double-blind randomized trial, we aimed to explore the effectiveness of trigger point
      dry needling in patients with CTTH in reduction of headache frequency, intensity, duration,
      and improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL).
