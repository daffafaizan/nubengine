      arteries that supply the heart with blood, causing the arteries to narrow and reducing the
      amount of blood that can get to the heart. One of the treatment options for CAD is
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in which a balloon is inserted into the artery
      supplying the heart to open up the artery where it has narrowed. A stent is then left in the
      artery once the balloon is removed to hold the artery open and allow more blood to flow to
      the heart. One of the risks of this procedure, as in CAD itself, is the formation of blood
      clots that then block the arteries, stopping or reducing blood flow and causing a heart
      attack.

      Platelets are small blood cells involved in the formation of blood clots that cause heart
      attacks. Antiplatelet drugs (e.g. aspirin) are given to patients with CAD to reduce the risk
      of a clot forming in the future and causing a heart attack. In a recent large clinical trial
      (PLATO study), it was shown that heart attack patients treated with a new antiplatelet
      medication (ticagrelor) had fewer later heart attacks compared to the current standard
      treatment (clopidogrel). The STEELPCI study is comparing three different strategies for
      prescribing antiplatelet medication to patients with stable CAD who have a PCI.

      Patients on waiting list for PCI who meet the study inclusion/exclusion criteria will be
      invited to participate. Patients will have their PCI as normal but be randomised to take one
      of three different medication strategies, either clopidogrel or one of two doses of
      ticagrelor. Patient will take the medication for 30 days and have blood tests and meet with
      the research team during that time to assess the effects of each medication strategy.
