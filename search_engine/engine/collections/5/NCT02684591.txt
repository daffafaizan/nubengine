      the efficacy of Aramchol at 600 mg/day orally versus identical placebo given over 12 weeks to
      improve HIV-associated hepatic steatosis as measured by a validated and accurate magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI)-based technique. In this study, we propose to randomize up to 50
      patients with HIV-associated NAFLD to either Aramchol or placebo for 12 weeks. We plan to
      enroll a total of 55 patients, expecting some drop outs prior to randomization. After an
      initial evaluation for insulin sensitivity, liver fat measurement by MRI, and total body fat
      content by DEXA, patients will be randomized to receive either Aramchol 600 mg/day or placebo
      orally for 12 weeks. Patients will be monitored at regular intervals for symptoms of liver
      disease, side effects of medication, and serum biochemical and metabolic indices. Patients
      will also be assessed for continued HIV viral load suppression and continued tolerance of
      antiretroviral therapy. At the end of 12 weeks, patients will have a repeat medical
      evaluation, liver fat measurement, and total body fat content measurement. Pre and post
      treatment liver fat by MRI, ALT/AST, HbA1c, CRP, insulin sensitivity, and DEXA for whole body
      fat will be compared. The primary end point of successful therapy will be improvement in
      liver fat by MRI. Secondary end points will be improvement in total body fat, insulin
      sensitivity and liver biochemistry.
