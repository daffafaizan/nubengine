      bilateral transversus abdominis plane (:TAP) catheters. After randomization in to two groups
      the patients receive either 1) intermittent boluses of ropivacaine in the TAP-catheters and
      isotonic potassium chloride-infusion i the epidural catheters or 2) intermittent isotonic
      potassium chloride-boluses i the TAP-catheters and bupivacain-infusion in the epidural
      catheters.

      The investigators record pain-score and consumption of opioids in the first 24 hours
      postoperatively as well as thermoanalgesia at dermatome-levels th10-th12.

      The investigators assume that the effect on postoperative pain after open gynecologic surgery
      is equal in the two groups.
