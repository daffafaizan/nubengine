      sequentially. Each participant will be taking Mirapex for PD and will be converted to Requip
      CR by 1 of 3 conversion factors (mg:mg): 1:3, 1:4 and 1:5 from Mirapex to once a day Requip
      CR. The first five subjects of each cohort will have their initial dose administered in the
      clinic and be monitored for orthostatic changes. Assessments of motor function before and
      after conversion will be done.
