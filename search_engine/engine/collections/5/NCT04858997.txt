    
      According to the early assessment(4 weeks) , this prospective study comprehensively
      investigate TTR of Palbociclib+ET in the first line treatment for HR+/HER2- MBC patients in
      China real-world study.

      Furthermore, evaluate the Early Tumor Shrinkage(ETS) of Palbociclib + ET, and assess
      Treatment Free Interval (TFI) with TTR and ETS；TFI was analyzed at the following time points:
      ≤24, >24, ≤36, > 36, ≤48, >48 months.

      Accroding to the follow-up of QoL questionnaire, understand the clinical symptoms
      improvements time.

      Meanwhile, cooperation with radiology department, establish a model for predicting early
