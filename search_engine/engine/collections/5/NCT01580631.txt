    
      This is a multicenter, prospective, double-blinded study of NBI images from 50 patients
      enrolled in the study. Patients undergoing BE screening and BE surveillance will be enrolled
      into the study. After meeting eligibility criteria, and obtaining an informed consent,
      patients will undergo their routine upper endoscopic examination using white light endoscopy.
      During the course of the upper endoscopy, the BE surface patterns will be carefully examined
      with the endoscope in overview mode (with the endoscope in the center of the esophageal
      lumen) and then in close proximity to the BE surface (approximately 3-5 mm away from the
      mucosa). In each of these positions, a maximum of 4 high quality images will be obtained from
      different surface patterns initially with WLE and then using NBI. Image capture will be
      standardized. All the images will be classified based upon a simplified NBI classification
      system using two main criteria:(1)mucosal pattern(regular/irregular/uncertain) and
      (2)vascular pattern (regular/irregular/uncertain). All images will be captured using a
      high-definition, NBI endoscope (190 endoscopes-GIF-HQ 190 [dual focus],Olympus Inc) and
      stored in the high quality TIFF format. After images have been obtained, target biopsies will
      be obtained from each area and submitted for histopathological evaluation in separate jars.
      From the reports on NBI patterns from the images by Gastroenterologist and corresponding
      histopathological details, the accuracy and interobserver agreement of this NBI
      classification system will be determined.
