      decreased over the past 2 decades. Beginning first with thrombolytic therapy for AMI, and
      more recently with growing acceptance and availability of primary percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI) for ST-elevation AMI, the mortality rates of this devastating ischemic
      event have decreased from almost 15% in clinical trials in the late 1980's to <5% in recent
      primary percutaneous coronary intervention trials. Though AMI-related mortality has been
      reduced, AMI survival is often accompanied by significant loss of function that may lead to
      subsequent treatments, congestive heart failure (CHF) and reduction in quality of life. A
      cell therapy that could reduce the damage associated with AMI and positively affect heart
      function would provide substantial benefits to the AMI patient.
