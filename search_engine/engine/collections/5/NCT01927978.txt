      staging can direct to appropriate therapy planning and provide prognostic implications.
      Positron emission tomography (PET) with [18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) has been shown
      to have better N staging and prognostic stratification abilities than conventional imaging
      modalities, such as endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) and CT.

      Purpose: This study is aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of 18F-FDG PET in the initial
      staging, therapy planning, and therapeutic response monitoring for esophageal cancer
      patients.

      Method: Patients with pathological proven esophageal cancer, age 20-90 year-old, will be
      included in this study. Each patient will receive a baseline PET study. For those patients
      who received pre-operative CCRT, another PET will be performed 1-4 weeks after completion of
      CCRT.

      Primary outcome: 1. The incremental staging information by using 18F-FDG PET 2. The impact of
      the PET results on the patients' subsequent therapy planning 3. To compare treatment response
      using RECIST criteria and FDG PET results.

      Secondary outcome: To correlate the PET response rate and the patients' disease free survival
      and overall survival.
