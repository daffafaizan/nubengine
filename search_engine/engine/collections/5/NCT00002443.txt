      plus AZT. Group 2 receives MK-639 alone. Group 3 receives AZT alone. Safety and tolerability
      are assessed by the incidence of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences. Blood and urine
      samples are collected for safety assessment and to determine CD4 cell counts and serum viral
      RNA levels. If therapy with MK-639 alone or with AZT is found to be generally safe and
      clinically efficacious, patients who have completed the study will have the opportunity to
      continue in an extension study protocol on a treatment regimen including MK-639.
