      data on the combination of ipilimumab and high-dose SBRT are lacking. Consequently, the first
      goal of the proposed prospective phase I trial is to assess the safety (dose limiting
      toxicity, DLT) of the combination of high-dose SBRT and ipilimumab in patients with advanced
      melanoma.
