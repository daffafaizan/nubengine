      obstruction, fecal impaction, and bowel perforation. Not only are the medical complications
      potentially severe, patient quality of life can also be impacted. Two agents are currently
      available for opioid-induced constipation - oral and subcutaneous methylnaltrexone and oral
      naloxegol. Mechanistically, both agents antagonize the peripheral mu-opioid receptor in the
      gastrointestinal tract to decrease constipation without reversing the systemic analgesic
      effects of opiates. The literature currently available has evaluated the effectiveness of
      each agent, not the comparative effectiveness of these agents.
