    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To estimate the graft-versus (vs.) host disease-free/relapse free survival (GRFS) rate of
      itacitinib used as prophylaxis to prevent graft versus host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic
      stem cell transplantation (ASCT) at one year.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment and compare between matched and
      unmatched donors.

      II. To assess safety of itacitinib as measured by non-relapse mortality (NRM) at day 100.

      III. To assess the toxicity profile associated with this regimen. IV. To assess the incidence
      of acute and chronic GVHD. V. To assess the incidence of disease relapse. VI. To assess the
      incidence of non-relapse mortality. VII. To assess overall survival and progression-free
      survival. VIII. To assess the incidence of withdrawal syndrome in patients with
      myelofibrosis.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES (CORRELATIVE STUDIES):

      I. To study immune recovery and cytokines at various time points pre and post-transplant.

      II. To study deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage studies in various cells post-transplant.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive busulfan intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days
      -20, -13, and -6 to -3, and fludarabine IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -3 in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ALLOGENEIC STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo ASCT on day 0.

      GVHD PROPHYLAXIS: Patients receive itacitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -21 to 80.
      Patients with no evidence of GVHD at day 80 receive a tapered dose of itacitinib until day
      90. Patients also receive tacrolimus IV then PO twice daily (BID) for 3 months when able, and
      methotrexate IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 3, and 6 (day 11 also for patients with a matched
      unrelated donor).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 100 days, 6 months, and 1
      year.
