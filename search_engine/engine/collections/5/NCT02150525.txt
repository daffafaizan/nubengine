      I. To examine the ability of oral omega-3 fatty acids to improve symptoms of atrophic
      vaginitis as reported by postmenopausal breast cancer survivors as compared to survivors not
      taking omega 3.

      II.To examine the ability of oral omega-3 fatty acids to decrease inflammation related to
      atrophic vaginitis in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors as compared to survivors not
      taking omega 3.

      III. To examine the ability of oral omega-3 fatty acids to uptake systemically and to
      validate adherence; these measures will be compared to demographic data including body mass
      index to observe if differences exist in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors vs. those not
      taking omega 3.

      IV. To examine the effect of oral omega 3 fatty acids as compared to placebo of dietary
      supplement on serum female hormone levels in postmenopausal breast cancer survivors.

      V. To examine cytokine levels in women taking oral omega 3 fatty acids as compared to women
      not taking omega 3 to determine effect.

      OUTLINE: Patients were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients received 3.5g omega-3 fatty acid orally (PO) daily for 6 months.

      ARM II: Patients received placebo of dietary supplement (7 capsules) PO daily for 6 months.
