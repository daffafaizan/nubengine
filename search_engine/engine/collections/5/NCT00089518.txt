      to end-stage renal disease (ESRD); nevertheless, it is predicted that many HIV infected
      patients on ART will reach ESRD by the next decade. Medications that affect the
      renin-angiotensin system, such as the ARB valsartan, may be useful in treating HIVAN. In a
      small study of HIV infected patients with HIVAN treated with the angiotensin-converting
      enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) fosinopril, kidney function was stable in patients who took the ACEI,
      but function decreased in patients who did not. These data are promising, and suggest that an
      ARB like valsartan may also slow the progression of HIVAN and improve patients' prognosis.
      This study will compare valsartan and ART to ART alone in slowing kidney disease progression
      in people with HIV.

      This study will last 96 weeks. All participants will continue taking their current ART
      regimen during the study and will be randomly assigned to one of two arms: Arm 1 will receive
      valsartan daily, while Arm 2 will receive placebo daily. Doses of drug or placebo may be
      adjusted during the first 8 weeks based on blood pressure readings taken during the study. In
      addition, if patients are on other antihypertensive drugs, dosage adjustments may be
      necessary for those drugs during the study. No ART or antihypertensive drugs other than
      valsartan will be provided by the study. Study visits will occur every week until Week 8,
      then every 8 weeks until the end of the study at Week 96. Study visits will include physical
      examination, medication assessment, and blood pressure readings. In addition, blood
      collection will occur at entry, Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8, and every 8 weeks thereafter.
