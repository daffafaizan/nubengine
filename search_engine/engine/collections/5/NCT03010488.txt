      Based on current timing of sleep, desired sleep time and responses to the
      Morningness-Eveningness Questionnaire, each subject who remains significantly depressed at
      their randomization (usually 2nd) visit, will be randomly assigned to one of two regimented
      sleep and light use protocols. On the night beginning their assigned regimented protocol,
      each subject will wear amber goggles for five hours and collect half hourly saliva samples
      for four hours. Each morning they will sit in front of a light box wearing goggles. During
      the first week following the start of the regimented protocol, they will complete self-report
      forms and have a telephone interview to document their depressive symptoms. They will have
      weekly in person interviews for six weeks and evaluations by an independent evaluator in
      person or by telephone at randomization, 2 and 6 weeks. Prior to their Week 2 Visit, they
      will wear the goggles for the four hours prior to their assigned bedtime and for the three
      hours prior to their assigned bedtime, they will collect half hourly saliva samples. At their
      Week 6 interview, they and their doctor will determine whether they have improved
      sufficiently or not. Their doctor will discuss with them whether it makes sense for them to
      continue the same regimented sleep/light schedule, make a change to it or switch to or add
      additional treatment, such as antidepressant medication. They will then be followed with
      study ratings monthly for six months, during which treatment is unrestricted; that is, the
      doctor and patient can determine what the treatment during this time will be. Following the
      six months follow-up, a referral will be made if appropriate.

      All saliva samples will be analyzed for melatonin concentration.
