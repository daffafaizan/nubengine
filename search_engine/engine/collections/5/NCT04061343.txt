      changes in ambient light setting in patients with glaucoma compared with controls (patients
      with ocular hypertension). Participants will be asked to read a Pelli- Robson chart under
      photopic (bright light conditions) and mesopic (intermediate light conditions); followed by
      scotopic conditions (dim light conditions). This chart is a fast, easy, and effective way to
      measure spatial contrast sensitivity with reliable and reproducible results(60). This study
      will therefore help clinicians gain more insight into glaucoma related disability and provide
      a possible additional tool to visual field testing in patients with advanced glaucoma where
      VF testing may be hampered by floor effects.
