    
      The purpose of this study is to perform a randomized controlled trial to test whether a
      multicomponent, nonpharmacological intervention improves sleep/wake patterns and functional
      recovery among older people (N = 214) undergoing post-acute rehabilitation. The intervention
      will combine: 1) structured sleep assessment, 2) patient education in key elements of
      cognitive behavioral strategies to improve sleep, and 3) environmental interventions on
      factors which likely contribute to abnormal sleep/wake patterns in the post-acute
      rehabilitation setting.

      This project will be conducted in a VA post-acute rehabilitation site. Older veterans (>= 60
      years) who were previously community-dwelling (N = 214) will be randomized to receive the
      intervention, or a social contact and memory skills training program as the control
      condition. Data collected at baseline will include medical data and demographics, as well as
      subjective and objective measures of sleep, structured assessments of functional status, and
      medical comorbidity. Follow-up assessments will be performed in the facility while the
      intervention/control condition is in place, and at three months and six months after
      discharge from rehabilitation. The main outcome measures will include objective sleep
      measures (nighttime percent sleep and daytime percent sleep) and functional status collected
      at three and six months follow-up. Data will be analyzed for all randomized participants in
      an intention to treat analysis.
