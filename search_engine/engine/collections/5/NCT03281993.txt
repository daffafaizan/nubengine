      It is usually performed at the end of each series of clinical examinations during diagnostic
      process. The most popular standard insufflation apnea test (I-AT) may be potentially harmful.
      It may cause some serious complications including pneumothorax, severe hypoxemia, hemodynamic
      instability and even cardiac arrest. Therefore, the investigators decided to analyze apnea
      test in CPAP option (CPAP-AT) as a new tool. For safety of the study the investigators
      analyzed a method after BD diagnosis.

      Methods:

      I-AT and hypoventilation with 100 % oxygen (if needed) were performed according to Polish
      guidelines. Two hours after BD diagnosis was performed extra apnea test in CPAP option
      (CPAP-AT). Before CPAP-AT the patients were ventilated 100% oxygen. After then the ventilator
      settings were changed to CPAP mode with PEEP 10 cm H2O, PS 0 cm H2O, FiO2 1,0, flow 6L/min.
      Emergency apnea ventilation was turned off. At the beginning of CPAP mode and 10 minutes
      after, blood samples for arterial blood gases (ABG) were collected. If were observed rapid
      desaturation defined as a decline in O2 saturation below 85%, CPAP-AT was aborted and study
      was finished.

      During routine diagnosis of brain death, pupillary dilation after a neck flexion was observed
      in one case. Therefore, the investigators decided to use a pupillometer during brain death
      examination to find out how pupils react after a neck flexion and how often it happens.

      Pupil measurements were taken immediately after the diagnosis of brain death. The
      measurements of pupil diameter were taken twice: A - before neck flexion; B - after neck
      flexion. We used pupillometer: AlgiScan (Equip Medkey BV).
