    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind parallel trial evaluating the efficacy
      of preventive acetazolamide intake on right heart function at rest in lowlanders older than
      40 years travelling to altitude. Participants living in the Bishkek area, Kyrgyzstan (760m),
      will be transferred by car within 4h to the Tuja Ashu high altitude clinic (3'100 m), and
      stay there for 2 days. Acetazolamide 375mg/day (or placebo), will be administered before
      departure at 760 m and during the stay at altitude. Outcomes will be assessed during the stay
      at 3'100 m.

      An interim analysis will be carried out when 200 participants will have completed the study
      and/or after the first year. The Peto's method will be used and the trial will be stopped
      when pre-specified futility boundaries were crossed.
