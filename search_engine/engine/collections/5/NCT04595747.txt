      I. To estimate the objective radiographic response rate to single agent rogaratinib (BAY
      1163877) in two cohorts of patients with sarcoma: Cohort A defined as patients with a sarcoma
      which harbors an alteration in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) 1, 2, 3 or 4
      identified by next-generation sequencing profiling, and Cohort B defined as patients with
      advanced succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-deficient gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients in
      Cohort A and Cohort B treated with rogaratinib (BAY 1163877).

      II. Further assessment for safety and tolerability.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate serial measurements of FGFR and FGFR ligand in serial tumor biopsies as
      potential pharmacodynamic markers of FGFR pathway inhibition by ribonucleic acid sequencing
      (RNA-seq) (pre-treatment biopsy and post-progression biopsy).

      II. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of the pre and post treatment biopsy to help identify
      mechanisms of resistance.

      III. To bank tumor material, germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and peripheral blood for
      potential future research for participating subjects who provide additional consent.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive rogaratinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 24 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.
