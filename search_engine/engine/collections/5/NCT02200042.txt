      I. To evaluate the addition of liver-directed radiation therapy with respect to overall
      survival (OS) for patients with unresectable, localized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the addition of liver-directed radiation therapy with respect to local control
      for patients with unresectable, localized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

      II. To evaluate the addition of liver-directed radiation therapy with respect to adverse
      events for patients with unresectable, localized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

      III. To evaluate the addition of liver-directed radiation therapy with respect to regional
      control for patients with unresectable, localized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

      IV. To evaluate the addition of liver-directed radiation therapy with respect to distant
      metastases for patients with unresectable, localized intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

      V. To evaluate the addition of liver-directed radiation therapy with respect to
      progression-free survival for patients with unresectable, localized intrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 3 years then
      every 6 months for 2 years.
