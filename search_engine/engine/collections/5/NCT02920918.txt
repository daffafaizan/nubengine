    
      Investigator Initiated Study: Randomized, double-blinded, active-control clinical trial to
      determine the safety and efficacy of Canagliflozin and Sitagliptin in patients with type 2
      diabetes and systolic heart failure (HF).

      The investigators propose to study the effects of Canagliflozin 100 mg vs Sitagliptin 100 mg
      (both administered once daily for 12 weeks) on parameters of aerobic exercise capacity and
      ventilator efficiency by CPET after 12 weeks of active treatment. BP, body water content
      (Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis [BIA]), body composition (Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry
      [DEXA]), cardiac function, diet and biomarkers will be also measured. Subjects with evidence
      of left ventricular hypertrophy will undergo cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging.
