    
      The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial to
      assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of suvorexant specifically in a cohort of 20
      Parkinson's Disease patients between the ages of 30 and 80 (inclusive) who have a complaint
      of insomnia. After informed consent is given, potential subjects will be screened to ensure
      they meet eligibility criteria. This will include an overnight polysomnogram, which will
      serve both as a baseline and a screening polysomnogram. Active drug will be suvorexant 10 mg
      orally at bed time with an optional up-titration to 15 mg orally at bedtime after 2 weeks.
      The first treatment period will be 4 weeks long, in which subjects will be randomized 1:1 to
      receive active drug or matching placebo. At the end of treatment period 1, subjects will
      undergo efficacy assessment with repeat polysomnogram and clinical scales. This will be
      followed by a 2-week washout period with placebo; this period only will be single-blinded, as
      subjects only will be blinded to treatment. Subjects will then be crossed over into the
      alternate treatment group, which will once again be double-blinded; those on active treatment
      for period 1 will be switched to placebo, and those on placebo in period 1 will be switched
      to active treatment. Treatment period 2 will also be 4 weeks long, and at the end of this,
      subjects will undergo final assessment with polysomnogram and clinical scales.
