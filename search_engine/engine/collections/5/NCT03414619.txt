      whether cognitive control is a common factor across three types of repetitive negative
      thinking (RNT): obsessions in OCD, worries in GAD, and ruminations in MDD. Specifically, the
      investigators aim to test whether individuals with obsessions, worries, and depressive
      ruminations demonstrate impaired cognitive control on executive functioning
      neuropsychological tasks (i.e., response inhibition, set shifting, attentional disengagement)
      relative to individuals without any psychiatric diagnoses. Additionally, the investigators
      will examine whether these deficits are associated with self-report measures of RNT as well
      as in vivo responding during a laboratory paradigm designed to induce intrusive thinking.
      Findings could inform psychological treatment of these problematic intrusions using novel
      transdiagnostic approaches.
