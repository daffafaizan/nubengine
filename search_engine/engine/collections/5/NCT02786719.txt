      CYCLE 1+2: Topotecan and cyclophosphamide

      Cycle 3+5: Cisplatin and Etoposide

      Cycle 4+6: Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide and Doxorubicin

      Stem cell collection: After the third cycle of chemotherapy, stem cells will be collected for
      possible stem cell transplantation at a later date using apheresis. In order to have enough
      stem cells present in the blood, the patient will need to receive daily G-CSF injections
      before this collection.

      Surgery: After the 5th cycle of chemotherapy, most patients will have surgery to remove as
      much remaining tumor as possible.

      Growth factor support: Growth factors to increase the number of white blood cells, G-CSF and
      GM-CSF(granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor) will not be given routinely in this
      study. GM-CSF will be given for patients who have serious bacterial infections or delays in
      administering chemotherapy because of low neutrophil counts. All people enrolled on the study
      will receive GM-CSF prior to having surgical removal of the main tumor. All people enrolled
      on the study will also receive G-CSF prior to having patients stem cells collected.

      Optional survey: This research study includes an optional survey regarding quality of life
      while on the study. This survey will be filled out after cycles 1 and 4 of chemotherapy.

      Drug Shortages:

      In the event of a drug shortage of a medication that is not a G-CSF or GM-CSF product, the
      provider may use best clinical judgment regarding omission of the agent or substitution with
      a different agent. The medical and research records of study patients should reflect that the
      patient was informed of any delays and/or modifications in protocol therapy related to the
      shortage of the agent and the associated risks.
