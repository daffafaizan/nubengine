        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of benzoylphenylurea in patients with advanced
           solid tumors.

        -  Evaluate the acute and chronic toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Evaluate the pharmacokinetics and metabolites of this regimen and any potential
           correlation with pharmacodynamic effects in these patients.

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oral benzoylphenylurea (BPU) once weekly. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BPU until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6
      patients experience a dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 12 additional
      patients are accrued and treated with BPU as above to confirm the MTD.

      Patients are followed for 30 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study.
