      therapy and chelation therapy alone in retarding the rate of myocardial iron deposition in
      thalassemia patients with iron overload and a constant transfusion need.

      Alternate Hypothesis Chelation plus amlodipine therapy is more efficacious than chelation
      therapy alone in retarding the rate of myocardial iron deposition in thalassemia patients
      with iron overload and a constant transfusion need.

      The aim of the investigators study is to determine if amlodipine, an L-type specific calcium
      channel blocker, in addition to the standard aggressive chelation therapy, can retard the
      deposition of iron in the myocardium of thalassemia patients with significant myocardial iron
      load with or without cardiomyopathy.
