      without aphasia and with a previous independent functional status (mRS <3). Patients will be
      randomized into four arms: 1) control group, 2) treatment with citalopram 20 mg / day, 3)
      group levodopa (sinemet plus)100 mg / day, 4) group levodopa (sinemet plus) 100 mg / day +
      citalopram 20 mg / day.

      The treatment begins within the first 5 days of stroke and is maintained for 6 months. All
      patients will be treated according to current guidelines for secondary prevention. We will
      assess the following variables: demographic, vascular risk factors, etiologic subtypes
      according to TOAST criteria, neurologic deficit with the NIHSS scale, cognitive assessment
      with Minimental scale and functional status with scale modified Rankin at discharge, 3, 6 and
      12 months, Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT), GDS-15 Geriatric Depression Scale, Logical
      memory of WMS-IV . The cognitive assessment and motor functional status will be evaluated by
      a neuropsychologist and neurologist blinded to treatment assignment.
