      the Emergency Department to help evaluate trauma patients. In the field a paramedic will use
      the START (Simple Triage Rapid Treatment) triage procedure to evaluate many patients and to
      help decide which patients are more critical and therefore need to be transported first. This
      study aims to create a mass casualty environment through the use of 10 volunteers who are on
      peritoneal dialysis and 10 patients who are not.
