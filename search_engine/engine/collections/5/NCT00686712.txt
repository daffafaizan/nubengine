      in improved control when used as a once-nightly or morning basal insulin injection in type 2
      diabetic patients who are inadequately controlled on combination oral agents has been
      controversial. Inner city ethnic minority patients with diabetes are a particularly
      challenging population of diabetic patients to treat. This study investigates whether insulin
      glargine may be a more effective or safer first-line basal insulin than NPH in this
      population.
