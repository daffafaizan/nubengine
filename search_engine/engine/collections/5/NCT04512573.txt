      treatment satisfaction measures in the real world using a bring-your-own-device approach for
      patients with rheumatoid arthritis who are initiating a JAKi medication. An exploratory
      objective is to assess the feasibility of using smartphone or web-based data collection to
      expand upon the insights gained through the Corrona RA Registry which uses a traditional
      site-based approach.

      POWER is a prospective, non-interventional study that will collect structured real-world data
      from patients with RA using a patient-centered mobile health application called
      ArthritisPower™. Patients planning to start treatment with a JAKi medication will self-report
      disease activity and treatment satisfaction through their first 3 months of therapy using
      their own web-enabled device such as a smartphone or computer.

      Patients will be recruited from the Corrona RA Registry at the time of a routine clinical
      encounter.

      After POWER registration, the remainder of the study is carried out using an automated data
      collection schedule via the web-based ArthritisPower™ application. Patients may complete
      assessments using a web browser or by downloading the free ArthritisPower™ application to a
      smartphone or tablet.
