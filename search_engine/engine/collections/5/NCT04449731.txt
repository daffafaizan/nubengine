      countries (i.e. including Bosnia and Herzegovina, Colombia, Croatia, Denmark, Egypt, Germany,
      Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Kosovo, Kuwait, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia,
      Poland, Portugal, Serbia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey and United Kingdom). A self-administered
      web-based questionnaire with questions aimed at assessing the dietary behaviours of the adult
      population during the COVID-19 confinement and before it started, will be distributed using
      social media and snowball sampling. The questionnaire is based on 44 items including
      socio-demographic data, MEditerranean Diet Adherence Screener (MEDAS) as a reference of a
      healthy diet, processed foods intake, changes in their usual food choices and weight gain.
      All data will be collected online to reach the largest number of participants from all
      territories.

      The main objectives of this study are: 1) to examine whether the COVID-19 outbreak
      confinement has influenced eating habits among the adult population from the 22 countries
      previously detailed, and 2) to assess the differences in eating behaviours between the
      countries involved in the study to have a global overview of the behaviour in the face of
      confinement that helps in public health decision making related to positive impact on the
      prevention of chronic diseases and COVID-19-related complications.
