      chemotherapy consisting of ifosfamide, carboplatin, and docetaxel followed by autologous stem
      cell transplantation in a variety of refractory malignancies.

      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation study of docetaxel. Cohorts of at least 4 patients each
      receive escalating doses of docetaxel IV over 11 hours as a continuous infusion 2 times daily
      in combination with constant doses of ifosfamide IV over 60 minutes daily and carboplatin IV
      over 60 minutes daily on days -6, -5, -4, and -3. On day 0, patients receive autologous stem
      cell (or bone marrow) transplantation. If 1 or 2 of 4 patients experience dose limiting
      toxicity (DLT), 4 additional patients are entered at the same dose level. If 3 or more of 4
      or 8 patients experience DLT, there is no further dose escalation and 6 additional patients
      are entered at the preceding dose level. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose
      level immediately preceding the level that caused DLT in greater than 50% of patients.
      Patients are followed at 3 and 6 months and then semiannually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued into this study.
