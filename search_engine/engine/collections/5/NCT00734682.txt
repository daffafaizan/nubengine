      relapse. The dose will be adjusted according to a phase-1 dose escalation scheme. Patients
      will receive drug intravenously every 3 weeks until tumor progression or excessive toxicity.
      Weekly follow up will occur to assess toxicities during the DLT phase of the trial. Patients
      will have different dose escalation if UGT1A1 is 6/6 versus UGT1A1 is 6/7. Patients with UGT
      1A1 of 7/7 will not be eligible. All patients must have UGT 1A1 status know as an eligibility
      requirement. Patients will be followed for both toxicity and progression, and progression
      will be evaluated by MR imaging every 6 weeks. Pharmacokinetics will be obtained in the first
      treatment cycle.
