    
      A long-term, multi-centre, open label, non-comparative phase III study in patients with
      atopic dermatitis. All centres in Europe which have participated or are still participating
      in the FG-506-06-12, FG-506-06-18 or FG-506-06-19, FG-506-06-22 or FG-506-06-23 studies will
      be offered a participation in the protocol. Only patients enrolled by those centres for the
      above mentioned studies, who have received at least one dose of study medication can be
      enrolled. Tacrolimus ointment 0.1% will be administered until clearance of the skin occurs.
      Treatment is restarted after signs and symptoms reoccur. Safety will be assessed from adverse
      events reported by the patient/parent/guardian or observed by the investigator at the site of
      application and elsewhere. The safety evaluation will include monitoring of routine
      hematology and serum chemistry parameters at Baseline/Day 1, Week 1, Month 6, Month 12, Month
      18, Month 24, Month 30, Month 36, Month 42 and/or at the end of the study (End-of-Study
