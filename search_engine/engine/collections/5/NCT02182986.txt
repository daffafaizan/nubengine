      malignancy in children after transplant. Diagnosis and effective treatment of the
      EBV-associated cancer is hampered by our inability to determine which children are at risk of
      developing these cancers and to detect the cancer at an early stage. In this study, we plan
      to test new "biomarkers" in the blood of children that will tell us very early on if the
      child is at risk of developing the EBV-associated cancer or if the cancer is present. These
      studies provide new opportunities for detection, diagnosis, and treatment of children with
      EBV-associated, post-transplant cancer.
