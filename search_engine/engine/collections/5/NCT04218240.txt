    
      An inpatient detoxification study where pregabalin (PBG) will be given orally at a starting
      dose of up to 600 mg daily (group 1) tapered to 100 mg daily over 7 days; given with
      lofexidine (LFX) starting at 2.16 mg daily and declining to 0.72 mg over 7 days. On day 8,
      subjects are offered an injection of XR-NTX if they provide a urine sample that is negative
      for opioids and buprenorphine and pass a naloxone challenge. All subjects, regardless of
      whether or not they receive XR-NTX, will be given a referral and appointment for follow-up
      treatment when they leave the inpatient detoxification program.
