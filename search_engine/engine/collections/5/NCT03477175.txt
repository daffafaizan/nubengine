    
      This is an open-label extension study to roll-over eligible participants from Eisai-sponsored
      lenvatinib studies. The participants may roll-over no sooner than the primary completion
      dates in their parent study or after all study data for the primary outcome measure have been
      collected for the parent study. The parent study is defined as the Eisai-sponsored lenvatinib
      clinical study in which the participant was receiving lenvatinib either as monotherapy or as
      combination therapy or was receiving any other comparator therapy. The participant can be
      enrolled in the current study for the purpose of long-term safety data collection if all the
      selection criteria for the current study are met. The intention is that the participant will
      not be without study drug during the transition from the parent study to the rollover study.
