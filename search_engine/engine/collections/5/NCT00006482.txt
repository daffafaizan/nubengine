        -  Determine the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with
           refractory or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive cisplatin IV and gemcitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Treatment
      continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-69 patients will be accrued for this study.
