      concentration epidural analgesia can achieve pain relief and allow for ambulation. Prior
      investigations have not shown a benefit in cesarean delivery between those who ambulate with
      an epidural and those who do not. These studies were conducted in women with normal weights.
      It is unknown if ambulation with a labor epidural is beneficial in decreasing cesarean
      delivery among obese women.

      Obese women at term with a singleton pregnancy will be enrolled in this study. Patients will
      receive their epidural analgesia when they desire per standard protocol at our institution.
      Following epidural placement, a Modified Bromage Score and straight leg test will be
      performed. If the patient passes the straight leg test and has a modified Bromage score > 6,
      the patient will be randomized to ambulation or no ambulation. Those in the no ambulation
      group will have standard of care. Those in the ambulation group will wear a pedometer and a
      mobile fetal monitoring device. They will be encouraged to ambulate for 20 minutes per hour
      with another adult alongside them. Obstetric care will be standard of care.

      On postpartum day one, the patient will be administered a Labor Agentry Scale. Chart review
      will then be conducted to review maternal and neonatal outcomes.

      The first ten patients will be part of a pilot study, all with intervention to determine
      feasibility of monitoring and ambulation.
