      in the development of systemic hypertension and the effects of positive airway pressure (PAP)
      treatment on blood pressure (BP) control are continuously increasing; however they are
      controversial. We aimed to determine the long term effects of compliance with PAP therapy on
      BP in both hypertensive and normotensive patients with OSAHS.
