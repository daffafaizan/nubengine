      I. To evaluate the effect of dexamethasone (Dex) treatment in patients with relapsed
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using 3'-fluorothymidine (FLT) positron emission
      tomography (PET) as measured by changes in tumor maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the reversibility of Dex-mediated changes in tumor FLT retention following the
      withdrawal of Dex.

      II. Measure tumor Glucocorticoid Receptor alpha expression (GRÎ±) from recent patient biopsy
      samples.

      III. Analyze blood samples obtained during imaging to determine serum Dex concentration and
      for senescence markers in circulating tumor cells.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-5. Patients undergo 3
      fluorothymidine F-18 (18F)-FLT PET scans. One scan within 7 days prior to the start of
      dexamethasone, one scan on day 3 after the 5th dose of dexamethasone, and one scan 6-9 days
      after the last dose of dexamethasone.
