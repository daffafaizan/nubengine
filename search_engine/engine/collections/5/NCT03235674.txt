      CVD, unfortunately, CR is vastly underutilized, due to low referral rates and patient-related
      factors such as time commitment, travelling distance or user fees. After 2 weeks of CR
      exercise prescription, ~80% of patients opt to exercise independently rather than join a
      structured rehabilitation program in the community, suggesting that alternatives for current
      centre-based CR should focus on at-home programming with the intention of enhancing adherence
      and maintaining the lifestyle benefits long-term. The implementation of high-intensity
      interval exercise in CR programming has proven to be time-effective, enjoyable, safe, and
      capable of inducing similar if not superior cardiorespiratory responses, when compared to
      traditional, continuous CR programs. Recently, the benefits of interval stair climbing
      exercise in sedentary women were established, in that completing 3, 60 second bouts of high
      intensity stair climbing, 3 days/week for 6 weeks improved cardiorespiratory fitness, and
      represents a model of low-volume high-intensity interval training which is tolerable,
      effective and easily accessible for sedentary adults.
