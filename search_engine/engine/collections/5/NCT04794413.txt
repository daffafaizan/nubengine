      dopamine (a brain chemical involved in movement). However, many of these drugs have adverse
      effects including irreversible, involuntary movements, typically affecting the face, known as
      tardive dyskinesia. Newer drugs may have lower risk of tardive dyskinesia. However, many of
      these drugs are still in clinical trials or are very expensive when used off-label (without
      FDA approval) to treat Tourette Syndrome. Given these limitations, exploring the potential of
      other drugs is essential in helping patients.

      Several studies have shown that serotonin, another chemical in the brain like dopamine, may
      also play a role in the symptoms of Tourette Syndrome. Serotonin is already the target of
      many drugs in the treatment of depression, anxiety and obsessive-compulsive disorder which
      frequently occur in patients with Tourette Syndrome. Pimavanserin is also a drug that works
      on serotonin system. This means it may be helpful in the treatment of Tourette Syndrome.
