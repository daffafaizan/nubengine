      Polish conditions. The detailed medical/ epidemiological history will be collected in each
      patient. The fracture will be assessed based on the x-ray examination and will be qualified
      according to AO classification. NRS (Numerical Rating Scale) will be used to assess the pain
      intensity. SF36, QoL, CSQ, COPE and HADS questionnaire will be used to evaluate patient's the
      quality of life (subjective assessment). First assessment will be done before operation and
      then after 3, 6, 12, 24 month postoperation treatment.

      With this main study, there is a plan to assess not only femur fractures patients, but the
      investigators would like to have addtional groups of the patients with hip and knee allopasty
      and knee arthroscopy with slightly different follow-up period: before the oparation, 1 and 12
      month after the treatment.
