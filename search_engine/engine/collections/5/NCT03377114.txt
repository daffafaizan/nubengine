      naso/oro-pharyngeal tissue. Application of force to overcome resistance can cause tissue
      injury leading to bleeding, which can disturb tracheal intubation.

      The hypothesis of this study is that the method of 'head tilting' can help easy passing of
      tracheal tube at naso/oro-pharyngeal pathway without trapping in nasotracheal intubation. The
      purpose of the present study is to investigate the effect of 'head tilting' on the incidence
      of trapping of tracheal tube at naso/oro-pharynx when tracheal tube is being advanced into
      oropharynx via nostril during nasotracheal intubation.
