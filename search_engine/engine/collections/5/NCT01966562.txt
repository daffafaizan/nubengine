      challenge, and the behavioral aspects of the activity) and the context (the social context)
      of activities are key elements when distinguishing various types. Social activity affects
      wellbeing or survival by reducing the risks of social isolation and by supplying emotional
      intimacy, socio-emotional support, reinforcement for one's self-concept and social roles, and
      the sense of being valued. On the other hand, productive activity may influence health and
      wellbeing through satisfaction with outcomes, economic gains, mental stimulation, comforting
      personal routines, sense of purpose, and increased self-efficacy or self-esteem. There are
      significant relationships between QoL and attitudes toward aging in older adults. It has been
      in fact demonstrated that a proactive attitude (i.e., exercise, planning ahead, and
      marshaling support) influences QoL outcomes (i.e., depressive symptomatology and social
      activities).

      Evidence has moreover shown that exist gender differences in engage physical activities and
      in mood state in ageing. In fact, aged women are less engaged in physical activity than men,
      probably due to menopausal transition (MT) state. Literature has suggested that women who
      experience longer MT and increased symptoms have higher stress and increased risk of
      depression , that in turn may affect their engagement in physical activities.

      Starting from current literature, we hypothesize that specific physical activity, WBV, may
      promote psychological well being and quality of life in female aged subjects. Moreover and
      therefore, we assume an improvement in proactive attitude and happiness when compared to and
      Multi-component training control group.
