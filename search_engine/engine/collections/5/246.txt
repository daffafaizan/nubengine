renal hemosiderosis (blue kidney) in patients with valvular heartdisease .anatomic evidence of intravascular hemolysis, i.e., renalhemosiderosis, was found at necropsy in 4 of 132 patients who died ofsevere valvular heart disease . the aortic valve in each of these 4patients was heavily calcified, immobile, and portions of the calcificdeposits were in direct contact with the blood . hemolysis in eachpatient was attributable to direct trauma to erythrocytes traversing thestenotic valve, and the frequency of trauma was increased by anassociated regurgitant flow . renal hemosiderosis was not observed inany patient with isolated mitral valve disease, or in those withcombined mitral and tricuspid valve malformations .
