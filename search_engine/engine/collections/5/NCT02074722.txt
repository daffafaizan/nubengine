      ability for subjects to concentrate on control the SMR thus improving the performance of BCI.

      Subjects will be recruited for short term MBAT and then undergo BCI training. The performance
      of subjects with MBAT will be compared with those without MBAT to test the hypothesis.
      Procedures involved include 6 weeks yoga classes with at least 3 classes per week, and a EEG
      brain noninvasive brain computer interface study.
