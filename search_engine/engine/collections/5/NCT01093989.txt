      cerebral malaria and severe malarial anemia, "Pathogenesis of cognitive/neurologic deficits
      in central nervous system malaria", underway in Kampala, Uganda. The pathogenesis study seeks
      to address the question of why children with severe malaria have later problems in thinking.
      The study we are now proposing will build on this study by assessing whether children with
      severe malaria have iron deficiency, and if they do, whether treatment with iron at the time
      of malaria is less effective than treatment one month later. We believe that treatment one
      month later may be more effective because there is data that shows that the inflammation that
      occurs with a malaria episode may decrease the body's ability to absorb iron in the gut and
      to send iron to the places it is needed, like the bone marrow and the brain. We are doing
      this study to see if our hypothesis about more effective iron treatment if it is delayed is
      correct and assessing anemia prevalence, iron status, and long-term neurobehavioral
      development as outcomes.

      We have three study groups: children with cerebral malaria, children with severe malarial
      anemia, and healthy community control children. Children found to be iron deficient will be
      randomized to receive iron (as ferrous sulphate syrup) either immediately or at their
      one-month follow-up visit. At 1-, 6, and 12-month follow-up visits changes in iron and
      inflammation indicators will be assessed. At the 6- and 12-month visits, neurocognitive
      behavior will also be evaluated and compared between the immediate vs. delayed iron groups.
      Malaria morbidity will be assessed via home visits during the period of iron supplementation
      and via clinic monitoring for the duration of the study.
