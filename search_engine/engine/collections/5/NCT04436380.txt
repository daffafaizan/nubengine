      of a cytotoxic T cell attack on the marrow stem cell. It is effectively treated in most
      patients with either immunosuppressive treatment (IST) or upfront allogeneic hematopoietic
      stem cell transplant (HSCT). However, in patients who are treated with IST, relapse remains
      an issue with a rate of 30-40%. Once relapsed, patients can be either re-treated with IST or
      undergo HSCT. The two most common IST regimes used for relapsed SAA are rabbit ATG (rATG) and
      alemtuzumab. Both rATG and alemtuzumab have been shown to have a response rate of
      approximately 60% in relapsed patients with similar overall survival rates of 83-85%.
      Previous predictors of relapse include time from diagnosis to IST, and early response to IST.
      Few long-term data exist on patients requiring repeat IST treatment due to relapse.
