    
      This is a multicenter, controlled, randomized phase III study to compare participation rate
      with two screening rounds of FIT versus one-time screening colonoscopy in FDR of patients
      diagnosed of CRC.

      The recruitment process will be programmed through the index case, that will be interviewed
      to obtain their CRC family history. FDR will be contacted in order to make an appointment in
      the High-risk CRC Clinic of the participant centers. Randomization will be performed before
      signing the informed consent to avoid selection bias. A researcher will be responsible to
      provide detailed information about the study and getting the informed consent. In case of
      willingness to participate in the study, the FDR will be randomized to one of the following
      arms: A) One-time colonoscopy; B) annual FIT for two screening rounds and a colonoscopy in
      case of a positive FIT (cut-off = 10 Î¼g Hemoglobin/g feces). Screening uptake will be defined
      as the percentage of FDR who participate at least in one of the two FIT screening round in
      the FIT group or who undergo colonoscopy in the other group. Screening uptake will be
      calculated under the assumption of intention to screen analysis.

      The hypothesis of the study is that annual FIT uptake and colonoscopy when a positive test is
      higher than that of straightforward colonoscopy. Assuming an uptake of 0.50 for colonoscopy
      and 0.60 for FIT, a Type I error (alpha) of 5% and a power of 90%, 538 FDRs will be necessary
      to include in each group.
