      against the disease. Fetus is known to be influenced by maternal systemic infections. Thymus
      size of fetus and the neonate, is proven to be changed by primarily inflammatory/infectious
      diseases. Investigators of present study, suggested that fetuses are affected from the
      possible fetal inflammatory syndrome in case of maternal COVID-19. Therefore the aim of his
      study is to evaluate that if the cardiothymic index is affected by the maternal COVID-19 and
      to demonstrate any possible association of this measurement with neonatal morbidities.
