    
      Aim of this study is the characterization of patients with mild cystic fibrosis in terms of
      lung function, bronchial hyperreactivity and the degree of systemic and bronchial
      inflammation.

      Sputum and serum samples are analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain
      reaction(qRT-PCR) and by cytometric bead assay (CBA). Components of the innate immune system
      (mannose-binding protein, TLR recognition proteins and surfactant proteins) are genetically
      determined from sputum or blood respectively. In order to support the analyzed lung function
      and sputum/ serum biomarker data the investigators will also rely on pre-existing imaging
      data like chest x-rays or high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT)of the lungs.

      Methods and Work Programme:

      This study consists of two study visits (V1 and V2)

      V1:

      Measurement of nitric oxide in exhaled air (eNO) Measurement of carbon monoxide in exhaled
      air (eCO) Lung function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography Blood test: blood
      count, CRP, RAST, serum inflammatory mediators, genetic markers of the non-specific pulmonary
      defense system Induced sputum for inflammatory mediators and microbiological investigations

      V2:

      Unspecific bronchial provocation test with methacholine (PD20 FEV1 methacholine) Lung
      function testing with spirometry and body plethysmography

      Study population:

      CF Children and adults (6 - 60 years of age) and a healthy control group (6-60 years of age).
      Both patients and healthy subjects are recruited from the Christiane Herzog Cystic fibrosis
      outpatient clinic.
