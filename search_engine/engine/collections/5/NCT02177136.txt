    
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding evaluation of
      the efficacy and safety of OCA in subjects with PSC. Approximately 75 subjects who provide
      written informed consent and meet all of the inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria
      will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups as follows: 1.5 mg titrating to 3 mg OCA, 5 mg
      titrating to 10 mg OCA, or placebo, in a 1:1:1 ratio. Subjects will administer
      investigational product (IP) orally, once daily for 2 consecutive 12-week periods.

      For the first 12 weeks, the subject's dose will be 1.5 mg OCA, 5 mg OCA, or placebo. After 12
      weeks, the subject's dose will be titrated as follows, providing there are no limiting safety
      or tolerability concerns in the opinion of the investigator, while maintaining the trial
      blind: the 1.5 mg OCA treatment group will titrate to 3 mg, the 5 mg OCA treatment group will
      titrate to 10 mg OCA, and the placebo group will remain on placebo. Double-blind treatment
      will continue for a further 12 weeks at that dose.

      Any subjects whose dose is not titrated, due to safety or tolerability concerns, will remain
      on their starting treatment (1.5 mg OCA, 5 mg OCA, or placebo) for the remainder of the
      double-blind phase to Week 24.

      Randomization will be stratified by the presence or absence of concomitant ursodeoxycholic
      acid (UDCA) use and total bilirubin level (â‰¤ 1.5x upper limit of normal [ULN] or > 1.5x ULN
      but < 2.5x ULN).
