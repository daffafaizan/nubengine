      proximal middle cerebral artery (MCA) or basilar artery (BA) occlusion. This trend is due to
      the limited efficacy of the only approved acute stroke treatment, systemic thrombolysis, in
      large vessel occlusion but also due to new technical innovations triggering the development
      of numerous devices for thrombus extraction. Within large single-arm trials, some of these
      devices demonstrated their potential with respect to acceptable complication- and substantial
      recanalization rates. Nevertheless, clinical outcome of these stroke patients is frequently
      poor despite an elaborate, aggressive, but also complex and costly treatment regimen. The
      factors determining good or poor clinical outcome in mechanical recanalization remain to be
      determined. The goal of the ENDOSTROKE-registry is the systemic evaluation of technical and
      clinical features that might be important for the further development and evaluation of
      endovascular treatment strategies for acute stroke. Special emphasis is laid on the
      assessment of clinical outcome (90 day MRS). Concerning technical and periprocedural aspects,
      a focus is put on time issues i.e. intra-hospital time delays, duration of angiographic
      procedures until vessel patency is achieved.It is planned to enroll approximately 500
      patients in this registry. In first line, prospective patients will be included in the
      register (start date January 2011) but retrospective inclusion of patients being treated
      within the three years before the start of the register is allowed as long a consecutive
      patient registration is guaranteed (to exclude selection bias). Data analysis will include
      univariate and multivariate approaches with respect to clinical outcome measures.
