      Primary

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of temozolomide in combination with bevacizumab in treating
           patients with metastatic uveal melanoma not amenable to curative surgery.

      Secondary

        -  To determine response rate in these patients.

        -  To determine duration of response in these patients.

        -  To determine progression-free survival of these patients.

        -  To determine overall survival of these patients.

        -  To determine the safety of treatment with this regimen in these patients.

        -  To study the CT perfusion imaging for functional imaging of response in these patients.

        -  To determine the pharmacogenetic influence of constitutional VEGF-A polymorphism on the
           efficacy and toxicity of bevacizumab. (ancillary)

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-7 and 15-21 and bevacizumab
      IV over 30-90 minutes on days 8 and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses.
      Patients achieving at least stable disease then receive bevacizumab monotherapy IV every 2
      weeks as maintenance therapy in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease progression.
      Patients undergo CT perfusion imaging at baseline, day 28, and at 3 and 6 months.

      Blood samples are collected at baseline and then periodically for VEGF-A genetic polymorphism
      analysis.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.
