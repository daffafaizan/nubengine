    
      This is a two-arm, randomized study to determine 1) whether weekly monitoring of respiratory
      function can lead to timelier initiation of NIV and 2) whether structured nurse coaching
      leads to improved self-efficacy for managing disease and better maintenance of respiratory
      health. For enrollees in both arms, standard FVC and MIP measurements obtained approximately
      every three months by the respiratory therapist during ALS Clinic are supplemented with
      self-administered rPFTs performed weekly. Enrollees in the rPFT+NRHC (nurse respiratory
      health coaching) arm will additionally receive monthly coaching with the study nurse via
      telehealth. Outcomes include measures of quality of life and self-efficacy for managing
      disease.
