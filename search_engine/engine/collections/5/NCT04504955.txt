      of patients with atopic dermatitis. Data collected will be used to extensively evaluate the
      effectiveness and safety of medications used to treat atopic dermatitis. This will be done
      through the standardized collection of patient-reported outcomes (PRO) and clinician-reported
      outcomes (ClinRO), and the prevalence and incidence of comorbidities and adverse events,
      medication utilization patterns, and patient productivity measures.

      The design is a prospective, non-interventional registry for patients with AD under the care
      of a dermatologist or qualified physician extender. Longitudinal data are collected from both
      patients and their treating dermatology providers during routine clinical encounters using a
      structured and standardized data collection method. The scope of data collection includes but
      is not limited to patient demographics, disease phenotype, duration, medical history
      (including all prior and current treatments for AD), smoking status, alcohol use, disease
      activity and severity, as well as other clinician- and patient-reported outcomes,
      comorbidities and adverse events, infections, hospitalizations, and other targeted safety
      outcomes.

      After the enrollment visit, AD patients and physicians will complete the follow-up
      questionnaires during regularly scheduled clinical encounters. The goal is to collect data
      from patients and providers approximately every six-months.

      Adverse events may be volunteered spontaneously by the subject or be discovered as a result
      of general questioning by the Investigator. During all Corrona related visits with the
      Investigator, subjects will be questioned regarding the occurrence of adverse events.
