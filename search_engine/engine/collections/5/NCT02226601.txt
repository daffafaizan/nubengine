      the so called "cognitive impairments" opioids may cause, such as drowsiness, loopiness and
      feeling "high".

      This would allow for a better recovery period, in which patients can be more "themselves",
      participate in activities around them and move forward.

      Subjects scheduled for elective surgeries with expected opioid medication for moderate to
      severe pain and good functional status shortly after surgery will be randomized to receive
      either aprepitant or placebo shortly before their surgery and for two more days thereafter.

      A telephone interview for cognitive status and several specific questions will be used to
      assess the effect of aprepitant on the subjects' cognitive and functional status.
