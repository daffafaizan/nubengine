    
      At least 102 asthmatics will be randomized 2:1 (2 to training group; 1 to control) and
      undergo 6 months of intervention or usual lifestyle.

      Subjects must have confirmed asthma diagnosis, on a stable treatment with inhaled
      corticosteroid, symptomatic and untrained.

      At enrollment and during the study asthma medicine is adjusted based on asthma symptoms
      evaluated by ACQ-5. 6 treatment steps are pre-defined, and if well controlled asthma,
      subjects are down-titrated one step, if uncontrolled, subjects are uptitrated one step.
