      euphoric effects of opiates. However, naltrexone treatment suffers from high rates of
      drop-out and relapse. One possible explanation for this is that opiate addicts continue to
      experience stress in early recovery from opiate dependence. Lofexidine is an experimental
      medication currently used in the United Kingdom for opiate detoxification and to treat opiate
      withdrawal symptoms, including sleep difficulty, muscle pain, anxiety, and tension. The
      purpose of this study is to examine whether lofexidine in combination with naltrexone can
      improve an individual's ability to cope with stress. The study will examine whether this, in
      turn, increases the likelihood that an individual remains abstinent from opiates and
      maintains recovery for a longer time period.

      Participants in this 12-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will be randomly
      assigned to receive either lofexidine or placebo while currently receiving standard
      naltrexone outpatient treatment. Lofexidine will be initiated at twice daily doses of 0.4 mg
      and increased to 0.8 mg by the end of Week 1. The doses will be increased to 1.2 mg by the
      end of Week 2, and maintained at this level for Weeks 3 through 12. During Week 12,
      lofexidine discontinuation will be tapered over 4 days. Hour-long study visits will occur 3
      times each week to assess vital signs, medication side effects, and withdrawal symptoms.
      Blood, alcohol, and urine tests will be performed as well as a psychiatric evaluation.
      Administration of naltrexone will also occur 3 times each week. Follow-up visits will occur
      at Months 1 and 3 after discontinuation of lofexidine.
