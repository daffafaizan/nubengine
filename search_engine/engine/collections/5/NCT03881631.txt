      lessen the psychological burden of family or spousal dementia caregiving. Some caregiver
      intervention studies have included measures of self-reported physical health and sleep, and
      others have focused on improving inflammation in caregivers. The current study will add to
      this literature by examining the effects of two behavioral interventions on adaptive immune
      responses, particularly, antibody response to influenza vaccination, in older adult family
      caregivers.
