      improving balance performance in people with PD. However they did not include all the balance
      domains and outdoor fall-prone activities have been overlooked. We designed a task- and
      context-specific balance training program based on the framework of the Balance Evaluation
      Systems Test (BESTest) to target all six balance domains including biomechanical constraints,
      stability limits and verticality, anticipatory postural adjustments, reactive postural
      responses, sensori-motor integration and dynamic gait control.
