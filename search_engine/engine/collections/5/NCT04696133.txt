      reading related skills in children with learning and intellectual disabilities were seen
      using sensory integration and fine motor intervention. However, there are limited studies
      investigating the effectiveness of sensory integration/occupational therapy on autistic
      features (stereotype movement, communication, and social interaction). Fine motor skills and
      quality of life of children with Autism spectrum are markedly affected which might be related
      to the stereotype movement and limited social interactions. Therefore, this study will be
      conducted to investigate and compare between the therapeutic outcomes of sensory SI and fine
      motor intervention on autistic features, fine motor skills and quality of life of children
      with Autism spectrum.
