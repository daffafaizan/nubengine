      (infusion of Idarubicin-Lipiodol intra-arterial hepatic) will be tested. The adjuvant
      chemotherapy is a minimally invasive technique. It consists of the administration of
      Idarubicin (Zavedos®, Pfizer) mixed with Lipiodol (Lipiodol Ultra-Fluid®, Guerbet) in the
      hepatic artery.The first course of treatment will be performed under general anesthesia at
      the same time as the percutaneous tumour ablation. The second and third cures will be
      performed under local anesthesia 3 and 6 weeks after percutaneous tumour ablation
      respectively. In the case of incomplete treatment during the percutaneous tumour ablation,
      the second intervention will be scheduled at the same time as the second intra-arterial
      chemotherapy treatment, under general anesthesia.
