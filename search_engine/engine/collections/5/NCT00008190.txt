        -  Determine the efficacy of busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide followed by
           autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation and interleukin-2 in patients with
           high-risk acute leukemia.

        -  Determine the efficacy of immunomodulatory therapies in terms of relapse-free survival
           of these patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the hematopoietic reconstitution, relapse, and survival of these patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Following a course of mobilization chemotherapy, patients receive priming therapy
      comprising filgrastim (G-CSF) and interleukin-2 through the completion of leukapheresis.
      Patients then receive oral busulfan 4 times daily on days -8 through -5, cyclophosphamide IV
      continuously on days -4 and -3, and etoposide IV over 2 hours on day -4. For patients unable
      to receive cyclophosphamide and etoposide, melphalan IV is administered instead on days -3
      and -2. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are reinfused on day 0.

      Patients then receive G-CSF daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts
      recover followed by interleukin-2 subcutaneously daily beginning at the completion of G-CSF
      therapy and continuing for 6 months.

      Patients are followed weekly for 1 month and then monthly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-5 years.
