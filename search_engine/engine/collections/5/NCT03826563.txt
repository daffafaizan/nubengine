    
      Context: Sleep disturbances and circadian dysrhythmias have been associated with psychotic
      symptom severity in Psychosis Spectrum (PS) youths. Supplemental melatonin is a safe
      over-the-counter dietary supplement, and several studies have found that melatonin improves
      sleep across several childhood neuropsychiatric disorders.

      Objectives: Investigators seeks to determine whether supplemental melatonin improves sleep
      and circadian alignment in PS youth. Investigators will also investigate whether supplemental
      melatonin affects psychotic symptoms, neurocognition, and peripheral inflammatory and
      oxidative stress markers.

      Study Design: Parallel group, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial
      Setting/Participants: 40 PS youths ages 11-30 years old (throughout the protocol we use
      "youth" to describe this age group) with sleep disturbances will be recruited from an extant
      cohort of PS youths followed by our lab in the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC),
      Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), University of Pennsylvania (UPenn), and the
      surrounding community. The study will be conducted at CHOP and UPenn.

      Study Interventions and Measures: Youths will be randomized to receive pill placebo or oral
      melatonin. Participants will take melatonin (or placebo) at the same time every evening for 2
      weeks (final dose range 2.5-10 mg nightly). Outcomes will be assessed at 1 week, 2 weeks, and
      6-months. Primary outcomes will be changes in self-reported sleep and actigraph-measured
      sleep and circadian rhythm. Secondary outcomes will be psychotic symptoms, neurocognition,
      and peripheral blood markers of inflammation and oxidative stress.
