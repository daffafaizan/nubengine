      transdiagnostic intervention for repetitive negative thinking (RNT) will significantly
      improve the target of attentional/cognitive control. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (like the flip of a coin) to receive eight 60 minute sessions (over 8 weeks) of either:
      Emotion Regulation Therapy-Attention Regulation (AR-ERT) or Supportive Psychotherapy (SPT).
      The investigators will use a multi-method approach to measure attentional/cognitive control:
      (a) behavioral (i.e., eye tracking fixations and reaction time), (b) electrophysiological
      (i.e., event related potentials), and (c) self-report (i.e., perceived ability to shift and
      focus attention). They also will examine early signs of treatment efficacy of AR-ERT and SPT
      and target validation (i.e., whether changes in attentional/cognitive control correlate with
      changes in RNT and associated symptoms). Participants will receive assessments of these
      target and outcome measures at baseline (week 0), mid-treatment (week 4), post-treatment
      (week 8), and 3-month follow-up (week 20). Findings could help identify a cross-cutting
      target that can be engaged to optimize treatment response for individuals with elevated RNT.
