    
      This is a single center, prospective study to compare early appendectomy vs. non-operative
      management of immunocompetent patients with complicated appendicitis, and then to compare
      interval appendectomy vs. no interval appendectomy in those managed with the initial
      non-operative approach. Patients who choose early appendectomy will have surgery within 24
      hours of diagnosis and be discharged once they are afebrile for 24 hours, have a normal WBC
      count, and can tolerate a diet. They will be discharged with 5 days of oral ciprofloxacin and
      metronidazole and follow-up in clinic 2-4 weeks later. Patients who choose non-operative
      management will receive piperacillin-tazobactam with or without abscess drainage until they
      are afebrile 24 hours with a normal WBC count and are tolerating a diet, followed by 5 days
      of oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole upon discharge. These patients will then be seen in
      clinic in 2-4 weeks, at which time they will be given the choice of whether or not to undergo
      interval appendectomy at least 8 weeks from initial presentation. Those in the interval
      appendectomy group will follow-up one month post-operatively. Patients in both groups will be
      contacted 3 months and 2 years following initial presentation.
