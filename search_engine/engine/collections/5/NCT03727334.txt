    
      The purpose of this study is to establish the feasibility of a novel intervention, and
      explore biomarker predictors of neurodegeneration and response to the proposed intervention.
      This 16 week intervention utilises allocentric spatial navigation tasks to improve memory and
      counteract hippocampal neurodegeneration. This intervention will be administered in
      combination with neuropsychological assessments, MR imaging, and the analysis of genomic
      variants at two time points; 6 months post-TBI and 12 months post-TBI.
