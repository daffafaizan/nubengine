      the study that was being conducted at the investigators' institution. Prospective subjects
      that met the inclusion criteria were identified from the hospital operating theatre's
      database two weeks prior to surgery. A letter, which contained the study's objectives and
      methods, was sent out to all patients. Subsequently, a telephone call was made to patients
      one week before surgery to clarify any queries they had. Consent was obtained on the morning
      of surgery. All study participants provided written informed consent.

      Peri-operative monitoring LiDCOâ„¢ CNAP and BIS monitoring were attached prior to induction of
      anaesthesia in the anaesthetic room of the operating theatre. A standardised anaesthetic
      technique was used for every participant, consisting of propofol induction, sevoflurane
      maintenance to a target BIS (40-60) and opioid analgesia with fentanyl. Participants
      underwent positive pressure ventilation to a tidal volume of 8ml/kg.

      Measurements of the following variables were taken continuously from pre-induction to time of
      extubation: heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic
      vascular resistance and BIS. Data recorded up to 3 minutes following propofol injection was
      analysed to capture the post-induction period. Further measurements were taken in recovery
      room. The total quantity and type of fluids, drugs administered, time of tourniquet
      application and removal (if performed), and the duration of the operation were recorded.
