      leading factor in the development of skin cancer. The majority of these individuals continue
      to protect themselves minimally and tan intentionally, including significant increases in
      tanning booth use recently. Such care-free behaviors exist despite widespread
      education/awareness about UV radiation and skin cancer. The purpose of the proposed project
      is to investigate the efficacy and longevity of two novel approaches to changing skin
      protection behaviors: 1) UV-detect photos that reveal currently existing skin damage and 2)
      motivational interviewing (MI), a person-centered, yet directive counseling style used to
      enhance internal motivation to change health behaviors. The proposed investigations include a
      pilot study to refine the methodology; a small formal randomized controlled efficacy trial;
      and a dismantling study. These studies will also expand current knowledge and research in
      several major ways: 1) the use of UV-detect photos will enable highly salient and
      personalized feedback, 2) MI will be used in a previously untried health domain (skin cancer
      prevention), 3) objective skin color changes will be measured using state-of-the-art skin
      reflectance spectrophotometry, and 4) the proposed studies will test aspects of several major
      psychological theories (e.g., Transtheoretical Model, Prototype/Willingness Model) to
      identify moderators/mediators of outcome. Therefore, the studies should provide useful
      information about process and outcome for skin cancer prevention researchers and clinicians.
