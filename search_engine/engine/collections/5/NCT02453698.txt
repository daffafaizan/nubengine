      attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). MPH suppresses the reuptake of dopamine by
      blocking dopamine transporter, which is elevated in ADHD. However, the precise mechanism by
      which suppressed dopamine transporter activity relieves ADHD symptoms is not fully
      understood, partly because dopamine pathways are implicated in various processes that could
      play a role in the deficits of ADHD and other disorders. MPH-induced dopamine variation has
      extensive effects in the brain and influences various executive functions in unknown ways.

      Hypotheses:

      Inhibitory Control: The investigators predict that MPH should increase the top-down activity
      in right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex associated with response restraint during go-phases
      and bottom-up activity in caudate and right inferior frontal cortex associated with response
      cancellation during successful stop trials. A greater modulation of top-down or bottom-up
      activity would imply a selective effect of MPH on one pathway over the other.

      Error Processing: The investigators predict that MPH should increase the intensity of
      deactivation in the bottom-up dopamine pathway on error detection (substantia nigra, dorsal
      striatum and ACC), and increase the intensity of deactivation in the top-down pathway on
      post-error slowing (caudal OFC, ventral striatum, ventral substantia nigra). A greater
      modulation of top-down or bottom-up activity would imply a selective effect of MPH on one
      pathway over the other.
