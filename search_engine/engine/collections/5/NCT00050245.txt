      antibody Rituximab to induce a clinical and serological remission in patients with
      IgM-anti-glycoconjugate antibody-mediated demyelinating neuropathy. Rituximab is a monoclonal
      antibody specific for the common B cell antigen CD20. Its administration depletes pre-B and
      mature B lymphocytes without altering neutrophils or hematopoietic stem cells. In humans with
      indolent B cell lymphomas, Rituximab can be safely administered, is well tolerated, promotes
      selective B cell depletion and lowers the serum IgM levels. Preliminary experience in some
      patients with demyelinating polyneuropathy and IgM-anti-glycolipid antibodies has shown that
      Rituximab was beneficial in improving the patient's symptoms and reducing the anti IgM
      antibody levels. In the present study we will examine in a placebo randomized trial the
      efficacy of Rituximab in patients with polyneuropathy related to IgM-anti-glycolipid
      antibodies. Twenty-six patients will be randomized to receive placebo or Rituximab given at
      four weekly intravenous infusions of 375 mg/M(2). The primary outcome will be based on
      changes in the monthly measurements of the neuropathy scores. The fine specificities of the
      IgM antibodies to various glycoconjugates or differences in the affinity binding to various
      antigens in neural membranes will be explored before and after treatment. It is anticipated
      that the study will: a) provide a new, immune-based and target-oriented therapy for patients
      with this neuropathy and b) examine the pathogenic role of these antibodies in the cause of
      the disease.
