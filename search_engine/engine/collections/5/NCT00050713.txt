      drug, sirolimus, in patients with idiopathic and lupus membranous nephropathy. Patients (age
      greater than or equal to 13 years) will be invited to participate if they have persistent
      nephrotic range proteinuria despite standard treatment with an angiotensin converting enzyme
      inhibitor or an angiotensin receptor blocker for at least one month, unless intolerant. These
      individuals are at risk for renal function deterioration as well as cardiovascular and
      thrombo-embolic complications of the nephrotic syndrome. Renal function, the degree of
      proteinuria and side effects will be monitored closely throughout the study. Physiologic
      measures of glomerular function will be examined at study entry and at the conclusion of the
      trial.
