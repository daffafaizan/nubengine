      or variants electroencephalographic (EEG) features and psychomotor regression. Various
      underlying conditions are associated with the infantile spasm included cerebral malformation,
      hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy, genetic disorders (Down syndrome), tuberous sclerosis
      complex (TSC), etc. Although vigabatrin has the evidence to use as the first line treatment
      for infantile spasm related with TSC. Adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH), or high dose
      prednisolone, or vigabatrin are the first line treatment of IS in non-TSC.

      The effectiveness of ACTH versus high dose prednisolone question have not yet definitely
      answered. Furthermore, ACTH expense and availability are the barriers in developing countries
      including Thailand. Vigabatrin, therefore, is the first option of therapy recommended by
      Epilepsy Society of Thailand due to ACTH unavailability. Recently, combined steroid
      treatments (either ACTH or high dose prednisolone) with vigabatrin are superior in cessation
      of spasms compared to steroid treatment alone. Questions about the clinical cessation of IS
      and electrographic remission by combination treatment with vigabatrin and high dose
      prednisolone compare to vigabatrin alone have not fully elucidated. Thus, this study is aimed
      to compare the efficacy of vigabatrin with high dose prednisolone combination therapy and
      vigabatrin alone.
