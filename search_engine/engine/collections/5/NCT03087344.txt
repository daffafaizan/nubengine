      stiffness (LSM) and spleen stiffness measurements after a test meal in patients whom the
      diagnosis cannot be reliably ruled in or ruled out based on two measurement of LSM by TE per
      standard of care. This includes patients in whom there is discordance between clinical
      impression and LSM and/or LSM are in the grey zone (LSM between 10 and 15 kPa). Liver
      biopsy/HVPG which is performed as standard of care will be used as gold standard.
