      obstructive sleep apnea. Studies showed high loop gain might also be acquired from long-term
      hypoxemia/hypercapnia due to OSA, and could be decreased by CPAP therapy in some of the
      individuals. Whether another treatment, i.e. upper airway surgery, could achieve a similar
      improvement in is not known. We hypothesize that 1) high LG could be reversible with improved
      hypoxemia and reduced apnea hypopnea index (AHI) by surgical treatment; 2) high loop gain at
      baseline may be associated with poor treatment outcomes.

      PSG was performed pre- and postoperatively to assess the OSA severity in participants who
      underwent uvulopalatopharyngoplasty and concomitant transpalatal advancement pharyngoplasty.
      Loop gain were calculated using a published method by fitting a feedback control model to
      airflow. The loop gain values at baseline and follow-up were compared. The association
      between loop gain change and improvement of OSA were analyzed.
