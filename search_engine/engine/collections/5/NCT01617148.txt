      previously treated with Ranibizumab or Bevacizumab for exudative macular degeneration.
      Specifically, we will examine its effect on macular degeneration, measured by SDOCT (Spectral
      Domain Optical Coherence Tomography) and ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study)
      visual acuity. This will be a prospective study with patients to receive an intravitreal
      injection of Aflibercept at the time of treatment.
