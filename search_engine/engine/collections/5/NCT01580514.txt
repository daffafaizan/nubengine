      therapy in patients with STEMI.

      Infarct size after STEMI was evaluated by both cardiac magnetic resonance image and cardiac
      biomarkers compared with standard treatment.

      LV function was assessed by conventional and speckle tracking echocardiography. During
      6-month follow up, the safety/tolerability of exenatide and clinical outcomes were also
      assessed.
