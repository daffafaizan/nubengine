      the safety and efficacy of CSF-1 in the treatment of presbyopia. Approximately 150 subjects
      will be enrolled across 7 study centers in the United States. At Visit 2, subjects will be
      randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment arms: CSF-1, CSF-1 Component #1, or CSF-1
      Component #2. All subjects will dose twice a day in both eyes with a single drop of their
      assigned treatment for approximately 1 week. At Visit 3, subjects randomized to CSF-1 will
      now receive a different concentration of CSF-1, subjects randomized to CSF-1 Component #1
      will receive a different concentration of CSF-1 Component #1 and subjects randomized to CSF-1
      Component #2 will continue dosing with the same concentration of CSF-1 Component #2. All
      subjects will continue dosing twice a day in both eyes for approximately 1 week.
