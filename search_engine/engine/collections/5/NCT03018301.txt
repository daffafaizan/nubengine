    
      -  No premedication will be given, and patients will be monitored by electrocardiogram,
           non-invasive arterial blood pressure, and pulse oximetry when they entered the operating
           room.

        -  18 gauge IV cannula will be inserted and all patients will be preloaded with 10 ml/kg of
           lactate ringer over 20 min period.

        -  All participants will have spinal anesthesia using bupivacaine. The dose of the drug, as
           well as the method of injection will be identical for all individuals; 10 mg (2 cc
           0.5%), in the L4-L5 space using needle 25 G, midline, with the patient in a sitting
           position.

        -  After administering bupivacaine, and prior to surgery the height of the sensory block
           will be assessed bilaterally (complete loss of sensation to ice) in a ascending fashion
           starting from T12 dermatome.

        -  Once adequate anesthesia to at least T6 dermatome will be achieved, the operation will
           be allowed to begin. When systolic blood pressure decrease to < 90 mmHg, or 30% of the
           pre-anesthetic blood pressure, it will be corrected by administering 5 mg ephedrine.

        -  Patients will be asked to report any intraoperative pain using visual pain score(VPS)of
           0(no pain) 10(worst pain).
