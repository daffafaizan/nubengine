      into a multi-site industry-sponsored Phase 4 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      study (NCT00406952) using an established antidepressant at a therapeutically efficacious
      dose. The analytic procedures used to extract the vocal acoustic measures will be automated
      to facilitate near rapid turn around between speech sample acquisition and delivery of
      biomarker outcomes data. Multivariate models of vocal acoustic information to enhance the
      sensitivity of treatment response measurement and prediction of patient response likelihood
      will be further refined.

      A total of 150 subjects will be recruited in the proposed studies, a sample of 50 from each
      of three targeted depressed patient populations - young adults (18-25 years old), elderly
      patients (60 years and older), and recent Asian immigrants with financial, linguistic, and
      cultural barriers to health care access. Eligible subjects will meet diagnostic criteria for
      Major Depressive Disorder, provide written informed consent, and will have baseline
      depression severity scores of 10 or greater on the QIDS. Pregnant women, women of child
      bearing potential not using a medically accepted means of contraception, suicidal or
      homicidal patients, or those with unstable medical illness including cardiovascular, hepatic,
      renal, respiratory, endocrine, neurological, hematological disease, or with clinical or
      laboratory evidence of hypothyroidism will be excluded. Patients beginning a new treatment
      for depression will be clinically evaluated (QIDS-C) during face-to-face interviews at the
      beginning of treatment (Baseline), and followed up 4 (study midpoint) and 8 weeks later
      (end-point). After completing the clinical interviews study participants will complete a
      series of IVR-based assessments using a standard desktop touch-tone telephone.
