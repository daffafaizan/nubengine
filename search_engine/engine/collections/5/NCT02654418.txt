    
      SIC 8000 is indicated for use in gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures for submucosal lift
      of polyps, adenomas, early-stage cancers or other gastrointestinal mucosal lesions, prior to
      excision with a snare.

      The current trial will focus on only colonic polyps â‰¥20 mm removed by snare EMR technique.

      Patients with lesions not suitable for EMR because of features strongly suggestive of
      sub-mucosal invasion will not be included.
