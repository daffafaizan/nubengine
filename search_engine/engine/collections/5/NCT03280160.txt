    
      Multicenter, non- randomized, open-label, double agent, phase II study of the Spanish Group
      of CLL (GELLC).

      Patients with untreated CLL/SLL. Ibrutinib will be administered orally 420 mg (3 x 140 mg
      capsules) once daily on a continuous schedule on an outpatient basis until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After 12 cycles of ibrutinib, patients that do not achieve a complete response (CR) will be
      treated with the combination of ibrutinib and ofatumumab. Patients in CR after 12 cycles of
      ibrutinib will continue with ibrutinib alone.

      Ofatumumab will be administered by IV infusion, 300mg on Day 1 and 1,000 mg on Day 8 of cycle
      13, followed by 5 monthly infusions of 1,000 mg (Day 1 of subsequent 28-day cycles for cycles
      C14, C15, C16, C17, and C18).

      A treatment cycle will be defined as lasting 28 days. Patients will be treated with
      ibrutinib, within the study frame, until progression, unacceptable toxicity or cycle C42 of
      treatment).

      All patients still on study treatment at the time of cycle C42, or if the study is stopped
      early, will be transitioned to prescribed ibrutinib.
