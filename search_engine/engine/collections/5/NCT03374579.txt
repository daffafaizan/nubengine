      challenge by giving via a specific venous line , first 150 ml is infused over one minute,
      after stroke volume at one minute measure the remaining 350 ml is infused over 14 minutes at
      constant rate , the fluid challenge performed with albumin 5% , fluid responsiveness is an
      increase in stroke volume by 15% after infusion of 500ml albumin 5%.

      Objectives is to investigate the ability of VA-co2 gap and gap/ ratio to predict the
      hemodynamic response to mini fluid challenge, and to compare the validity of VA-co2 gap and
      gap/ratio with svo2 for prediction of fluid responsiveness.
