      fascial planes, has significantly facilitated practice of regional nerve blockade for it
      offers confirmation of the spread of the local anesthetic drug in the correct space.
      Interestingly, there has been a reinvigoration of interest in ultrasonography-guided
      transversus abdominis plane block in children since its emergence as a valid postoperative
      analgesia alternative in adults undergoing abdominal surgery. transversus abdominis plane
      block involves blockade of spinal afferent nerves in the neurofascial plane between the
      internal oblique and transversus abdominis muscle. Whereas the advantages (reduction in pain
      intensity/analgesic requirements) of ultrasonography-guided transversus abdominis plane block
      have been well documented in adults in the first 48 hours post surgery, in children, its use
      as a primary postoperative analgesia technique remains limited. Caudal anesthesia is easy to
      perform in younger children; however, its main disadvantage is the short duration of action.
      Even bupivacaine, along-acting local anesthetic drug, can provide only4-8 h of analgesia.
      Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alfa2 agonist with sedative and analgesic properties.
      It has an alfa1/2 selectivity ratio of 1600 : 1, which is eight times more potent than
      clonidine (200 : 1)[16]. DEX has been used effectively in intensive care to aid weaning from
      mechanical ventilation and is being used increasingly in children
