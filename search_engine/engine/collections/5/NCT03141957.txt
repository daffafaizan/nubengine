      cause a progressive muscle loss associated with a decrease in resting energy expenditure
      (REE). In cancer, loud inflammation background also provokes a decrease in muscle mass as
      well as in fat mass. However, previous studies reported an increased REE, termed
      hypermetabolism, probably linked to inflammation.

      Data concerning response to aggression in the elderly patient is scarce and even inexistent
      when it comes to cancer. The investigators hypothesize that the mitochondrial dysfunction
      that comes with aging and that decreases the ATP rendering per unit of energy-producing
      nutrient oxidized increases the amount of nutrient to be consumed in order to sustain to
      energy needs. Therefore, in this situation, elderly patients could have a higher rate or
      degree of hypermetabolism than younger patients.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of aging on the metabolic
      response to cancer assessed by resting energy expenditure measured by indirect calorimetry
      corrected by whole body fat free mass calculated from single slice CT imaging at the third
      lumbar vertebra.

      The secondary objective of this study is to point out some inflammatory or endocrine
      determinants of these energy metabolism changes in the cancer patient.

      Non-small cell lung carcinoma seems to be a relevant choice for this study because it is
      frequently associated with cachexia and the literature reports a high rate of hypermetabolism
      in this cancer.
