    
      This is a Phase 2 study designed to characterize the objective response rate (defined as
      complete response (CR) and partial response (PR)) of Etirinotecan pegol (NKTR-102)
      administered to subjects with metastatic and recurrent NSCLC after failure of 2nd line
      therapy. Up to 37 eligible subjects will be enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania.

      One cycle will be defined as 3 weeks. Patients will be followed clinically every week for the
      first cycle with laboratory parameters and physical exam. Response will be determined by
      RECIST version1.1 after 2 cycles of therapy. Patients with stable disease (SD), PR or CR will
      continue on treatment for up to six cycles. Those who are benefitting after six cycles will
      have the option of continuing on treatment. Patients with progressive disease will be taken
      off study and will be followed for OS data.
