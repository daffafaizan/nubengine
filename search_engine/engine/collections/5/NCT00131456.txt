      individuals diagnosed with both conditions may be effective. The purpose of this study is to
      determine the effectiveness of Ven-XR in treating individuals diagnosed with depression and
      marijuana addiction.

      During this twelve-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, study visits will occur
      twice each week. During study visits, participants will receive either placebo or medication
      and provide a urine sample for drug screening. Blood tests will be collected each month and
      women must take pregnancy tests each month. Throughout the study, all participants will
      receive individualized psychotherapy sessions. At each study visit, participants will be
      given $5 to cover transportation costs.
