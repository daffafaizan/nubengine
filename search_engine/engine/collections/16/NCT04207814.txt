      death in utero (FDIU) complicates the evolution of a pregnancy on 200. The SRM remain
      unexplained in 50% of the cases although a beam indirect arguments sometimes encourage to
      evoke a prothrombotic process and / or endothelial dysfunction, immunological disorders, an
      alteration of the ovarian reserve, and possibly the impact of genetic determinants. Regarding
      SRM, in the absence of a fetal, funicular cause or obvious preeclampsia, very diverse
      mechanisms are evoked depending on the placental histology (vasculoplacental, inflammatory,
      intervillitis, immunological, etc.). Thus, while these mechanisms remain for some to be
      demonstrated and are probably not unequivocal, clinicians are faced with a pressing request
      for therapeutic intervention on the part of patients. This is why, after having studied in
      DEFI-1 the 2 main constitutional thrombophilia in the 2 members of the couple, the
      procoagulant circulating microparticles and the generation of thrombin in the mother on the
      one hand, the modalities of inactivation of an X in the mother, on the other hand, a further
      investigation in subgroups of particular cases would be appropriate.
