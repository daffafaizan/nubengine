      a focused dose of radiation to the areas at high risk for locoregional recurrence following
      pancreaticoduodenectomy. This surgery is currently the only potentially curative approach for
      patients with pancreatic cancer. Unfortunately, following surgery alone >50% of patients will
      have a local recurrence of disease [5]. Local control will become increasingly important as
      chemotherapy regimens continue to improve the distant metastases-free survival.
      Intraoperative radiation therapy allows direct access to the tumor bed and areas of concern
      while allowing displacement and shielding of normal tissue and organs at risk of radiation
      toxicity.

      Study Objectives The primary objective is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for
      low kilovoltage (kV) intraoperative radiotherapy (IORT)

      The secondary objectives are:

      To develop acute and chronic toxicity profiles for this treatment modality

      To determine the feasibility of including low-kV IORT in the treatment of pancreatic cancer

      To evaluate the following physics and delivery parameters: treatment prescription dose, depth
      of treatment, applicator type, and treatment time.

      To measure patient's quality of life (QOL) before and after treatment, including change in
      pain level and fatigue level.

      To describe the disease specific outcomes of local regional control, progression
      free-survival, distant metastasis free-survival, disease free-survival and overall survival
      associated with low-kV IORT following pancreaticoduodenectomy.
