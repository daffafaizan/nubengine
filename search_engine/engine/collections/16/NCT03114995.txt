      a poor prognosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Devices like Ultegra Rapid
      Platelet Function Analyzer (VerifyNowÂ®) enable us to quantify platelet reactivity quickly in
      the catheter laboratory. This means that the poor responders to DAPT can be identified, and
      the patients' outcomes can be improved by providing additional antiplatelet agents.
      Tirofiban, a GP IIb/IIIa inhibitor, is a potent antiplatelet agent which is recommended for
      Non-ST-Elevation acute coronary syndrome (NSTE-ACS) with high risk at presentation. However,
      its role is not clear for patients stabilized with standard medical treatment but with a poor
      responsiveness to DAPT.

      In this study, Investigators administered tirofiban on top of DAPT to patients with NSTE-ACS
      undergoing PCI who have a high platelet reactivity (HPR) identified by VerifyNow.

      To the best of our knowledge, there are few studies conducted with tirofiban for tailored
      antiplatelet therapy. Moreover, this is the first randomized study with NSTE-ACS patients for
      tailored use of tirofiban under the guidance of platelet reactivity.
