      local infiltration, peripheral nerve blocks, and neuraxial anesthesia. This new formulation
      allows the effects of bupivacaine to last up to 72 hours as it is slowly released from a
      liposome. It is FDA approved for local infiltration and has recently been approved for
      interscalene blocks.

      A transversus abdominis plane block is a fascial plane block that is performed routinely for
      postoperative pain relief for some abdominal incisions. It is performed by placing local
      anesthetic between the internal oblique and transverses abdominis muscle planes where it will
      provide analgesia to several dermatomes of the abdomen in hopes of improving postoperative
      pain relief and reducing postoperative opioid requirement.
