      with a special cryo-assisted rotational design (Cassi II, USA) compared with FNA for biopsy
      of intermediately suspicious lymph nodes. Eligible patients would be randomized to one of two
      arms by 1:2 : Core with FNA or FNA alone. The diagnostic accuracy and adverse outcome of core
      and FNA would be compared.
