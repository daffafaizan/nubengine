      Departments. Research into risk factors for fracture has found that children who have
      narrower bones and a low bone mass are more likely to fracture than children with larger
      bones. Studies in postmenopausal women, young women with low bone mass and children with
      disabling conditions such as cerebral palsy, have shown that up to 10 minutes a day stood on
      a vibrating platform can significantly increase bone mass.

      However little is known of the immediate response of bone to whole body vibration (WBV). The
      investigators previously investigated the acute bone response in healthy pre-pubertal boys to
      standing on one of two vibrating platforms for 10 minutes on 1, 3 or 5 consecutive days. This
      showed a platform dependent reduction in the bone resorption marker CTx pre to post
      vibration, with an increase in the bone formation marker P1NP over the 8 day study. The
      investigators would like to look at the response of bone to WBV in pre-pubertal boys who have
      a history of fracture(s). The investigators will compare this to the investigator's previous
      data to determine if bone in boys who have previously fractured responds in the same way as
      bone in boys who have not.

      The investigators plan to recruit 24 boys aged 9-12 years who have had a previous fracture to
      stand on one of two vibrating platforms for 10 minutes on 5 consecutive days. Before and
      after the period of vibration on days 1, 3, 5, and on days 8 and 12 the investigators will
      take a blood sample to measure changes in the bone cells. The boys will be asked about the
      amount of exercise they have participated in over the previous seven days. The findings of
      this study will be used to direct further research.
