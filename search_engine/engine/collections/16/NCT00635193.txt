    
      This is an open-label study of liposomal doxorubicin with or without volociximab for the
      treatment of subjects with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer or primary peritoneal cancer
      relapsed after prior therapy with Plat/Taxane-based chemo. Volociximab is an anti-angiogenic
      integrin inhibitor being developed for the treatment of solid tumors. Preclinical data with a
      surrogate volociximab antibody administered as monotherapy indicate encouraging efficacy in
      terms of tumor reduction and anti-angiogenic effects in mouse ovarian cancer xenograft
      models. In clinical studies, volociximab has been evaluated in several solid tumor types,
      including pancreatic, renal, and melanoma, with many subjects who entered the studies with
      progressive disease remaining progression-free for several months.
