      The pilot: The first part, known as the pilot study, will include 8 subjects and will

      amount of each of the active ingredients in the stratum corneum.

      each of the active ingredients at steady state or close-to-steady state between LEO 80185 gel
      and Dovobet® Ointment. The number of subjects in the pivotal study and the number of
      application sites for study medications will be based on the results of the pilot study.
