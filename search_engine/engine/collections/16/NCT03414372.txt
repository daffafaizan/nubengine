      system that features three avatars, two virtual locations and three disclosure scenarios
      which represent a variety of common disclosure experiences and contexts experienced by YMSM.
      In Phase II the investigators will further enhance Tough Talks and develop a full-feature
      automated version to test via a multi-site, randomized controlled trial (RCT) through the
      newly created Center for Innovative Technologies (iTech) across the Prevention and Care
      Continuum, an NIH-funded center to support adolescent HIV research.
