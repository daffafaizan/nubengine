      on a previous technique where the supportive device and the semi tendon graft share the
      clavicular and coracoid drill holes. A notable problem with the previous technique was large
      protruding suture knots on the washer and clavicle, which could predispose to wound
      infection. In this new modified technique, new implants were introduced. The new implant
      hides the suture knot and less foreign material is needed.

      The purpose of this study is to follow the patients operated using the new implants with
      special attention to early clavicular wound healing. A further aim is to compare a technique
      where the semitendinosus graft runs through clavicular and coracoid drill holes versus a
      technique where the graft runs under the coracoid process.
