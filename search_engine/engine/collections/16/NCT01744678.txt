      last one shift rotation (5 -7 days): One 5-shift or 7-shift block of Orbit 1 night shifts on
      console with access to photic and exercise countermeasures, a second 5-shift or 7-shift block
      of Orbit 1 night shifts on console with no access to countermeasures, and a third 5-shift
      block of daytime office work off console. We will be measuring sleep via a wrist worn
      activity measuring device and compliance of exercise intervention via a small, commercially
      available heart monitor worn around the chest underneath clothing. The activity device will
      be worn continuously and the heart monitor will be worn on shift. These devices will be
      downloaded at the end of each block of shifts. Subjects will complete a short baseline
      questionnaire once at the beginning of the study. Subjective alertness will be assessed with
      the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS), performance testing will occur regularly and 'end of
      shift' questionnaires will be completed at the end of each shift. Drowsiness will be measured
      on the commute to and from work with the Optalert.
