      patients on self-reported health-related quality of life, admissions and mortality.

      Trial design: Randomized trial with polypharmacy intervention in addition to standard
      geriatric care. After referral to the geriatric outpatient clinic (but before the first
      visit), a medical secretary screens the patient's medication on the electronic medication
      list. If the patient is taking more than 8 different drugs, the patient is randomized to
      either standard geriatric care or standard geriatric care plus polypharmacy intervention.
      During the first visit, the patient is informed of the project and asked for written,
      informed consent. If given, we collect data regarding the patient's medication and any
      medication changes during the intervention, demographics, frailty (FRAIL Scale), Charlson
      Comorbidity Index, self-reported history of falls, recent admissions, self-reported,
      health-related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L) and death. Data is collected at baseline, 4 months
      follow-up and 13 months follow-up.

      Participants: All randomized, polymedicated (>8 drugs) patients referred to the geriatric
      outpatient clinic.

      Outcomes: The primary outcome is the between-group difference in the EQ-5D-5L difference
      (self-reported, health-related quality of life) between baseline and 13 month follow-up.

      The secondary outcomes are number of medications, number of successful medication
      discontinuations, number of admissions and visits to the emergency department, self-reported
      low-energy falls, and death.
