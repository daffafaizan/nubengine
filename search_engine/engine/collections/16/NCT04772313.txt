      subcutaneous (SC) MTX Run-in period. Participants must be able to tolerate MTX at a minimum
      dose of 15 mg during the 6-week MTX Run-in Period to be eligible to participate in the
      Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period.

      All participants who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria and complete the MTX Run-in Period
      will be considered enrolled participants. During the Pegloticase + MTX Treatment Period,
      pegloticase 8 mg will be administered IV every 2 weeks and MTX SC weekly.

      Two sequential cohorts of participants will be enrolled in this trial. Cohort 1 is targeted
      to enroll 20 participants who previously failed to maintain sUA (serum uric acid) response
      with pegloticase monotherapy and stopped pegloticase treatment without a history of
      pegloticase-related infusion reaction. If the safety assessment during Cohort 1 indicates
      that the pegloticase infusions are well tolerated, then the trial can begin enrolling Cohort
      2. 10 participants with a history pegloticase-related infusion reaction.
