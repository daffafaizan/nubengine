      will be qualified for final enrollment in the study and will be randomized 1:1 and treated
      with the investigational drug or placebo. Any stents will be placed only after randomization,
      assignment, and adventitial drug therapy, although any stenting decisions (other than for
      treatment of AEs) must be made prior to randomization and adventitial drug delivery in order
      to avoid bias toward or against stenting.
