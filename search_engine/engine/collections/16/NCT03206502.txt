      capture convulsive seizure events such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures (GTCS's), and to
      initiate an alert when such an event is captured. Patients can also enter seizures (captured
      or not, GTCS or not) into the "Mate" diary, and they can cancel or mark false alarms if
      Embrace triggered a false alarm.
