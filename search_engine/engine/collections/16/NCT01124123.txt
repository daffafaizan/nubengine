    
      Single centre, open label, cross-over, randomised, controlled, single dose study. The primary
      endpoint is the determination of plasma concentrations versus time (17 samples per subject at
      various time intervals after dosing) in order to assess the oral bioavailability of bilastine
      in healthy volunteers. Therefore the primary pharmacokinetic variable will be the area under
      the plasma concentration versus time curve from time zero to infinity (AUC 0-âˆž). Additionally
      the following pharmacokinetic variables will also be assessed: Cmax, AUC 0-t, tmax, Ae, Clr,
      t1/2. Additional objectives are to describe the safety and tolerability of a single
      administration of oral and endovenous bilastine in healthy volunteers.

      Twelve healthy volunteers will be included. Each volunteer will take in random order one
      single dose of 20 mg oral bilastine and 10 mg IV bilastine with a minimum washout period of
      14 days between them.

      Bilastine plasma concentrations will be measured using a liquid chromatography/mass mass
      spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) micro method
