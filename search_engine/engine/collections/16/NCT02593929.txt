      planned surgical resection of HNSCC. The dose will be 20 mg twice daily, the FDA-approved
      dose in myelofibrosis. The brief treatment duration is within the expected window of time
      that elapses from initial patient evaluation by a surgeon to performance of surgery. In the
      phase 0 or window trial model, a paired specimen analysis permits ex vivo evaluation of
      target modulation and pharmacodynamic changes in downstream or parallel molecular pathways.32
      This study design is optimal in order to assess the biochemical and immunomodulatory effects
      of ruxolitinib on HNSCC. Furthermore, predictive biomarkers can be developed as related to a
      clinical endpoint or a biochemical, pharmacodynamic endpoint.
