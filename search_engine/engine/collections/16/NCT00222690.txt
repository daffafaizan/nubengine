    
      Fibromyalgia (FM) may currently be the most common rheumatic diagnosis of rheumatologists
      among their female patients, with 15-20% of all new rheumatology referrals meeting the 1990
      American College of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnosis criteria for fibromyalgia. People with
      fibromyalgia live through widespread musculoskeletal chronic pain, fatigue, psychological
      distress, and exhibit diminished physical performance due in part to the cycle of pain that
      adversely affect their activity participation and overall well-being.

      The purpose of this prospective mixed methods study is to conduct semi-structured qualitative
      interviews using ethnographic techniques to examine the personal experiences of women living
      with fibromyalgia. The specific aims of this study are to identify clinically relevant
      "triggers" of fibromyalgia symptoms and examine their impact on activity limitations and
      participation restrictions.
