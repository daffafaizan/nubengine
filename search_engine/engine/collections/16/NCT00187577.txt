      efficacy and safety of latanoprost (Xalatan) ophthalmic solution compared to bimatoprost
      (Lumigan) ophthalmic solution in patients with eyelash loss due to alopecia areata. This is a
      collaborative study between the Departments of Dermatology and Ophthalmology at UCSF.
      Patients will be randomized to receive either latanoprost or bimatoprost. Patients will be
      instructed to apply latanoprost or bimatoprost to the affected eyelid margins of one eye
      using a sterile cotton-tipped applicator once a day (similar to the application of eyeliner).
      The untreated eye will serve as a control. When substantial eyelash growth is noted in the
      treated eye, patients will be instructed to decrease application to once a week. Patients
      will be seen every four weeks in the Department of Dermatology. In addition, eyelash growth
      will be assessed in the Beckman Vision Center where eyelash length will be measured, and
      photographs will be taken at baseline, 2 months, and 4 months. Intraocular pressure will be
      documented at baseline and at each visit to the Beckman Vision Center. The study will be
      conducted over four months.
