      I. Determine the response rate in patients with recurrent or persistent endometrial
      adenocarcinoma treated with ixabepilone.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
