    
      In the first period, subjects received either the test formulation (160 mg valsartan
      film-coated caplets produced by PT Dexa Medica, Palembang, Indonesia) once daily, or the
      innovator film-coated tablets (DiovanÂ® 160, Novartis Farmaceutica S.A., Barbera del Valles,
      Spain for Novartis Pharma AG, Basel, Switzerland) once daily as the reference formulation. In
      the subsequent period, after a one-week wash-out period, they received the alternate drug.

      At the night before starting the study, subjects were instructed to fast from any food and
      drink but mineral water for 9 hours before the drug administration. In the morning after, at
      the dosing day, each of the 48 subjects then swallowed (without chewing) one dose of
      valsartan 160 mg of the test formulation or of the reference formulation, with 200 mL of
      water. As much as 5 mL of blood samples for drug assay were drawn again from each subject, at
      0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16, 24, 36, and 48 hours after dosing.

      The concentrations of valsartan in plasma were assayed using a validated high performance
      liquid chromatography with fluorescence detector (HPLC-FL) method. Pharmacokinetic
      parameters, including the area under the concentration-versus-time curve (AUC) from time zero
      to the time of last quatifiable concentration (48 hours after dosing) (AUC-t), AUC from time
      zero extrapolated to infinity (AUC-inf), maximum concentration (Cmax), time to reach the
      maximum concentration (tmax), and half-life (t1/2), were assessed in this study.
