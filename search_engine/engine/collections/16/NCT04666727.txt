      I. To evaluate the differences in dietary patterns among individuals reporting to be
      vegetarian and omnivorous.

      II. To compare the difference in stool microbiome pattern in the above mentioned two groups
      of individuals.

      III. To compare somatic mutations in colorectal epithelial cells in the above mentioned two
      groups of individuals.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To identify and characterize an association between diet, the microbiome and its genotoxic
      effect on the colorectal epithelial cells and predisposition to colorectal carcinogenesis.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete dietary questionnaire over 30-60 minutes and undergo collection of
      stool, blood, and tissue samples for analysis via sequencing and laser dissection.
