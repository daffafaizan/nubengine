      alternative and effective approach for stroke prophylaxis in AF patients, especially those
      with OAC contra-indications. Despite mounting evidence of their safety and efficacy in
      comparison with standard oral therapy, device-related thrombus and incomplete LAA closure
      resulting in residual, significant leak may occur, potentially hindering an effective stroke
      prevention. To date, detachable coils have found a wide range of applications for
      transcatheter occlusion/embolization procedures (e.g., cerebral aneurysms, pulmonary, renal
      and cerebral arteriovenous malformations, patent ductus arteriosus, endoleaks). The main
      purpose of this trial is to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of transcatheter leak
      closure with detachable coils in patients with evidence of incomplete percutaneous/epicardial
      LAA exclusion.
