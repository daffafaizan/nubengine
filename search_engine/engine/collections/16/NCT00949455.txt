      Primary

        -  Compare progression-free survival in patients with HER1- and/or HER2-overexpressing
           stage IV bladder cancer who have been randomized to maintenance therapy with lapatinib
           ditosylate or placebo following first-line chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare overall survival between these patient groups.

        -  Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the regimens in these patients.

        -  Assess and compare quality of life between these patient groups.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to ECOG performance
      status and response to first line chemotherapy (complete or partial response vs stable
      disease). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral lapatinib ditosylate once daily in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily in the absence of disease progression
           or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo quality of life assessment by EORTC QLQ-C30 at baseline and every 4 weeks
      during study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5 years.
