      to the higher safety and feasibility of this minimally invasive surgical option compared to
      standard open procedure. This procedure is performed under deep neuromuscular block (dNMB) in
      order to guarantee an adequate working space. Induction and maintenance of the dNMB require
      neuromuscular monitoring and adequate reversal at the end of the intervention to prevent
      postoperative residual curarization (PORC). Sugammadex is the most attractive strategy to
      titrate reversal according to NMB monitoring data and to ensure a complete recovery of muscle
      function before extubation. In elderly patients, the risk of PORC and related postoperative
      complications is higher. For these reasons, we hypothesize that a dose of sugammadex
      increased by 50% compared to a standard dose could significantly shorten neuromuscular
      recovery time, extubation time, OR discharge time and PACU length of stay in elderly patients
      undergoing RALP.
