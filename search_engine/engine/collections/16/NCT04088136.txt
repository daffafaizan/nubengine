      functioning in older adults. The approach (1) trains people to use simple but effective
      memory skills that have broad applicability in everyday life and (2) shapes a set of skills
      and habits of mind that will increase the likelihood of effective use of skills and memory
      aids. It is based on a metacognitive perspective on self-regulation in cognitively demanding
      situations and informed by recent theories about how suboptimal habit patterns can be
      altered. The approach has not yet been used in an everyday memory intervention in
      high-functioning, community-dwelling older adults. The proposed research validates ecological
      momentary assessment methods to get actual behavioral measures of forgetting in everyday
      life. It then uses these procedures in a randomized experiment that contrasts the everyday
      memory intervention group with a traditional memory-strategy training group. The hypothesis
      is that the everyday memory training intervention will reduce everyday memory errors and
      memory complaints, whereas the memory strategy training will alter strategy use and memory
      performance, with little cross-over effect. The hypothesized pattern will establish the
      explicit benefits of our everyday memory intervention procedures and demonstrate the
      limitation of standard memory training for that purpose.
