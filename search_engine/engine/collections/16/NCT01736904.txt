      with advanced colorectal cancer. According to the previous data, higher rate of diarrhea was
      observed in the combination of irinotecan and capecitabine (XELIRI) regimen, compared to the
      combination of irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil (FOLFIRI) regimen. However, the modified weekly
      XELIRI regimen, which was investigated in our previous single armed study, show tolerate
      toxicities compared with FOLFIRI, without compromising efficacy. It is supposed that wXELIRI
      regimen is no less less than FOLFIRI regimen in efficacy.
