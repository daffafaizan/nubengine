    
      This is an open-label Phase II Study to determine the efficacy of Gleevec® in
      neurofibromatosis (NF1) patients with plexiform neurofibromas with the secondary goals of
      determining the toxicity, and tumor markers in this genetically defined population. The
      rationale for this study arises from the response of human and murine NF1 cells to Gleevec®
      in vitro and the response of a single NF1 patient treated with Gleevec® for airway
      compression by a plexiform neurofibroma with a dramatic response not previously seen in NF1
      therapy. The plan of therapy will include oral dosing of Gleevec® at 440 mg/m^2/day (max 800
      mg/day) for pediatric subjects and 800 mg/day for adult patients. (with 25% dose reduction
      for significant toxicity). Treatment will continue for 6 months with an option to continue as
      long as the patient remains on study provided the patient shows benefit from treatments with
      Gleevec® and there are no safety concerns.
