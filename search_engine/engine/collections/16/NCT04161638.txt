      weight stigma (STIGMA) and the other non-stigmatizing neutral (NEUTRAL) scenes, on
      cardiovascular reactivity as assessed by resting BP and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP) and
      heart rate (HR), among women with obesity and high BP (HBP) or normal BP (NBP). The
      investigators hypothesized that as a result of STIGMA compared to NEUTRAL, cardiovascular
      reactivity would be significantly greater immediately upon watching the video and persist
      outside of the laboratory over ambulatory conditions in women with obesity and HBP compared
      to women with obesity and NBP.
