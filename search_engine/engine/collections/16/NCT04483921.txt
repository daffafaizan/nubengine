    
      Aim 1: Measure 24-hour energy expenditure and its components (resting, activity, and sleep
      energy expenditure) and compare differences between African-American and White girls.

      Hypothesis: Total, resting, and sleep energy expenditure will be lower in African-American
      relative to White girls. Activity energy expenditure will be equivalent per the study design.

      Aim 2: Measure and compare substrate oxidation and associations with appetite (i.e., hunger,
      desire to eat) and energy intake between African-American and White girls.

      Hypothesis: African-American girls will have a higher RQ at rest, during exercise, and
      following exercise, and RQ will be positively associated with subjective appetite ratings and
      energy intake.
