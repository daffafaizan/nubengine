    
      This clinical trial will be conducted in a single center, prospective, and randomized manner.
      In this protocol, standard radio(chemo)therapy duration is 6 weeks. Early enteral nutrition
      intervention (EEN) refers to starting enteral nutrition intervention 2 weeks before
      post-operative radio(chemo)therapy begins and stopping this intervention 2 weeks after
      post-operative radio(chemo)therapy completes. Standard enteral nutrition intervention (SEN)
      refers to starting of enteral nutrition intervention 3 weeks after post-operative
      radio(chemo)therapy begins and stopping this intervention 2 weeks after post-operative
      radio(chemo)therapy completes. Nutritional supplementation periods for EEN and SEN groups are
      10 weeks and 5 weeks, respectively. Dietitians will design meal plans for both groups of
      subjects so that their normal diets will provide 25-30 kcal/d/kg body weight in additional to
      nutritional supplements.
