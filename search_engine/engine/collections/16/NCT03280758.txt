      muscle mass, strength and functional performance in older patients with Type II Diabetes (T2
      DM).

      This is a single-blinded, randomized controlled trial. 60 subjects will be randomly allocated
      to either a muscle strengthening group or a no exercise control group.

      Information on demographic characteristics, body composition, muscle strength, functional
      capacity and glycemic control will be collected at baseline (pre-test) and after a 4-month
      intervention (post-test). Muscle strengthening group will receive resistance training 3 times
      per week (1 hour/session).

      The control group will not receive any training but can continue usual medical care and daily
      activities.
