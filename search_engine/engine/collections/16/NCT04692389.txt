      device Jalosome® soothing gel in the healing of grade 2 or 3 radiodermatitis, in oncology
      patients undergoing radiotherapy treatment, during a 8-week observation period.

      The secondary endpoints are radiodermatitis pain control and quality of life.

      The investigators would like to involve 30 oncology patients. All oncology diagnosis will be
      included in this pilot study. The study will adopt a quasi-experimental design with one arm.
      The results will be used to determine the sample size for a clinical trial in which the class
      IIA medical device Jalosome® soothing gel will be compared to usual care.
