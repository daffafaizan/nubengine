      insulin-secreting beta-cells. This consequently leads to a lack of insulin and elevation of
      blood sugar, namely hyperglycemia, which is a major cause for the development of diabetes and
      its acute or chronic complications. The current treatment for type 1 diabetes requires a
      life-long dependency on daily insulin injections, causing inconvenience and burden to
      patients. Drug-induced hypoglycemia is also common as it presents a major challenge in
      insulin therapy. Furthermore, although insulin therapy is lifesaving, it is not a cure as it
      neither reverses the progression of the disease nor prevents the development of serious
      complications associated with this disease. New treatments are urgently needed.

      Recent studies have demonstrated that a natural chemical found in the brain,
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which is also produced in large quantities by pancreatic
      beta-cells, has beta-cell regenerative and immunoregulatory effects. Importantly, GABA
      prevented and partially reversed diabetes in type 1 diabetes mouse models. It is important to
      address essential questions regarding the potential effects of GABA in diabetic patients in
      humans. Given the largely unknown mechanism of action of GABA in the pancreas, and the
      limited information on how GABA is absorbed, distributed and eliminated from the human body,
      we plan to examine these issues (referred to as pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics) in normal
      subjects.

      The outcome of this study will provide useful information on the mechanism of action of GABA
      in human subjects.
