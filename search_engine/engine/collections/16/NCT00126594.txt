      I. Efficacy of Bay 43-9006 with or without low dose interferon by evaluating response rate in
      MRCC.

      II. Toxicities of Bay 43-9006 with or without low dose interferon in MRCC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival. II. Duration of response. III. Overall Survival.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      Arm I: Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28.

      Arm II: Patients receive sorafenib as in arm I and low-dose interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously
      twice daily on days 1-28.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of progressive disease or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Tissue samples are analyzed for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) patterns via
      genotyping.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
