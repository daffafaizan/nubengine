      techniques and the operation follows the normal procedure, in addition a sentinel node
      mapping is performed.

      Indocyanine green is injected around the tumor by laparoscopic technique, the fluorescence is
      controlled and after 20 minutes the surgeon looks for sentinel nodes in a standardized
      manner. In the meantime, the surgeon proceeds with the operation as usual, except that the
      mesocolon can be resected only after sentinel node mapping has been performed.

      After surgery the surgeon and the pathologist inspect the resected colon together and agree
      on D1, D2 and D3 margins. Any marked sentinel node(s) is verified and the location is checked
      on the colon diagram on the case report form. In addition, an ex vivo sentinel node mapping
      will be performed by the pathologist right after the surgery has ended. This is done to
      investigate if it is the same lymph nodes there will be identified by ex vivo as by
      intraoperative (in vivo) sentinel node mapping.

      The lymph nodes in the resected colon and mesocolon are all analysed. Sentinel nodes and an
      equal number of randomly chosen non-sentinel nodes will be analysed further with additional
      sections and immune histochemistry.
