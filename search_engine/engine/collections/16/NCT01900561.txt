      research to understand and improve survivorship care for this large population of Veterans. A
      substantial proportion of prostate cancer survivors in the general population have
      significant side effects from treatment (surgery or radiation therapy) that often persist for
      years, including incontinence, erectile dysfunction, and metabolic syndrome, all of which can
      contribute to decreased quality of life. The investigators' pilot data suggests that VA
      prostate cancer survivors experience similar or worse symptom burden to that of the general
      population of survivors. To address the need to improve patient-centered survivorship care
      management for Veterans with prostate cancer, the investigators propose a 4 year study with
      two aims: 1) to conduct a randomized controlled trial to compare a personally tailored
      automated telephone symptom management intervention for improving symptoms and symptom
      self-management to usual care. The investigators expect that those in the intervention group
      will have more confidence in symptom self-management and better symptom self-management and
      prostate cancer quality of life following the intervention, and that these outcomes will
      translate to more efficient use of services for these Veterans, and 2) to compare utilization
      of services among those in the intervention group to those in the control group.
