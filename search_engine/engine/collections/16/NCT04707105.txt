      therapeutic managements have been proved effective. Large quantities of work needs to be done
      to fully delineate the prevalence and prognosis of ICH. Hence, the investigators design a
      prospective, observational cohort study to provide contemporary information on the
      prevalence, characteristics, risk stratificationï¼Œcost-effective, treatments and prognosis of
      Chinese hospitalised adult patients with ICH.
