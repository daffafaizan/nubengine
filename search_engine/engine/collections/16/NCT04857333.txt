      identified in computed tomography (CT) scans from thoracic clinic. The radiological features
      and their chronological changes during follow-up period will be recorded in detail. Subgroup
      analyses will be performed based on the clinical and demographic characteristics of patients
      (including symptomatic information, comorbidities, family history, antibiotic usage, etc).
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) is collected from each patient at multiple time
      points to evaluate the patients' psychological status and its impact on clinical
      decision-making. The interaction analyses between individual characteristics (such as
      education level, occupation, disease cognitive level, etc) and Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale will also be performed. The researchers aim to provide high-quality evidence
      for the formulation of a precise follow-up and management plan for patients with pulmonary
      nodules.
