    
      This randomized, open-label, Japan, Korea and Taiwan collaborative, phase 3 study will
      evaluate overall survival of nimotuzumab in combination with irinotecan compared to
      irinotecan alone in subjects with EGFR overexpressed advanced gastric or gastroesophageal
      junction cancer. Approximately 400 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      irinotecan (control group) or nimotuzumab and irinotecan (combination group). Nimotuzumab
      and/or irinotecan should be continued until disease progression or intolerable toxicity.
      Nimotuzumab is administered at 400 mg once weekly as an intravenous infusion and irinotecan
      is administered at 150 mg/m2 once every 2 weeks as an intravenous infusion.
