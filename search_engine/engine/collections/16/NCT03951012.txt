      initiation of anti-PD-1/L1 based immunotherapy, either single agent or in combination with
      chemotherapy. The blood will be coded, processed and sent for analysis. Results of analysis
      will be correlated with clinical data to see whether serum proteomics can be a good
      therapeutic predictor for future studies and treatments of NSCLC.
