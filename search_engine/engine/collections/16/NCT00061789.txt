      prevalence of cigarette smoking. Because animal and human studies have shown that nicotinic
      acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) play an important role in cognitive function, cognitive
      deficits in schizophrenia also suggest abnormalities in these receptors. Postmortem studies
      showed abnormalities in high affinity nAChRs in these patients but the direction of the
      abnormalities (increase or decrease) were not consistent probably because it is difficult to
      control the effects of cigarette smoking and neuroleptics in such studies. In vivo imaging
      studies are necessary to study relationship between nAChRs and psychiatric symptoms including
      cognitive impairments.

      We plan to use a new single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) tracer,
      [(123)I]5-I-A-85380, which appears suitable for imaging the high affinity Alpha 4 Beta 2
      subtype of nAChRs. We plan to compare four groups, 1) schizophrenia smokers, 2) schizophrenia
      non-smokers, 3) healthy smokers, and 4) healthy non-smokers. All patients will be on stable
      doses of olanzapine or risperidone. In addition to comparing [(123)I]5-I-A-85380 binding
      among these groups, relationship will be studied between psychiatric symptoms or cognitive
      dysfunction and the SPECT measurement of the receptors. Further, to study the reliability of
      the SPECT measurement, a test retest study will be preformed in healthy subjects with a wide
      range. The proposed study will explore the roles of nAChRs in the psychiatric symptoms,
      particularly the cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, which is the central impairment of this
      disorder. New findings in this research will lead to enhanced treatment of the cognitive
      deficits.
