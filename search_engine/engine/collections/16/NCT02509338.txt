      disorders. The main therapeutical target used for treating dystonic syndromes is the internal
      globus pallidum (GPi). Given the morphology and the topography of this nucleus and, based on
      the experience of an efficient therapy by using only one or two contacts out of the available
      four contacts of the standard DBS lead, we designed two new electrodes, one one
      contact-electrode and one two contact-electrodes, with the aim to limit side effects related
      to internal globus pallidum DBS and to provide a more homogeneous electric field around the
      electrode within the GPi and maintaining the same therapeutical outcome.

      The main objective of the trial is to study the technical feasibility of the implantation of
      a new one contact-electrode (Monopolar DBS Lead Model 09064-40cm) for treating isolated
      generalized/segmental dystonia or tardive dystonia.

      The second main objective of the study is to assess the safety of the implantation of the new
      device.

      The secondary objective is to explore the therapeutical effect of DBS using the new
      monocontact electrode and to study the electrical field generated around the monocontact
      electrode within the GPi.

      The study is prospective and patients are recruited from a Tertiary Movement Disorders
      Clinic. Seven subjects will be recruited for the study.
