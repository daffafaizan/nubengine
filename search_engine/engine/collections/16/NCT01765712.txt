      clinical studies that carefully and comprehensively investigate the role of PRP in ACL
      surgery. Specifically, ACL reconstruction using Bone Patellar Tendon Bone (BPTB) harvest and
      the role of PRP in decreasing postoperative pain at the donor site. Given the need for a
      highly powered study to demonstrate the clinical efficacy of PRP in ACL reconstruction, the
      investigators have designed a prospective, randomized, level 1, double-blinded study to
      evaluate the effects of PRP on the specific outcomes of donor site pain and radiographic
      measures of graft healing and incorporation.

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of intra-operatively applied autologous PRP
      in reducing donor site morbidity and increasing radiographic healing in ACL reconstruction
      using autologous BPTB.
