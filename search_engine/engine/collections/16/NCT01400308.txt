    
      Design: Multicenter, experimental, randomized and prospective study. The patients were
      consecutively and alternately assigned to each comparison group. Randomization was assured by
      central randomization and the first patient to one of the groups and, from there, too
      centrally, back to each of the two groups.

      Group A will be treated with the protocol described in the "Consensus document and GEIH-SEIMC
      SEMPSPH" Version 31/10/07, as shown listed in Table 4. It is a protocol of 5 days (nasal
      mupirocin and chlorhexidine, potentially plus systemic antibiotics and 7 days).

      Group B will be treated with the protocol established for Prontoderm® for five days and
      eventually plus systemic antibiotics. Ensure the correct application of the treatments
      without interruption over the weekend indicated protocol.

      Sample Calculation: The investigators propose an initial sample of 310 patients for a
      bilateral approach with a type I error α = 0.05 and β type II error of 20%.

      Analysis:

      Simple analysis and logistic regression (to adjust for risk factors, sources, concomitant
      therapy, etc) compared the frequency of decolonization of MRSA, according to sources.

      Procedures: To collect information using a standardized form CRD in paper to all hospitals,
      indicating the parameters listed in this protocol and cultures to be done both baseline and
      monitoring cultures

      DISEASE IN STUDY

      This will be treated either or both of the following conditions:

      MRSA Colonization: The presence of the organism in the flora of the patient, detected by
      positive culture for MRSA, and no diagnosis of infection.

      MRSA infections: presence of the organism between the flora of the patient, detected by
      positive culture for MRSA, and the presence of MRSA infection diagnosed according to criteria
      EPINE 2009 (Annex 8).
