        -  Multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) is a rare but lethal Kaposi's sarcoma-associated
           herpesvirus (KSHV) associated lymphoproliferative disorder with a median survival of 2
           years. It occurs more often in HIV-infected individuals than those without HIV
           infection. The poor prognosis is not fully explained by the underlying HIV, as the
           HIV-negative cases appear to have no survival advantage over the HIV-positive cohort.
           The disease has no defined standard treatment and has not been prospectively studied in
           a comprehensive manner.

        -  KSHV-MCD may provide a model for the development of targeted oncolytic virotherapy or
           other pathogenesis-based approaches to viral-associated malignancies. In KSHV-MCD, viral
           encoded tyrosine kinase genes appear to be possible targets to exploit in a virotherapy
           approach. Specific viral encoded genes appear to convert zidovudine and ganciclovir (or
           valganciclovir) into toxic phosphorylated moieties within the KSHV-infected tumor cells,
           to specifically target the KSHV-infected cells thus leading to specific cell death. If
           successful, this could have direct therapeutic benefit to participants and also provide
           a model for further development of this approach in other tumors.
