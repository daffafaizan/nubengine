      body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/mÂ² or greater. The rising prevalence of obesity in all parts
      of the world is of great public health concern due to the fact that obesity is associated
      with many causes of morbidity and mortality. Excess body fat accumulates when energy intake
      is greater than energy expenditure and recently, the role of the colonic microbiome has been
      highlighted as a potential contributor to energy balance. The obese microbiome is suggested
      to promote obesity due to an excess production of short-chain fatty acids, and, thus,
      increased colonic energy availability.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the effects of two human microbiome
      formulations (MET-3 and MET-5) on fasting serum TG concentration.
