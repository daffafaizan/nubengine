      will receive standard care gemcitabine/erlotinib for treatment of their metastatic pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma. They will be closely monitored for disease response/ progression. If vitamin
      C has a beneficial effect on tumour cells, patients may experience a regression of tumor or
      tumor markers. Additional benefits include scans at no charge to the patient. This study
      requires several days of treatment per week and treatments are given in two different
      locations. The intravenous vitamin C treatments are given 3 times per week, these are given
      every week for an initial cycle of 15 weeks.
