        -  The primary objective of this study is to determine whether subjects randomized to
           receive adjuvant HSPPC-96 after surgical resection of locally advanced renal cell
           carcinoma at high risk of recurrence, have improved recurrence-free survival as compared
           to subjects with no adjuvant treatment.

      Secondary Objective:

        -  Determine whether subjects randomized to receive HSPPC-96 have improved survival as
           compared to subjects with no adjuvant treatment.

        -  Further characterize the safety profile of HSPPC-96.
