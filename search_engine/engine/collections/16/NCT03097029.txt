    
      This is an interventional study of subjects with short bowel syndrome to determine if enteral
      absorption improves following therapy with pancreatic enzymes. The study will assess enteral
      absorption and nutritional status at baseline through a series of stool tests, blood tests,
      and anthropometric measurements. Following approximately ten days of therapy with pancreatic
      enzymes, the study will reassess enteral absorption.
