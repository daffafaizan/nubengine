    
      1. Aim 1 Determine if FDG-PET-MRI imaging biomarkers differentiate patients with VEDOSS/
           early SSc (predominantly inflammatory) from those with late SSc (predominantly
           fibrosis). Stool markers will be used as secondary biomarkers supporting inflammation.

           Study design: cross-sectional; The investigators will compare biomarkers between
           patients with VEDOSS/early SSc and those with late SSc not on immunosuppressive
           treatment.

        2. Aim 2 Evaluate FDG-PET-MRI imaging biomarker change over a 6- and 12-month treatment
           period with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) in patients with early SSc. Stool markers will
           be used as secondary biomarkers supporting inflammation.

           Study design: longitudinal; In early SSc patients, the investigators will determine
           change in biomarker levels from pre-treatment baseline to 6 months (primary end-point)
           and 12-months (secondary end-point) following MMF treatment.

        3. Exploratory Aim: In patients with VEDOSS/early SSc not on immunosuppressive treatment,
           the investigators will characterize imaging and stool biomarker changes over one year.
