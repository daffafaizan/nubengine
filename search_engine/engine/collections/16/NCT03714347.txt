    
      Patients undergoing intracranial surgery will be divided into two groups; group (Group
      Control n = 100) and cerebral oxygenation monitoring group (Group Oxygen). all hemodynamic
      parameters such as systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure, oxygen saturation,
      Et CO2, SpO2;% and BIS during anesthesia during anesthesia will be recorded intraoperatively
      and 10 postoperatively in 5 min intervals. After extubation, Modified Aldrete Score, GKS
      (Glasgow Coma Scale), Ramsey Sedation Scale (RSS), nausea-vomiting and pain will be recorded
      in the recovery room. Pain assessment will be done with Visual Analog Scale (VAS). Patient
      satisfaction will be recorded. MMST (mini mental state test) and ASEM (antisaccadic eye
      movement test) tests will be performed preoperatively and postoperatively at 1st, 2nd and 3rd
      days.
