    
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned treatment), placebo-controlled
      (an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has
      a real effect), parallel-group, multicenter study of the effects of canagliflozin on renal
      and cardiovascular outcomes in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic
      nephropathy, who are receiving standard of care including a maximum tolerated daily dose of
      an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB).

      The study will consist of a pretreatment phase (several weeks), and a double-blind treatment
      phase (up to approximately 66 months). During the pretreatment phase all participants will
      also receive diet/exercise counseling for lipid and blood pressure management as well as
      counseling on renal and cardiovascular (CV) risk factor medication. A post-treatment
      follow-up contact or visit will take place approximately 30 days after the last dose of study
      drug or the completion of the study. The total duration of the study is estimated to be about
      5 to 5.5 years. Approximately 4,200 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      canagliflozin or matching placebo. Participants randomized to canagliflozin will receive a
      dose of 100 mg once daily. The overall safety and tolerability of canagliflozin will be
      evaluated by collecting information on adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs (pulse,
      blood pressure), physical examination, and body weight.
