      guidelines require strict control of blood pressure for preventing cardiovascular events;
      however, the control is often poor.

      A new angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), azilsartan, is the first drug which is superior
      to other ARBs in blood pressure lowering in phase III clinical trials in Japan. We try to
      evaluate effect of azilsartan on blood pressure lowering in Japanese patients with
      hypertension who have already taken normal-dose ARBs, and to compare it with that of
      valsartan.
