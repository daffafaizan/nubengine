      radiopharmaceutical 3'-deoxy-3'-[F-18]fluorothymidine, [F-18]FLT, a radiopharmaceutical that
      directly assess tumor proliferation using Positron Emission Tomography (PET) in
      differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis in a group of 30 patients with glial
      neoplasms. This preliminary clinical study will investigate [F-18]FLT in patients with
      previously treated primary malignant brain tumors (WHO Grade II, III or IV glial-based
      tumors) who have a new or enlarging enhancing lesion on Gd-MRI and in whom it is not possible
      to differentiate recurrent tumor from radiation necrosis on the basis of conventional imaging
      techniques. The ability to make this important differentiation and accurately determine the
      amount/degree of tumor recurrence from the amount/degree of radiation necrosis in the
      enhancing mass is critical for the care of treated brain tumor patients and could potentially
      change patient management once validated as an accurate means of differentiating the
      amount/degree of radiation necrosis from recurrence.

      While the safety of [F-18]FLT has been studied in a many patients to date we will also obtain
      additional safety data on the use of this agent in patients with primary brain tumors in a
      cohort of the initial 12 patients to be studied. It is important to emphasize that the
      potential clinical application of [F-18]FLT imaging in brain tumors must be compared to the
      current widely used imaging techniques of MRI and PET imaging using the agent, [F-18]
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG).

      In this study, [F-18]FLT PET will be used to assess the three goals of this project:

        1. Show that imaging with [F-18]FLT and PET will or will not better determine the
           amount/degree of tumor versus necrosis in the abnormal areas seen on the recent MRI scan
           and FDG-PET scan.

        2. The [F-18]FLT radiopharmaceutical is shown to be safe or not safe in the amount
           administered in this study.

        3. The amount of [F-18]FLT that is seen on the PET study is shown to correlate or not to
           correlate with other tests used to determine the proliferation of brain tumors in a
           tissue sample of your newly identified abnormality on MRI in the event that another
           surgical biopsy or procedure is performed
