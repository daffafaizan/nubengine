      urethra, so that the inside of the bladder can be checked for injuries. Current guidelines
      recommend that this is done after a hysterectomy. Normally, doing a cystoscopy requires that
      a patient's foley catheter (a tube inserted through the urethra and into the bladder to drain
      urine) gets removed and then replaced. This can potentially lead to a urinary tract infection
      (UTI).

      CystoSureTM is a silicone device that was developed by surgeons to enable easy and
      standardized cystoscopy. The design of the CystoSureTM catheter has separate channels for
      draining the bladder and performing cystoscopy, so doctors can perform a cystoscopy without
      removing the catheter (which can, as described above, potentially lead to a UTI). In this
      study, investigators want to examine whether using a CystoSureTM catheter instead of a
      standard foley catheter could therefore lead to a reduced number of UTIs in hysterectomy
      patients. CystoSureTM is cleared by the FDA.
