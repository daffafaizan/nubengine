      promoting glycemic control and weight loss. However, it is unclear whether weight loss is
      attributed to decrease in fat components and associated with favorable changes in metabolic
      profile. The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes of body composition induced by
      SGLT2 inhibitor and its metabolic consequence in Korean type 2 diabetes (T2D).
