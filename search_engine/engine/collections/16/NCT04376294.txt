      randomly into two equal groups. The study group received ESWT in addition to a conservative
      physical therapy program for four weeks, while the control group received a conservative
      physical therapy program only. Pain and functional mobility were assessed before and after
      treatment through a visual analog scale (VAS) and Victorian Institute of sports assessment -
      Achilles questionnaire (VISA-A), respectively
