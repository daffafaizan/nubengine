      vessels) and tranexamic acid (TXA) (prevents bloodclots from dissolving). The drug studied to
      what extent it reduces pain will be bupivacaine, a common local anaesthetic. Patients
      undergoing bilateral symmetric breast surgery or single sided mastectomies are candidates for
      enrollment in the study. The bilateral patients will have two identical procedures and hence
      two identical wounds in the same patient. This enables the investigators to use one side as
      control and hence design our study arms as prospective and placebo-controlled. The patients
      undergoing a one-sided procedure will need to be compared to similar patients, but as wounds
      will be of different sizes and in different people, larger groups are needed to find
      significant differences between treatment and controls.
