      Medical Endocrinology, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen University concerning levothyroxine (T4)
      replacement and cardiovascular risk profile. The patient files are recruited among
      hypopituitary patients treated with growth hormone from the period 1993 to 2008. The trial is
      a retrospective assessment of data already collected for routine purposes and thus an audit
      of daily clinical practice. All information on the patients is obtained from the paper and
      electronic files existing in the department and no new measurements are foreseen.
