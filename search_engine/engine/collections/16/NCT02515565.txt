      admissions due to pneumonia range from the 1.1 and 4 per 1,000 patients, increasing with age.
      Hospitalization causes a decline in physical and functional status. Physical impairment
      involves a higher risk of disability and mortality in elderly people. Various studies have
      examined the impact of hospitalization in patients with respiratory pathology, and it has
      been shown that hospitalization implies a significant physical impairment in patients
      admitted for pneumonia showing that this deterioration increases with age. That highlights
      the need of interventions in order to reduce the impact of hospitalization. The objective of
      this study is to examine whether a physical therapy intervention can reduce impairment in
      patients hospitalized due to pneumonia.
