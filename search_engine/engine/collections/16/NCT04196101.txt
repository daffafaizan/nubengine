    
      Subjects (aged 18 to 75 years, inclusive) with up to 48 hours of upper respiratory tract
      infection (URTI) symptoms who test positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and
      negative for influenza virus by rapid testing (ie, Rapid Viral Screen). Subjects with stable
      asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) will be allowed in the study.

      Approximately 70 subjects will be enrolled in this Phase 2b, randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, multicentre study of EDP-938 administered orally for the treatment of
      acute URTI with confirmed RSV infection in ambulatory adult subjects.

      For each subject, the duration of study participation will be approximately 2 weeks and will
      consist of 3 periods: Screening (occurs on Day1), Treatment (5 days), and Follow-up (9 days
      after last dose).
