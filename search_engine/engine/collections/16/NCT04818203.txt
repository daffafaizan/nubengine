      The study consists of phase 1 to evaluate safety and phase 2 to evaluate efficacy.

        -  Phase 1: Single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design. If a subject
           voluntarily signs the written informed consent form to participate in this study, he/she
           will be enrolled as a subject after eligibility evaluation. After a single
           administration of the study drug to a subject, safety and efficacy will be evaluated at
           Week 2, Week 12, and Week 24 visits after administration.

      If an adverse drug reaction of grade 3 or higher occurs in 3 subjects 2 weeks after
      administration of the study drug in the phase 1 study; if an adverse drug reaction occurs in
      0/3 subjects, the phase 2 study will be conducted after completing the phase 1 study; if an
      adverse drug reaction occurs in 2/3 or more subjects, the study will be terminated; and if an
      adverse drug reaction occurs in 1/3 subjects, 3 additional subjects will be enrolled to
      proceed with the study. After the safety of subjects in the phase 1 study is confirmed by
      Week 12, the phase 2 study will be conducted.

        -  Phase 2: Single center, randomized, subject- and assessor- blinded, placebo controlled,
           parallel design.

      If safety is secured 12 weeks after administering the study drug in phase 1, phase 2 will be
      conducted.

      Only the subjects that meet the final inclusion criteria will be assigned sequentially and
      recognized by the same procedure and will receive the study drug once.

      Safety and efficacy will be evaluated at Week 2, Week 12, Week 24 after administration. All
      subjects will be tested on the same schedule.
