      thoracic surgery and defines the required length of postoperative hospital stay in the
      majority of patients. So far, no generally accepted recommendations exist for postoperative
      chest tube management to streamline the postoperative stay. Instead, decision making in most
      thoracic surgery units is based on team preferences and individual training rather than
      scientific data. Therefore, digital pleural drainage systems represent a useful tool to
      standardize existing intradepartmental protocols for chest tube management. However, for the
      development of generally accepted protocol-recommendations, the diverging interdepartmental
      treatment protocols have to be analyzed and compared for superiority. In this IIT, the effect
      of different chest tube management protocols on chest tube duration is analyzed in four
      German Thoracic Surgery units.
