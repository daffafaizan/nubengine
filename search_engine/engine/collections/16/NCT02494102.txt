      for the treatment of general anesthesia related delayed emergence in patients with the
      diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea. 124 patients will be recruited and randomized on the
      day of surgery to receive 200mg modafinil or placebo. After randomization, patients will
      proceed to the operative suite for surgical procedure under general anesthesia. The primary
      outcome measured will be post-anesthesia care unit length of stay. Secondary outcomes will
      include performance on a post-anesthesia recovery scale.
