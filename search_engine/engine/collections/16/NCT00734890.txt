      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose, safety, and toxicity of vandetanib and bevacizumab
           in patients with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Measure changes in VEGF and other angiogenic cytokines in plasma samples from these
           patients.

        -  Determine the biochemical changes in the EGF signal transduction pathways in tumor
           biopsy samples from these patients.

        -  Determine the anti-angiogenic effects of this regimen in tumor biopsy samples from these
           patients.

        -  Evaluate the application of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI to determine early changes in
           tumor vascular permeability during treatment.

        -  Evaluate the effects of this regimen on circulating endothelial progenitors and mature
           circulating endothelial cells in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral vandetanib once daily on days 1-21 and bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo blood sample collection periodically for correlative laboratory studies,
      including pharmacokinetic, biomarker (VEGF and other angiogenic cytokines), and circulating
      endothelial cell analysis. Patients may also undergo optional tumor biopsies for additional
      correlative laboratory studies.
