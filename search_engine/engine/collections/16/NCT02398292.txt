    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a 6-week nutrition, movement,
      and mindfulness program (M³ Program) for youth with a recent diagnosis of psychosis. Program
      effects on metabolic and mental health outcomes compared to wait-list control will also be
      assessed. Participants will be 15-25 years of age, and have a recent diagnosis of psychosis.
      Twenty participants and their study partners (20 study partners) will be equally divided into
      two cohorts. Participants will sign up for one of the two series on a rolling enrollment
      basis until both of the program date frames are filled. Participants that signed up for the
      second series will serve as a wait-list control; outcomes from the participants in the first
      series will be compared to this group. M³ will be a combination of didactic and experiential
      training. The course will meet once-a-week for six weeks. Participants will learn how to
      prepare healthy snacks and meals, make healthy choices when eating out, and interpret food
      packaging and labels. They will also learn about different forms of mindfulness exercises and
      movement, such as yoga, martial arts, and a Japanese style of drumming. Feasibility will be
      assessed throughout the program.
