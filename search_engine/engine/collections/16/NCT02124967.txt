      living in Ontario have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease
      (CHD) compared to the general population. Various explanations for these differences have
      been established, one of which is based on low levels of physical activity in people of SA
      origin, particularly in Muslim women. Studies suggest that they participate in less physical
      activity or recreational exercise compared to other SA women. Practical barriers (e.g. lack
      of time, childcare) are often interwoven with cultural barriers, such as restrictions leaving
      the home alone to enter mixed-gender settings, and lack of socialization into sporting and
      other outdoor activities) inhibit participation.

      The provision of culturally and gender sensitive facilities, such as women-only exercise
      sessions at mosques could serve as a solution for Ontario SA Muslim women to be more active.
      Studies indicate health promotion programs in religious institutions (e.g. churches) have
      demonstrated clinical and psychosocial benefit to women of various ethnic groups. Similar to
      Canadian churches, mosques have key elements identified in the literature to be beneficial in
      providing physical activity opportunities for Muslim women: partnerships, available and
      accessible space and supportive social relationships.

      To the investigators' knowledge, mosque-based physical activity interventions for SA Muslim
      women have not been implemented and evaluated in Ontario. Such interventions are needed to
      help attenuate the risk of diabetes and CHD in this ethnic group who represent a significant
      part of the Ontario population.
