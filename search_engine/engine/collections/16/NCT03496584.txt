      pomegranate juice to reduce skin aging by assessing UV-induced change and skin biological
      characteristics of elasticity, sebum, hydration/moisture and systemic inflammation and 2. To
      determine the impact of pomegranate polyphenols on the metabolic response to a high fat meal
      by postprandial flow-mediated dilation and plasma nitric oxide. The investigators propose to
      achieve the following specific aims in a randomized, two arm, parallel intervention of
      pomegranate juice or placebo for 12 weeks in obese men.
