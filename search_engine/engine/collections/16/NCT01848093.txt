      The aim of this study is to evaluate the molecular (mucins) and structure properties
      (mucin-stability) of the airway secretions in COPD related to the severity of the disease.

      We characterize sputum composition of patients with pulmonary exacerbations. Using gel
      electrophoresis, with specific antibodies we will analyze MUC5AC and MUC5B mucins.

      The significance of these studies is that they will give us novel information about the
      pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory airway diseases, provide tools for assessing the
      progression of lung disease, and most critically, will identify novel opportunities and
      targets for therapeutic intervention.
