    
      In this single-site, small-scale prospective natural history study, we intend to recruit up
      to 40 patients with PSC diagnosed by standard clinical, biochemical, or imaging features
      (including up to 30 with a known diagnosis of IBD) and up to 90 controls. Evaluation of
      subjects with PSC and of controls, as well as all study related procedures will take place at
      the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.

      Participants with PSC:

      We plan to obtain epidemiological as well as bio-samples from multiple body compartments
      presumably involved in development and progression of PSC. These will include the nasal and
      oral cavities, small bowel, colon, portal and systemic venous circulation, bile duct system
      and liver, and optionally bone marrow.

      Control Participants:

      We plan to collect epidemiological data as well as blood samples, nasal swabs, salivary
      samples and stool samples from family members and cohabitants of subjects affected with PSC.

      All or part of samples will be interrogated using cutting edge research methodologies which
      may include quantitative immunophenotyping via mass cytometry, microRNA sequencing of targets
      of interest, metagenomic sequencing, and other high throughput "omics" techniques. The robust
      datasets generated from these multi-omics investigations will be integrated and mined using
      advanced bioinformatics tools by leading experts in the field.
