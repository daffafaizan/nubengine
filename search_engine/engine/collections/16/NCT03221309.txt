      development of directly acting antivirals (DAA) has dramatically improved the cure rate of
      HCV treatment. However, despite the availability of effective therapy, the global epidemic of
      HCV infection continues to be driven by people with ongoing injection drug use (PWID), who
      are largely excluded from HCV therapy. Several critical barriers exist preventing high-risk
      patients' entry to care, including (1) lack of engagement in the traditional healthcare
      system by marginalized patient populations, and (2) insurance restrictions due to concerns
      regarding treatment adherence and HCV reinfection. Furthermore, ongoing injection drug use
      places these individuals at high risk of HIV acquisition. However, studies have repeatedly
      demonstrated that pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) reduces HIV acquisition and opioid
      substitution therapy with buprenorphine reduces HIV and HCV acquisition in PWID.

      As such, we propose a comprehensive model of care to engage individuals with ongoing
      injection drug use in treatment of HCV, in conjunction with collocated services to prevent
      HIV acquisition and HCV reinfection, including pre-exposure prophylaxis and opioid
      substitution therapy. This pilot trial will demonstrate whether a comprehensive model of care
      can simultaneously treat HCV, and prevent HCV reinfection, HIV acquisition and effectively
      treat opioid use disorder.
