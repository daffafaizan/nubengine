    
      This is a 30-day sponsor-initiated, open-label trial of the therapeutic treatment THX-110 (a
      combination of Dronabinol and PEA) in 30 adults with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
      Participants will receive THX-110 for the duration of the trial. The goal for this pilot
      study is to provide initial safety, feasibility and tolerability data on THX-110 in an OSA
      population.
