      fusion transcripts in the circulation of NSCLC patients positive for ALK on tissue analysis,
      using an institutionally accepted assay; 2) Demonstrate feasibility of detection of T790M
      EGFR mutation in the circulation of NSCLC patients positive for T790M on tissue analysis,
      using an institutionally accepted assay.
