    
      20 to 25 patients suffering from Irvine Gass Syndrom should be monitored for at least six
      months, controlled monthly. In all cases best corrected visual acuity, Spectralis-OCT (volume
      thickness scan), fundus photography (Optomap), intraocular pressure, slitlamp assessment and
      indirect ophthalmoscopy should be performed on every visit. Fluorescein angiography should be
      performed at baseline and after 3 and 6 months.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Patients older than 18 years who develop macula edema secondary to cataract surgery.

      - Consent agreement - Patients should be informed that it is possible to get an active
      medication (Ozurdex implant) as an "on label" indication from the health insurance company if
      the diagnosis is accepted as an intraocular inflammation form of "Uveitis posterior".

      Exclusion criteria:

      Visual acuity worse than 20/400, known history of glaucoma and steroid response, any macular
      disease interfering with visual acuity (DME, AMD, etc.), history of vitrectomy, use of
      systemic, periocular, or intraocular corticosteroids within 30 days.

      Outcome:

        -  BCVA

        -  Patients suffering from diabetes mellitus should be evaluated also separately.

        -  Change in central retinal thickness using optical coherence tomography (OCT)

        -  Secondary parameters (elevated IOP, retinal detachments, vitreous hemorrhage,
           endophthalmitis rates)
