    
      A randomized, open-labelled, placebo-controlled study was conducted on 200 nondiabetic,
      nonobese and elderly (â‰¥60 years) subjects. Over a twelve-week period, the test group consumed
      one bottle (120 mL) of dairy yogurt each day, whereas the placebo group consumed same volume
      of low fat milk daily. NK cell activity (%) was measured based on the ratios of effector
      cells (E; peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PBMCs) from each participant to target cells
      (T; K562 cells) at E:T= 10:1, 5:1, 2.5:1, 1.25:1 or 0.625:1. In addition, cytokines and
      immunoglobulin levels measured using commercial kits as manufacturer's instruction.
