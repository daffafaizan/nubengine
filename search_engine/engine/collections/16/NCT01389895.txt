    
      Cohort 1 will consist of 12 subjects (6 AMG 557: 6 placebo) randomized to receive AMG 557 210
      mg or matching placebo. Cohort 2 will consist of 12 subjects (6 AMG 557: 6 placebo)
      randomized to receive AMG 557 140 mg or matching placebo. Enrollment of Cohort 2 (140 mg)
      will be initiated after enrollment of Cohort 1 (210 mg) is completed. After Cohort 1 and 2
      enrollment has been completed, the emerging PK and PD data will be reviewed to determine if
      an additional 4-8 subjects with SCLE will be enrolled into the study to address equivocal
      results from the study. These 4-8 additional subjects will receive the same dose of either
      210 mg or 140 mg SC (in an allocation ratio of 1 AMG 557: 1 placebo).

      In addition, an open label extension study for participants in this study may be instituted
      following completion and analysis of results of this study. Initiation of this study will
      require that an acceptable risk-benefit profile and some evidence of efficacy are observed in
      the current study.
