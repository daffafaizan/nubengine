    
      This is a single-arm, multicentre pilot study designed to provide an indication of the
      effectiveness and safety of the Cinatraâ„¢ Corolimus Eluting Coronary Stent System. The primary
      endpoint to be evaluated in this study is late lumen loss (in-stent) at 6 months
      post-procedure as measured by QCA in the 30 participants undergoing angiography at this
      timepoint. Late lumen loss is defined as the difference between the post-index procedure
      minimal lumen diameter (MLD) and the follow-up MLD.
