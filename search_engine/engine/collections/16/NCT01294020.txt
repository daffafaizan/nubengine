    
      Part A: On Day 1 subjects will be converted from their routine Prograf®-based
      immunosuppressive regimen to a Prograf®-based immunosuppressive regimen supplied by the
      Sponsor as study medication and continue treatment until Day 7. The daily dose of the study
      medication must be the same [1:1 (mg:mg)] as the Prograf® dose received during the 30-day
      screening period.

      On Day 7 the first 24 hour PK profile will be started. Samples will be taken over a 24 hour
      period and will be completed on Day 8.

      On Day 8 subjects will be switched to once-daily Advagraf® on a 1:1 (mg:mg) total daily dose
      basis and continue treatment until Day 14.

      On Day 14 the second 24-hour PK profile will be started. Samples will be taken over a 24-hour
      period and will be completed on Day 15.

      Part B: One year follow-up period to evaluate safety and efficacy of tacrolimus when
      administered as an Advagraf®-based immunosuppressive regimen.

      Part C: Continuation of long-term follow-up (from Day 365 onwards). Patients who have
      completed Part B and to whom continued treatment with Advagraf® is not currently available,
      will be offered participation in a continuation of long-term follow-up (Part C). Part C will
      continue until Advagraf® becomes available to these patients or these patients'
      discontinuation, whichever is the earliest.

      Part C applies to patients in the following countries: United Kingdom, Czech Republic,
      Germany, Italy, and Poland only.
