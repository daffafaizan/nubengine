    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, multinational, longitudinal assessment of disease
      severity in subjects with DEB. Subjects with either dominant or recessive DEB (dominant
      dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB) and recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa
      (RDEB), respectively) will be assessed four times over a one year period: upon enrollment,
      and at 1 to 2 weeks and 6 and 12 months after enrollment. All subjects with either DDEB or
      RDEB that meet the study entry criteria will be offered participation in the study, provided
      they can be accommodated within the anticipated study timeline. In addition to their usual
      clinic assessment, subjects will have a quantitative evaluation of skin involvement and will
      be asked to fill out questionnaires that measure among other things disease severity, QOL,
      pain, pruritus, and medical and family histories.
