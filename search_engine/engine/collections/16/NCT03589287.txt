      affects cartilage. Cartilage is the smooth tissue covering the ends of bones within the
      joint. In people who suffer from knee OA, articular cartilage top is broken down and worn
      away, resulting in the underlying bones to rub against each other. This friction can cause
      pain, joint swelling and decreased range of motion (ROM). Eventually, the joint may become
      deformed and bone spurs may form around the edges. With the advances in biotechnology, cell
      therapy in the application of cartilage reconstruction has gradually matured. The purpose of
      this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of single intra-articular (IA) injection of
      allogeneic bone marrow (BM) mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for knee OA. The same cell products
      used in this trial have been applied in a phase I/IIa clinical trial in Taiwan for the
      treatment of critical limb ischemia, and so far no treatment-related adverse effect has been
      observed. In the current trial, allogeneic bone marrow MSCs of up to 4 donors will be
      isolated. BM MSCs are expanded and applied for a phase I/IIa study in treating 15-24
      recipient patients with knee OA. The treatment protocol consists of two stages: the first
      stage is a traditional 3+3 open dose-escalated study design with three cohorts of dosing
      groups: (1) 1 x 10^7 cells, (2) 5 x 10^7 cells and (3) 10 x 10^7 cells. At the second stage,
      knee OA patients will be treated by the cell products of the maximum tolerance dose (MTD) as
      determined by the results of the first stage. All the study subjects will be followed up to 6
      months (24 weeks) after the treatment for safety and preliminary efficacy evaluation, which
      the latter will include both clinical and imaging study assessments.
