    
      - EUS Examination After the surgery, the specimen is filled with 0.9%NS (normal saline )
      without cut openï¼Œand put into a container filled with 0.9%NS before fixation in formalin. EUS
      will be performed on the resected specimen.The endoscopy move from the distal to proximal
      side along the longitudinal axis of stomach, evaluate the invasion of gastric wall, and mark
      the deepest point with sutures under the EUS guided. The images were stored .

      EUS images the are reviewed by two endoscopists. They are asked to stage the tumor according
      to the AJCC(American Joint Committee on Cancer) staging system (7th edition) , assign a level
      of confidence to the staging, and score the quality of the EUS image .

        -  Histologic Preparations and Examination Carcinoma invasion into each layer of the
           gastric wall is diagnosed by an experienced pathologist (L.ZW) who is unaware of the
           findings of the EUS imaging. The marked section will be assessed separately.

        -  Data analysis The diagnosis between the pathologic findings and EUS prediction will be
           compared. Whether the marked point was the deepest in pathologic findings is recorded.
           And the histological section and the EUS image of the marked point is compared.
