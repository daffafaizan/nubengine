      lenvatinib once daily. Each four-week treatment period will be considered to be one treatment
      cycle. The selection of subsequent dose levels will be performed according to an accelerated
      design: Although initially 3 patients per dose level will be entered, the next dose level can
      be opened for patient accrual after only the first patient in the previous cohort completes
      Cycle 1 with no drug-related toxicity greater than grade 1 (except alopecia, lymphopenia and
      anemia).
