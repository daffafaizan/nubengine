    
      The IRON-HF study is an investigator initiated, multicenter, prospectively
      designed,randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled clinical trial.

      Randomization:Each of the eight participating centers will randomize patients by telephone
      contact with the randomization center at Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre. The
      randomization system will be based on a computerized table of random numbers and performed in
      blocks of three per participating center.

      Blinding:Each participating center will elect a third party blind individual (usually a RN)
      who will open the allocated medication box, prepare iron sucrose infusions or saline and
      administer to patients in opaque devices. Both patient and attending physicians and/or nurses
      will be blind to allocated therapy. Oral medications and oral placebo will be identical in
      all aspects.
