      research, the impact of different anesthetic techniques on the immune system remains unclear.

      Aim of this ex vivo / in vitro study was to determine the effects of general and neuraxial
      anesthesia on monocyte subset alteration and the release of prototypical pro- and
      anti-inflammatory cytokines. Twenty patients undergoing total knee replacement surgery were
      randomly assigned to receive either general anesthesia (ITN) or combined spinal/epidural
      anesthesia (CSE). Samples of venous blood were taken from the patients before and after
      induction of anesthesia, immediately, 6 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours after surgery. All
      blood samples were incubated in presence or absence of LPS (lipopolysaccharide; 1 µg/ml) for
      24 hours. CD14 and HLA-DR expression patterns on monocytes and intracellular TNF-alpha
      production were quantified via flow cytometry. TNF-α and IL-10 release were measured via
      enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).
