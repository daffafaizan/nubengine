      treatment of postoperative ileus. TJ-100 extract powder (Tsumura & Co., Tokyo, Japan) is
      manufactured as an aqueous extract containing 2.2 % Japanese pepper, 5.6 % processed ginger,
      3.3 % ginseng, and 88.9 % maltose syrup powder. A recent randomized, parallel-group,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-response trial demonstrated that TJ-100 accelerates
      colonic transit time, particularly in the ascending colon. Given its potential actions in the
      intestinal tract, it seems reasonable to postulate that TJ-100 may play a role in improving
      and preventing bowel dysmotility. This study was designed to investigate the effect of TJ-100
      on intestinal dysmotility and for the prevention of postoperative paralytic ileus in patients
      undergoing pancreaticoduodenectomy.

      The primary endpoint is the incidence of postoperative paralytic ileus. Secondary endpoints
      are QOL assessment by the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS) Score (Japanese
      Version) and visual analogue scale, the change in ratio of abdominal circumference, the
      incidence of postoperative complications, the length of hospital day, and the incidence of
      surgical site infection. Two hundred patients are required for the study (100 patients per
      group).
