    
      A prospective study by means of a questionnaire, specifically designed for each of the three
      groups.

        1. Adult patients whose operation date has been deferred

        2. Patients who did not have had an operation date

        3. Patients who have been operating on during the month before

      Each group will receive a twofold questionnaire:

      Part I: Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), a robust questionnaire used for
      hospitalized and non-hospitalized patients gauging the degree of anxiety and/or depression,
      irrespective of their specific medical condition. All three groups receive the same list of
      questions.

      -Part II: a questionnaire made up specifically for issues concerning the
      medical/psychological/access aspects during the COVID-19 outbreak. Each of the three groups
      will receive a questionnaire, adapted to the group they are assigned to.

      The questionnaires will be delivered by the use of Qualtrics or on paper. Timing and mode of
      presentation (Qualtrics or fill-in paper on admission) of the questionnaire will depend on
      the length of the quarantine measures.
