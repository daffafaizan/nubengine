    
      The study involves parents/caregivers of infants, â‰¥ 5 months but < 11 months of age. Parents
      who enrolled their infants complete a 1-month blinded placebo run-in period, followed by
      randomization to placebo or the food supplement.

      During the intervention period, infants randomized to the food supplement are fed a once
      daily, individual packet of the food supplement mixed into liquid (e.g., breast milk, infant
      formula) or solid (e.g., applesauce, pureed carrots) foods being fed to the infant. The food
      supplement is a blend of 16 common allergenic proteins ([oat, milk, egg, sesame, wheat]
      [almond cashew, hazelnut, peanut, pecan, pistachios, soy, walnut] [cod, shrimp, salmon])
      combined with 400 IU of Vitamin D3. Parents complete a daily diary about any reactions or
      symptoms within 2 hours of ingesting the food supplement. Infants randomized to the placebo
      are also fed a once daily individual packet of the placebo mixed into liquid or solid foods
      being fed to the infant. Parents also complete a daily diary about any reactions or symptoms
      within 2 hours of ingesting the placebo.
