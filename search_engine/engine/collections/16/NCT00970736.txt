      etiological sources of swallowing disorders, including stroke and head and neck cancer. The
      Veteran's Health Administration has recently identified dysphagia as a major clinical focus
      for the VA system (Sullivan & Dennis, 2006). In order to accurately assess adaptations in
      motor cortex, it is first necessary to have a reliable tool for measuring organizational
      representation in the motor cortex. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a desirable
      choice for such measurement because of the ability to identify causative relationships
      between an area of motor cortex stimulated and muscle response. Therefore, the specific
      research objectives of this proposal are:

        1. To demonstrate the reproducibility of TMS mapping of the submental muscle group in
           healthy older adults between 60 and 80 years of age

        2. To determine the neural representation of submental musculature in the motor cortex of
           healthy older adults between 60 and 80 years of age.

      Twenty healthy adults, 10 men and 10 women, between the ages of 60 and 80 years will serve as
      research participants. TMS will be used to establish motor maps of the submental muscles.
      Subjects will undergo two testing sessions, on day 1 and day 14. The results from each
      session will be compared to assess excitability and representation within the motor cortex,
      and to assess stability and reliability of measurement.
