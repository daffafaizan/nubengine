      treatment with G/P for acute HCV infection and then followed 24 weeks post treatment.
      Participants with HCV recurrence (reinfection, suspected relapse or undefined post-treatment
      viremia) or HCV virologic failure before or at the Step 1 Week 16/SVR12 (sustained virologic
      response 12 weeks post-treatment) visit may enter Step 2 for re-treatment. The remaining
      participants complete the study at Week 28 of Step 1. The study primary and secondary outcome
      measures pertain to Step 1.

      In Step 2, participants will be re-treated with G/P with or without ribavirin (RBV) for up to
      16 weeks, and followed for 24 weeks post treatment. Post-treatment follow-up for Step 2 will
      include visits for SVR12 determination after re-treatment.

      In Step 1, study visits are scheduled at study entry, weeks 1 and 2 (on-treatment), week 4
      (treatment discontinuation), and weeks 8, 12, 16 and 28 (post-treatment follow-up). In Step
      2, participants will have study visits during the re-treatment period, where the number of
      visits depends on the re-treatment, and visits at 12 and 24 weeks post treatment. Study
      visits may include physical examinations, clinical assessments, blood and urine collection,
      questionnaires, and HCV re-infection prevention counseling.
