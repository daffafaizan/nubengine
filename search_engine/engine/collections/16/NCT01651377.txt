      D2/3 agonist pramipexole, using the extended release preparation that has been shown to
      produce continuous DA receptor stimulation. Pramipexole is a non-ergot DA 3
      receptor-preferring agonist. In contrast to pergolide, bromocriptine and cabergoline, it does
      not stimulate 5-HT2B receptors and therefore does not cause cardiac valvulopathy. It can
      therefore be safely used chronically at higher doses, whereas pergolide has been withdrawn
      from the market for causing cardiac valvulopathy.
