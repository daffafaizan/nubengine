      a follow-up period. Participants will receive either cebranopadol or morphine PR for 44 days.
      Initially participants will be titrated after 2 and then every 4 days to a morphine PR or
      cebranopadol dose that provides adequate analgesia and is tolerated. The titration period is
      planned to last 16 days. Thereafter the dose of morphine PR or cebranopadol is to be kept
      stable for a further 28 days, i.e. no dose adjustments will be allowed during the maintenance
      period. This 28 day period is the maintenance period. The follow-up period is planned for up
      to 18 days after the end of last pain medication treatment intake.
