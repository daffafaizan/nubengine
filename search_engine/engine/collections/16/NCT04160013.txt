      discipline options. The investigators aim to mitigate adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) by
      integrating evidence-based parent training into pediatric primary care. Some of the most
      modifiable ACEs are associated with parenting behaviors that can lead to child abuse. The
      investigators define unhealthy parenting behaviors such as spanking, threatening, yelling,
      and humiliation. For adults in the original ACEs study, it was exposure to these behaviors
      that led to the categorization of child abuse/neglect and that were associated with heart
      disease, obesity, depression, smoking, drug use, violence, and many other problems. This
      study may help change policy and practice related to mitigating ACEs in primary care. To
      accomplish this goal, randomized controlled trials are needed to test brief screening tools
      and evidence-based resources. A population-based approach is needed to reach all parents
      (i.e. primary prevention). In the study, parents in the intervention group will receive 3
      minutes of education about healthy discipline strategies.
