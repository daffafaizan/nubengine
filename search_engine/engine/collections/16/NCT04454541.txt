      plane block and greater occipital nerve block in treatment of cervicogenic headache using
      ultrasound guided.

      This prospective study that was approved by Institutional Review Board (IRB), Mansoura
      Faculty of Medicine, Mansoura University, Cairo Egypt (Code Number: R/19.04.483) and all
      participants gave written informed consent. The procedures followed were in accordance with
      our protocol.

      This study included patients with cervicogenic headache disorders that diagnosed according to
      International Classification of Headache Disorder version III (ICHD-III beta version)
      criteria (18)

      Full clinical neurological examination was done for all patients. Blood samples for routine
      laboratory investigations (Complete blood count, creatinine, liver function tests, PT, APTT)
      were taken from all patients, electrocardiography (ECG) were done for all patients. Pain
      intensity was evaluated via visual analog scale (VAS) scores (0 -10). Pain intensity
      evaluation will be done at initial presentation then after 2 and 4 weeks, using the VAS scale
      for affected side of cervicogenic headache. Saturation of pulse oxygen (SpO2), all Procedures
      performed using ultrasound system with a 7 - 13 MHz multi-frequency transducer (LOGIQ P5; GE
      Healthcare).
