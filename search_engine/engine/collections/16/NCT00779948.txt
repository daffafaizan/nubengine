      plate-screw-systems. Regarding the latter, the dynamic hip screw systems (DHS)represent the
      most frequently used devices.

      Targon FN (Aesculap) is a new plate-screw system and available on the market since 2007. In
      contrast to the DHS, which uses only one telescrew, the Targon FN provides up to four
      telescrews.

      With this registry, we want to evaluate the results of Targon FN compared with DHS systems.
