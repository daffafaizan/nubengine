      skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs). These SSTIs are usually caused by a bacteria called
      Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), and can result in severe negative consequences such as
      hospitalization, disability, and even death. Despite treatment with antibiotics, 20-70% of
      children with an SSTI will develop a recurrent infection within the next year. Additionally,
      this treatment fails to eradicate S. aureus from children nearly 50% of the time. Of the
      types of S. aureus that cause these infections, antibiotic-resistant strains such as
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), which are associated with higher rates of
      transmission, have become increasingly more common. Thus, the problem of interest is the high
      rate of recurrent SSTIs in children caused by S. aureus despite the use of systemic
      antibiotic treatment, due to difficulties in decolonization and the prevalence of
      antibiotic-resistant strains such as MRSA.
