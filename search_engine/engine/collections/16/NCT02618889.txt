    
      Specific Aim 1: To investigate the effect of BoNT on PsyD severity and disability.

      We will measure the changes in severity, duration, and incapacitation scores of the Rating
      Scale for Psychogenic Movement Disorders (RSPMD)10 in adult patients with clinically definite
      PsyD one month after intramuscular injections with onabotulinumtoxinA in selected muscles of
      the affected limb(s).

      H1: PsyD patients treated with onabotulinumtoxinA injections will demonstrate lower severity
      and disability at one month than those having received placebo injections.

      Specific Aim 2: To investigate the effect of CBT on PsyD severity and disability with and
      without BoNT pretreatment.

      We will examine the extent to which any changes in severity and disability of PsyD, as
      measured by the RSPMD, after 12 weekly CBT sessions, can be influenced by pre-CBT injections
      with onabotulinumtoxinA.
