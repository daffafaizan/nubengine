    
      Specific Aim 1 To identify a patient population seen in the University of California, San
      Diego general internal medicine and cardiology subspecialty clinics as well as referrals from
      community physicians who are hyporesponsive to statin therapy (defined as an initial LDL
      reduction of <25% in response to 10mg of atorvastatin or 20mg of simvastatin- expected mean
      reduction is 35% -37% for starting dose simvastatin and atorvastatin).

      Specific Aim 2 To test the hypothesis, with a prospective study, that a hyporesponse to
      statin therapy may be related to increased cholesterol absorption, and that this hyporesponse
      may be overcome by the addition of ezetimibe, a specific cholesterol absorption inhibitor.

      Specific Aim 3 To evaluate whether patients with less than 25% LDL reduction on 10 mg of
      atorvastatin (or 20 mg of simvastatin) would achieve significantly greater LDL reduction with
      combination therapy (atorvastatin/ezetimibe) than with statin dose titration (using
      atorvastatin).
