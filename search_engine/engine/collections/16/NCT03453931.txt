      variability and the modification of the microalbuminuria level after intravenous infusion of
      corticosteroids. The investigator shall not initiate the treatment. Patients will receive
      high-dose intravenous corticosteroids for the treatment of different diseases. The
      departments, where the patients are enrolled, are: nephrology, neurology, dermatology and
      rheumatology and the day hospital. The day before the corticosteroids administration, a
      holter monitor will be started for at least 24h to detect arrhythmias and heart rate
      variations. By mean of a Finometer, beat-to-beat blood pressure, cardiac output and
      baroreflex sensitivity will be measured before, during and after the infusion. Blood and
      urine samples will be used to explore the effects of corticosteroids on microalbuminuria,
      electrolytes, CRP and glomerular filtration rate during the 3 days of observation.

      To our knowledge, it will be the first prospective trial to explore a link between
      intravenous corticosteroids administration and heart rate variability, Baroreflex
      Sensitivity, as well as microalbuminuria.
