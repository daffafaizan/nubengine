    
      Study aims of this phase are:

        -  Assessing the use and attitudes toward PROMs by clinicians in a comprehensive cancer
           centre.

        -  Reviewing and compare pre-existing ePROMS assessment systems.

        -  Developing and pilot testing a flexible system for electronic collection of PROMs.

        -  Assessing feasibility of ePROM assessment of physical symptoms, psychological distress
           and patient satisfaction.

        -  Identifying barriers to and developing strategies for the final implementation and
           integration of routine ePROMs into the clinical practice.

      The project will last 2 years. Longitudinal and cross-sectional studies will be carried out
      with the aim to evaluate compliance, acceptability, and usability of a routine ePROM
      assessment system by both patients and clinicians. Participants will be enrolled among
      patients attending 3 out-patient clinics (physical symptom), 3 inpatient wards (psychological
      distress) and 5 multidisciplinary teams (patient satisfaction). The Edmonton symptom
      assessment scale, the Distress Thermometer, and a questionnaire adapted from the Bench-Can
      and EURACAN projects plus the institutional customer satisfaction survey, will be used in the
      three studies. Qualitative methods will be used identify patient and clinician related
      barriers to ePROM assessment and to pinpoint engagement strategies to promote its use in
      routine cancer care. Semi-structured interviews and focus groups will be carried out.

      Quantitative and qualitative studies will respectively enroll 600 and 40 participants.
