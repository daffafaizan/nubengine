      profoundly impact course of illness. Acupuncture is a widely recognized therapy to treat
      depressive disorders and sleep disturbances in clinical practice. This multicenter randomized
      placebo-controlled trial is aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of
      electroacupuncture, sham acupuncture and standard medical care, administrated by professional
      acupuncturists and psychiatrists, in depression patients with insomnia.

      The investigators describe a protocol for a multicenter randomized controlled trial. Two
      hundred seventy eligible patients in 3 different health-care centers in Shanghai will be
      randomly assigned to one of 3 treatment groups: EA group (electroacupuncture+standard medical
      care), Control A group (sham acupuncture+standard medical care) and Control B group (standard
      medical care). Treatment will be given 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes is
      the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The secondary outcomes are sleep parameters
      recorded in the Actigraphy, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) score and Self-rating
      Anxiety Scale (SAS) score. Daily dose of patients' antidepressant and sedative-hypnotic
      medication will be recorded in the dairy. All adverse effects will be assessed by the
      Treatment Emergent Symptom Scale (TESS). Outcomes will be evaluated at baseline, 4 weeks
      post-treatment and 8 weeks post-treatment, as well as at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months
      follow-up.

      The findings from this trial will help further about the efficacy and safety of acupuncture
      for depression related insomnia, as well as determine the differences between
      electroacupuncture, sham acupuncture and standard medical care for treating insomnia and
      depression.
