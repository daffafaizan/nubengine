      no studies have detailed the in-vivo completeness of CordimaxTM stent coverage at different
      time points. The objective of this prospective study is to measure the completeness of strut
      coverage and vessel wall response (neointima disomogeneity, acquired late incomplete strut
      apposition) at different time points following CordimaxTM stent implantation, in patients
      with non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome . Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) that
      detects smaller degrees of stent strut coverage more accurately than IVUS will be used at
      different time points (3-6-12 Months)
