      (circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D) with MACCE (major cardiac or
      cerebrovascular event) in cardiac surgical patients. The occurrence of several postoperative
      adverse events such as myocardial infarction, low cardiac output syndrome, stroke and
      in-hospital death will be assessed from cardiac surgery to discharge. Approximately 4,000
      data sets from mid of 2012 until the end of 2013 will be analyzed. In all patients, we will
      also assess the association of vitamin D metabolite levels with the duration of mechanical
      ventilatory support and intensive care unit stay from cardiac surgery to discharge. Moreover,
      in-hospital stay will be assessed according to vitamin D status
