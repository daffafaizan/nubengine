      plays important roles for detection and staging for PCa, in addition to blood or urine
      biomarkers. Although there are a number of very different diagnostic imaging methods, e.g.
      transrectal ultrasound (TRUS), computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and
      spectroscopy, or 18F-FDG positron emission tomography (PET), none of these have gained a
      dominant role as the optimum method for all clinical scenarios.The recently added
      armamentarium, PET/MR, might improve diagnosis in this regard.

      Therefore, we conduct this trial to identify the ability of [11C]Choline PET/MR to evaluate
      the patients with prostate cancer, especially under the circumstance of elevated PSA level.
