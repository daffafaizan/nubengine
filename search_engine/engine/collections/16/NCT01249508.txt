      changing environment encouraging high energy intakes and a sedentary lifestyle. Examples of
      important environmental factors are the changing nature of the food supply, the changing
      socio-demographic structure of the population, the lack of nutrition information and the
      increasing reliance on foods consumed away from home. This evolution has driven the
      development of measures to encourage more healthy eating patterns. Nutrition labelling is one
      of those measures. Since adults and students spend approximately half their waking hours at
      the workplace or university, the work or study environment is believed to be an appropriate
      setting to assess and try to change individuals' dietary behaviour. This study aims to
      evaluate a nutrition labelling program in improving university canteen customers' dietary
      pattern and behavioural determinants (e.g. knowledge).
