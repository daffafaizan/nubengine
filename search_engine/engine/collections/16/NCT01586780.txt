      cardiovascular diseases, and it has been suggested that reduction of postprandial glycaemia
      is just as important as lowering fasting blood glucose levels to reach optimal metabolic
      control and reduce risk of complications in T2D. Observational studies indicate that milk
      consumption reduces the risk of developing T2D, obesity and cardiovascular disease, and a
      possible protective mechanism has been ascribed to the protein fraction. It has previously
      been demonstrated that addition of whey proteins, co-ingested with carbohydrates, stimulates
      insulin secretion and reduces postprandial glycaemia in both healthy subjects as well as in
      T2D patients. The effect is mediated through the insulinogenic properties of whey that
      appears to stem from a generation of a particular amino acid (AA) pattern in postprandial
      blood after ingestion of whey proteins. In the presently described project it is hypothesized
      that exchanging part of the whey protein for insulinogenic AA might be useful to optimize an
      insulinogenic effect. Additionally, soy protein has been suggested to have beneficial effects
      on insulin resistance and obesity as well on satiety. The possible effect of soy protein on
      insulin response and glycaemic regulation is therefore also of interest.

      A randomized, single blind, within-subject trial was performed. The test meals were provided
      as breakfasts on 7 different occasions in random order with approximately 1 week between each
      test. The test subjects were instructed to drink the protein drink immediately prior to
      eating the standardized sandwich meal. Altogether, the protein drink and the sandwich meal
      were to be consumed within 12 min.
