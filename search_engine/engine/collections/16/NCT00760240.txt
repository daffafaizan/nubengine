    
      This is a study that involves a questionnaire that a study participant fills out, detailing
      their experience with eyedrops (if any), followed by a video recording of them instilling
      artificial tears into their worse-seeing eye, with their dominant hand. Patients must have
      visual acuity worse than 20/60 in at least one eye, and/or have a recent visual field that
      demonstrated Hodapp criteria for Moderate or Severe visual field damage. This is an
      observational study of how patients with low vision due to either glaucoma or retinal disease
      instill eyedrops. Each video will be "graded" by the principal investigator for "success" at
      instilling eyedrops, and patients will be stratified by their visual acuity or visual field,
      and whether they have a primary diagnosis of glaucoma or retinal disease.
