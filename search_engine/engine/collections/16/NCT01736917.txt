    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

      Treatment Regimen:

      Patients must have no nausea and/or vomiting for 24 hours and must not have used other
      anti-emetics for 72 hours prior to starting protocol treatment. Treatment must not start
      until this criteria is satisfied.

      Any germ cell chemotherapy regimen utilizing cisplatin (20mg/m^2 x 5 days). This will usually
      be combined with bleomycin (BEP), etoposide (EP), ifosfamide (VIP), vinblastine (VeIP),
      paclitaxel (TIP) or epirubicin. All of these regimens get the identical cisplatin, which is
      the only highly emetic drug in any of the chemo regimens.

      Acute emesis prophylaxis (administered per institutional standards prior to chemotherapy):

        -  Any 5HT3 receptor antagonist may be used days 1 through 5 or days 1, 3 and 5 if
           palonosetron is used per institutional standards.

        -  Dexamethasone 20mg PO (orally) daily, days 1 and 2

        -  Fosaprepitant 150mg IV on day 3

      Delayed emesis prophylaxis:

        -  Fosaprepitant 150mg IV on day 5

        -  Dexamethasone 4mg PO BID (twice a day) on days 6, 7 and 8

      PRN (as needed) antiemetics allowed at the discretion of the treating investigator

        -  No additional doses of 5HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, or fosaprepitant will be
           given during the acute or delayed treatment periods

        -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 K/mm3

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) > 10 g/dL

        -  Platelets > 100 K/mm3
