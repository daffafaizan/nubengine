        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibody HuHMFG1 in women with
           locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer previously treated with anthracycline and
           taxane-based therapy.

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and appropriate schedule of this drug in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the tumor response rate, progression-free survival, and median survival of
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Analyze immunological markers for evaluation of disease status (e.g., in vitro analysis
           of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity, natural killer cell activity, complement
           depletion, and tumor markers CA 15.3 and CEA) in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, open-label, nonrandomized, multicenter study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive monoclonal antibody HuHMFG1 IV over 1-3 hours once every 3
           weeks for doses 1 and 2. All subsequent dose intervals are based on individual half-life
           value of the drug. Patients receive at least 6 doses in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody HuHMFG1 until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

        -  Phase II:Patients receive monoclonal antibody HuHMFG1 as above at the MTD. Patients are
           followed at 28 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-40 patients (3-15 patients for phase I and 19-25 patients
      for phase II) will be accrued for this study within approximately 12 months.
