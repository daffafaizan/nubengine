      in a 4-week daily diary, as a primary outcome, and reduction in associated personal distress.

      There is also evidence that testosterone therapy results in a similar improvement in sexual
      function in premenopausal women with loss of libido.

      Testosterone therapy has been associated with significantly improved well-being in studies in
      which the participants had low well-being at enrollment.

      Trials of testosterone for HSDD in women have excluded those with clinical depression, as
      well as those taking antidepressants.

      Whether testosterone will benefit women with HSDD who are taking an antidepressant is not
      known.

      The primary aim of this study was to examine the effects of transdermal testosterone therapy
      with a nanoemulsion BIOLIPID B2 on sexual function in women at midlife, who were experiencing
      treatment-emergent low libido. The primary study outcome was the change in the total score of
      the Sabbatsberg Sexual Self-rating Scale (SSS).

      In line with previous studies of women without depression, efficacy was measured by the
      change in the frequency of SSEs over 4 weeks, as well as the domains of the SSS, general
      well-being, depression, and mood status.

      In this present study these factors will be analized in 12 weeks interval
