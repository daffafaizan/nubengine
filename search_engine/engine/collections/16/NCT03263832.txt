      A. Investigate the role of antibiogram-antibiofilmogramme concordance (in terms of S. aureus
      strains and prescribed antibiotics) in orthopaedic device-related infection management.

      B. Investigate the capacity of S. aureus isolates to form biofilm in presence/absence of
      antibiotics.

      C. Create an S. aureus strain collection for future ancillary studies
