      and dilated cardiomyopathy, which can evolve to heart failure, causing great morbidity and
      reduction on patient's quality of life. Some patients stay asymptomatic while others develop
      the cardiac form of the disease (chronic chagasic cardiomyopathy), or other forms, like the
      digestive (megacolon and megaesophagus) and the mixed form (cardiac and digestive).

      The objective of this study is to analyze the association between single nucleotide
      polymorphisms with the clinical forms and the amount of cardiac fibrosis in patients with
      Chagas disease.

      The polymorphisms will be analyzed by real time PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction). The genes
      whose polymorphisms will be analyzed are: galectin-3, SOCS-3, IL-28B, CLDN-1 and CCL5.

      The patients shall be accompanied in the specialized outpatient clinics for Chagas disease -
      Center of Biotechnology and Cell Therapy. They will be submitted to collection of blood
      samples for biochemical analysis and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging.
