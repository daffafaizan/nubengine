      collected from individuals with Tedlar® bags (Keika Ventures, LLC) after endoscopy.. Two
      breath samples were collected from each person tested.

      Two-bed sorption tubes filled with the following sorbents were used as traps for sample
      collection with simultaneous preconcentration: 100mg matrix Tenax TA and 50mg matrix Tenax TA
      (35-60 mesh; purchased from Supelo, Bellefonte, PA). Sorbents were separated by glass wool.
      The samples were collected at a total flow through sorption trap of 200ml/min.

      One sample was used for analysis with the nanosensors array, and the other sample was used
      for Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis.

      Cancer tissue and paracancerous tissue samples were collected in the process of surgical
      resection. After collection in the operating room, the samples were immediately placed in - 5
      ℃ dry ice and transferred to the laboratory. Then, the samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen
      for 30 minutes, and then placed in - 80℃ freezer for cold storage. After that, the samples
      were divided into several batches and transported in dry ice for subsequent transcriptome
      analysis. All the saliva samples were collected using 2ml cryopreservation tube during early
      morning before surgery or endoscopic resection. The patient had been told not to eat after 22
      o'clock the night, and not to drink water, smoke, brush teeth or exercise violently one hour
      before the collection. The saliva samples were sealed in the -80 C refrigerator after
      collection and then transported in a foam box equipped with dry ice, followed by UHPLC-MS
      analysis.
