    
      The primary objective of the trial is to test the new radio tracer 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2
      for PET imaging of angiogenesis. The tracer has the potential of identifying tumors with a
      high level of angiogenesis, which is one of the cancer hallmarks. Furthermore, the tracer can
      potentially be used in early response assessment to anti-angiogenic treatment.

      This is a first-in-man study to test the radio tracer in cancer patients. Safety,
      biodistribution and dosimetry will be evaluated by repeated PET imaging (10 minutes, 1 hour
      and 2 hours post injection).

      The primary end points are safety, biodistribution and dosimetry of 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2.
      In addition, the quantitative uptake of 68Ga-NODAGA-E[c(RGDyK)]2 will be compared to the
      expression of integrin αvβ3 measured directly in tumor tissue obtained by surgery or
      biopsies. The study will be monitored and evaluated in accordance with the principles of Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP).
