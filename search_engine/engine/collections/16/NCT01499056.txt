      injection of cultured autologous BM-MSCs in patients with severe hip osteoarthritis candidate
      for total hip replacement. All subjects will undergo bone marrow aspiration. Autologous MSCs
      will be extracted and cultured for 4 weeks. Patients will receive intra-articular injection
      of cultured MSCs under the guide of fluoroscopy. Paraclinical studies (X-Ray and MRI) will be
      done before and 6 months after treatment. Pain relief and functional improvement of the joint
      will be assessed by VAS, WOMAC, and Harris Hip Score questionnaire before treatment, and 2
