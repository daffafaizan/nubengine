      part of Grape Seed Extract (GSE). Researchers are in looking at the combination of GSE and
      vitamin D in subjects with solid cancers (gastrointestinal, lung, breast, prostate, lymphoma
      or cancer of the lymph nodes). Researchers will examine the safety of the GSE and vitamin D
      when GSE is given at different doses. Researchers will also look at the effects of GSE and
      vitamin D on your quality of life and your body. In particular, they will look at differences
      in biomarkers in your blood and urine.
