      response of patients with anaplastic astrocytoma or anaplastic oligoastrocytoma in first
      relapse treated with intravenous leflunomide (SU101). II. Assess the safety of SU101 in these
      patients. III. Describe the health-related quality of life of patients treated with
      intravenous SU101.

      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive leflunomide (SU101) IV
      over 6 hours on days 1-4. Patients then receive SU101 IV over 6 hours weekly for 6 weeks
      (beginning between days 8-12). Patients exhibiting complete response, partial response, or
      stable disease may continue on treatment for up to a year or until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity occurs. Patients continuing therapy receive SU101 IV over 6 hours every
      week for 7 weeks, followed by 1 week of rest. Quality of life is assessed every 8 weeks and
      at the end of the study. Patients are followed every 8 weeks or until tumor progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
