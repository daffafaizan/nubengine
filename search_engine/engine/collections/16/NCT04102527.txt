    
      Patients included in this trial will be monitored as part of the usual management of their
      pathology, a Terminal Chronic Kidney Disease treated by the Peritoneal Dialysis technique.

      During this treatment, patients will be follow every 2 months in consultation in the
      Metabolic Diseases Department of the Hospital of Vichy.

      These consultations include:

        -  Pre-selection consultation/Inclusion (visit to J0 -3 months)

        -  Half-yearly review (visit J0, visit at 12 months and visit at 24 months)

        -  Simple consultation (visits to 2, 4, 8, 10, 14, 16, 20, 22 months)

        -  Annual review (visits at 6 and 18 months)

      In this prospective trial, there is no intervention on the patient; They will only have to
      complete questionnaires on their intestinal transit (Charlson Scale, Katz Scale, Neurological
      Functional Score, Intestinal Function Index, Severity Score for constipation, Bristol Scale,
      Constipation Assessment Scale, Constipation Risk Assessment Scale). No minimal risk and
      constraint is identified, excluding our trial from the category of interventional research.
      The category 3 (non-interventional trial) of the jard√© classification is therefore accepted.
