    
      This study is a double blind-placebo controlled study in which subjects will be exposed to
      propranolol infusion during one study day, the opioid alfentanil on another day, and placebo
      infusion during a third study day. The infusion order will be randomized, and the participant
      and individual conducting the pain testing will both be blinded to the treatment.

      Propranolol, alfentanil, and placebo infusions will be administered intravenously using a
      computer-controlled infusion pump that can be set to accurately administer a target plasma
      concentration of drug.

      On one study day subjects will receive propranolol at a target concentration of 30ng/ml over
      3 hours time. On another study day subjects will receive 100ng/ml alfentanil over 3 hours,
      and on a third study day subjects will receive placebo (normal saline) using a
      computer-controlled infusion paradigm.

      Sites to be evaluated for response to propranolol and placebo will be established in 2 ways.
      One will use ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure to create a "sunburn" causing inflammation and
      pain. The other will be a model of acute injury using an array of micro-needles.

      Means of evaluation of injured, and non-injured sites will be pain testing (heat and
      mechanical pain thresholds will be established), interstitial fluid sampling for detection of
      pro-inflammatory, and pro-nociceptive cytokines, and laser doppler evaluation of tissue
      perfusion.

      Subjects will be recruited using flyers. Interested participants will contact the study team,
      their questions will be answered, and an appointment for screening will be made.
