      deficits decrease mobility which again leads to further cognitive decline. In a field study,
      we developed a pattern recognition model of disorientated behaviour based on accelerometric
      data. However, it is questionable if phases of disorientation also affect gait parameters.
      Furthermore, there is growing evidence that impaired cognitive functioning is associated with
      changes in gait performance, e.g. gait variability, measured in dual-task walking conditions.
      Increases in heart rate and skin conductance have also been reported during instances of
      disorientation.

      Hence, We implemented a 3D environment of a familiar city centre in the GRAIL, which combines
      a fully instrumented treadmill with a synchronized VR environment. We record gait parameters
      through the motion capture system, and accelerometric and physiological data using wearable
      sensors (movisens), for comparability with the SiNDeM field study. Young and old healthy
      adults will participate in the first phase of the study, while Mild dementia or MCI patients
      will participate in the later phases. Phases of disorientation will be induced by changing
      the virtual environment.We aim to assess gait, accelerometric and physiological parameters
      during instances of disorientation, using the GRAIL (Gait Real-Time Analysis Interactive Lab,
      Motekforce Link).

      The results will further enable the automatic detection of disorientation based on gait
      parameters, physiological and accelerometric data. This is necessary for the development of a
      situation-aware assistive system which supports persons with dementia in autonomous outdoor
      mobility.
