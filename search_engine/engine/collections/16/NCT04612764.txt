      early diagnosis and improved treatments, the survival of individuals with UCDs has improved,
      and this improved survival has led to unmasking of some long-term complications such as
      hepatic dysfunction and progressive fibrosis in a subset of patients. Hepatic complications
      in UCDs are quite variable and dependent upon the specific metabolic defect.

      Currently, there are no guidelines for monitoring hepatic complications or extent of liver
      disease in UCDs. The gold standard for staging of fibrosis or confirming cirrhosis has
      traditionally been liver biopsy, an invasive procedure with inherent risks, particularly in
      the setting of a UCD and compromised coagulation. Recently, non-invasive serum and
      imaging-based biomarkers have been introduced to assess hepatic fibrosis in adults and
      children who are at increased risk. Utilization of these technique in individuals with UCDs
      could be invaluable in both the research and clinical arenas.

      The purpose of this study is:

      1) To assess risk for increased fibrosis using serum biomarkers and/or VCTE in distal
      disorders (ASS1D, ASLD and ARG1D) as compared to OTCD 2 ) To assess risk for hepatic fibrosis
      (liver stiffness as measured by MRE) in individuals with UCDs who have abnormal serum
      biomarkers and/or VCTE as those who have normal values
