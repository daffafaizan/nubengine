      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) compared to balloon angioplasty alone. Nevertheless,
      restenosis is still encountered in 20 to 40% of coronary lesions after implantation of bare
      metal stents, inferring frequent repeat revascularization procedures with a negative impact
      on quality of life and health care expenditures. Drug-eluting stents (DES), with their
      controlled release of therapeutic agents, have significantly reduced the rate of major
      adverse cardiac events (MACE) following coronary stent implantation, primarily by a reduction
      in restenosis and target lesion revascularization.

      Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an optical analogue of intravascular ultrasound (IVUS):
      it uses an infrared light source (wavelength 1310nm) and measures the backscatter of light in
      a technique similar to conventional ultrasound. With this technique a resolution up to 10Î¼m
      in-vivo has been reported, a far better level of resolution compared with IVUS. Optical
      coherence tomography has been used in vivo and has detected early atherosclerotic plaques
      previously not visualised by IVUS. Segments with strut malapposition and the presence or
      thickness of neointimal hyperplasia can also be more accurately assessed with OCT compared
      with IVUS.

      The present study will utilize the imaging capabilities of OCT to assess stent strut
      malapposition and tissue coverage in two different types of DES. The biolimus-eluting stent
      eludes biolimus from a biodegradable polylactic acid polymer on the abluminal surface of a
      stainless steel stent. This stent will be compared in a randomized fashion to the permanent
      polymer based everolimus-eluting coronary stent made of cobalt chromium alloy.
