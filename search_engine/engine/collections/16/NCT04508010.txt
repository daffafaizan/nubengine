      of two arms : 1) IVR or 2) CATI. Participants in the first study arm will receive an IVR
      survey. Participants in the second study arm will receive a CATI survey. Each questionnaire
      contains a set of demographic questions and one non-communicable disease (NCD) module
      (alcohol, or tobacco, or diet, or physical activity, or blood pressure and diabetes). We will
      examine contact, response, refusal and cooperation rates and demographic representativeness
      by each study arm.
