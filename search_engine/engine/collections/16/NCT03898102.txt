      regorafenib treatment safety and efficacy in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer
      (mCRC). The difference in grade 2 or worse hand-foot skin reaction (HFSR) incidence within
      the first 8 weeks of regorafenib treatment between two arms will be examined as the primary
      objective.
