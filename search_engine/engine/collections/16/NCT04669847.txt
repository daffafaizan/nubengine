      extremity, and pulmonary function in children with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.

      26 children with DMD aged 5-16 were included in the study. They were divided into two groups
      (study and control). The study group (N=13) exercised with the trunk-oriented exercise
      program and the conventional exercise program under the supervision of a physiotherapist,
      whereas the control group (N=13) underwent the conventional exercise program under the
      supervision of their families at home for 8 weeks. The conventional program exercises were
      taught to patients and their families in the study and control groups. These exercises were
      performed daily for 8 weeks, twice a day, on average 45 minutes, each exercise 5-10
      repetitions. The conventional exercises program formed stretching exercises, and active or
      active-assisted strength exercises (upper extremity, lower extremity, abdominal muscles, back
      muscles), and the Trunk-oriented exercises were specially adapted to the patient based on the
      patient's functional status and active participation in the exercises. Trunk control was
      assessed using the Trunk Control Measurement Scale, the upper extremity function was assessed
      using Performance of Upper Limb and respiratory function using the pulmonary function test
      before and after the 8-week exercise program in this study.
