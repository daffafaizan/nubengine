    
      Patients under age 22 years at Children's Hospital of New York (CHONY) who are referred for
      ambulatory ECG monitoring will be consented and enrolled prospectively to have the Holter
      monitor and the Zio patch placed simultaneously in the pediatric cardiology clinic. Patients
      will be instructed to wear both devices for 48 hours. Demographic data will be collected,
      including date of birth, age, gender, weight, height, chest circumference, body surface area,
      indication for ambulatory ECG monitoring, prior congenital heart disease, prior cardiac
      surgery, and prior Holter or Zio patch use. A patient satisfaction survey will be given to
      the patient and parent/guardian after completion of the study to compare the comfort,
      interference with daily activities, adverse events (such as skin irritation or if either
      device fell off), and preference for each device. Holter monitors will be returned to the
      clinic along with the patient satisfaction survey, and the Zio patch will be mailed back to
      manufacturer headquarters and the report will be returned to the investigators.
