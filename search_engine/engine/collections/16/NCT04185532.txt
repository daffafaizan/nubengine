      which pushes the tibia anteriorly, and the result of the treatment is often successful with
      healing of the ligament. Similarly, in anterior cruciate ligament injuries, it is suggested
      that a rebound ACL brace which pushes the tibia posteriorly can facilitate healing of the
      ACL. It does not have as successful treatment results as the PCL brace, but the type and
      location of the ACL injury has in previous studies not been well defined. We will, after
      having described the localisation and type of ACL injury treat the intervention group with
      the rebound ACL brace and a standardized rehab program and the control group with
      standardized rehab program alone.

      The randomization is made blockwise of 4, to treatment A= Brace+physiotherapy or
      B=Physioterapy. The groups are stratified for gender and age (<=14 years and >14 years)
