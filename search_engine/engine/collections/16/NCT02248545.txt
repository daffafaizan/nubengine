      barley, and rye) that primarily affects the small intestine in genetically predisposed
      patients and resolves with exclusion of gluten from the diet. Although CD is not surely
      placed among the autoimmune diseases, patients with CD show circulating autoantibodies
      (anti-transglutaminase, anti-tTG) and suffer from the destruction of a specific tissue cell
      type (the enterocytes) by CD8+ T cells. Furthermore, other autoimmune diseases have been
      reported in association to CD in 20-30% of the cases. In the last few year, a new clinical
      entity emerged, which seems include patients who consider themselves to be suffering from
      problems caused by wheat and/or gluten ingestion, even though they do not have CD or wheat
      allergy. This clinical condition has been named "Non-Celiac Gluten Sensitivity" (6), but, in
      a recent paper, the investigators suggested the term "Non-Celiac Wheat Sensitivity" (NCWS),
      since, to date, it is not known what component of wheat really causes the symptoms. The doubt
      areas about the NCWS regard also its pathogenesis as, despite some papers evidenced an
      intestinal immunologic activation, others linked NCWS to the dietary FODMAPs (Fermentable
      Oligo-di and Mono-saccharides, And Polyols) load, thus excluding an immunologic involvement
      in the NCWS. To explore the presence of autoimmunity in NCWS, in the present study the
      investigators evaluated: a) the frequency of autoimmune diseases and b) the frequency of
      serum anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) positivity in newly diagnosed NCWS and CD patients.
