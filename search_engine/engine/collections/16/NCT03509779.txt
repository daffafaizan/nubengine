      complexity. Molecular subtypes may be identified through large-scale molecular screenings or
      gene expression analyses and molecular signatures are recognized as a relevant source of
      disease stratification.

      The investigators will focus on NSCLC patients with localized diseases included in the
      ONCOHEGP tissue collection project (OncoHEGP, Ministere de la Recherche n° DC 2009-950). The
      investigators had previously shown that in EGFR mutated cancer, reactivation of TWIST1 was
      reversibly linked to EMT and to survival. To go further, the investigators plane to
      investigate EMT in a large cohort of patients with lung cancer to identify prognostic and
      predictive markers of long term survival.

      The investigators will integrate mutation, and copy number alterations to EMT gene expression
      analyses and to EMT related miR quantification. Tumor phenotype, miR signatures, mutation
      status will help classify patients according to survival.

      Clinical data will be assessed thanks to the epithor database. Epithor is a
      government-recognized clinical database, accredited by the French Health Authorities (Haute
      Autorité de Santé) and is supported by the National Cancer Institute (Institut National du
      Cancer).

      EMT characterization and scoring will be done using 10 markers by qPCR, mutation and CNV
      screenings by targeted NGS analysis, miRs signature by MIRSeq and qPCR.
