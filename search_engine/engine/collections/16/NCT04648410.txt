      infection are recommended by several guidelines. In the very beginning of SARS-Co-2 pandemic
      the early recommendation by professional organization was against routine use of
      corticosteroids for patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ARDS, despite previous
      data and clinical practice for patients with refractory or severe form of ARDS. But at the
      latest after publication of RECOVERY trial (Randomized Evaluation of Covid-19 Therapy, July
      2020) and ensued metaanalysis of World Health Organization (WHO) working group, the routine
      administration of systemic corticosteroids was revisited. However, there are ongoing critical
      debate of the evidence regarding the dose, administration, timing and type of corticosteroids
      and ongoing randomized controlled trial (RCT) are challenging the recommendation of 6 mg of
      dexamethasone for all patients with severe form of COVID-19. The dynamic of COVID-19 surges,
      flip-flop of official recommendations within very short period of time and ongoing critical
      debate could be with possible variations of daily clinical practice regarding using systemic
      corticosteroids. In an electronic evaluation form that will be send to European Society of
      Intensive Care (ESICM) Members. The electronic survey will contain 10 question. In the
      questionnaire the participants will have to describe their routine clinical practice
      regarding administration of systemic corticosteroids among patients with COVID-19 ARDS.
