      University Hospital, Daegu, Republic of Korea. 90 patients were enrolled in this study and
      written informed consent was obtained from all patients. We included patients with ASA
      physical status classification I or II, and aged 18-65 years scheduled for elective
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy.

      Patients were assigned to one of three groups by computer-generated randomization, fentanyl
      group (group F, N=30), oxydodone group (group O, N=30), or control group (group C, N=30). 10
      minutes before completion of surgery, patients received 2 mL mixture of fentanyl 1 „éç/kg or
      oxycodone 0.08 mg/kg with isotonic saline or isotonic saline 2 mL intravenously in accordance
      with allocated study groups by an anesthesiologist who was blinded to group treatment.

      Airway reflex responses including coughing, breath holding, bucking, and laryngospasm were
      recorded at point of awareness, extubation, and 3 min after tracheal extubation. Hemodynamic
      responses were recorded at the completion of surgery (T1), at the point of awareness (T2), at
      the point of extubation (T3), and 3 min after tracheal extubation (T4). Coughing severity was
      assessed using a 5-point scale. In the recovery room, hemodynamic responses were evaluated
      every 5 min for 30 min. The postoperative pain intensity was assessed 5 and 30 min in the
      postanesthetic care unit (PACU) using numerical rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 (no pain)
      to 10 (worst possible pain).
