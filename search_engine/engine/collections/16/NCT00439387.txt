    
      Objective: To study serotonergic transmission in epilepsy and its relation to cerebral
      glucose metabolism, mesial temporal sclerosis, and depression.

      Study population: Patients with localization-related epilepsy with and without depression,
      and generalized epilepsy, and normal controls, ages 18-60.

      Design: This is a neuroimaging study using positron emission tomography with a 5HT(1A)
      receptor ligand, 18F-FCWAY, a serotonin transporter ligand, 11C-DASB, and 15O-H2O for
      cerebral blood flow estimation. Patients will have measurements of cerebral glucose
      metabolism using 18F-FDG as well. Magnetic resonance imaging will be performed for
      examination of hippocampal structure and partial volume correction. Screening for depression
      will be performed by NIMH investigators. We will measure cortisol and ACTH levels, which may
      affect hippocampal structure and function. Testing for genetic markers that may predict
      serotonin transporter activity and depression will be performed.

      Outcome measures: 5HT(1A) receptor binding, serotonin transporter activity, cerebral blood
      flow, and, in patients, glucose metabolism and hippocampal structure. Patients will be
      stratified by seizure type and depression ratings.
