      temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). Symptoms are evaluated with RDC/TMD forms. Regarding the
      treatment plan, patients are divided into two groups; 2 mm-thick splint group (2 mm-TSG) and
      4 mm-thick splint group (4 mm-TSG). They used SS's at night for 8 hours, and they were
      recalled on 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 6th months after splint insertion. Their symptoms and splints
      are checked.
