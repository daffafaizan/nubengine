      with interferon-alfa 2a/2b in patients with HIV-1. The mechanism of action of RBV has led to
      in vitro studies examining the agonism/antagonism in efficacy occurring when used in
      combination with nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs). The primary objective
      of the pharmacology component of this current study will be the evaluation of the effect of
      RBV on the intracellular activation of ZDV or d4T owing to the reported antagonism observed
      in vitro.

      Pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluations for plasma ZDV or d4T and intracellular ZDV or d4T and
      measurements of their triphosphate anabolites are performed before initial RBV dosing (within
      2 weeks of visit) and 8 weeks after RBV administration. Thymidine triphosphate (TTP)
      concentrations also are quantitated to permit estimation of the ratio of active drug to
      endogenous triphosphate concentrations.

      For entry, prior to RBV dosing, blood samples are collected within 2 hours prior to the ZDV
      or d4T dose and then at Hours 1, 4, and 8 post dosing. Following the entry PK blood draws,
      patients initiate RBV treatment within 2 weeks of the first PK study day.

      For the Week 8 evaluation (measured as 8 weeks following initiation of RBV), blood samples
      are collected prior to the ZDV or d4T dose and then at Hours 1, 4, and 8 post dosing.
