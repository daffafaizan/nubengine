      I. To compare the invasive disease-free survival (IDFS) of patients with inflammatory breast
      cancer receiving concurrent administration of olaparib with standard doses of radiotherapy to
      the chest wall and regional lymph nodes compared to standard doses of radiotherapy alone to
      the chest wall and regional lymph nodes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To compare the effect of concurrent administration of olaparib with radiotherapy versus
      radiotherapy alone on improvement in locoregional control (measured by locoregional
      recurrence-free interval), distant relapse-free survival, and overall survival in
      inflammatory breast cancer patients.

      ADDITIONAL OBJECTIVE:

      I. To collect tissue and whole blood for processing and banking in anticipation of future
      correlative studies in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 groups.

      GROUP I: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) the day before standard
      radiation therapy (RT) commences (Day 0) and throughout the RT course until the last day of
      RT administration. Olaparib is also continued on weekends (routine days without RT)
      throughout the RT course. Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients undergo standard radiation therapy 5 days per week for 6 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 5 weeks, then every 3
      months until 3 years after registration, and then every 6 months for up to 8 years after
      registration.
