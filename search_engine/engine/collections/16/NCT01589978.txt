      lesions. The PROMUS Element Plus Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium Coronary Stent System
      is indicated for improving luminal diameter in patients with symptomatic heart disease or
      documented silent ischemia due to de novo lesions in native coronary arteries ≥2.25 mm to
      ≤4.00 mm in diameter in lesions ≤34 mm in length. The proposed study will compile real-world
      clinical outcomes data for the PROMUS Element Plus Everolimus-Eluting Platinum Chromium
      Coronary Stent System in routine clinical practice.

      Patients enrolled in this study are expected to follow antiplatelet therapy recommendations
      per American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA)/Society for
      Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions (SCAI) guidelines for percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI). Recommended medications include aspirin, which should be taken for 3 days
      prior to the procedure or as a peri-procedural loading dose and then continued indefinitely.
      Additionally, one of the following P2Y12 antagonists may be given in a peri-procedural
      loading dose and in a maintenance dose per physician discretion: clopidogrel, prasugrel,
      ticagrelor, or ticlopidine.
