      record including your age, sex, and status of the disease.

      For the MRI scans, you will receive a routine contrast drug by vein. Contrast drugs are used
      by doctors in order to see MRI images more clearly.

      A modified MRI scan will performed right after your scheduled standard-of-care MRI scan. This
      modified MRI scan is the investigational scan. To complete the modified MRI scan, you will
      need to stay in the MRI scanner for about 8 extra minutes. It should take about 47 minutes
      total to complete both scans.

      The way that researchers program the MRI machine and the order in which the images are taken
      is what is being modified for the investigational scan. These changes may help researchers
      capture better images.

      Length of Study:

      Your participation on this study will be over after the modified MRI scan is complete.

      This is an investigational study. The standard-of-care MRI scan method is FDA approved and
      commercially available for the diagnosis of several diseases. The modified MRI scan method is
      being used in research only.

      Up to 25 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
