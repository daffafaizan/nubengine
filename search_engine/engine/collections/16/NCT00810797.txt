    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression-free survival at 4 months, as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Objective response rate (complete response [CR] and partial response [PR]).

      II. Clinical benefit (CR, PR, and stable disease >= 6 months).

      III. Assessment of toxicity.

      IV. Assessment of compliance with medication adherence.

      V. Assessment of quality of life.

      VI. Assessment of bone health.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Serial measurements of serum estradiol, estrone, and estrone sulfate.

      II. To investigate treatment resistance (e.g., expression of amphiregulin, epidermal growth
      factor receptor [EGFR]), using molecular and immunohistochemical analyses of blood and tumor
      samples of pre- and post- (when available) treatment tissues. Microarray analyses to
      quantitate the expression of specific estrogen-responsive genes (e.g. thyroid transcription
      factor 1 [TTF1] and PDZK1) will also be performed.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for 1 year.
