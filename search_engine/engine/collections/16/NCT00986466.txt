      Although there is evidence that both exercise and vitamin D improve neuromuscular and
      cognitive function, and may thus reduce the risk of falls and fractures, these two factors
      have never been evaluated together in a clinical trial. This study is a randomized 24-month
      intervention in elderly women. The investigators hypothesize that exercise and vitamin D
      supplementation reduce falls and injuries including fractures in community-dwelling,
      independent-living women 70-79 years of age. The eligible participants will be randomly
      assigned into one of four groups:

        1. exercise with vitamin D

        2. exercise with placebo

        3. no exercise with vitamin D

        4. no exercise with placebo. The rational of this study is to provide important information
           on how to maintain and improve physical functioning and thus prevent falls and fractures
           of elderly people. In addition, if fear of falling can be declined with this program, it
           will further help elderly people to keep physically active and maintain their functional
           capacity and quality of life.
