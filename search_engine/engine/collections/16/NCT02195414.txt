      myocardial infarction, and ischemia driven target lesion revascularization (TLF) at 1 month
      follow up. At 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 years follow-up, clinical endpoints include TLF (its
      individual components), Patient-oriented cardiac event (all cause death, all MI, and all
      revascularization) target vessel revascularization, scaffold thrombosis.
