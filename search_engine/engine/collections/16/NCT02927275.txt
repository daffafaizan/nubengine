      on physical health, investigations into cognitive performance during these periods of
      activity are increasing in number. For changes in the workplace to occur, data needs to show
      that mental processing is not compromised while engaging in low-intensity exercise.

      In this current study, participants, after giving written consent, performed quantitative,
      computer-based cognitive tests to evaluate for differences in performance between active and
      sedentary conditions. The participants engaged in four activity modalities: sitting,
      standing, biking slowly on a stationary bicycle, and walking at 1mph. The validated tests
      used were immediate and delayed verbal recall, the color-word test based on the Stroop test,
      and the "n-back" test. Responses were scored according to both the speed in answering along
      with accuracy on each test. From the scores generated, effect sizes were calculated for
      sitting and compared to effect sizes for cumulative activity stations for statistical
      analysis.
