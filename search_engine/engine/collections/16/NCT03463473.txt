    
      This is a first-in-human (FIH), open-label, Phase 1 dose-Escalation Study of MSB2311, a
      humanized anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, in subjects with advanced solid tumors. Qualified
      subjects will be enrolled to receive their assigned dose regimen of MSB2311 until disease
      progression or intolerable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever occurs
      first. The maximum treatment duration is 2 years. During the study, subjects will be
      evaluated for safety and toxicity, PK/PD, immunogenicity, biomarkers, and anti-tumor activity
      of MSB2311.
