      by 2D-STE after successful reperfusion therapy of acute myocardial infarction (AMI).The
      estimated total number of participants is 90 patients with AMI and treated with successful
      percutaneous coronary intervention were included in this study. The echocardiographic
      measurements were performed in all patients within in-hotpital after PCI procedure, and then
