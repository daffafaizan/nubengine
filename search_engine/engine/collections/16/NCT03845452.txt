    
      Aim of this study is to compare the association of muscle mass and functionality with
      mortality among chronic haemodialysis

        -  the involvement of malnutrition inflammation and atherogenesis syndrome (increase in C
           reactive protein and decrease in serum albumin) on voluntary muscle strength impairment
           and phyiscal activity.

        -  the relationship between voluntary muscle strength and mortality

        -  the relationship between voluntary muscle strength and physical activity
