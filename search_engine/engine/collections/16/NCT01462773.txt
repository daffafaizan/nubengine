    
      The primary objective of this study is to:

      • Determine the safety, tolerability and DLTs of VELCADE when administered in combination
      with interferon-alpha-2b (IFN-α-2b) to patients with metastatic malignant melanoma.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to:

        -  Document any objective anti-tumor responses that may occur in response to this treatment
           regimen.

        -  Document the time to tumor progression in patients receiving this treatment regimen.

        -  Measure levels of the cell cycle proteins p21 and p27 in PBMCs and tumor biopsies
           obtained pre-study and during week 4 of Cycle 1 (Day 26).

        -  Conduct histologic evaluations of microvessel density, tumor apoptosis and lymphocytic
           infiltrates within tumor biopsies obtained pre- and post-study.

        -  Measure plasma levels of bFGF and VEGF over the course of the study.

        -  Monitor the effects of proteasome inhibition on the biological activity of IFN-α within
           immune cells by measuring Jak-STAT signal transduction in patient PBMCs.
