      could be an important mechanism to protect gingiva as it is exposed to mechanical, chemical,
      thermal etc. irritation during whole life. It is especially important during flap surgery.
      Laser Speckle Contrast Imaging (LSCI) is novel non-invasive method with high spatio-temporal
      resolution, therefore it allows us to study remote effect of local vasoconstriction such as
      spreading vasoconstriction in human gingiva.

      The epinephrine is a daily used vasoconstrictor material in dentistry and it will be used to
      trigger remote effect on gingiva. Epinephrine in 1 mg/ml concentration. Solution will be
      dropped on the gingiva at tooth 12 in a fabricated leakage proof well attached to 2mm above
      the marginal gingiva in group "A". The solution will be dropped on the surface of tooth 12
      next to the sulcus into the well in case of group "B". The changes of the blood flow will be
      monitor at the test side with surrounding gingival area by LSCI. The control side in each
      case will be - appropriately to the test side - at tooth 21 with phisiologocal saline.
