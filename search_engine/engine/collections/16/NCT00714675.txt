      to re nutrition is highly decreased. Several experimental studies have shown that an amino
      acid named citrulline could avoid this, by restoring protein synthesis.

      The treated group will receive each morning for three weeks a supplementation of 10 g of
      citrulline and the control group, non essential amino acids in iso-nitrogenous quantity to
      the 10g of citrulline.

      During the three weeks of supplementation, clinical tolerance and physical exercise will be
      evaluated regularly.

      On the 21st day, whole body protein synthesis rate in the post-absorptive state will be
      measured by the isotopic dilution of L-leucine (1-13C expressed in g / kg of lean mass / 24h)
      as well as other parameters of the protein turn-over in the post-absorptive and post-prandial
      state.
