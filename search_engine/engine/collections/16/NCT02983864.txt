      Norms theory help to reduce sexual assault among college men, these programs do not
      completely eliminate sexual assault and their effects tend to fade over time. Unfortunately,
      there is minimal research on whether (1) decreasing alcohol use concurrently decreases sexual
      assault perpetration among college men and (2) whether alcohol interventions can be
      incorporated into existing sexual assault programs for college men (i.e., Bystander/Social
      Norms programs). Therefore, the objective of the proposed project is to conduct a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) comparing sexual assault perpetration and related outcomes (i.e.,
      bystander behavior; rape myth acceptance) for men who receive a group alcohol intervention
      only to men who receive a group integrated alcohol and sexual assault intervention.
      Specifically, the alcohol only intervention will consist of the Brief Alcohol Screening and
      Intervention for College Students (BASICS), an empirically-supported intervention for college
      student drinking. The integrated alcohol and sexual assault intervention, which we have
      termed Ohio University's Combined Alcohol and Normative Intervention program (OU CAN), will
      be modeled after BASICS and empirically-supported Bystander and Social Norms interventions
      for sexual assault. The current study will recruit 100 college men who are sanctioned by
      their university to receive an alcohol intervention for violating a campus alcohol policy: by
      definition an indicated and at-risk population for sexual assault perpetration. Men will be
      followed for 6 months to determine the effects of the intervention on sexual assault
      perpetration and other primary outcomes (e.g., bystander behavior).
