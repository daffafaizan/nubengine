      anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction to more closely replicate the original
      footprint compared to the transtibial (TT) approach.1-5 Few randomized trials have evaluated
      differences in these techniques with respect to clinical outcomes. The purpose of this study
      was to determine if there are any differences in clinical outcome between the AM and TT
      approaches.
