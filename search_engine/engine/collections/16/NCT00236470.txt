    
      This is an open-label study of an oral formulation of risperidone to be taken daily over 12
      months by children and adolescents with conduct and other disruptive behavior disorders. It
      is an extension of a randomized, double-blind study (RIS-INT-79) comparing risperidone with
      placebo over 6 months in patients who had already shown response to the medication for a
      period of 12 weeks. Efficacy assessments include: the Conduct Problem subscale of the
      Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (N-CBRF), a measure of symptoms of conduct and other
      disruptive behavior disorders; Visual Analogue Scale for the most troublesome symptom
      (VAS-MS), a scale ranging from not troublesome to extremely troublesome; Clinical Global
      Impression-Severity of Illness (CGI-Severity), a measure of overall severity of illness;
      Children's Global Assessment Scale (C-GAS), as assessment overall functioning. Safety
      evaluations include incidence of adverse events, physical examinations, laboratory tests
      (biochemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), and electrocardiograms (ECGs). Oral risperidone
      solution (1milligram/milliliter) daily for 1year. For patients weighing at least 50kg, start
      dose is 0.5ml/day. At investigator's discretion, dose may be increased (maximum 1.5ml/d over
      5 days). Patients under 50kg start at 0.25ml/d, increased, if required, to maximum 0.75ml/d.
