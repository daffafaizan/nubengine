      doctors for liver transplant recipients. No study has been reported to date evaluating the
      pharmacokinetics of Myfortic in new liver transplant recipients who also take Prograf and
      corticosteroids. During this six month study, a series of blood samples will be obtained
      after subjects take Myfortic, Prograf, and corticosteroids.
