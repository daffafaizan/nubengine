      fatal, especially among children. Although the mechanism of the liver toxicity remains
      elusive, mitochondrial oxidative stress, has been hypothesized to play a role.

      Most of the studies addressing antiepileptic drug effects on the mitochondria discuss the
      effect of valproic acid. The exact mechanisms involved in the drug-induced effects on
      oxidative phosphorylation are still far from being resolved. Most of the studies investigated
      the effect of valproic acid by using animal models or different in vitro
      methods.Mitochondrial diseases should be considered as a risk factor for valproic
      acid-induced hepatotoxicity, and there is a consensus for avoiding the administration of the
      drug for these patientsIs it possible that other antiepileptic drugs have similar effects?
      The knowledge regarding the effects of other antiepileptic drugs on the mitochondria is
      relatively scarce.
