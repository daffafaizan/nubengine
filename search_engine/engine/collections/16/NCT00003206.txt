      paclitaxel in patients with locally recurrent or metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over 30
      minutes. This cycle is repeated every 3 weeks. Patients may receive 6-8 cycles of therapy in
      the absence of toxicity and disease progression. Patients are followed every 3 months for the
      first 2 years, every 6 months for the next 3 years, and yearly thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 30 eligible patients will be accrued in approximately 18 months.
