    
      This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an antibody conditioning
      regimen known as JSP191, in combination with low dose radiation and fludarabine, in patients
      with Myelodysplastic Syndrome or Acute Myeloid Leukemia undergoing blood stem cell
      transplantation.

      Blood Stem Cell transplantation offers the only potentially curative therapy for many forms
      of Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and for Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). While standard of
      care conditioning regimens given prior to blood Stem Cell transplantation, such as standard
      TBI/Flu conditioning is well tolerated, they are associated with increased rates of relapse
      due to persistence of disease causing Hematopoietic Stem Cells and insufficient graft versus
      leukemia effect.

      The biological conditioning regimen, JSP191, is an antibody that binds to CD117. CD117 is the
      receptor for Stem Cell Factor on blood forming cells. CD117 binding to Stem Cell Factor is
      critical for survival and maintenance of blood forming stem cells.

      The binding of JSP191 to CD117 blocks CD117 from binding to Stem Cell Factor on blood forming
      stem cells. In the absence of CD117/Stem Cell Factor binding, hematopoietic stem cells that
      are currently occupying the bone marrow niches in MDS/AML patients are depleted.

      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of adding JSP191 (an anti-CD117
      monoclonal antibody therapy) to standard TBI/Flu conditioning regimen in adults with AML and
      MDS undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
