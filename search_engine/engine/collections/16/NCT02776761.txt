    
      Investigational HTNV and PUUV DNA vaccines, manufactured in accordance with cGMP guidelines
      by Ajinomoto Bio-Pharma Services (California), from their respective drug substances,
      pWRG/HTN-M(co) and pWRG/PUU-M(s2),were constructed on a well-characterized plasmid backbone,
      pWRG7077. These plasmid DNA vaccines will be delivered IM using the needle-free, disposable
      syringe jet injection device (PharmaJet Stratis). Subjects will be randomized into 3 groups
      of 9 subjects each for a total of 27 subjects. Each subject will receive a total of 3
      vaccinations. Group 1 vaccine will consist of 2 administrations of 1 mg of HTN plasmid (left
      and right deltoid) for a total of 2 mg/vaccination. Group 2 vaccine will consist of 2
      administrations of 1 mg of PUU plasmid (left, right deltoid) for a total of 2 mg/vaccination.
      Group 3 vaccine will consist of a 1:1 mixture of HTNM and PUU vaccines (left, right deltoid)
      for a total of 2 mg/vaccination (1 mg/vaccination of each DNA). Vaccinations will be
      administered on Days 0, 28, and 56. There will be an optional 4th vaccination on Day 168
      dependent on subject availability for the additional follow-up visit on Day 196, tolerability
      of the vaccinations to date, and investigator discretion. Volunteers will be invited back for
      the 4th vaccination to determine if a booster dose results in increased immunogenicity and
      seroconversion. All subjects will be followed until Day 252 (9 months). A Day 365 follow-up
      visit, for an immunogenicity draw only, may be requested dependent on immunogenicity results
      shortly after this final date, generally within 4 weeks of the Day 252 visit or once the
      assays can be completed. Subjects may be allowed to receive other licensed vaccinations or
      enroll in other clinical trials after the Day 252 visit.
