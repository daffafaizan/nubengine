      Primary

        -  Estimate the antitumor activity of the combination of paclitaxel, topotecan, and
           cisplatin in patients with advanced, persistent, or recurrent carcinoma of the cervix.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity for this drug regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the duration of progression-free survival and overall survival.

        -  Determine the impact of prior chemoradiation on response to treatment.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by topotecan IV over 30 minutes and
      cisplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 66 patients will be accrued for this study.
