    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, active controlled comparative binocular Post
      Market Follow-up (PMCF) clinical study to demonstrate safety and efficacy between the
      trifocal intraocular lens POD L GF and the Johnson & Johnson TECNIS Symfony® Extended Range
      of Vision IOL and the Alcon AcrySof® IQ Monofocal IOL.

      Patients who are scheduled to undergo cataract extraction in one or both eyes and posterior
      chamber intraocular lens implants may be screened for eligibility in the study and, if
      eligible, complete a pre-operative screening visit. Both eyes of subjects who are eligible to
      receive the POD L GF IOL or the Johnson & Johnson TECNIS Symfony® Extended Range of Vision
      IOL must be eligible to receive bilateral multifocal IOL implants. Both eyes of subjects who
      are eligible to receive the Alcon AcrySof® IQ Monofocal IOL must be eligible to receive
      bilateral monofocal IOL implants.

      At the time of the first eye surgery, the subjects to be implanted with either the POD L GF
      (test) IOL or the Johnson & Johnson TECNIS Symfony® Extended Range of Vision (comparator) IOL
      will be randomized to receive either the test or comparator IOL in a 1:1 ratio. In addition,
      50 subjects will be implanted with the Alcon AcrySof® IQ Monofocal IOL. All subjects will
      undergo bilateral IOL implantation and will receive the same brand of lenses in each eye.
      Second eye implantations will be delayed until 1 to 30 days after the first eye implantation.
