        1. The evaluated stent is clinically non-inferior to control BMS in terms of freedom of
           MACE

        2. The evaluated stent is clinically beneficial compared to control BMS by reducing
           exposure to radiations, amount of contrast medium administered, procedure time, as well
           as amount of administered heparin,

        3. The evaluated stent does not result in more frequent adverse events than control BMS,

        4. The evaluated stent improves direct stenting success while not decreasing procedural
           success compared to control BMS.

        5. Resource utilization (R.U.):

             1. Hospital-perspective resource utilization during the index admission and index
                procedure is not greater with evaluated the stent and potentially lower than with
                control BMS

             2. Resource utilization over a 6-month time-horizon, in relation to routine follow-up
                and MACE, is not greater with the evaluated stent than with control BMS.
