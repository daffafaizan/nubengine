      associated with a high morbidity and mortality. To reduce the adverse effect of ischemic
      reperfusion injury after organ transplantation, various strategies including ischemic
      preconditioning or postconditioning. Remote ischemic postconditioning is one of such
      strategies where brief ischemic reperfusion injury of one organ protects other organs from
      sustained ischemic reperfusion injury. Remote ischemic postconditioning of the limb with a
      tourniquet is a safe and convenient method of postconditioning organs against ischemic
      reperfusion injury. However, the efficacy of remote ischemic postconditioning in patients
      undergoing living donor kidney transplantation needs to be established. Therefore, we
      investigate the efficacy of remote ischemic postconditioning of the upper limb with a
      tourniquet in recipients of kidney transplantation by measuring the markers of acute kidney
      injury.
