      intravenous solutions to provide a whole blood reinfusion from a cardiopulmonary bypass
      machine.

      Following cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), blood remaining within the bypass machine circuit is
      normally processed by a centrifugal separation of fluids from red blood cells (RBCs) and the
      RBCs are reinfused back into the patient. An FDA approved device, the HemobagTM, provides an
      alternative by reinfusing whole blood, including RBCs, from the CPB machine circuit. This
      allows the patient's own whole blood to be returned back to the patient with all components
      including functioning, non-activated platelets, coagulation factors and plasma. In
      preliminary human trials, blood measurements were improved in patients whose CPB blood was
      processed through the HemobagTM.

      This study will evaluate 50 patients whose post-CPB blood is processed by normal practice
      (centrifugal separation of RBCs for reinfusion) or HemobagTM whole blood reinfusion. Outcome
      measurements will be chest tube drainage for the initial 24 hours following on-pump cardiac
      surgery, ventilatory requirements, protein levels, transfusion requirements, coagulation
      profile, A/A gradients, arterial blood gas measures, and CBC blood panels. All of these data
      are available from the normal clinical care of the patient.

      The hypothesis is that the HemobagTM treated patients will have improved physiologic function
      from the return of whole blood rather than just RBCs following cardiac surgery using CPB.
