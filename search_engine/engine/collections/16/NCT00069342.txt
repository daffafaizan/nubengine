      diverse group of disorders, with several shared characteristics. Marked differences in the
      incidence, prevalence, severity, processes of care, and outcomes in a number of rheumatic
      conditions exist among racial and ethnic groups as compared to white Americans. Furthermore,
      access to health care and treatment also differs in the minority community as compared with
      the majority.

      The effects of the disease may be modifiable by changes in life style, diet, activities and
      exercise. Such changes are difficult for patients to accomplish and various strategies have
      been developed to facilitate success. Strategies include educational materials and programs,
      diet and exercise programs, patient support and empowerment programs and the like.
      Differences in culture and environment, lack of culturally sensitive materials and
      approaches, and lack of trained personnel may make these tools ineffective in the minority
      community. Their effectiveness in the African-American or Latino clinic population has not
      been assessed to date.

      This is a descriptive, exploratory study designed to examine the diverse health beliefs and
      behaviors among the minority patients who are enrolled in the NIAMS Natural History of
      Rheumatic Disease in Minority Communities protocol (# 01-AR-0227). Qualitative and
      quantitative methodology will be used to assess the psychosocial and cultural correlates of
      rheumatic diseases in newly enrolled patients both at intake and after six months of being
      followed at the NIAMS Community Health Center, an outreach site located in the District of
      Columbia in the Upper Cardozo Health Center.
