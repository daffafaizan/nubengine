      increasing, however, genetic susceptibility of patients with the disease have not been
      identified. To elucidate the genetic susceptibility of NTM lung disease, the investigators
      perform a genome-wide association study (GWAS) including patients with NTM lung disease and
      healthy controls (case : control = 1 : 3). The age-, sex-matched control group will be
      recruited from the Korean Healthy Twin Study.
