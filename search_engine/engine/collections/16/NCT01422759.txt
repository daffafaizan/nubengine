      hormone) overproduction in overweight pubertal girls with androgen excess. The investigators
      hypothesize that reduction in P450c17alpha overactivity and androgen receptor blockade by 12
      weeks of spironolactone administration will improve androgen levels after adrenal stimulation
      testing with adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and ovarian stimulation testing with
      recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (rhCG).
