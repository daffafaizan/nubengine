      patients ASA physical status I-II grade, aged within 20-70 years, are randomly allocated into
      two groups: 75mg/20ml ropivacaine only group (Group R, n=30) and 75mg/20ml ropivacaine +
      1Î¼g/kg dexmedetomidine (Group RD, n=30). At the end of surgery, the investigators perform
      four points thoracic paravertebral block guided by ultrasound combined with nerve stimulator
      at T3-4, T4-5, T5-6, T6-7 of surgical side where 5ml solution is injected to each point. The
      characteristics of patients are analyzed to confirm whether they are comparable in both
      groups. Pain was assessed according to a numerical rating scale (NRS) (0 = no pain; 10 =
      worst pain imaginable). Patients were asked to evaluate the maximal degree of pain. Pain
      scores were recorded in post anesthesia care unit(PACU), and1, 2,4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48
      hours after surgery. The study endpoints are evaluated by an anesthesiologist who does not
      know the group allocation. The postoperative rescue analgesic administration, adverse
      outcomes and patient satisfaction are also recorded.

      All data were processed in SPSS 18.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL USA). Normality was tested by
      the Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis. Comparisons of continuous outcomes among groups were
      examined using Kruskal-Wallis test. Chi-square analysis or Fisher's exact test was used to
      assess categorical outcomes between groups. A P-value<0.05 was considered statistically
      significant.
