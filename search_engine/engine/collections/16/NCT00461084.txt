      therapy in previously untreated patients with indolent lymphoma who do not require active
      lymphoma therapy (utilizing GELF criteria,). This is the primary objective Response rate (CR
      + PR) stratified for Follicular/Non-Follicular disease.

      The secondary objectives of this study are to understand the biologic correlates of indolent
      lymphoma biaxin (clarithromycin) response and progression:

      Response rate (CR + PR) according to H. pylori positive or negative (RR with a confidence
      interval will be estimated for each subset). Immunohistochemistry in all diagnostic biopsy
      specimens: Lymphocyte- Activated Macrophage (CD68) and other selected markers to clarify
      tumor infiltrating cells. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMCs) studies to evaluate
      possible HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibition with biaxin (clarithromycin) therapy.
