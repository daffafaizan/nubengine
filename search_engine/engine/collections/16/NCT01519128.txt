      study medication is assigned by chance), crossover (method used to switch patients from one
      treatment arm to another in a clinical study) study to investigate the effect of steady-state
      TMC278 on the single dose pharmacokinetics of digoxin. The study consists of 3 phases,
      including screening phase, treatment phase, and follow-up phase. After the screening phase,
      participants will be randomized to one of 2 treatment sequences consisting of Treatments A
      and B, ie, Sequence AB (11 participants), and Sequence BA (11 participants). Treatment phase
      includes, Treatment A: digoxin 0.5 mg (single oral dose), and Treatment B: TMC278 25 mg once
      daily with digoxin 0.5 mg (single oral dose). The 2 consecutive sequences will be separated
      by a washout period (period when receiving no treatment) of at least 14 days. Safety
      evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiograms, cardiac
      telemetry, vital signs, physical examination, alcohol breath test, and specific toxicities
      will be monitored throughout the study.The study duration for treatment phase will be at
      least 26 days.
