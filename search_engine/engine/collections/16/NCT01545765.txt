      inclusion into the study, subjects will have the study drug applied with a different
      application time to one side of the face and anterior thigh according to the randomization.
      After the completion of the application process, study drug on both sides of the face and on
      both anterior thighs will be removed by peeling.

      After drug removal, the duration of anesthetic effect of the study drug will be tested using
      a pinprick test. Five (5) pinpricks using a 21-gauge needle will be performed at the 4 target
      zones (each side of the face and both anterior thighs). The pinprick test will be repeated up
      to 8 hours after drug removal. There will be a total of 20 post drug removal pinprick test
      completed.
