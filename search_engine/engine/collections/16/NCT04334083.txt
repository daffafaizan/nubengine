      between specific situations (ie: life and death emergencies) and breaks in the variability of
      the heart rate. Each emergency physician participates in the study four times. A night shift
      from 6:30 p.m to 8:30 a.m (14 hours) which will be compared with a day shift, as a control,
      from 8:30 a.m to 6:30 p.m, 16 hours following the night shift and 14 hours following the day
      shift. Emergency physicians will be accompanied by a medical externship student and by a
      student in psychology.

      Statistical analysis will be performed using Stata software (version 13; Stata-Corp, College
      Station, Tex., USA). All statistical tests will be bilateral and a p <0.05 will be considered
      significant. Qualitative variables will be described in terms of numbers and proportions.
      Quantitative variables will be described in terms of numbers, average, median, standard
      deviation, and range. Graphic representations will be complete presentations of results. We
      process multivariate physiological series (HR, HRV, SC, wrist motion, respiratory rate) in
      order to build a stress index. For such multivariate physiological series, we first use
      change point analysis on each univariate series in order to get clusters with constant
      parameters, then we use classification algorithm on the constant parameters obtained in first
      step in order to obtain different classes corresponding to different levels of stress.
      Eventually, we obtain at each time the level of stress and can compare it to the
      environmental conditions.
