      the two following conditions: (i) being compatible with the daily professional, social and
      family activity of the patients so it can be integrated in their life habits and (ii) being
      intensive enough to induce functional benefits. This experimental work will be based on
      multi-factorial evaluations, i.e. biological, physiological, functional, and quality of life
      questionnaires. This work will be based on a collaboration between the Universities of Saint
      Etienne (L. Féasson), Grenoble (B Wuyam) and Örebro (F Kadi) within the Rhône-Alpes Reference
      Centre for Rare Neuromuscular Diseases (JC Antoine).

      It is accepted that exercise therapy can be recommended for patients with myopathies but
      long-term training load still has to be determined for each pathology. In the specific
      context of facioscapulohumeral dystrophy, we aim at associating the scientific evaluation of
      physical activity benefits and a therapeutic education of patients in order to contribute to
      recommendations for physicians and physiotherapists. The purpose of this study is to combine
      an integrated approach with a better understanding of biological process implicated in this
      physiological treatment strategy.
