    
      Therefore, the major goal of the study is to analyse for the first time the host responses in
      kidney-transplant recipients with chronic HEV infection and to compare them to the host
      responses in kidney-transplant recipients without viral infection (controls), to identify a
      specific peripheral signature using blood microarray-based gene expression profiling.

      Other minor goals are :

        1. to assess the incidence of HEV infection in kidney-transplant recipients from
           south-eastern France, to study the risk factors, and to describe the clinical features
           and outcomes of chronic HEV infection in kidney-transplant recipients,

        2. to compare the peripheral signature to a liver signature in the cases where a liver
           biopsy is available. If peripheral and liver signatures are parallel, peripheral
           signature may become a non-invasive tool of exploration of chronic HEV infection in
           kidney-transplant recipients.
