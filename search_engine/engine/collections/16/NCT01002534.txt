      intracellular levels that are balanced by degradation through cyclic nucleotide
      phosphodiesterases (PDE). Several families of PDEs with varying selectivities for cAMP and/or
      cGMP have been identified.PDE5 is highly specific for cGMP and is involved in the regulation
      of the intracellular concentration of cGMP in various tissues. Recently, it has been shown,
      in a preclinical model of transgenic mice, that pharmacological doses of sildenafil and
      vardenafil, two clinically approved PDE5 inhibitors, stimulate chloride transport activity of
      the mutant F508del-protein (Lubamba et al, 2008); this parameter has been assessed by means
      of the nasal potential difference (NPD). An increasing effect of sildenafil on the expression
      of F508del-CFTR protein (Dormer et al,2005) was originally reported in nasal epithelial cells
      harvested from patients with cystic fibrosis and cultured on impermeable supports, a
      configuration that allows interaction of drugs with the apical side of epithelia.

      This study aims at investigating the effect of a single local administration of vardenafil on
      NPD measurements in CF patients homozygous for the F508del mutation.
