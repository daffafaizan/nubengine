      clinical relevance is unclear. A single nucleotide polymorphism in the LTC4 synthase promoter
      region has been associated with increased LTC4 synthase mRNA and a trend toward improved
      bronchodilatory response to leukotriene modifiers in severe asthmatics. This study will
      examine mild to moderate asthmatics with the variant gene and evaluate the bronchoprotective
      response of montelukast in a double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over fashion.
