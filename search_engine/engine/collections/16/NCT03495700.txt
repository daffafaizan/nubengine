      with lateral window technique (L), will be enrolled. All patients have to fulfil all of the
      inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria. The trial will comprise 8 visits. Written
      informed consent will be obtained prior to any examination carried out for study purposes.
      Randomization will be performed using sealed, sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes
      containing treatment allocation.

      Under local anaesthesia, the required L will be performed. Once the blood extraction is done
      the surgery can start following the normal procedure for the lateral approach of sinus floor
      elevation. Once the preparation of the sinus floor elevation is done the randomization
      envelopes will be open and the selected treatment will be applied. For the test group the
      sub-sinus cavity will be filled with L-PRF block and the window will be closed with L-PRF
      membranes. For the control group the sub-sinus cavity will be filled with only DBBM and the
      window will be closed with a collagen membrane. Afterwards suturing will be conducted and a
      CBCT will be taken for control and observation.

      After 6 months the subjects return for a check-up of the healing process. A CBCT will be
      taken to assess the bone regeneration. Implant surgery will be discussed.

      With a crestal incision the implant site will be exposed. A trephine bur of 3 mm in diameter
      will be use to obtain a biopsy of the test or control site. This will result in a biopsy
      sample of the healed site. At the exact same location of the biopsy the drilling will be
      performed according to implant protocol and the implant will be placed and ISQ values will be
      recorded. Follow-up will be till 1 year.
