    
      -  Study site: George Washington University Medical Center

        -  Number of participants: up to 15

        -  Study duration: up to 3 months; each participant will undergo a minimum of one screening
           visit and one study visit.

        -  Each participant will have both skin prick-puncture and intradermal skin tests applied
           on the same study day. The prick-puncture and intradermal tests will be applied
           sequentially to the volar aspects of the participant's forearms:

             1. Skin prick-puncture: four different concentrations of Na-ASP-2 solution (1, 10,
                100, and 1000 μg/mL) will be applied simultaneously in duplicate, to the left
                forearm.

             2. Intradermal: three different concentrations of Na-ASP-2 (10, 100, and 1000 μg/mL)
                will be injected simultaneously, in duplicate, to the right forearm.

             3. Allergen diluent and histamine solutions will be utilized as the negative and
                positive controls, respectively, for both the skin prick-puncture and intradermal
                tests.

             4. Participants will be observed in the study clinic for at least 30 minutes following
                application of the skin tests, and will be contacted via telephone 2 days following
                skin testing.

             5. Sizes of the wheal and erythema reactions for each application will be recorded and
                graded in comparison to the histamine positive control reaction.

        -  Each participant will have blood collected via venipuncture (a maximum of 25 mL)
           immediately prior to application of the skin tests, in order to measure antibodies
           (particularly IgG and IgE) to Na-ASP-2 using an ELISA procedure.
