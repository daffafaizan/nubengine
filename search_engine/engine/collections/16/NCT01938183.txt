      chronic periodontitis (CP) is uncertain. The authors compared the effect of metronidazole
      (Mtz) on full-mouth periodontal debridement (PD= 1 hour of ultrasonic calculus/plaque
      removal) in smokers with CP.

      Methods. This pilot study involved 30 Individuals (having at least six teeth with a clinical
      attachment loss of ≥ 5 mm and probing pocket depth (PPD) of ≥5 mm) that were randomly
      assigned into three groups (n=10): 1) PD plus 3 g of placebo gel daily topical application 2)
      PD plus daily topical application of 3 g of 15% Mtz benzoate gel; and 3) PD plus a daily
      single dose of 750 mg Mtz (Flagyl®). Clinical parameters visible plaque index (VPI), gingival
      bleeding index (GBI), relative attachment level (RAL) and PPD; and the quantitative analysis
      (real-time PCR) of Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis and
      Tannerella forsythia were assessed baseline, 1, 3 and 6 months after PD.
