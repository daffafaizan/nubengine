      cells for the treatment of cirrhosis has caused great concern.Stem cells from human
      exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) has been shown to be safe and effective for liver diseases.
      Randomization controlled studies are needed to confirm the long term effect of SHED treatment
      for liver cirrhosis. The present study aimed to investigate the safety and efficacy of SHED
      in hepatitis B related liver cirrhosis patients.

      This study is an prospective, randomized control study. Patients with decompensated cirrhosis
      will be randomly assigned to receive 4 times of SHED treatment plus standard medical
      care(treatmentï¼‰or standard medical care (control). SHED infusion (1x10E6 cells/kg body
      weight) via peripheral vein will be given at week 0,4,8,12.The primary outcome is MELD-Na
      score. Secondary outcomes are Child-Pugh, liver function, life quality and survival.
