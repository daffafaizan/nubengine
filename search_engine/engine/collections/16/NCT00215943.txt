      received four cycles of VAD repeated every 4 weeks. Chemotherapy was administered by
      continuous IV Infusion for 96 hours: vincristine at a dose of 0.4 mg/day and doxorubicin at a
      dose of 9 mg/m^2/day. Patients were administered dexamethasone 40 mg by mouth (PO) on days 1
      to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of the initial two cycles. Dexamethasone was given only on days
      1-4 of all subsequent cycles. Patients were randomized to receive zoledronic acid IV on
      either Day 1 or 15 of each cycle. This schedule continued monthly as long as the patient
      remained on study. The dose was calculated based on the patients' monthly creatinine
      clearance. Upon initiation of Zometa therapy, the following guidelines were applied: For
      patients with creatinine clearance >60 mL/min, the recommended dose remained at 4mg. For
      patients with reduced creatinine clearance, dosing was calculated to achieve the same area
      under curve (AUC) as in patients with creatinine clearance of 75 mL/min. Creatinine clearance
      was calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula.
