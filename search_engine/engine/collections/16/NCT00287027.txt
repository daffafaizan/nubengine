      being treated with a medication called Risperidone Long Acting Injectable medication or
      another antipsychotic medication are candidates for the study. The purpose of the study is to
      find out from patients' family how they feel the medication has affected their relationship
      with them.The study will involve meeting with family members three times over the course of
      one year. The first time will be at New Hampshire Hospital (NHH) or at a community mental
      health center and the follow up times will be at a convenient place and time for the family
      member (s), in the community. We will ask them to answer questions from the Family Burden
      Interview and Quality of Life Questionnaire. The family will not be charged for any test that
      is completed solely for this study. The family will be provided a travel stipend to meet with
      the researchers.We do not see that there will be any risks to the family. We will be
      interviewing the patient's family, and they will be sharing information as to how they feel
      their relationship with the patient is going. All efforts will be made to keep this
      information confidential; however, there may be unforeseen circumstances that could lead to
      breaching of confidentiality. If the family expresses need for help the research staff will
      make recommendations for referral to a provider.
