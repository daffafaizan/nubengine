      Asthma is a major public health problem in the United States, with particularly high
      prevalence rates among some Hispanic groups. Genetic linkage studies of this disease are of
      potentially great utility for the identification of those at risk, the search for new
      pharmaceutical treatments, and designing interventions to prevent development of asthma.
      Study power is greatly enhanced if a relatively isolated, homogeneous population with a
      significant prevalence of asthma can be identified. Such a population does not exist among
      Hispanics in the United States but is available in the Central Valley of Costa Rica.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      The study concentrates on a genetically isolated Hispanic population with high asthma
      prevalence living in the Central Valley of Costa Rica. A genome screen will be conducted on
      large pedigrees multiplex for asthma and linkage analysis performed for seven intermediate
      phenotypes related to asthma including airway responsiveness; FEV1; bronchodilator
      responsiveness; skin test reactivity to common aeroallergens; serum total and
      allergen-specific IgE; and peripheral blood eosinophil count. A genome screen will also be
      conducted in the parent-child trios, and ancestral haplotypes will be reconstructed to
      identify regions influencing asthma-associated phenotypes. Within candidate regions
      demonstrating both linkage in extended pedigrees to asthma and/or asthma-related phenotypes
      and significant linkage disequilibrium within the unrelated asthmatic subjects, fine mapping
      will be performed by testing for genetic association to single nucleotide polymorphisms
      within positional candidate genes.
