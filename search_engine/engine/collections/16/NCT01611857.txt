    
      This is a Phase I, open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation study with a Phase II portion
      planned upon reaching the Maximum Tolerated Dose or recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). Phase
      I: The first cycle of the Phase I portion of the trial will be considered the Dose Limiting
      Toxicity evaluation period. Patients with advanced solid tumors will be treated with
      Tivantinib on Days 1 to 14 and with FOLFOX on Day 1. Following evaluation of the Dose
      Limiting Toxicities, doses will be escalated/reduced according to the protocol with 3 to 6
      patients treated per dose level until the Maximum Tolerated Dose is determined.
