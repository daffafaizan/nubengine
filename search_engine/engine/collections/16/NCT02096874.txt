      characterized by thickening of the macula due to abnormal leakage of the retinal vasculature.
      Ischaemic changes and microvascular pathologies have long been hypothesized to play a role in
      the development of DME. In diabetic retinopathy, ischaemia stimulates the production of
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which can lead to the breakdown of blood-retinal
      barriers, and may cause DME through an increase in retinal vessel permeability. DME is best
      evaluated by optical coherence tomography (OCT) while retinal ischemia is determined by
      Fluorescein angiography. With the avaiability of ultra wide field fluorescein angiography,
      the investigators can now accurately measure the degree of ischemia in peripheral retina.
      Thus, this study will provide us data on the degree of retinal ischemia in nonproliferative
      diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) and proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) cases as well as the
      measurable change that occurs in retinal ischemia after intra vitreal injection of
      bevacizumab.
