      functional ability, and provide greater health related quality of life. However, evidence
      showed that presence of severe pain, impaired functional outcomes and reduced muscle strength
      continue up to 6 to 12 month after surgery. Relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle
      relaxation exercise and rhythmic breathing have long been used in treating postoperative pain
      and for various health-related purposes. Although the number of studies that include
      relaxation techniques in treating postoperative pain is increasing, there isn't any study
      that investigate the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation exercise on pain,
      functional outcomes and muscle strength in patients with TKA.

      The aim is to investigate the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) exercise
      on pain, functional outcomes and muscle strength in patients with TKA.
