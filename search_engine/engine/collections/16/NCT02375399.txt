      asynchronous contraction impairing cardiac function. By implantation of pacemaker systems
      with three leads located in atrium, right ventricle and coronary sinus, tracing back this
      deranged contraction closer to the physiological excitation propagation is aimed (cardial
      resynchronization therapy [CRT]). Despite patient selection according to the guidelines
      nearly one-third of the patients do not profit, neither clinically nor echocardiographically,
      from an implanted CRT-device. In addition, recent studies have shown that no reliable
      prediction may be achieved with the known echocardiographic parameters of dyssynchrony,
      regarding the response to such therapy. The aim of this study is therefore to assess new
      echocardiographic parameters, which may allow to better predict CRT response.
