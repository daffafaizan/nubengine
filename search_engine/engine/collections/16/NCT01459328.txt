    
      This phase III randomised clinical trial compares the outcome of two different neo-adjuvant
      radiation based treatments for locally advanced rectal carcinoma. This encompasses patients
      at risk for a positive circumfrential resection margin (CRM+) on baseline assessment imaging
      and pateints identified as being with a T-descriptor T4 at baseline assessment.

      The arms compared are as follows:

        -  The investigational arm: short chemo-radiation course(25Gy in 5 daily fractions over 1
           week) +/- surgery.

        -  The conventional arm: protracted chemo-radiation course (50Gy in 25 daily fractions over
           5 weeks combined with chemotherapy)+/- surgery.

      The outcomes include four domains: overall survival, biological effect, quality of life and
      health-related economics.
