        -  Compare the overall and progression-free survival at 24 weeks in patients with
           previously untreated metastatic or unresectable renal cell carcinoma treated with
           interferon alfa-2b with or without thalidomide.

        -  Compare the safety of these 2 regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these 2 regimens.

        -  Compare the pharmacodynamic effects of these regimens on pharmacodynamic measurements of
           angiogenesis such as serum and plasma angiogenic factor levels in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior
      nephrectomy (yes vs no), disease-free interval (no more than 1 year vs more than 1 year), and
      ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 or 2). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) twice daily beginning on
           day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive interferon alfa-2b as in arm I and oral thalidomide once daily
           beginning on day 1.

      Treatment in both arms continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) continue treatment for 24 weeks past
      CR.

      Quality of life is assessed prior to randomization and then every 4 weeks through week 24.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 346 patients (173 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 2 years.
