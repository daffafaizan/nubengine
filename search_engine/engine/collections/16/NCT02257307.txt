    
      Study Design: Observational Cohort Study Setting/Participants: Premature babies who are at
      high risk for ROP during their stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

        -  The number of sites - 5 centers in the US

        -  The number and description of participants: 500 babies with birth weights of <1251g

      Study Interventions and Measures:

      Data from RetCam digital images obtained as part of clinical care during the routine
      diagnostic eye exam for ROP will be uploaded and transmitted via secure server to a central
      reading center. These de-identified images will be graded by Certified Image Readers. Results
      of image gradings will be sent back via secure web-based platform to the Clinical Center. The
      primary outcome measure is the turnaround time from uploading the images to feedback to the
      Clinical Center. The secondary outcome measure is the time required to obtain retinal images
      for babies scheduled for ROP examination in the NICU (relative cost-effectiveness).
