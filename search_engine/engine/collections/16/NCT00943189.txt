      conducted. Meticulous ultrasound examination will be done to the fetuses using trans vaginal
      and transabdominal techniques. The patients will receive only the NT information. Only in
      cases of detection of severe fetal anomalies the patient will get the information of the
      examination and counseling according to the findings. All patients will be asked to provide
      information of the 15 weeks early comprehensive ultrasound examination. The NT examination
      will be compared to the 15 weeks ultrasound. All patients will be asked to give information
      after delivery of the baby's health condition.
