    
      Endoscopic papillary balloon dilatation is an alternative to endoscopic sphincterotomy for
      treating bile duct stones:

        -  easier and as effective. But...

        -  a higher risk of pancreatitis.

      Conditions including periampullary diverticulum, prior EST, Billroth-II anastomosis, or
      distal CBD tapering pose difficulty in EST and lithotripsy with increased risk of
      complications.

      Whether EPBD or EST is superior in efficacy or safety under such circumstances is not clear.
