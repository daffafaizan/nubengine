      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has been shown both at the individual and public health
      levels to reduce morbidity, mortality, and vertical and possibly horizontal HIV transmission.
      However, expenses, feasibility, long-term adherence, and effective delivery of HAART remain
      formidable barriers, particularly in developing nations. Recently, international initiatives
      have provided hope for widespread use of HAART at affordable cost in sub-Saharan Africa.
      Simplified, once-daily HAART regimens with directly observed therapy (DOT) may help to
      achieve high levels of treatment adherence, a key component for long-term viral suppression
      and treatment success. Peer advocates have been used to improve adherence with medical
      therapies in a variety of settings. This study will evaluate the effectiveness and
      feasibility of DOT using patient-nominated peer supervisors to improve adherence to HAART in
      HIV infected adults in South Africa.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to either Peer-DOT-HAART or self-administration of a
      once-daily combination of the Western Cape Province ART program medications for 24 months.
      Study measures will include CD4 cell count and HIV viral load, adherence questionnaires,
      genotypic HAART resistance testing, and incidence of new or recurrent opportunistic
      infections.
