      movement of an upper limb that has impaired movement due to a stroke. Many researchers have
      found that incorporating both the affected and unaffected limb together during exercises
      (bilateral task training) results in increased functional use of the affected limb as
      compared to only performing exercises with the affected limb. Therefore, we want to determine
      if bilateral task training is more effective than unilateral task training with the use of
      the SaeboFlex device in subacute and chronic stroke rehabilitation. For the unilateral
      training group, exercises will be completed with only the affected hand using the Saebo
      device. For the bilateral group, the Saebo will be on the affected hand, no device on the
      unaffected hand, and both arms will do the exact same movements/exercises at the same time.
      The participants will be videotaped and photographed moving balls without the device, with
      the device at the start of the study, with the device midway through the study, and at the
      end of the study. This will be done for the purpose of providing participant feedback
      regarding their progress and for report of outcomes upon completion of the project. Faces
      will be omitted from all photographic media at the request of the participant, and the
      participant may decline photographic media at any time without having to withdraw from the
      study.
