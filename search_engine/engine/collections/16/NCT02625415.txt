      that will receive chemotherapy treatment with capecitabine and/or pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin. The selection of potential participants will be based on inclusion and exclusion
      criteria. Patients will be randomly allocated either to the treatment group or the placebo
      group. Treatment will be delivered daily (t.d.s) and assessments will take place at 0, 1, 2,
      3 and 4 weeks.

      The intervention group will receive the application of topical vitamin B6 cream to the hands
      and/or feet of the patients and the control group will receive the placebo.

      At both baseline and follow-up, patients in both groups will be assessed for their degree of
      palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, the Quality of Life, the need for dose-limiting due to PPE
      and Pain intensity using standardized rating scales. Data will be analysed with inferential
      and descriptive statistics.
