      patients with obstructive sleep apnea and examining their response to compliance to therapy
      with CPAP. To date no correlation between biomarkers of oxidative stress and compliance to
      CPAP has been measured. CPAP is the most effective treatment for obstructive sleep apnea and
      has been show to reduce blood pressure and decrease oxidative stress.
