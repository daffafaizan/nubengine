    
      The purpose of the study is to test the effect of the Alereâ„¢ q HIV-1/2 Detect (diagnostic
      assay) on uptake of HIV testing among HIV-exposed infants and young children, and health
      outcomes for HIV-infected infants and young children through a novel POC EID Community Model
      in Zambia. The study will also assess the feasibility of field implementation of this novel
      diagnostic tool and its acceptability among HIV-infected mothers and frontline health
      workers. The knowledge generated from this study will enable the Zambia Ministry of Health
      (MOH) to make informed policy decisions about the implementation and scale up of point of
      care (POC) diagnostic tools for early infant diagnosis and pediatric HIV treatment programs
      in Zambia and the region.
