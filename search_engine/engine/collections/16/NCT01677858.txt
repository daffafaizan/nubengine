    
      This is a Phase 1/2, multicenter, single-arm, nonrandomized, open-label and dose-escalation
      study of weekly carfilzomib and dexamethasone for patients with progressive multiple myeloma.
      The Phase 1 dose escalation portion will enroll patients into sequential dose-escalating
      cohorts consisting of 3 patients each to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of
      carfilzomib administered weekly as a 30 minute intravenous (IV) infusion with dexamethasone.
      The Phase 2 portion will enroll patients using the MTD established for carfilzomib from the
      Phase 1 portion of the study. Dexamethasone will be administered IV or orally at the same
      dose and schedule as used in the Phase 1 portion of the study.
