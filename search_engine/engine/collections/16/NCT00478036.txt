      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs) as a preventative measure to control the
      post-selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) anterior chamber inflammation. Both classes of
      compounds reduce inflammation through the inhibition of the cyclooxygenase pathway, whereas
      the corticosteroid class also inhibits the lipoxygenase pathway of the arachidonic acid
      cascade. Although effective, topical corticosteroids are associated with increase in
      intraocular pressure (IOP), posterior subcapsular cataract formation, and reduced response to
      infection. These adverse side effects have not been reported to occur with topical NSAIDs,
      which are effective in controlling the pain after SLT along with the prevention and
      suppression of the ocular inflammation. There are ophthalmologists who forgo using the
      anti-inflammatory agents post SLT and prescribe Refresh Tears to their patients to comfort
      the treated eye.

      The significance of the study lies in assessing the efficacy of Acular LS, compared to Pred
      Forte and to Refresh Tears in reducing discomfort, inflammation and maximizing IOP lowering
      following SLT procedure for open angle glaucoma with the hope of resolving the dispute over
      the effective post-operative care in SLT patients.
