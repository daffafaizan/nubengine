      animals. More of the pentamidine reached the lungs and less was found in the liver and kidney
      after pentamidine was given by aerosol than after an intravenous injection. This suggests
      that the toxicity of pentamidine may be less if given by aerosol than if given by the
      intravenous route.

      Patients will inhale one dose of radiolabeled aerosol containing pentamidine, and an image of
      the lung will be taken immediately and then 24 hours later to determine the amount of
      pentamidine reaching the various areas of the lung. Patients will then undergo a
      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) in order to recover the PCP organism from the lung and to
      corroborate the diagnosis of PCP. If PCP organisms are detected, patients will be randomly
      assigned to aerosolized or intravenous pentamidine and treated for 21 days. Patients taking
      pentamidine by aerosol will repeat the radiolabeled aerosol study on day 9. The BAL will be
      repeated at the end of therapy for all patients. If patients do not improve within 9 days,
      they will be switched to another therapy. After completion of therapy, patients will be given
      the option of prophylactic therapy, i.e., doses of medication to prevent reinfection, for
      PCP. All patients will be carefully assessed every 4 weeks for 6 months whether they begin
      prophylactic therapy or not. Zidovudine (AZT) may not be taken during the 21-day trial
      because of the increased risk of side effects, but it can be resumed when PCP therapy is
      completed.
