      BMI 21.99±3.02 kg/m2) were included in this study. Subjects were randomly allocated to KT
      (with the muscle facilitation technique) and placebo-KT (without any technique and tension).
      Scapular isometric muscle endurance was measured with a scapular muscle endurance test. The
      strength of the upper, middle, and lower trapezius, and serratus anterior was assessed using
      a hand-held digital dynamometer. Data were analyzed with 2x2 [groups (KT and Placebo-KT) x
      time (pre- and post-intervention)] mixed-model ANOVA.
