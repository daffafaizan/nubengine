      paradigm allows the analysis of familiarity as a quantitative process as well as the analysis
      of personal familiarity to each subject. Three familiar and three unfamiliar faces are
      morphed in pairs for each participant. The displayed stimuli for each pair of faces are ten
      morphs with 5 to 95% of familiar face increasing by 10%. Participants are asked to press a
      button if the displayed stimulus seems familiar. At the end of the task each participant is
      asked to name the identity of the familiar faces (true or false recognitions, true or false
      omissions).

      Each participant will undergo 2 visits.
