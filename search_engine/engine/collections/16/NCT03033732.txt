    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, 2-arm, randomized trial with a pragmatic design involving
      276 individuals with prescription opioid use disorder. Participants will be randomized to
      receive either:

        1. Methadone provided via initial daily witnessed ingestion as per local guidelines.

        2. Buprenorphine/naloxone maintenance therapy provided via flexible take-home dose regimens
           dispensed as per the physician's discretion, once clinical stability is achieved.

      Once randomized to a study medication and treatment initiation and induction has begun, study
      physicians and participants will discuss the treatment plans and procedures going forward.
      Once treatment initiation has taken place, the participant will attend study visits every 2
      weeks (including collection of urine samples) for the 24-week intervention period. For all
      study sites, standardized guidelines exist and will be adhered to for the safe induction of
      both medications. Frequency of illicit opioid use, intensity of craving and other secondary
      endpoints will also be assessed via standardized questionnaires.
