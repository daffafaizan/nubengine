    
      Mediterranean-DASH Diet Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay (MIND) is a Phase III
      randomized controlled trial designed to test the effects of a 3-year intervention of a hybrid
      of the Mediterranean and DASH diets, called MIND, on cognitive decline among 600 individuals
      65+ years without cognitive impairment who are overweight and have suboptimal diets. The
      proposed MIND diet is a hybrid of the Mediterranean and DASH diets but with selected
      modifications based on the most compelling evidence in the diet-dementia field. The MIND diet
      has the same basic components of the DASH and Mediterranean diets, such as emphasis on
      natural plant-based foods and limited animal and high saturated fat foods, but uniquely
      specifies green leafy vegetables and berries as well as food component servings that reflect
      the nutrition-dementia evidence. The trial will employ a parallel group design comparing the
      effects on cognitive outcomes of the MIND intervention diet plus mild caloric restriction for
      weight loss to the control diet, usual diet with mild caloric restriction for weight loss.
      Biological effects of the MIND diet will be assessed by measurement of brain macro- and
      micro-structural integrity in 300 randomly selected participants. Other biochemical markers
      will be assessed in the entire cohort of 600 participants, including: plasma Abeta 42/Abeta
      40, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and plasma markers of oxidative stress and
      inflammation. In addition, the trial will examine potential effect mediators and modifiers by
      a number of cardiovascular risk factors, AD biomarkers, and biological mechanisms. The
      proposed study has two clinical sites, one in Chicago (Rush University) and one in Boston
      (Harvard University), and centralized laboratories for data coordinating and analyses
      (Brigham & Women's Hospital), neuroimaging analyses (Rush University), and specialized
      laboratories for tissue biochemical analyses.
