      skills. Those studies were conducted using traditional game controllers. The relatively new
      Nintendo Wii uses a novel set of mechanics which allows for more realistic representation of
      player generated movements. We aim to study if the unique mechanics of the Wii can improve
      laparoscopy skills better than a traditional video game (Playstation 2).
