    
      A double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and
      pharmacodynamics of three doses (75 mg, 250 mg and 750 mg) of mepolizumab intravenous (i.v.)
      administered every 4 weeks compared with placebo over a 52-week treatment period in subjects
      with severe uncontrolled refractory asthma. Efficacy will be measured by the frequency of
      asthma exacerbations. In addition lung function, rescue medication usage, daily symptoms,
      asthma control score, asthma quality of life score and withdrawals due to asthma
      exacerbations will be assessed. Safety will be assessed by adverse events, clinical
      laboratory evaluations, ECGs, immunogenicity and vital signs. Pharmacodynamics will be
      assessed by eosinophil levels in blood, serum IL-5 and eosinophil levels in induced sputum.
