      affecting primarily the joints. In RA, inflammatory synovium causes destruction of cartilage,
      erosion of the adjacent bone and ultimately loss of function of the affected joint. Newer
      imaging techniques, such as ultrasound (US), have shown promise in evaluation of RA. Many US
      scoring system have been used to classify and quantify the synovium, effusion, erosion and
      cartilage for assessing and monitoring AR. However, its use is considered problematical
      because there are very few data on normal joints and, at this point, there is no clear
      definition of excess amount of synovium in normal people.
