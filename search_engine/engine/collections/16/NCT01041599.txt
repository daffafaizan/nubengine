      gives important information about atherosclerosis. Oscillometric methods may be useful in
      assessing arterial stiffness in a mainly operator independent way.

      OBJECTIVE: We aim to investigate the relationship between albuminuria and arterial stiffness
      measured with an oscillometric device in diabetic patients, hypertensive patients and healthy
      subjects.

      METHODS: 152 diabetic patients, 152 hypertensive patients and 152 healthy subjects are
      planned to be enrolled in this study. The measurements will be done between 9:00 and 13:00.
      After the measurements, blood and urine samples will be obtained, centrifugated and kept in
      -80Â°C until assayed. Afterwards, echocardiographic left ventricle mass index will be
      calculated. The correlation between albuminuria and arterial stiffness will be assessed as
      the primary outcome measure.
