      Proper vehicle selection is important when managing scalp conditions, such as seborrheic
      dermatitis, because the efficacy of these treatments depends largely on compliance and the
      amount of active ingredient delivered to the scalp. It is therefore important to prescribe
      vehicles that are easy to apply and cause the least amount of disruption to the patients'
      pre-existing hair care practices. One of the most common rate limiting hair care practices
      among different cultures is wash frequency. Literature shows African American women are more
      likely to wash their hair less than once weekly versus Caucasian women. We hypothesize
      certain vehicles, such as foam preparations which do not require hair washing, will be more
      efficacious in African American women with seborrheic dermatitis than shampoo preparations.
