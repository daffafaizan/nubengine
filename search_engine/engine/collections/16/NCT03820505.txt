    
      As a result, the investigators also found a very high variability in the number of deliveries
      per month for the EMS 34 and the SSSM of the SDIS 34, which can reach up to 11 deliveries per
      month (May 2014 example).

      Formalized expert recommendations were published in 2010 by SFAR, which then led to the
      establishment of a national observatory for IEA at the end of 2011, in which the
      investigators have been participating for 4 years.

      Currently the national database lists 2000 unannounced deliveries including 230 in the
      HÃ©rault.

      This observational study allows us to evaluate the management of these patients and newborns,
      the risks and needs of pre-hospital teams, including the need for reinforcement and expertise
      of midwives.

      The investigators can also assess mortality and morbidity, as well as the extension of
      hospital stays beyond J7
