      biopsy will be removed surgically through a small incision in the breast.

        -  The surgical biopsy specimen will be carefully examined by a pathologist, and may be
           useful in guiding further therapy if needed.

        -  In the future, tissue from the surgical biopsy may be used to study genetic changes that
           may be responsible for cancer formation and prevention. The tissue will be kept for
           future research for up to 10 years.
