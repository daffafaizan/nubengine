      attacks and strokes is firmly established for many high-risk people with diagnosed arterial
      disease, and the proportional reductions in these cardiovascular events appear to be about
      one quarter, whether or not such patients have diabetes. But, most younger and middle-aged
      people with diabetes do not have manifest arterial disease - although they are still at
      significant cardiovascular risk - and yet few trials have tested aspirin in such individuals.
      As a result, there is substantial uncertainty about the role of aspirin for the prevention of
      heart attacks and strokes among apparently healthy people with diabetes, and only a small
      minority receives it.

      There is consistent evidence from observational studies of lower rates of cardiovascular
      disease (particularly cardiac and sudden death) in people with higher intakes, or higher
      blood levels, of fish oils (omega-3 fatty acids). Trials in people who have survived a heart
      attack have shown modest, but potentially worthwhile, reductions in coronary events. There
      have been, however, no large-scale trials of the use of fish oils for the prevention of
      vascular events in people without diagnosed arterial disease.

      If ASCEND can reliably demonstrate that aspirin and/or fish oils safely reduce the risk of
      cardiovascular events and deaths in people with diabetes who do not have pre-existing
      arterial disease, then this would be relevant to some tens of millions of people world-wide
      (who are currently not receiving such therapy) and might save tens of thousands of lives each
      year.
