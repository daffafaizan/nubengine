      history of supportive care for BD patients and is recognized as the world leader in this
      regard. According to the EULAR 2018 recommended guidelines of Behcet's Disease, the first
      line of therapy recommended against recurring oral ulcers is colchicine. However, a
      significant portion of the participants undergoing colchicine therapy does not have
      sufficient response and require subsequent immune modulatory therapy. By comparing
      participants receiving colchicine as part of supportive care to those who also receive
      topical pentoxifylline (PTX), the investigators seek to prove the concept that topical PTX
      may have clinical value. Additionally, the investigators seek to demonstrate the safety and
      practicality of using topical PTX in BD patients. If the PTX gel therapy provides a
      sufficient response in participants, these participants might not need to undergo immune
      modulatory therapies. The risks of PTX are well characterized and previously reported adverse
      events were primarily gastrointestinal. The investigators expect fewer GI symptoms to result
      from the topical PTX application. The investigators anticipate the benefits of PTX can be
      optimized by a topical application, but require a trial to test that hypothesis.
