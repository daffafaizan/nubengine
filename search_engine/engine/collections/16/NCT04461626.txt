      data for the Persona fixed bearing implants used in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).
      The study will include a maximum of 20 centres and up to 1000 implanted knees. Each centre
      may enrol up to a maximum of 100 implanted knees to permit assessment of the consistency of
      outcomes across a variety of investigators and clinical settings.
