      inflammation. Moreover, appearance of the resulting scar depends largely on surgeon
      technique. Use of the Prineo™ wound closure system may decrease operative time, decrease
      incidence of infection and inflammation, and improve aesthetics of the resulting scar.
      Prineo™ has been shown to hold as well as sutures for the first 12-25 days and may reduce
      closure time of the final skin layer up to 75% in abdominoplasty and breast procedures. The
      system provides excellent coverage of the wound edge, protecting the incision with a
      microbial barrier. Cosmetic results in abdominoplasty and breast procedures appear to be
      equivalent to sutures.

      The main endpoints will be operative time to closure of the final skin layer and
      patient-rated and blinded observer-rated scar quality. The investigators hypothesize that
      operative time to closure of the final skin layer using Prineo™ will be faster than operative
      time to closure using subcuticular suture. The investigators also hypothesize that subjective
      and objective scar quality of incisions closed with Prineo™ will be better than those closed
      with subcuticular suture.
