      20%. Though the bleeding rate of GVs (25%) is lower than that of Esophageal varices (EVs),
      the mortality rate is higher due to greater GVs rupture and less space for endoscopic
      intervention. In addition, in 30% of patients with GVs, the possibility of treatment failure
      exists.

      Guidelines differ on endoscopic treatment for secondary prevention of GVs.Current studies
      suggest that EVL, due to its low incidence of complications, is suitable for GOV1, while it
      is still controversial for the treatment of gastric varices. Compared with glue, the
      advantage of ligation is that it can avoid serious complications caused by glue injection,
      such as ectopic embolization, large ulcer and sepsis. As there are few studies comparing GVL
      and GVO in secondary prevention of gastric varices, the treatment methods are different, and
      the treatment effect is controversial. In addition, the choice of treatment for different
      types of GVs needs further study.

      The investigators establish a randomized controlled clinical trial, comparing the efficacy
      and prognosis of GVL and GVO in secondary prevention of GVs, especially in patients with
      portosystemic shunting, and exploring the endoscopic treatment selection of different types
      of GVs.

      Outcome expectations: Compared with glue injection, endoscopic ligation for secondary
      prevention of gastric varices is safe and effective, especially in patients with
      portosystemic shunting.
