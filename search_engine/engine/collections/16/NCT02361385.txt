      psoriatic arthritis in the feet and ankles. Patients will first undergo a screening
      genotyping test; low affinity binders for PBR28 PET will be excluded from this pilot study.
      Those patients meeting inclusion criteria, will then undergo a PET-CT localised to feet and
      ankles that have been identified to be clinically inflamed (on examination and ultrasound at
      the screening visit). After PET-CT, patients will undergo synovial biopsy of one joint
      imaged. After 6 patients have undergone PET-CT, an interim analysis will be undertaken, to
      optimise PET scan duration and to alter the group of joints being imaged with CT.
