      for morphine per and postoperative and thus reduces the side effects associated related to
      their administration.

      Nevertheless, on the basis of current knowledge, clonidine may disrupt some
      electrophysiological measures required for the intraoperative monitoring of surgeries with a
      high risk of neurological complications.

      For such surgery, anaesthesiologists are led to inject clonidine after surgery, at a time
      when the electrophysiological measures are no longer needed, which limits the benefit in
      terms of intraoperative morphine savings.

      Whith this study, investigators would like to investigate if an early administration of
      clonidine in patients aged 6 to 16 years undergoing ear surgery disturbs excitability of the
      spinal motor neuron.

      The choice of the study population is justified by the fact that the ear surgery does not
      require electrophysiological monitoring and it is carried out under conditions similar to
      that of anesthesia of scoliosis corrective surgery for which electrophysiological
      measurements are essential for the prevention of neurological complications.

      Observations will allow investigators to determine therefore whether early administration of
      clonidine is possible at high risk of neurological complications surgeries for which
      electrophysiological monitoring is essential.
