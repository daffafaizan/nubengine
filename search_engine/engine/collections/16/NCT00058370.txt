        -  Determine the feasibility of combining post-operative intrathecal radioimmunotherapy,
           craniospinal radiotherapy with intensity-modulated radiotherapy boost, and chemotherapy
           in patients with standard-risk medulloblastoma.

        -  Determine whether this regimen can maintain or exceed the current progression-free
           survival rate while decreasing long-term serious morbidity in these patients.

        -  Determine the long-term morbidities, most specifically neuropsychological,
           neuroendocrine, audiometric, and growth outcomes, in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Radioimmunotherapy: Patients receive intrathecal iodine I 131 monoclonal antibody 3F8 on
           days 1 and 8.

        -  Radiotherapy: Beginning as soon as possible after radioimmunotherapy, patients undergo
           external-beam and intensity-modulated radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks.

        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive vincristine IV once weekly for 8 weeks concurrently with
           radiotherapy. Beginning about 6 weeks after completion of radiotherapy (4 weeks after
           vincristine), patients receive cisplatin IV over 6 hours and oral lomustine on day 0 and
           vincristine IV on days 0, 7, and 14. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to 8 courses
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.2 years.
