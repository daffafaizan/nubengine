      cancer. Performing nephrectomy in these patients is not without risk, however. The very real
      chance of significant metastatic disease progression during the postoperative period or
      complication before or during surgery that may prolong postoperative recovery could
      potentially delay or prevent the administration of systemic therapy in the postoperative
      period. Patient selection for surgery remains critical for success.

      Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is a medical procedure where tumor is ablated using microwave
      energy to treat a medical disorder. The benefits of RFA in selected metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma patients with small primary tumor (<5 cm) will be evaluated in this Phase I/II
      study.
