      cardiac autonomic function. However, no studies have evaluated the influence of different
      ventilators during noninvasive ventilation (NIV) in the autonomic modulation associated with
      hemodynamic changes. Objective: Evaluate the autonomic behavior and hemodynamic changes
      during the execution of the NIV with two models of mechanical ventilators in subjects after
      CABG. Material and Methods: This is quantitative randomized, prospective, crossover study.
      The subjects were selected on first day postoperatively CABG and was performance NIV
      procedure using two different ventilators: conventional ventilator and specific ventilator
      for the use of NIV for 30 minutes, each. Block randomization was used to determine the
      technique that begins to approach then by crossover, perform the sequential technique. The
      heart rate variability (HRV), heart rate, respiratory rate, oxygen peripheral saturation and
      arterial pressure were evaluated before procedure, in the instants 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30
      minutes during NIV each and 15 minutes after the end of the NIV application. HRV was
      evaluated using the time and frequency domain.
