      ventral redistribution of regional ventilation, which impairs gas exchange. Two-handed mask
      ventilation has been shown to improve gas exchange by providing higher tidal volume than
      one-handed mask ventilation. We hypothesis that those higher tidal volume caused by
      two-handed mask ventilation would also improve the respiratory mechanics during induction of
      general anesthesia.
