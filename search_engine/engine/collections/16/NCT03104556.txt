      adults. Surgical reconstruction is considered treatment of choice. For some patients the
      surgical risk is to high an operation is refused. For those Patients the MitraClip system
      (Abbott Vascular, Menlo Park, CA, USA) offers a much less invasive treatment option.
      Occurrence of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) is one of the potential
      complications during this procedure. 1% of all patients have an acute stroke. The number of
      new ischemic lesions without clinical manifestations is much higher (up to 85%). The impact
      of these lesions on the global cognitive function is unclear. The aim of this study is to
      determine the frequency of cerebral embolisms related to predefined procedural intervals and
      postprocedural cerebral lesions using Transcranial Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance
      imaging. Furthermore we want to study the correlation between cerebral embolisms seen as high
      intensity signals in transcranial duplex ultrasound and cerebral lesions seen in the cMRT.
      The results should build a basis for further studies that want to reduce the amount of
      cerebral lesions.
