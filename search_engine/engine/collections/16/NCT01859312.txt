      21-hydroxylase enzyme deficiency accounting for 95% of the cases. 21-hydroxylase deficiency
      presents with a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from salt-wasting and
      virilization of female neonates (classic CAH) to symptomatic (precocious puberty, short
      stature, acne) or asymptomatic hyperandrogenemia (non-classic CAH). Classic CAH is
      characterized by impaired cortisol and mineralocorticoid biosynthesis, which triggers
      adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) hyper-secretion and accumulation of adrenal androgens.
      Glucocorticoid treatment of patients with classic CAH focuses on cortisol replacement and
      prevention of the ACTH-driven androgen excess. Current conventional glucocorticoid treatment
      regimens (short or long-acting agents dosed once, twice or thrice daily) have failed to
      simulate physiological cortisol secretion and suppress adrenal androgen overproduction,
      without supraphysiologic replacement. Short-term overtreatment with glucocorticoids can lead
      to iatrogenic Cushing syndrome and long-term use has been associated with the development of
      obesity, visceral adiposity, insulin resistance and osteoporosis. Isolated case reports have
      provided evidence that continuous subcutaneous hydrocortisone infusion (CSHI) can mimic
      physiologic cortisol release and lead to improved CAH control at doses similar to or lower
      than the traditional treatment. This pilot study aims to test the hypothesis that
      difficult-to-treat adult patients with classic CAH will have better adrenal androgen control
      and improved CAH and glucocorticoid-related comorbidities, when they receive near-physiologic
      cortisol replacement therapy via CSHI compared to conventional glucocorticoid treatment. In
      addition, this study will provide information on the safety and tolerability of CSHI, and
      will generate data that will be used in the design of future pediatric studies.
