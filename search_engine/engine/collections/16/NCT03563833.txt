      techniques on the antioxidant system make the method of anesthesia more important.

      The effects of Minimal Flow Anesthesia (0.4 l / min) and High Flow Anaesthesia (2 l / min) on
      tissue oxygen saturation (St02) and thiol / disulfide balance in hypotensive anesthesia
      operations will be investigated.

      Minimal flow anesthesia is widely used because of its advantages such as cost reduction,
      prevention of environmental pollution, minimization of heat and humidity loss.

      Hypotensive anesthesia is preferred in some specialized surgical procedures in order to
      reduce bleeding and improve the surgical field of view.

      The use of hypotensive anesthesia and inhalation agents may cause hypoperfusion at the tissue
      level and cause hypoxia-induced oxidative stress and initiate cell damage.

      Determining the ideal anesthesia technique in terms of oxidative stress and tissue perfusion
      will reduce intra- and postoperative risks by protecting patients from the harmful effects of
      anesthesia.
