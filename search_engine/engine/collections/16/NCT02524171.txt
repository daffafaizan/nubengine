      two thirds will likely reoffend and return to the justice system. Antisocial cognitions and
      behaviors are the strongest predictors of reoffending and are highly prevalent among
      justice-involved Veterans (JIVs). However, in the absence of treatments with demonstrated
      effectiveness with JIVs, no systematic approach to address antisocial cognitions and
      behaviors has been implemented in VA. Moral Reconation Therapy (MRT) is a
      cognitive-behavioral intervention that aims to reduce antisocial cognitions and behaviors.
      MRT has the best empirical support for reducing risk for criminal recidivism among civilian
      offenders, and its associated mechanisms (improvements in interpersonal functioning and
      impulse control) have been linked to improvements in health-related outcomes that are also
      risk factors for recidivism (substance use, mental health, housing, and employment problems).
      However, no trials have been conducted with JIVs. Differences between JIVs and
      justice-involved civilians (e.g., prevalence of traumatic brain injuries; interpersonal
      problems) suggests prior research on MRT with civilians may not be generalizable, and
      prompted the VA's Veterans Justice Programs (VJP) and the developers of MRT to develop a
      Veteran-specific curriculum of this intervention.

      Using the new Veteran-specific manual, the overarching objective of the current proposal is
      to implement and evaluate MRT as an intervention to reduce risk for criminal recidivism and
      improve health-related outcomes among JIVs in VA Mental Health Residential Rehabilitation
      Treatment Programs (MH RRTPs). Using a Hybrid Type 1 design, this project will test the
      effectiveness of MRT in a multisite Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) (Palo Alto, Little
      Rock, and Bedford VAs) and conduct a formative evaluation to facilitate future implementation
      of MRT in VA.
