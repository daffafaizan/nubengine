      B-infected participant populations. Each part of the study will consist of screening phase
      (up to 8 weeks), treatment phase (24 weeks or 48 weeks, depending on treatment response), and
      post-treatment follow-up phase (24 weeks or 48 weeks, depending on treatment response). The
      duration of individual participation will be up to approximately 56 weeks (participants not
      eligible to continue treatment in extension phase), up to 80 weeks (participants continuing
      treatment in extension phase but not meeting treatment completion criteria), or up to 104
      weeks (participants meeting treatment completion criteria). The safety and efficacy will be
      monitored throughout the study. In a separate substudy, at selected clinical sites,
      percutaneous core liver biopsy will be performed to evaluate changes of intrahepatic viral
      parameters.
