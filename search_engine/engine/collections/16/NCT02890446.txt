      training on the InMotion 2 shoulder robot (12 hourly sessions over four weeks). The external
      focus group received instructions specifically to pay attention to the task goal--hitting
      targets on the video game, while the internal focus group was instructed to pay attention to
      the movement of their arm motions (video game monitor was turned off). Both groups practiced
      the same arm reaching pattern and were matched for level of arm impairment and training
      dosage.
