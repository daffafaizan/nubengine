      nears death, common themes for caregivers include anxiety and emotional distress from
      impending death, anticipatory grief, and acceptance of loss, which negatively impact the
      caregiver QOL. Investigators propose to conduct a pilot project to investigate music therapy
      impact on caregiver distress for caregivers of imminently dying hospitalized patients
      referred to hospice. Upon enrollment, caregivers will be provided a music therapy
      intervention with legacy-building components, and will be asked to complete 3 brief
      questionnaires on distress and quality of life before and after the music therapy to assess
      their response to the intervention. The overall aim is to reduce caregiver distress and
      optimize QOL.
