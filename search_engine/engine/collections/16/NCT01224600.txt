      with newly diagnosed PAD (< 1 year). Initial data on medical history, caracterisation of the
      PAD (risk factors, main sites and severity of the atherosclerotic lesions),clinical
      evaluation of undetected previous CV events, standardized US duplex examination of the
      abdominal aorta and carotid arteries and treatment (type and duration) are collected by the
      physician into an electronic medical record. A phone follow up at 3 months, 1, 2 and 3 years
      is realised by the Centre for Clinical Research of Grenoble. Data on mortality,
      revascularization, treatments prescribed (type and duration), cancer onset, cardiovascular
      events, carotid stenosis, abdominal aortic aneurysm are collected. All these serious adverse
      events are documented and reviewed by an independent critical events committee.
