    
      Stress urinary incontinence (SUI) is a common problem that affects 35-40% of women worldwide.
      SUI occurs when a woman experiences involuntary leakage of urine with physical activities
      such as exercise, coughing and sneezing that increases intra-abdominal pressure. Vaginal
      laser therapy offers a potential novel treatment for SUI, however there is limited scientific
      evidence to show benefits to treatment. A sham controlled study will further add to the
      literature and evidence to support or oppose the use of the fCO2 laser for SUI.

      The purpose of this study is to compare active therapy to sham treatment to determine if a
      true benefit to treatment exists. Eligible participants will be randomized 1:1, to receive
      active or sham fCO2 laser treatments. Three treatments, active or sham, to the vagina will be
      performed approximately four weeks apart. The primary efficacy endpoint is four weeks after
      completing all treatments. Treatment durability and safety will be assessed eight weeks after
      the primary endpoint.
