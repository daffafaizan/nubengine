      of life (HRQoL) of upper-extremity sarcoma patients who have undergone limb salvage surgery.

      Patient hospital records are retrospectively reviewed for demographic and clinical data.

      The patient recruitment takes place at the outpatient clinic of the Comprehensive Cancer
      Center, Helsinki University Hospital, and Tampere University Hospital. The study includes a
      cross-sectional assessment at six months follow-up with five validated questionnaires. A
      follow-up is conducted two and five years after surgery in the outpatient clinic.
