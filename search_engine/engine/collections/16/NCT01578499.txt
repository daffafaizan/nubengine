      being tested to treat people who have CD30+ cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (mycosis fungoides and
      primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma). This study will look at the overall
      response of people who took brentuximab vedotin compared to people who took methotrexate or
      bexarotene as standard care.

      The study enrolled 131 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by chance, like
      flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain undisclosed to the
      participant and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent medical need):

        -  Methotrexate 5 to 50 mg or Bexarotene 300 mg/m^2 (as per physician's choice)

        -  Brentuximab vedotin 1.8 mg/kg

      This multicenter trial is being conducted worldwide. The overall time to participate in this
      study is approximately 6 years. Participants will make multiple visits to the clinic every 12
      weeks for a minimum of 24 months after the end of treatment (EOT) visit, and then every 6
      months until death, study closure, or 6 years after enrollment of the last participant.
