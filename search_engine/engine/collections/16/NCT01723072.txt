      multicenter design to investigate the impact of omalizumab on Quality of Life (QoL) in
      Chronic Spontaneous Urticaria (CSU) and will assess its effectiveness in reducing and/or
      inhibiting the occurrence, time-course and severity of angioedema episodes.

      Omalizumab is administered subcutaneously every 4 weeks as an add-on therapy to the current
      approved treatment of adult CSU patients. The treatment period is 28 weeks which is followed
      by an 8-week follow-up. The study aims to enroll approximately 70 patients.

      The study is divided into a 2-week screening period, a 28-week double-blind treatment phase
      with omalizumab or placebo-omalizumab, and an 8-week follow-up phase.
