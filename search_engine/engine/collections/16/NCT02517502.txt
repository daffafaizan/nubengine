      making, learning, and memory. These symptoms, collectively referred to here as cognitive
      dysfunction can appear as early as the first few months after starting chemotherapy and may
      persist long after chemotherapy and anti-hormone therapy, if any, is completed.

      Once developed there is no satisfactory treatment for cognitive dysfunction although
      cognitive retraining and exercise may improve symptoms and/or function; at least for some.

      Omega-3 fatty acids derived from ocean fish are a new potential preventative treatment
      against development of cognitive problems which can arise in some individuals during
      chemotherapy treatment. In doses of 1-2 grams per day it has been found to improve some
      aspects of cognitive function in healthy adults who have low DHA dietary intake. It has also
      been shown to improve some aspects of function in individuals with a mild reduction in
      cognitive ability but not for those with marked impairment.

      Participation in this study will last about 12 months. Participants will make visits to the
      study site for both standard of care visits and additional study-related visits. Participants
      will be randomized (randomly assigned; like flipping a coin) to one of two groups. Neither
      the Investigator nor the participant will know the assigned treatment.
