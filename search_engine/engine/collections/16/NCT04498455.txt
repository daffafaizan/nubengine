      effect of dietary fiber [Prebiotin] on the gut microbiome, perceived stress, anthropometric
      variables, and clinical biomarkers of metabolism. All participants in this study will be
      resident physicians at the Family Health Center in Waco, TX. This population was selected
      based on pilot data indicating they are at a greater risk for weight gain and have higher
      levels of stress than the average population. The goal is to recruit 40 participants for a 12
      week intervention trial.
