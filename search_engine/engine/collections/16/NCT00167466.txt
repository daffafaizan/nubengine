      of gingivitis and periodontal disease (Brill, 1962; Kleinberg, 1974). The disease process
      manifests as periodontal inflammation and tissue destruction (Oliver et al, 1969). Although
      relatively crude methods are used for routine clinical diagnosis and monitoring of
      periodontal disease (eg, probing for gingival pocket depth and bleeding), sensitive and
      reproducible measures of periodontal disease have been validated (Oliver et al, 1969; LÃ¶e et
      al, 1965; Egelberg, 1964; Golub et al, 1976; Borden et al, 1977).

      By the Lewis definition, an acid is an electron pair acceptor. In the presence of light &/or
      electrical induction, valence electrons from a wetted titanium dioxide (TiO2) semiconductor
      will donate electron pairs to neutralize organic acids. Whereas a tooth surface is negatively
      charged, plaque has a net positive charge, and in part, ionic attraction contributes to the
      adherence of plaque to the tooth surface. Donating electrons to the plaque will alter
      polarity and diminish the ionic attraction between the plaque and the tooth surface
      (iontophoretic effect).

      Thus, in addition to the established mechanical benefits of brushing, the flow of electron
      pairs for disrupting ionic bonding of plaque to the tooth surface and neutralizing bacterial
      organic acids, may confer an advantage over a conventional toothbrush (Hoover et al, 1992;
      Niwa et al, 1989; Kusunoki et al, 1986). There is some evidence that the electrons may also
      interact with bacterial coenzyme-A to have an antibacterial effect (Morioka et al, 1988;
      Onoda et al, 1996).
