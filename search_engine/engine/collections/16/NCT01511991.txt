      1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 inspired vol% (T1, T2 and T3, respectively) during remifentanil-based
      anesthesia (1.0 mcg/kg/min) for cardiac surgery (n=14):

        1. TDI of lateral mitral annulus at systole (S'), early filling (E') and atrial contraction
           (A')

        2. transmitral flow Doppler at early filling (E), atrial contraction (A), deceleration
           time;

        3. LV-ejection fraction (EF)

        4. bispectral index (BIS)

        5. phenylephrine-infusion rate

        6. other pressure derived hemodynamic parameters:heart rate; systolic, diastolic, and mean
           blood pressures; systolic, diastolic, and mean pulmonary artery pressures; central
           venous pressure (CVP), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP), mixed venous O2
           saturation (SvO2), cardiac index (CI) and stroke volume index (SVI)
