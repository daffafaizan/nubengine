    
      This study used a randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel-group
      design in which QAW039 150 mg or QA039 450 mg or placebo was added to standard of care, GINA
      steps 4 and 5 asthma therapy.

      The study included:

        -  Screening period of up to 2 weeks to assess eligibility;

        -  Run-in period of approximately 2 weeks and a maximum of 6 weeks on placebo to collect
           baseline data for efficacy variables and compliance with the Electronic Peak Flow/
           eDiary device. Upon completion of the run-in period, all patients who met the
           eligibility criteria were randomized to one of three treatments: QAW039 150 mg or QAW039
           450 mg or placebo once daily in a ratio of 1:1:1.

        -  Treatment period of 52 weeks (assessment period for all Primary and Secondary Outcome
           Measures). Clinic visits were scheduled approximately 4 weeks after randomization and
           then at approximately 8-week intervals during the active-treatment period. Phone calls
           occurred at specified time points between visits occurring at 8-week intervals. Patients
           who had successfully completed 52 weeks of treatment in this study were offered an
           optional participation in a safety study (CQAW039A2315).

        -  Follow-up period of 4 weeks, investigational and drug-free, following the last dose of
           study drug. A follow-up visit occurred approximately 4 weeks (i.e., approximately 30
           days) following the last dose of study therapy to complete safety assessments and
           pregnancy testing (if applicable). the follow-up period applied to all patients except
           those patients who had entered the safety study (CQAW039A2315) directly after the Week
           52 study visit.
