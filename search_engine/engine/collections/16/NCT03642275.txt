    
      This is a single site, two-arm, pilot randomized controlled trial that aims to examine the
      feasibility, acceptability and preliminary efficacy of a mobile phone-based intervention
      compared to usual care in older adult patients with HF (â‰¥50 years). Forty (n=40) patients
      from the University of Illinois Hospital & Health Sciences system will be enrolled in the
      study, randomly assigned to the intervention or usual care group, and followed for 60 days.
      Patients in the intervention group will receive the Heart Failure Health Storylines mobile
      app developed by Self Care Catalysts in collaboration with the Heart Failure Society of
      America, three connected health devices from Fitbit and Nokia that interface with the mobile
      app, and tailored text-messages targeting health beliefs, self-care efficacy, and knowledge
      about HF. The control group will receive standard care which involves patient education and
      outpatient follow up with physical and laboratory examinations as needed. The primary study
      outcome is change in self-care and quality of life. Secondary outcomes include hospital
      re-admissions and emergency room visits.
