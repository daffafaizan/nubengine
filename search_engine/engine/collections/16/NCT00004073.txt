      radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed high grade glioblastoma multiforme. II.
      Evaluate this regimen in terms of survival in this patient population.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive suramin IV over 2 hours for initial dose and over 1 hour for
      subsequent doses daily for 5 days on week 1. Patients receive concurrent radiotherapy daily
      with suramin IV over 1 hour twice weekly on weeks 2-7. Patients with stable or responsive
      disease receive a second course of suramin twice weekly on weeks 20-24. Treatment continues
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 2
      months until disease progression or start of new therapy and then monthly for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued for this study over 1.5 years.
