      subgroups, the data came from conventional radiotherapy era showed that the prognosis of this
      three subgroups were different, the N1 groups suffered more distant metastasis than N0 group,
      and some literature showed that combined chemotherapy with radiotherapy in stage II patients
      can improve the treatment results.

      Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)now is an widely used technique in the treatment of
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the preliminary results showed that IMRT can improve the quality of
      life in nasopharyngeal through salivary gland preservation.

      Compared IMRT alone with IMRT plus cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy in the treatment of
      stageII nasopharyngeal carcinoma, we hope to confirm whether stage II (and which subgroup)
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma will be benefit from concurrent chemoradiotherapy.
