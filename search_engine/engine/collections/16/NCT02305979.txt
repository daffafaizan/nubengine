      The primary objective is to determine the incidence of bone pain following G-CSF
      administration in patients with hematologic malignancies, patients undergoing mobilization of
      hematopoietic progenitor cells, and patients who have undergone an autologous hematopoietic
      cell transplant. Incidence will be determined via patient-reported incidence following G-CSF
      administration.

      Secondary objectives include determining the efficacy of loratadine for bone pain prevention
      as indicated by a decrease in incidence and a decrease in severity (questions 4 and 5 of the
      survey).
