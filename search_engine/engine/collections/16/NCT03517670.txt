      intravenous milrinone for the treatment of arterial vasospasm following subarachnoid
      hemorrhage. Intravenous milrinone is part of our standard care protocol for the management of
      cerebral vasospasm in association with nimodipine (intravenous or enteral route) and high
      arterial blood pressure (mean arterial pressure of 100-120 mmHg, spontaneously or induced by
      volume expansion and norepinephrine). All patients of our ICU who were diagnosed with
      cerebral arterial vasospasm during the few days following a subarachnoid hemorrhage will be
      included.
