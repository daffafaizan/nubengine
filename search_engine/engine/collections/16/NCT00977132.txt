      described below without treatment interruption as long as no criteria for termination of
      treatment are met. After two years the primary endpoint will be evaluated. Non-responders
      will be taken off study after 4 months of therapy. Patients who relapse after an initial
      response to study treatment can receive one attempt to re-start therapy after a short
      duration of discontinuation.

      Treatment with Valproic Acid starts at day 1. The dose of Valproic Acid is slowly increased.
      In the morning of day 13 trough level of Valproic Acid will be checked. The target range will
      be 50-110 Âµg/l. The dose of Valproic Acid will be adjusted depending on the trough level.

      In the first eight weeks of therapy weekly controls of Valproic Acid levels are required.
      Thereafter, Valproic Acid levels will be checked every four weeks.

      The planned dose of lenalidomide is 10 mg/day, orally as continuous therapy. Dosing will be
      in the morning at approximately the same time each day. Capsules may be taken before or after
      a meal. In the course of the study the dose will be adjusted to the results of the blood
      count.

      Only one cycle of study drug (28 days) will be supplied to the patient every four weeks.

      Patients experiencing adverse events may need study treatment modifications.

      During treatment with study medication weekly control visits for the detection of adverse
      events are required during the first eight weeks, thereafter the patient must be seen every
      four weeks.

      Therapeutic success is evaluated in 4-weekly intervals. Bone marrow will be examined after 12
      weeks and after 48 weeks or in case of premature study termination
