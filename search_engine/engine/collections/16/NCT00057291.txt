      and structural changes that promote more consistent and fewer caregivers will lead to better
      physical, mental, social, and emotional development of young children. Structural changes are
      designed to facilitate a more family-like environment and include smaller group sizes, more
      consistent caregiving from fewer caregivers, integration by age and disability status, and
      establishing two daily 60-minute Family Hours in which children and caregivers interact
      together. The project also attempts to demonstrate that training caregivers can be beneficial
      to both caregivers and children.

      All caregivers and children in three orphanages for children under 4 years old in St.
      Petersburg, Russia will participate in this study. One orphanage will implement both training
      and structural changes. A second orphanage will receive training only. The third orphanage
      will serve as a control, receiving neither training nor structural changes. Caregivers are
      assessed annually for attitudes to and problems with their jobs; anxiety and depression;
      coping styles; traditional versus progressive attitudes toward caregiving; sensitivity to
      children's emotions; values; and perceptions of their own relationships. Children are
      assessed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 36, and 48 months for physical growth, chronic and acute
      disorders, functional abilities, and mental, motor, social, and emotional development.
