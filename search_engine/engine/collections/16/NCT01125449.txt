      normal cells from its peroxidative effects. This study will examine the effect, if any, of
      the drug when dosed in patients at a level sufficient to achieve transient serum states of
      400mg/dl. Safety of the drug has been shown in a Phase I study when dosed as high as
      1.5gm/kg. Patients will be treated twice weekly for 12 weeks (24-cycles) and evaluated for
      response using RECIST criteria. Patients showing stable disease or objective response will
      remain on study for up to one year or until absence of measurable disease or disease
      progression.
