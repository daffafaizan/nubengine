      disengagement from CSC treatment. In Phase 2, we will compare disengagement among high-risk
      individuals with a CSC Step-down intervention to that with standard CSC care. The Step-down
      intervention will use web-based telemedicine and a smartphone app, to decrease disengagement
      likelihood. High-risk participants identified by predictors found in Phase 1 will be offered
      the intervention.
