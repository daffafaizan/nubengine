      pregnancy complication, associated with premature delivery, fetal growth restriction,
      abruptio placentae, and fetal death, as well as maternal morbidity and mortality. Although
      preeclampsia has been recognized for centuries, the etiology of this disorder remains
      unknown. Familial clustering of preeclampsia has long been identified, leading to the concept
      of a genetic basis for this syndrome. We propose a familial genetic study of preeclampsia. As
      such a study is often difficult to do, we plan to conduct a pilot study to test the
      feasibility, logistics and examine frequency of genetic polymorphism of certain genes in the
      target population.

      A total of 50 women who had preeclampsia during their first pregnancy will be identified
      through the Preeclampsia Foundation. Women who had chronic hypertension or diabetes prior to
      the first pregnancy will be excluded. We also will try to enroll their family members to this
      study. All subjects will be asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire and collect
      mouth wash samples. Women who reported having hypertension during pregnancy will be asked to
      sign a medical record release form. A copy of the medical record will be obtained to confirm
      the diagnosis of preeclampsia. DNA will be extracted from buccal cells. Frequency of
      polymorphisms for a number of candidate genes (e.g., HLA-G, AGT, eNOS, MTHFR, IL-1 beta,
      TNF-alpha, Prothrombin, and Factor V Leiden) will be examined. Information and experience
      gained from this pilot study will be most valuable for use to plan a main study.
