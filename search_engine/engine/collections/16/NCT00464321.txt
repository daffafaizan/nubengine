      body weight. The higher dose cohort will not start until the first 28 days safety data for
      the lower dose cohort have been reviewed by the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC).
      Cohort C and D will run concurrently with patients randomised to receive either a 4 or 0.3
      mg/kg body weight dose, respectively. After receiving the infusion of GC1008 on Day 0,
      patients will be monitored for the 24 hours following the infusion. Patients will return
      periodically over the following 112 days for safety evaluations and clinical outcome
      assessments. Blood samples will be collected to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of single dose
      administration of GC1008 as well as for evaluation of markers of clinical efficacy
