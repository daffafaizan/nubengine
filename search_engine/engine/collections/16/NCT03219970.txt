      locally advanced or metastatic EGFR T790M-positive NSCLC within the context of the early
      access program in Hong Kong. In particular, osimertinib treatment efficacy will be assessed
      in the context of the relationship between EGFR T790M mutant AF and survival outcomes,
      particularly overall survival. In a real-world setting, analysis of overall survival benefit
      is considered less sensitive to differences in healthcare systems and standards. Other
      clinical outcomes including response rate (based on physician's judgement) and time to
      treatment discontinuation (TTD) will be examined. This study will also describe current
      practice for molecular testing and EGFR mutation profiles in this patient population.
