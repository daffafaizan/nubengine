      confirmed non-squamous NSCLC would be enrolled.Patients were randomly divided into two
      groups, with 85 in the group A and 85 in the group B.The group A was treated with
      endostar,sintilimab and chemotherapy(carboplatin-pemetrexed).The group B was treated with
      endostar and chemotherapy(carboplatin-pemetrexed).The efficacy and safety would be
      evaluated.The progression-free survival and overall survival would be analyzed.This data of
      this study might provide a more effective treatment for non-squamous NSCLC.
