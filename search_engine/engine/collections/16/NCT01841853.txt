      researchers, as well as with tools to bridge barriers to health promotion. For example,
      alternative ways to recruit participants and to collect and analyse data in studies with and
      for people who are ageing in a migration context.

      The findings describe how a person-centred approach could be used to make use of the
      resources of the target groups, and visualise methods to bridge linguistic barriers. The
      education material from Older people in the risk zone has also been translated to Bosnian
      Serbo-Croatian and Finnish.
