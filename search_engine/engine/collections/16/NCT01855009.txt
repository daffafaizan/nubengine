        1. Compare the relative efficacy of four variations of the GN4K program in facilitating
           positive changes in body composition and parental ratings of quality of life.

        2. Compare parental ratings of children's behavior to DXA-measured changes in body
           composition;

        3. Compare measurements of scale weight, height, waist/hip ratios and BMI with DXA-measured
           changes in body composition;

        4. Develop a logarithm formula with the use of anthropometric measurements and parental
           ratings to predict body composition changes
