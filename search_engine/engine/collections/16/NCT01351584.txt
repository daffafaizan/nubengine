      information on the antineoplastic treatment of breast cancer in Germany. The registry will
      follow patients for up to five years. It will identify common therapeutic sequences and
      changes in the treatment of the disease. At inclusion, data in patient characteristics,
      comorbidities, tumor characteristics, biomarker testing and previous treatments are
      collected. During the course of observation data on all systemic treatments, radiotherapies,
      surgeries, and outcome are documented.

      The impact of nutrition (MaNut) and physical activity (MaNut) on the course of the adjuvant
      disease will be examined, as well as long-term effects of adjuvant treatment (MaTox) and the
      multiple patient-reported outcomes (MaLife).
