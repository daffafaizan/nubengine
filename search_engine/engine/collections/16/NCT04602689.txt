      gastric tumors in the high-risk group of bleeding (the size of the iatrogenic ulcer is
      expected to be 40mm or more, or taking aspirin, antiplatelet drugs, and anticoagulants).

      After resection and hemostasis with ESD, Fibrin glue (Greenplast Qâ„¢) is applied to the
      iatrogenic ulcer at the end of the procedure, and the control group will not be applied.

      After that, observe whether there is a difference in the bleeding rate within 48 hours and 4
      weeks.
