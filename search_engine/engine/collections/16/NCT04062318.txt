      beta (15-29 Hz) bands in primary somatosensory cortex (SI) are associated with a decreased
      probability of perceiving tactile stimuli at perceptual threshold, and can be modulated with
      attention. Furthermore, high power beta activity in SI emerges as brief "events" (<150ms) in
      un-averaged data, the rate and timing of which underlie the attentional and perceptual
      effects associated with high beta power.

      In this study, human electroencephalography (EEG) and a non-painful tactile detection task
      are used to assess if and how the rate and timing of ongoing rhythmic events in the
      alpha/beta bands prior to a tactile stimulus causally impact touch perception, and how this
      relates to attention. A custom TMS protocol that is hypothesized to mimic endogenous
      beta-frequency event patterns is used to test whether TMS can impact perception in a similar
      manner. Finally, computational neural modeling designed to simulate macro-scale EEG signals
      is used to aid in the interpretation of potential neural circuit mechanisms underlying
      features of acquired EEG data.

      The TMS-EEG components of this study will use a within-subjects crossover design. In initial
      study sessions, participants will have an MRI, and then complete a tactile detection task
      while EEG data is recorded. In subsequent study sessions, participants will complete the
      tactile detection task while EEG data is recorded concurrent with online active or sham TMS.
      Analyses will focus on comparing detection probabilities of tactile stimuli presented at
      perceptual threshold and tactile evoked response potential waveforms between trials in which
      TMS pulses or endogenous beta events occur with similar timing and intensity.
