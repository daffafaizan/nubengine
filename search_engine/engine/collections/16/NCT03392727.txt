      (n=110) will be provided a baby box and standardized face to face education regarding the box
      and its contents, safe sleep, and infant health promotion; the control group (n=110) will be
      provided information on how to obtain the same baby box at a community site in Winnipeg, and
      will receive a safe sleep pamphlet, baby box pamphlet and a guide to online resources for
      prenatal ad infant health promotion. An additional comparison group will be parents who
      already have a baby box at the time of recruitment. This group will also receive the safe
      sleep pamphlet. Families will be interviewed at recruitment and 2-4 months of age to measure
      box ownership and self-reported safe sleep and infant health promotion practices.
      Administrative data will be used to evaluate the impact on infant immunizations and
      hospitalizations in the first year of life, and to evaluate the impacts of prenatal care
      visits and neonatal length of stay on the outcomes.

      Families will be asked to participate in a face to face interview at baseline (enrolment) and
      one follow-up interview coordinated with a scheduled routine healthcare visit for the infant
      at 2 months of age and conducted face to face or by telephone, according to family
      preference.

      PHIN will be requested for both mother and infant in order to explore the relationship
      between adequacy of prenatal care and the study outcomes, and to evaluate the impact on
      infant immunizations and hospitalizations in the first year of life. Postal code will be
      requested to analyze differences related to place of residence and neighbourhood income
      quintile.
