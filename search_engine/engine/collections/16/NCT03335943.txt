      options other than supportive care. In pilot studies, CDA-2 showed promising results of
      hematological improvement in these patients.

      To date, the optimal regimen for CDA-2 treatment is not well established. The researchers are
      going to make a multi-centered clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CDA-2 in
      800 patients with International Prognostic Scoring System(IPSS) Lower/Intermediate-risk
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).

      Eligible patients will be given CDA-2 intravenously, with 200 ml each day for 14 consecutive
      days in every four weeks (one cycle). The treatment will be repeated at least for 3 cycles.
      The patients will be followed up to 24 weeks.

      The primary endpoint is hematological improvement (HI) at 12 weeks according to IWG criteria.
      Full blood counts will be done on all patients every week. Change in bone marrow function as
      measured by changes in bone marrow morphology and cytogenetics will be assessed before and
      after 3 cycles of the treatment.

      The secondary endpoint is the therapy response. Complete remission (CR), partial remission
      (PR) and response duration, side effects, evaluation of QOL will be evaluated at the end of
      the treatment in every cycle.

      Adverse events of the treatment will be recorded for evaluation of the safety.
