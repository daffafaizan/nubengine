      and NPH insulin. The trial will be evaluating differences in effectiveness, safety and cost
      between the two agents when used in patients on more than 80 units or 1unit/kg long-acting
      insulin. The investigators hypothesis is that patients switched from lantus to NPH will have
      improved blood glucose control.
