      surgical site infection. The standard practice is to perform peritoneal and wound lavage
      using normal saline solution. The investigators propose the use of superoxidized solution for
      peritoneal and wound lavage to decrease the incidence of surgical site infection.

      Superoxidized solutions contain hypochlorous acid (HOCl) which has bactericidal properties.
      The reactive oxygen species that is produces damages cell wall membrane of unicellular
      organisms, however remains safe when in contact with human or animal tissue. It is commonly
      used for topical treatment of wounds.
