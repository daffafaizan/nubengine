    
      Patients with Irritable Bowel Syndrome entering a group hypnotherapy program are asked to
      complete a series of questionnaires at the outset, and repeat a symptom severity scale at
      intervals over the one year period after termination of treatment. Eligibility was limited to
      patients with age greater than 20.

      Outcome measures were improvement in symptom score. Outcome predictors studied included
      quality of relationships, measured with a Quality of Relationship Inventory and attribution
      of IBS to physical or emotional cause, measured with a Mind-Body IBS Questionnaire, both
      administered before onset of hypnotherapy.
