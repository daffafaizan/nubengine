      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicities of cisplatin when
      delivered selectively by isolated lung suffusion to patients with any biopsy or cytologically
      proven resectable or unresectable primary or secondary malignancy in the lung.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess lung tissue levels of cisplatin after isolated lung suffusion as a function of
      the dose delivered.

      II. To evaluate systemic and pulmonary artery concentrations of cisplatin during isolated
      lung suffusion.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive cisplatin intra-arterially via isolated lung suffusion over 2 hours.
      Beginning approximately 2 weeks later (6-8 weeks if indicated for patients with sarcoma
      undergoing surgery after cisplatin), patients receive standard chemotherapy regimen.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 90 days.
