      any adverse outcomes associated with immediate weight bearing as compared to non-weight
      bearing following first MTP joint fusion. The primary outcome measures will look at patient
      reported outcomes of pain and function. The secondary outcome measures will be the difference
      in the incidence of non-union, as well as adverse events/complications (malunion, wound
      complications, hardware complications, infection, stress fracture).
