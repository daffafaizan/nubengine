      nonunion, and infection. Preventing infection through meticulous irrigation and debridement
      is an important goal in management, and different lavage fluids and irrigation techniques
      (e.g. high or low pressure lavage) have been described for this purpose. There are, however,
      a limited number of randomized trials comparing irrigating solutions or irrigating technique.
      We compared the use of castile soap versus normal saline, as well as high versus low pressure
      pulsatile lavage on the rates of reoperations and complications in patients with open
      fracture wounds.
