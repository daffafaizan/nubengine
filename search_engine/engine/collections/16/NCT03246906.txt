      I. Compare chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD)-free and relapse-free survival (CRFS)
      after transplant between the 2 GVHD prophylaxis regimens.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Compare rates of acute (grades II-IV and III-IV) and moderate and severe chronic GVHD
      (based on National Institutes of Health [NIH] consensus criteria), relapse, non-relapse
      mortality, progression or relapse-free survival, and overall survival between the 2 regimens.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) at day 0.
      Patients with an HLA-matched unrelated donor receive mycophenolate mofetil orally (PO) on
      days 0 to 40, cyclosporine PO every 12 hours twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 96 then tapered
      to day 150, and sirolimus PO once daily (QD) on days -3 to day 150 then tapered to day 180.
      Patients with an HLA-mismatched donor receive mycophenolate mofetil PO on days 0-100 then
      tapered to day 150, cyclosporine PO BID on days -3 to 150 then tapered to day 180, and
      sirolimus PO QD on days -3 to 180 then tapered to day 365.

      ARM II: Patients undergo HCT at day 0. Patients with an HLA-matched unrelated donor receive
      cyclosporine PO BID on days 5-96 then tapered to day 150, sirolimus PO QD on days 5-150 then
      tapered to day 180, and cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) on days 3 and 4. Patients with an
      HLA-mismatched donor receive cyclosporine PO BID on days 5-150 then tapered to day 180,
      sirolimus PO QD on days 5-180 then tapered to day 365, and cyclophosphamide IV on days 3 and
      4.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 months and every year
      thereafter.
