      represents the principal cause of symptoms which negatively influence quality of life (QoL).
      Moreover anemia has been associated with increased cardiac disease which, in older patients,
      may aggravate pre-existing conditions such as congestive heart failure. Patients with MDS
      often require red blood cell transfusions that further deteriorate patients' perception of
      well-being. This is an 18-month prospective observational investigation about the Quality of
      Life in Myelodysplastic patients with the aim to evaluate the correlation between hemoglobin
      (Hb) value and QoL and to compare the MDS patient's self-assessed QoL per physician's
      assessment. One hundred and fifty consecutive MDS patients at diagnosis and at least one with
      cytopenia - low level of hemoglobin or low level of neutrophils (a type of white blood cells
      that fights against infection) or low level of platelets (irregularly shaped cells found in
      blood that help prevent bleeding) - will be included in the evaluation. Demographic and
      disease-specific data will be collected and QoL will be evaluated by a specific questionnaire
      named QoL-E which will be completed both by patients and respective physicians. Study visits
      will be performed monthly until week 12; the subsequent visits will be performed at 6, 12 and
      18 months. No Serious Adverse Event will be collected during the study, only adverse reaction
      to any Janssen-Cilag drug should be reported. This information may be important to optimize
      treatment according to patients' preferences and expectations, to detect functional
      complications, as well as to improve communication between patients and caregivers.
      Observational study - No study drug was administered.
