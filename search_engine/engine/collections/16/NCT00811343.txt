      Principal outcome: Therapeutic impact of the use of new tests for diagnosis of LTBI in
      patients before anti TBF therapy

      Secondary outcomes :

        -  medico-economic impact of replacement of TST by QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests in LTBI
           screening in patients before anti TNF therapy.

        -  concordance of QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests results with TST

        -  Concordance between QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests and evaluation of indetermined tests.

        -  concordance of QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests results with patient disease.

        -  concordance of QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests results with TST in patients with LTBI
           determinated by clinical or radiological observation

        -  Impact of geographical, disease and treatment in patients with LTBI determinated by
           clinical or radiological observation

        -  Identify the original characteristic and maximal impact therapeutic of QFTB-G and
           T-SPOT.TB test

      Analysed criteria :

        -  therapeutic impact

        -  Patients percentage with different therapeutic outcome based on usual recommendations
           medico-economic

        -  Medico-economic impact :impact of both tests as early and late cost - efficacy

      Statistic :

        -  Primary criteria : Percentage of patients for whom therapeutic would have been changed
           by QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests results compared to usual diagnosis strategy.

        -  Secondary criteria : Concordance of QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests with TST Concordance
           between both QFTB-G and T-SPOT.TB tests .

           400 patients Timing : inclusions : 1 years
