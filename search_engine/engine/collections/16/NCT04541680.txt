      COVID-19 pneumonia, particularly in the most severe forms requiring hospitalization. Early
      thoracic HRCT is a useful tool for the evaluation of patients suspected of COVID-19
      pneumonia. Typical features are evocative of the disease in an epidemic context, with
      multifocal ground-glass opacities, being nodular or not, or crazy-paving with or without
      consolidations, with a bilateral, peripheral or mixed distribution and involvement of the
      posterior zones. CT manifestations of fibrosis or fibrous stripes are described in COVID-19.
      Pan et al observed fibrous stripes in 17% patients in the early phase of the disease. Ye et
      al observed bronchiectasis in 2 patients (15.4%) and evidence of pulmonary fibrosis in 3
      patients (23.7%) at HRCT performed at 4 weeks. Long term data are still lacking in patients
      with COVID-19 and the investigators do not know how many patients will have fibrotic sequelae
      from the acute illness.
