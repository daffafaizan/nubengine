      transplantation (HSCT). It often leads to an increased risk of life-threatening hemorrhage,
      frequent requirement of platelet transfusions and extended hospital stays, representing a
      challenging clinical problem. Current treatments for thrombocytopenia after HSCT, including
      thrombopoietin, interleukin-11, immunoglobulin, methylprednisolone and rituximab, are
      frequently unsatisfactory in platelet recovery. Therefore, it is urgent to explore an
      effective therapy to improve the outcomes of thrombocytopenia after HSCT. Thrombopoietin
      (TPO) is a cytokine that drives thrombopoiesis by stimulating the differentiation of stem
      cells into megakaryocytes and promoting megakaryocyte proliferation and polyploidization.
      Decitabine was approved for the treatment of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) as a DNA
      methylation inhibitors. Studies in vitro show that decitabine enhances platelet release and
      megakaryocyte maturation. Here, the investigators performed a prospective clinical trial, in
      order to investigate the safety and efficiency of rhTPO and decitabine in the treatment of
      thrombocytopenia following HSCT.
