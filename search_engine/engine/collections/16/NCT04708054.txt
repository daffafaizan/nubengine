    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy as defined by 1-year progression free survival.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine safety of this regimen as per National Cancer Institute (NCI) toxicity
      criteria.

      II. To determine time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment. III. To determine incidence of
      acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD).

      IV. To determine relapse incidence. V. To determine non-relapse mortality. VI. To determine
      overall survival. VII. To determine graft versus host disease-relapse free survival (GRFS).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive venetoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -22 to -3, busulfan
      intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days -20, -13, -6, -5, -4, and -3, and fludarabine
      phosphate (fludarabine) IV over 1 hour and cladribine IV over 2 hours on days -6 to -3 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo stem cell
      transplantation over 1-2 hours on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 days, at engraftment, at
      1, 3, 6, and 12 months, then annually for up to 3 years.
