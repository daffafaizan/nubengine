      antibiotics in the medical or surgical ICU by open-label randomization of patients to
      approximately 20 g prebiotic fiber/day including 45% short-chain fructooligosaccharides
      versus 0 g fiber/day by providing one of two feeds. Per 10 ounces of feed, both the high and
      low fiber feeds contain identical micronutrients and have 296 kilocalorie (kCal), 19 g
      protein, 8 g fat, and 39 g carbohydrates. The sole difference is that the fiber-containing
      feed has 4 g fiber including 45% short-chain fructooligosaccharides per 10 ounces whereas the
      other feed has 0 g fiber. Randomization will take place at the time the order for enteral
      feeding is placed. Rather than supplying the feed itself, the investigators will supply a
      randomized recommendation for a feed type (i.e., high vs low fiber) and the feed will be
      obtained from the hospital pharmacy in the usual manner. Determination of the feed rate and
      duration will be decided on the individual patient's needs by the treating ICU team. The
      primary outcome will be to determine whether high fiber feeds alter the gut microbiome in the
      face of antibiotics and critical illness, calculated by comparing within-individual
      microbiome differences from baseline to Day 3 in each intervention group.
