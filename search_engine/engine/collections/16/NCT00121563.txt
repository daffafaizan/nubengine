      clinical study to evaluate the role of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)
      modulator, thalidomide, in acute inflammation and analgesia. The analgesic effect of
      thalidomide, a putative TNF-alpha modulator, will be evaluated using a model of tissue
      injury, the oral surgery model. Briefly, healthy males referred for third molar extraction
      will undergo the surgical extraction of third molars using standard surgical methods. At the
      completion of the surgical procedure, a microdialysis probe will be placed under the
      mucogingival flap previously elevated for the surgical procedure and subjects will be
      observed for pain over the course of six hours following surgery. Thalidomide or control will
      be administered one hour prior to surgery. Tissue levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and
      inflammatory mediators will be measured at time intervals postoperatively concomitant with
      pain measurements. Pain will be assessed postoperatively over the course of six hours.
      Demonstration of amelioration of pain is the primary outcome measure; changes in levels of
      tissue mediators will be taken as evidence of an acute anti-inflammatory effect of
      thalidomide. Based on our previous work with the fusion protein etanercept (TNFR:fc) which
      specifically binds TNF-alpha and prevents its interaction with cellular receptors, similar
      changes in the inflammatory cascade and clinical endpoints of inflammation may provide
      insight into the activity of thalidomide on acute inflammation and its clinical sequela,
      pain.
