      consuming bagels made with resistant starch daily for 8-weeks can reduce the risk of type 2
      diabetes and colon cancer in an adults who are at an increased risk for type 2 diabetes.
      Additionally, we will compare the satiating effect of these bagels to that of a standard
      bagel.
