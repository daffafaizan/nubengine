      anaesthesia; however, LMA use in infants is limited, as many anaesthesiologists prefer to use
      tracheal intubation in infants.

      In this study, the Supreme and ProSeal LMAs in infants were compared by measuring their
      performance characteristics, including insertion features, ventilation parameters, induced
      changes in hemodynamics and rates of postoperative complications.

      Infants of ASA physical status I who were scheduled for elective, minor, lower abdominal
      surgery were divided into two groups: the Supreme LMA group and the ProSeal LMA group. Heart
      rate (HR), oxygen saturation and end tidal carbon dioxide values were recorded both before
      and after LMA insertion, as well as both before and after extubation. After extubation,
      complications and adverse effects were noted.

      Demographics and surgical data were similar between the two groups. LMA insertion times for
      the ProSeal group were shorter, the leakage pressure for the ProSeal group was statistically
      higher. The ProSeal LMA is superior to the Supreme LMA for use in infants, due to its ease of
      insertion, high oropharyngeal leakage pressure and fewer induced changes in hemodynamics.
