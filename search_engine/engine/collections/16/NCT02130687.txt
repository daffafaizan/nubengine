    
      The use of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4) inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes
      (T2DM) is growing rapidly. The majority of patients with T2DM are also taking ACE inhibitors
      or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in order to reduce cardiovascular and renal morbidity
      and mortality. DPP4 and ACE inhibitors share the common vasoactive substrate substance P.
      Substance P acts as a vasodilator but also activates the sympathetic nervous system.
      Understanding the interactive effects of DPP4 and ACE inhibitors on blood pressure and
      neurohumoral activation has important implications for the millions of patients with T2DM who
      take these drugs concurrently.
