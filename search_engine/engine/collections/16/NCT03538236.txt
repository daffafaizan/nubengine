    
      Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a growing and leading etiology of chronic liver
      disease worldwide resulting in substantial morbidity and mortality.

      Given recent data confirming weight loss as an effective treatment strategy for NASH and the
      recent availability of endoscopic bariatric therapies recently described by the American
      Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy (ASGE) and approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA), the investigators seek to primarily study efficacy of intragastric
      balloon for weight loss in obese patients having NASH. Secondary objective would be to assess
      whether the use of intragastric balloon combined with lifestyle intervention can improve
      liver histology in NASH with significant fibrosis over lifestyle intervention alone in a
      prospective paired study.
