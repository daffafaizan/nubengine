      changes in flight simulator performance near age 60, and 2) to assess whether there is an
      alternative model that can explain longitudinal flight simulator performance on the basis of
      measures of cognitive function and expertise. Such a model might be able to predict change in
      aviator performance better than what could be predicted by chronological age alone.
