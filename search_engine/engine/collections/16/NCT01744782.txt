      well it works to treat cystinosis) of a new drug called RP103.

      In cystinosis, the body builds up cystine. When taken regularly, the active ingredient of an
      older, already approved drug called Cystagon® (cysteamine bitartrate) reduces cystine in the
      body. RP103 has the same active ingredient as Cystagon® and is designed to reduce cystine in
      a similar way that Cystagon® does. RP103 is also different from Cystagon®: Instead of the
      cysteamine bitartrate being absorbed from the stomach, RP103 is designed to be absorbed from
      the small intestine. This may make the effects of the drug last longer, so that it can be
      taken twice a day instead of four times a day like Cystagon®.

      To decide if RP103 is effective, the study used two types of blood tests. One test is
      pharmacodynamics (PD), which measures the amount of white blood cell (WBC) cystine after
      taking study drug. WBC cystine is a laboratory test used to find out if cysteamine bitartrate
      is reducing cystine levels in the body. The second test is pharmacokinetics (PK), which
      measures the amount of cysteamine in the blood after taking the drug.
