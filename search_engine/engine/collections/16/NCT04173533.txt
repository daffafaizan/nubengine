    
      This is a prospective, two arm, double-blind, phase III clinical trial in adult patients with
      acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and myelodisplasia (MDS) who have undergone an allogeneic stem
      cell transplant (allo-SCT) and are randomised to receive oral azacitidine or placebo upon
      engraftment for up to 12 months as maintenance therapy. Patients will be stratified by type
      of transplant (myeloablative/reduced intensity, age (<60/â‰¥ 60 years) and donor type
      (sibling/unrelated)).
