      bronchoscopy and the diagnosis will affect the treatment strategy and prognosis. R-EBUS can
      be used for non-invasive diagnosis of PPLs, and the supplement pathological diagnosis results
      of EBUS-TBLB. During the procedure, target PPLs are examined by ultrasound host (EU-ME2,
      Olympus, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with Doppler function and ultrasound probe . The bronchoscope
      reaches the distal as far as possible according to the predetermined position on chest CT or
      positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) . The R-EBUS probe is inserted into
      the working channel of the bronchoscope, and gradually approaches the target PPL to obtain
      R-EBUS image. According to the characteristics such as within or adjacent to image, the probe
      scan the lesion from the near end to the far end and record the video. The recording time is
      required longer than 10 seconds. After selecting a typical R-EBUS image, freeze the image and
      take a screenshot. The long and short diameter of the lesion will be measured. This project
      includes three parts: preliminary construction and evaluation of R-EBUS image system for
      benign and malignant PPLs, construction of R-EBUS artificial intelligence prediction model
      and multi-center prospective validation of the prediction model. A total of 1000 patients
      will be enrolled to construct diagnostic model and 300 are enrolled to verify the diagnostic
      effiency.
