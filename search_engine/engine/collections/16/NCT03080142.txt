      surgery patients for perioperative pain control. This practice, however, is resource
      intensive, adds the risk of catheter-related complications, and adds increased burden to
      patients by requiring them to be tethered to 2 catheters.

      An alternative TAP can be performed using a single shot of liposomal bupivacaine (Exparel),
      an extended release local anesthetic that is FDA-approved for surgical plane infiltration
      including TAP blocks.

      With this prospective study, we seek to improve patient care at UC Davis and educate other
      institutions through the use of concrete data comparing these 2 treatment options.
