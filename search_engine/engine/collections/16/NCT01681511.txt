    
      This pilot study will be a prospective, single site, randomized clinical investigation
      comparing the safety and effectiveness of the ICET TIC antimicrobial Foley catheter, against
      the infection control standard-of-care, the BARD ® LUBRI-SIL® I.C. Foley catheter.

      Approximately 160 patients will be screened. The study has been designed to enroll
      approximately 120 eligible subjects to obtain about 60 evaluable subjects (30 in each arm).
      Subjects who meet the eligibility criteria will be enrolled into the study and randomly
      assigned to the experimental or standard-of-care group in a 1:1 ratio.
