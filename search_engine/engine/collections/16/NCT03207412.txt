      clinical manifestations of ovarian recession. Now, there is no exact and effective treatment
      to restore ovarian function. Human amniotic Epithelial cells (hAECs) are derived from human
      amniotic epithelium. hAECs retain the characteristics of embryonic stem cells, as well as a
      strong differentiation potential and plasticity. Experiments show that the fertility of mice
      is significantly improved after amniotic epithelial cells implantation. In order to further
      study the role of hAECs in POI treatment, this project will conduct minimally invasive
      implantation with hAECs in 20 cases of POI patients, and evaluate the changes of ovarian
      function and the safety of hAECs implantation. hAECs is prepared by Chongqing iCELL
      Biotechnology Co.,Ltd., which is a subsidiary of Shanghai iCELL Biotechnology Co.,Ltd.
