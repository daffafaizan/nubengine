    
      The purpose of the study is to examine the prevalence and outcome of sexual harassment within
      and outside sports, including who the perpetrators are, the association between experienced
      sexual harassment and psychological health, knowledge of report mechanisms and emergency
      plans, and the participants suggestions for preventive strategies. The knowledge from this
      study will be a good basis to establish and implement prevention strategies and educational
      programs in the future.

      Students, trainers (with more than 20 % employment status) and leaders at elite sport high
      schools and regular high schools in Norway will answer a questionnaire at two measurement
      points. Additionally, a sample of randomly selected students who report experiences with
      sexual harassment, and a random sample of trainers and leaders, will be invited to
      participate in an individual in-depth interview. Students scoring above cut-off on the
      questionnaire measuring symptoms of eating disorders (EDE-q) will be invited to a separate
      diagnostic interview (EDE).
