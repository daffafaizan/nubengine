      complete healing will be assessed after applying the study device, MedifoamⓇ or BetafoamⓇ,
      for 12 weeks to pressure ulcer patients. In addition, the pressure ulcer size reduction rate
      over 12 weeks will be evaluated.

      Patients will make once weekly site visits. There are 14 visits in total, including a
      screening visit 14 days (maximum) before the baseline visit.
