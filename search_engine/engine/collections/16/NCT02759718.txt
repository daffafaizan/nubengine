    
      An interventional, prospective, multi center pilot study to assess the clinical relevance of
      CgA levels in patients with PNET as performed in current clinical practice.

      There will be a measurement of CgA levels at baseline (preoperative measures after consent)
      and afterwards, in 3, 6, 12, and 24 months after resection. Immunoradiometric assay (IRMA,
      normal values: < 100 ng/mL) will be used.

      The collection of blood samples will proceed as detailed below:

      Extraction of samples for serum collection:

      7 ml of blood without anticoagulants will be allowed to sit for 30 min at room temperature
      before the serum is separated by centrifugation (3500 rpm). The serum will be stored at -20ÂºC

      Assessments: Baseline (preoperative measures after consent), 3,6, 12, and 24 months

      Clinical parameters: weight, height, performance status, vital signs including blood
      pressure, clinical signs and symptoms, survival data

      Blood biochemical parameters: Sodium, potassium, calcium, glucose, urea, creatinina,
      bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate transaminase (AST), and alanine transaminase
      (ALT).

      Computed tomography (CT) : preoperative condition, and 3,6,12,24 months after resection.
