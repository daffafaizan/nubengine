    
      This is a two-part, randomized (participants are assigned to treatment by chance),
      double-blind (participants and investigators do not know what study agent is being
      administered), placebo-controlled study. A placebo appears identical to a study agent, has no
      active ingredients, and helps investigators evaluate the effect of a study agent. In Part 1,
      following administration of CNTO 3157 or placebo, the severity of an upper respiratory tract
      infection, due to inoculation with HRV 16, will be assessed in healthy participants for
      safety reasons. In Part 2, following administration of CNTO 3157 or placebo and inoculation
      with HRV-16, efficacy and safety will be assessed in asthmatic participants using standard
      assessments to evaluate asthma treatments. The study (Parts 1 and 2) will be completed when
      the last participant completes the last visit (Week 11) in Part 2.
