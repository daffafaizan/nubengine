      whose birth mother consumed alcohol during pregnancy. The effects can include physical
      problems and/or difficulties with behavior and learning. When clinicians identify FASD early,
      intervention approaches can minimize the potential impact and lessen or even prevent
      disabilities. Thus, objective markers for prenatal alcohol exposure are desired.

      Using dried blood spots from the umbilical cord and a heel stick of newborns, this study will
      use Phosphatidylethanol (PEth), a novel biomarker for alcohol exposure, to identify and
      characterize infants' exposure to alcohol before birth. Additionally, the dried blood spots
      will used to validate the use of screening assays using epigenetic changes as markers for
      prenatal alcohol exposure. Epigenetic changes are heritable changes in DNA that affect DNA
      function but do not change DNA sequence. The use of PEth testing will allow for the
      correlation of prenatal alcohol exposure levels with epigenetic changes. Women will be
      consented prior to delivery for participation in this prospective study. The study will be
      conducted in collaboration with United States Drug Testing Laboratories, Inc. (USDTL).
