      I. To achieve an overall response rate of 15% or more.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine progression free survival. II. Determine overall survival. III. Evaluate
      toxicity profile of ABT 869 (linifanib) in this patient population.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive Linifanib orally (PO) once daily (QD). Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for
      2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 years.
