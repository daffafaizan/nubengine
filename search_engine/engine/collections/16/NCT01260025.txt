      underwent evaluation of vital signs including blood pressure, pulse, respiratory rate, and
      temperature before treatment, at intervals during infusion, and hourly for 6 hours after
      infusion. After infusion, patients underwent serial pharmacokinetic sampling. All patients
      were seen weekly during the study therapy and follow-up and underwent evaluation with
      physical examination including ECOG performance status, vital signs, and laboratory
      evaluation with complete blood count with manual differential, chemistry evaluation,
      prothrombin time/partial thromboplastin time, and urinalysis.
