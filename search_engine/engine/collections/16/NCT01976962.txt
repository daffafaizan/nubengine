      through stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), with an aim to improve tumour control and
      reduce or maintain normal tissue complications. The strategy will make use of the combined
      effectiveness of several functional imaging approaches to identify the dominant lesion(s)
      within the prostate. An SBRT treatment plan will be designed which utilizes 5 fractions to
      treat the entire prostate gland with an additional boost to the dominant lesion. The lower
      dose to the entire prostate should reduce normal tissue complications but still be effective
      in treating prostate cancer while the increased dose to the dominant lesion should improve
      tumour control. The use of only 5 fractions will reduce the number of patient visits, thus
      reducing overall treatment costs.
