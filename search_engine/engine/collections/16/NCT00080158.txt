      problem. Depression is the most common diagnosis for adolescent suicide attempts. Little is
      known about what treatment is best for these adolescents since they are usually excluded from
      participation in research studies.

      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive carefully monitored
      antidepressant medication with routine support and management, cognitive behavioral therapy
      (CBT), or a combination of antidepressant medication plus CBT.
