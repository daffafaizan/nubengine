      cardioprotective role of remote ischemic conditioning. Eleven male healthy volunteers are
      going to take oral beta-blocker (carvedilol, 12.5 mg once) or not before undergoing remote
      ischemic conditioning (consisting of 4 cycles of 5-min ischemia and subsequent 5-min
      reperfusion of upper arm), separated by 6-day wash-out period. To evaluate cardioprotective
      effect of remote ischemic conditioning, blood samples will be obtained before and after
      remote ischemic conditioning. Form the samples, human dialysate will be obtained and be
      perfused to rat heart through Langendorff apparatus before ischemia-reperfusion injury to the
      rat heart. Changes of infarct size of the rat heart will be compared between the beta-blocker
      and control groups.
