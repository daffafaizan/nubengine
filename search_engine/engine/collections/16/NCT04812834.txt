      increase in age and in patients with multiple chronic diseases and more complex health needs
      is observed.

      Frailty is known to impact patient health outcomes with medical and surgical procedures.
      Thus, frailty is correlated with a greater presence of delirium, longer stays, a greater
      requirement for complementary examinations, a greater presence of mortality and other
      post-surgical complications, more dependence, more risks derived from hospitalization, and a
      greater need for convalescence after discharge.
