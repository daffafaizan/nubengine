    
      This single-center open label study compares the outcomes of surgical repair of
      intratrochanteric fracture under general anesthetic or peripheral nerve blocks.

      Patients are high risk individuals scheduled for intratrochanteric fracture repair, with
      contraindications to spinal anesthesia. One group will receive general endotracheal
      anesthetic, the other femoral and lateral femoral cutaneous nerve with deep sedation.

      Mortality, morbidity (major cardiovascular incidents,delirium, pneumonia), pain scores and
      opioid consumption will be recorded.
