    
      Patients ages 50 to 80 who are identified through the electronic health record as not being
      up to date on colorectal cancer screening are eligible for the study and will be randomly
      assigned to the intervention or usual care group. Individuals in the intervention group will
      be mailed a letter informing them that they are due for colorectal cancer screening,
      educational material regarding colorectal cancer screening, a fecal occult blood testing
      (FOBT) kit, directions on how to use and return the FOBT kit. The proportion of patients
      assigned to the intervention versus usual care groups who complete a guideline recommended
      form of colorectal cancer screening within 4 months of the initiation of outreach will be
      compared.
