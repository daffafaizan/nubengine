      early septic shock. However, evidence have associated saline with hyperchloremia and
      secondary metabolic acidosis, and renal vasoconstriction, increased incidence of acute kidney
      injury (AKI) and mortality. The primary aim of this trial is to compare the effect of
      acetated ringer's solution with that of saline for therapy on the incidence and development
      of major adverse renal events among septic shock patients. The investigators hypothesize that
      use of acetated ringer's solution for resuscitation among septic shock patients will reduce
      the incidence of major adverse kidney events.
