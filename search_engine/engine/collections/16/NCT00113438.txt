    
      This is a phase II study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Combretastatin A4 Phosphate
      (CA4P) combined with carboplatin and paclitaxel. Treatment is for a maximum of 6 consecutive
      21-day cycles. Patients are randomized onto one of two CA4P dosing arms (45 or 63 mg/m2).
      CA4P is administered on days 1, 8 and 15 of each cycle. Carboplatin and paclitaxel (AUC 6 and
      200 mg/m2, respectively) are administered on day 2 of each cycle. At least 2 DCE-MRI scans
      will be performed to evaluate the change in tumor blood flow following treatment with CA4P.
