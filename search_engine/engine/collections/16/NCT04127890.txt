      Singapore has 12.8% of its population diagnosed with diabetes mellitus, of which more than 90
      percent are type 2 diabetes with underlying insulin resistance. With the aging population and
      increasing prevalence of obesity and sedentary lifestyles, the prevalence is expected to
      continue to rise.

      In vitro studies demonstrated that hypoxia creates a state of insulin resistance through HIF
      (Hypoxia Inducible Factor) transcription factor expression in adipocytes. Insulin sensitivity
      was shown to improve in type 2 diabetes patients and overweight non diabetic patients placed
      in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber.Increased water intake has been associated with lower HbA1c in
      the general population , and also with lower post-prandial glucose in type 2 diabetic
      individuals.

      This study aims to evaluate the effects of 1.5 L daily of ELO water, a drinking water
      enriched with molecular oxygen in a stable form, with a similar volume of bottled drinking
      water, on glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes in Singapore.
