    
      This is a single-center, randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance),
      double-blind (neither Investigator nor participant knows which treatment the participant
      receives), placebo controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is compared with a drug
      to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), study of a single-ascending
      dose of JNJ-54861911 in participants between 55 to 75 years of age. The duration of study
      will be approximately 2 to 6 weeks per participant. The study consists of 3 periods:
      Screening period (28 to 2 days prior to dose administration); Double-blind Treatment period
      (participants will receive either a single oral dose of JNJ-54861911 or placebo as tablets
      under fasted conditions); and a Follow-up visit period (7 to 14 days after dose
      administration). All the eligible participants will be assigned to any of following 3
      cohorts: Cohort A (single oral dose of JNJ-54861911, 25 milligram [mg] or placebo); Cohort B
      (single oral dose of JNJ-54861911, 50 mg or placebo); Cohort C (single oral dose of
      JNJ-54861911, 100 mg or placebo). Each cohort will include 8 participants. Participants in
      each cohort will be randomly assigned to receive either a single oral dose of JNJ-54861911 (n
      = 6) or placebo (n = 2). Blood samples will be collected pre-dose and over 96 hours (that is
      up to Day 5) after dosing for understanding the PK characteristics of JNJ-54861911.
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
