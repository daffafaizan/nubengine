      hepatocellular carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer with standard
      adjuvant treatment are enrolled. This is a prospective exploratory trial. Patients' tumor
      tissues are subsequent to whole exosome sequencing and possible neoantigens are identified.
      DC is in vitro primed with synthesized peptides. Both adverse events and responses are
      recorded.
