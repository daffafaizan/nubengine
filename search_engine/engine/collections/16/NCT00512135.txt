      study. Approximately 880 participants who were to complete former studies in this program
      (370 participants from studies MRZ 60201-0520/1 (8) and MRZ 60201-0527/1 (8) as well as
      approximately 510 participants from studies MRZ 60201-0724/1 (10) and MRZ 60201-0741/1) (11)
      were expected to enroll in this study in 26 centers in the United States, Canada and Germany.
      Participants with moderate to severe glabellar frown lines at maximum frown who completed
      participation in one of these four "feeder" studies in the frown line program were eligible
      to participate in this repeated dose study. Each participant received a dose of 20 units
      incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin) intramuscular injection on Visit 1 (Day 0 of Cycle 1).
      Re-injections with 20 U NT 201 could be performed on Day 0 of a subsequent cycle for up to 8
      cycles (one cycle >= 85 days). Intervals between treatments were at least three months or 12
      weeks, i.e., >= 85 days. For a new treatment cycle to start, the participant had to request a
      re-injection. The investigator then had to assess if the glabellar frown lines had relapsed
      to 'moderate' or 'severe'. In this case, a new injection could be administered. The treatment
      duration per participant was 24 months and up to eight cycles for participants enrolled from
      studies MRZ 60201-0520/1 and MRZ 60201-0527/1 and 6 months and up to two cycles for
      participants enrolled from studies MRZ 60201-0724/1 and MRZ 60201-0741/1, respectively.
      Participants enrolled from studies MRZ 60201-0520/1 and MRZ 60201-0527/1 participated at
      least one year in the study whereas participants enrolled from studies MRZ 60201-0724/1 and
      MRZ 60201-0741/1 participated for six months and up to two cycles.
