      groups: 3 groups of 50 subjects receiving the adjuvanted candidate vaccine, at 3 different
      doses and 3 groups of 10 subjects receiving the non-adjuvanted candidate vaccine in water for
      injection, at 3 different doses. The vaccination schedule will be 0-1 month. Blood samples
      will be collected at 8 visits. The duration of the study will be approximately 14 months for
      each subject. Rationale for Protocol Posting Amendment: The third vaccination will be
      cancelled and the visit at Month 7 will be postponed to Month 9. The Protocol Posting has
      also been updated in order to comply with the FDA Amendment Act, Sep 2007.
