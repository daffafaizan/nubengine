      surgery at one institution. Each shoulder was prepared with one of three randomly selected
      solutions: ChloraPrep (2% chlorhexidine gluconate and 70% isopropyl alcohol), DuraPrep (0.7%
      iodophor and 74% isopropyl alcohol), or povidone-iodine scrub and paint (0.75% iodine scrub,
      1.0% iodine paint). Aerobic and anaerobic cultures were taken prior to skin preparation for
      the first twenty patients to determine the native bacteria around the shoulder and following
      skin preparation for all patients.
