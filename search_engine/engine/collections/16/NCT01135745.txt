    
      OCD is an anxiety disorder characterized by intrusive thoughts or images (obsessions), which
      increase anxiety, commonly accompanied by repetitive or ritualistic actions (compulsions),
      which decrease anxiety. The most frequent symptoms are contamination concerns with consequent
      washing or concerns about harm to self or others with consequent checking.

      Although many OCD patients benefit from pharmacotherapy or CBT, between 7% and 10% of OCD
      patients fail to benefit from these standard treatments and may be considered
      treatment-resistant with a chronic deteriorating course. The most severely afflicted and
      disabled of these patients may be indicated for neurosurgical treatments, often considered as
      a therapy of last resort.

      Neurosurgical procedures currently used in the treatment of severe, treatment-resistant OCD
      include anterior cingulotomy, subcaudate tractotomy, limbic leucotomy (which is a combination
      of the first two procedures) and anterior capsulotomy. The commonality between the different
      neurosurgical procedures is the irreversible lesioning of bilateral neuroanatomical
      structures and/or interconnecting pathways that are believed to be involved in the control of
      affect and limbic function.

      An alternative neurosurgical treatment option to the standard lesioning procedures is
      ReclaimÂ® Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) Therapy for OCD, which received CE mark in July 2009.
