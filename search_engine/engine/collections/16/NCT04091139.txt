      consists of 8 modules, and the parent program consists of 3 modules. Similar to the work by
      Ehrenreich and Barlow, a flexible modular approach would be adopted, when extra sessions
      would be arranged to cater for individual treatment needs and heterogeneity of symptom
      severity. The whole treatment comprised of 10 to 12 individual sessions for the adolescents,
      and 4 to 6 sessions for parents or guardian. The total duration would be around 3 months.
      Each treatment sessions would be around 1 hour.
