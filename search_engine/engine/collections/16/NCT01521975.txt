    
      This study is an open-label, multicenter, PCR response adaptive clinical study design, with
      intensification of treatment (addition of adefovir to telbivudine treatment) depending on HBV
      DNA level at week 24. All patients commence with Telbivudine 600mg daily. At week 24 they
      will be divided into 2 Groups according to virological response. Patients with PCR detectable
      HBV DNA will add on ADV(Group I). Patients with PCR undetectable HBV DNA(Group II)will
      continue telbivudine monotherapy. ADV will not be added on unless viral breakthrough occurs.
