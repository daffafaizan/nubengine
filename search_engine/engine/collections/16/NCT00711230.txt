    
      Patients were randomized into one of the following 6 arms:

        -  Arm 1: Low dose DermaVir (0.2 mg DNA in 2 DermaPrep patches, n=9)

        -  Arm 2: Low dose Placebo (2 DermaPrep patches, n=3)

        -  Arm 3: Medium dose DermaVir (0.4 mg DNA in 4 DermaPrep patches, n=9)

        -  Arm 4: Medium dose Placebo (4 DermaPrep patches, n=3)

        -  Arm 5: High dose DermaVir (0.8 mg DNA in 8 DermaPrep patches, n=9)

        -  Arm 6: High dose Placebo (8 DermaPrep patches, n=3) DermaPrep Patch size: 80 cm2.
           DermaVir Standard Unit per patch is 0.1 mg DNA = 0.8 mL of DermaVir nanomedicine.

      The patch sites for immunization are preferably the left or right upper back and left or
      right upper ventral thigh. The same skin sites should be used for all immunizations.

      Immunization schedule (Days): 0, 42, 84, and 126.

      The total DermaVir dose:

        -  Low dose: 0.8 mg DNA

        -  Medium dose: 1.6 mg DNA

        -  High Dose: 3.2 mg DNA

      DermaVir immunizations were administered over an 18-week period Primary endpoint: 24 weeks
      Safety follow up: 234 weeks
