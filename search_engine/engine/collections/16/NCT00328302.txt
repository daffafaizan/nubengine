      perform a second biopsy. During the follow-up 10 patients developed complications i.e.
      hypertension or microalbuminuria. 7 of the patients got treatment during follow up and 3
      started the treatment after the second biopsy. 19 patients with two kidney biopsies were
      still normoalbuminuric and normotensive. 13 of them entered the double-blind treatment study
      of Atacand or Placebo. 6 denied to participate in the treatment study.

      The treatment study will continue for 5 years and will end with a third kidney biopsy. Also
      the rest of the patients that have done 2 kidney biopsies will be asked to perform a third
      biopsy.
