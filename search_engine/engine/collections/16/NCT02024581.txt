      efficacy trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of VIR003 treatment regimen when
      administered to pediatric subjects with molluscum contagiosum.

      Once subject eligibility is confirmed the subject will start the Treatment Period of the
      study. All subjects will receive active treatment or placebo with the first dose applied at
      the Day 0 Study Visit. Subjects will be instructed on how to apply the study medication twice
      a day for 90 days of treatment. Subjects will return to the clinic on Study Days, 7, 14, 30,
      45, 60 and 90 for routine evaluations and then on Study Day 97 for the Final Study Visit.

      Safety will be assessed by evaluating adverse events (AEs) with respect to severity,
      duration, and relationship to study drug. In addition tolerability evaluations will be
      performed at each study visit.

      The preliminary efficacy evaluation for the study will be the resolution of molluscum
      contagiosum lesions at Study Day 90 in evaluable subjects.
