      speech perception and speech production, in that what one can perceive, one can produce.
      Hearing loss disrupts this link and while cochlear implants make a significant difference in
      perception of sound, adults who are deaf and receive a cochlear implant (CI) do not gain the
      same perceptual benefits as children who are deaf and are implanted at a young age. Thus, the
      speech production of the adult CI user is reported to be less intelligible. The purpose of
      this proposed study is to examine the benefits of using electropalatography (EPG) during
      speech therapy with adult individuals who are either congenitally deaf or adventitiously deaf
      and use a cochlear implant. The investigators have proposed to study 10 CI users (5 in each
      etiological group) who will undergo speech intelligibility testing, and receive speech
      therapy (1x/week for 10 weeks) using EPG that provides both visual (biofeedback) and auditory
      feedback. It is hypothesized that the biofeedback in addition to the auditory feedback from
      the CI will result in an increase in articulation skills and thus the speech intelligibility
      in these individuals will improve significantly.
