      individuals, although about one third of patients are less than 60 years of age at diagnosis.

      CLL is a heterogeneous disease characterised by a surprisingly diverse clinical course with
      patients that may have an overall survival time ranging from months to decades.

      CLL accounts for approximately 7000 new cases and 4500 deaths per year in the US.

      Chemotherapeutic treatment of CLL is largely ineffective and despite new emerging therapies,
      CLL still remains an incurable disease.

      ITF 2357 is a novel and proprietary molecule synthesized by Italfarmaco S.p.A. Research
      Laboratories, provided with an established and powerful HDAC-inhibitory activity (see below
      for further details). It is being developend for a range of possible clinical applications
      both in oncohaematological conditions and in chronic inflammatory diseases. The former
      application is consistent with the well known antitumor pharmacological properties of
      HDAC-inhibitors as a family (i.e. cell-cycle arrest, pro-apoptotic and cell-differentiating
      effects); the latter application (chronic inflammation) is based of the demonstrated
      anticytokine effect of ITF 2357.
