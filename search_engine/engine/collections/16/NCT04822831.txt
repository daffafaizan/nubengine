      increased by nearly 20 billion in 15 years. However, the high cost shows the high morbidity
      rate, high mortality rate and low ventilator weaning rate of prolonged mechanical ventilation
      patients, so it is worthwhile to explore how to improve the respiratory function and even
      their quality of life of patients in the respiratory care ward (RCW).

      OBJECTIVE: To investigate the improvement of respiratory function and the effect of
      respirator detachment in 45-degree semi-sitting and upper limb training, and to understand
      the correlation between this training activity and death risk.

      METHODS: This study used repeated experimental measurements and purpose sampling, and the
      investigators invited patients in the respiratory care ward (RCW) in northern Taiwan. They
      were randomly assigned to the experimental group and the control group. The experimental
      group was given 45 degree Semi-sitting 2hrs and upper-limb exercise training 10mins once a
      day. After 4 weeks, the investigators measure the respiratory parameters such as the maximum
      inspiratory pressure (MIP), the tidal volume (VT), the minute ventilation (MV), and the rapid
      shallow breathing index(RSBI) of these two groups, and used the generalized estimating
      equation (GEE) to compare with them.
