      pancreatic or peripancreatic mass. The choice of the needle depended upon the availability at
      the time of admission: 34 punctures were performed with a 20-gauge Procore®, and 34 with a
      22-gauge Acquire®. Histological material was studied in a blinded manner with respect to the
      needle, and cumulative length of tissue core biopsies per needle pass was determined. Intra
      and inter-observer variability of this criterion was then evaluated.
