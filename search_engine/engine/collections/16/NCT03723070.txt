      isolate pulmonary veins during an atrial fibrillation ablation procedure. Cryo is a
      scientifically proven energy source used to create a thermal injury during endocardial
      ablation. The investigational device uses current technology with minor design modifications
      and will be studied to validate similarities in the safety and performance parameters
      compared to literature.
