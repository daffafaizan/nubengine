      I. To determine the 2-year progression-free survival of asymptomatic, high-risk genomic
      chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) patients treated with ibrutinib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether concurrent administration of ibrutinib with 2 doses of the
      pneumococcal vaccine (pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate vaccine) does not negatively impact
      the immune response compared to those who receive the pneumococcal vaccination with
      sequential therapy.

      II. To determine the safety and toxicity associated with administering ibrutinib to
      asymptomatic, high-risk genomic CLL patients.

      III. To determine the response pattern (complete response [CR] minimal residual disease
      [MRD]-, CR, partial response [PR], PR with lymphocytosis, stable disease [SD]) in
      asymptomatic, genomic high-risk patients treated with ibrutinib.

      VI. To determine changes in the stress, anxiety and depressive symptoms, and related quality
      of life indicators from patients treated with ibrutinib.
