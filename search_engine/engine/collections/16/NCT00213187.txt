      less active than their peers, and consequently they often have poor physical fitness. This
      study follows up our pilot study, in which we showed that exercise training can be safely
      carried out in children who have arthritis.

      We plan to randomly assign 80 children with arthritis to one of two groups. The experimental
      group undergoes a vigorous exercise training program consisting of twelve weekly supervised
      sessions as well as twice weekly at home sessions using an exercise video. The control group
      also has twelve supervised sessions and two home sessions. However, their exercises are
      non-strenuous, based on Qi gong. All children have comprehensive fitness testing before and
      after the training at the exercise lab at the Hospital for Sick Children.

      If we show that fitness exercise leads to improved motor function and improved ability to
      carry out activities of daily living, then we will change the way in which we provide therapy
      for childhood arthritis. We hope that this study will lead to an improved quality of life for
      children with arthritis.
