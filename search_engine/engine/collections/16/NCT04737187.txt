    
      This is an international, open-label, controlled two-arm, randomised phase III study
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of trifluridine/tipiracil in combination with bevacizumab
      versus trifluridine/tipiracil monotherapy in patients with refractory mCRC. The analysis will
      be done after 331 events are reported. In order to observe this number of events, 490
      patients will be randomised (1:1) to receive trifluridine/tipiracil in combination with
      bevacizumab (experimental arm) or trifluridine/tipiracil monotherapy (control arm).
