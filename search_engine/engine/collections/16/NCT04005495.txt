      establishing healthful habits and behaviors. The self-care program combines didactic
      information with experiential learning in nutrition, culinary arts, exercise, yoga, and
      mindfulness. The aim of the project is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptance of teaching
      kitchen program as a worksite wellness program at Emory University. Changes in biomarkers and
      self-reported behaviors will be evaluated up to one year.
