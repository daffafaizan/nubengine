      strategy to manage weight for obesity, as compared to the DPP program. During the 24-week
      active intervention phase, participants will be randomized to one of two treatments: 1) APP,
      wherein participants receive calorie, fat, and physical activity goals via a Smartphone
      application for self-monitoring, online educational readings, and biweekly sessions with a
      Health Promotionist; or 2) DPP, wherein participants are guided to self-monitor their
      physical activity, food intake, and weight via a participant log, and are guided through 16
      sessions by a Health Promotionist. Assessments to track progress will occur remotely at the
      3-month, 6-month, and 12-month time points of the program.
