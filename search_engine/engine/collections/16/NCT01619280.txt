      with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that are not attributed to left atrial hypertension. ALI
      is responsible for significant mortality and morbidity in the critically ill population.

      Novel rescue therapies used to support oxygenation in severe ALI include inhaled nitric oxide
      and high frequency oscillatory ventilation; however, neither have been shown to reduce
      mortality and both are limited by logistical and financial challenges.

      Inhaled sodium nitroprusside (iSNP) is a vasodilator which causes local vasodilation of
      pulmonary capillaries surrounding functional alveoli, resulting in improved oxygenation by
      redistributing pulmonary blood flow to areas with better ventilation-perfusion ratios. As
      iSNP can be administered by a low-cost nebulizer and is relatively inexpensive compared to
      other novel rescue therapies, this modality may be an alternative therapy for patients with
      severe hypoxemia. Two pediatric studies support the use of iSNP in ALI; however, iSNP has not
      been studied in the adult ALI population. To determine whether iSNP can improve oxygenation
      in adult ALI, the maximum tolerable dose (MTD) must first be determined.

      Our study aims to determine the MTD of iSNP in adult ALI through an open-label,
      non-randomized, single centered, dose escalation study design, whereby subjects will receive
      iSNP for thirty minutes and have various physiologic variables recorded.
