    
      Study TAS-120-301 is an open-label, multinational, parallel 2-arm, randomized Phase 3 study
      evaluating the efficacy and safety of futibatinib versus gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy
      as first-line treatment of patients with advanced, metastatic, or recurrent unresectable iCCA
      harboring FGFR2 gene rearrangements. Eligible patients will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to
      the following study arms:

        -  Experimental Arm: Patients will receive futibatinib at an oral dose of 20 mg,
           administered daily (QD) on every day of a 21-day cycle.

        -  Control Arm: On Days 1 and 8 of a 21-day cycle, patients will receive:

             -  Cisplatin 25 mg/m2 in 1000 mL 0.9% saline by intravenous (I.V.) infusion over 1
                hour, followed by 500 mL 0.9% saline over 30 minutes; and

             -  Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 in 250-500 mL 0.9% saline by I.V. infusion over 30 minutes,
                beginning after completion of the cisplatin and saline infusions.

      Patients in the Experimental Arm may continue to receive continuous futibatinib until
      documentation of progressive disease (PD) per RECIST 1.1, or until other withdrawal criteria
      are met, whichever comes first. However, treatment may continue following PD per RECIST 1.1
      if the patient is clinically stable and is considered by the Investigator to be deriving
      continued clinical benefit from futibatinib.

      Patients in the Control Arm may receive gemcitabine-cisplatin chemotherapy for up to 8 cycles
      or until PD or other withdrawal criteria are met, whichever comes first. Patients who
      discontinue gemcitabine-cisplatin due to documented disease progression (by ICR) may receive
      treatment with futibatinib ("crossover"), if medically appropriate in the opinion of the
      Investigator and if criteria for futibatinib treatment are met.
