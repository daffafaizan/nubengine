      single injection of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the 2K scale. Pharmacokinetic Assessment 2
      (PK2): PK assessments are made following a single injection of rFVIIIFc manufactured at the
      15K scale where participants are randomized to the 1000 IU vial or 6000 IU/vial strengths.
      Pharmacokinetic Assessment 3 (PK3): PK assessments are made following 13 weeks of rFVIIIFc
      treatment manufactured at the 15K scale where participants are randomized to the 1000 IU vial
      or 6000 IU/vial strengths. After study completion, in countries where rFVIIIFc is not
      commercially available, eligible participants will be offered enrollment into a long-term
      safety and efficacy extension study (8HA01EXT [NCT01454739]).
