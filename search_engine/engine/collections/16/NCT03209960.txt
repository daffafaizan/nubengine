      development of a simple physical examination guide for primary care providers/clinicians.
      This guide will assist in the identification of patients who would benefit from being
      referred to a movement disorders neurologist for spasticity evaluation and subsequent
      treatment. The examination tool will be tested for bedside implementation in all consenting
      participants residing in Tennessee State Veteran's Home, which is a long-term care facility
      in Murfreesboro, TN. Each of the 140 residents will receive one neurological examination and
      two physical examinations guided by the referral tool. A medical record review will also be
      performed.
