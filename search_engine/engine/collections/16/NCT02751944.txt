      intensely or for too long a period. This discomfort is often realized as either pain or
      stiffness in the joint that was the focus of the exercise. For example, one's knees will hurt
      after jogging for several miles, particularly if jogging for the first time. This study is
      intended to evaluate whether NEMÂ® brand eggshell membrane can alleviate joint pain or
      stiffness, either directly following exercise or 12 hours post-exercise versus placebo. The
      study will also evaluate NEM's effect, if any, on cartilage turnover via the cartilage
      degradation biomarker c-terminal cross-linked telopeptide of type II collagen (CTX-II).
      Participants will perform a minimum of 50 steps per leg utilizing an aerobics step at the
      clinical site. They will follow this exercise regimen on alternating days for 2 weeks.
      Changes in pain & stiffness (immediate & 12-hour) will be compared to both baseline and to
      the placebo group. Blood & Urine samples will also be collected at baseline and at the end of
      Week 1 & Week 2. The change in CTX-II will be compared to baseline.
