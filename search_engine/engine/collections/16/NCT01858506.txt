    
      Aim: To evaluate a culturally-adapted method of lifestyle assessment, counseling, and
      education among Arab people with diabetes who have varying literacy skills using an
      interactive computerized tool and graphically-enhanced patient logs for dietary and physical
      activity. The investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of this method for: a) increasing
      patients' knowledge and understanding of the role of lifestyle (diet and physical activity)
      in diabetes management; b) improving patients' engagement in monitoring dietary intake and
      physical activity; c) improving dietary and physical activity behaviors and self-blood
      glucose monitoring (SBGM) practices; d) improving glycaemic control; and, e) improving the
      efficiency of lifestyle assessment, education and counseling while increasing patients'
      engagement in the process.
