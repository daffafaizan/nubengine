    
      This is a multi center registry of sarcoidosis associated pulmonary hypertension (SAPH). With
      this registry, the investigators will characterize the demographics, clinical course,
      hemodynamics, pulmonary physiology, and disease management of sarcoidosis associated
      pulmonary hypertension on the United States. The investigators will also compare these
      features to non-US sites.
