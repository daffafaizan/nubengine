      inter-related. We have completed a series of studies in marijuana smokers showing that a
      clinically-utilized dose of naltrexone (50 mg) enhanced the reinforcing and subjective
      effects of orally-administered tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), while a low naltrexone dose (12
      mg) blunted the effects of THC. A better understanding of the effects of a range of
      naltrexone doses in combination with smoked marijuana has important implications for the
      following reasons: (1) Alcohol- and opioid-dependent patients receive high doses of
      naltrexone (50-150 mg), which may increase the abuse liability of marijuana, (2) Low-dose
      naltrexone blunts THC's intoxicating effects, suggesting potential utility as a treatment
      medication for marijuana dependence. This study will determine if naltrexone (0, 12, 25, 50,
      100 mg) administration 45 min prior to marijuana administration (0, 3.27% THC) alters
      marijuana's subjective, cognitive or physiological effects. Marijuana smokers will spend
      approximately 5h/day for a total of 10 days in the outpatient laboratory. Participants will
      visit the outpatient laboratory 2-3 times per week, with a minimum 48-hr interval between
      sessions to allow for naltrexone clearance. These data will provide important information
      regarding the clinical use of naltrexone.
