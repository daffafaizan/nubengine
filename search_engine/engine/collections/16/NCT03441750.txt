      surveillance in China. Prediabetes is an important risk factor for developing overt Diabetes
      and macro/micro vascular diseases. Pharmaceutical medications such as metformin had been
      proved effective in preventing Diabetes. Local studies are in need to guide the clinicians in
      their daily practice to prevent Diabetes in China. Therefore, China Diabetes Prevention
      Program（China DPP）is designed and conducted to compare the efficacy of metformin combined
      with lifestyle intervention versus lifestyle intervention alone in preventing Diabetes.
