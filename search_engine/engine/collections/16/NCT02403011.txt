      congenital muscular torticollis and deformational plagiocephaly.

      Design: A Randomized controlled trial design Setting: University research department
      Participants:Babies with congenital muscular torticollis, aged between 0-6 months, who had a
      head tilt from 5 to 20 degrees and no other health problems were the participants of the
      study. The study included two groups; home program group was seen once every six weeks, the
      study group in addition to the home program also received soft tissue mobilization three
      times in a week. All groups received a baseline home program consisting of positioning,
      handling strategies plus stretching, stretching and strengthening exercises, environmental
      adaptations and classical massage. Babies were allocated to two groups by sealed envelope
      randomization. Babies were evaluated initially, at sixth weeks, at 12 weeks and follow-up at
      18 weeks with muscle function scale, head tilt and ear shift assessments which included
      photographing method, neck normal range of motions (lateral flexion and rotation) and
      plagiocephaly severity scale
