      good quality oocytes, in order to select and transfer embryos with the highest possible
      implantation potential thereby optimizing the chance of a pregnancy and ultimately a live
      birth. This is done by applying an individualized controlled ovarian stimulation (iCOS)
      protocol, primarily based on ovarian reserve markers like antral follicle count (AFC) and
      Anti-MuÌˆllerian hormone (AMH), when deciding the follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)
      stimulation dose. Certain patients, the so called "poor ovarian responders' (PORs), pose a
      clinical challenge because they have a poor ovarian reserve and develop a limited number of
      pre-ovulatory follicles in respond to ovarian stimulation despite high FSH stimulation doses,
      thus experiencing reduced live birth rates.

      The aim of the present study is to examine the possible effects of long-term LH activity by
      the administration of hCG for eight weeks in between two identical IVF/ICSI cycles and
      compare cycle characteristics and outcome. The primary outcome is the follicular output rate
      (FORT) which reflects the proportion of antral follicles at the start of controlled ovarian
      stimulation that reaches the pre-ovulatory state. Secondary outcomes include amongst others
      AMH and antral follicle count at baseline (cd 2-3), number of pre-ovulatory follicles,
      oocytes retrieved, and embryos developed.

      We hypothesize that eight weeks of androgen priming by hCG increases the proportion of antral
      follicles that reaches the pre-ovulatory state during controlled ovarian stimulation for
      IVF/ICSI in women with poor ovarian reserve.
