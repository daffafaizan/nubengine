      compared to normal weight individuals congruent with diet induced obese rodent models and
      similar to models of addiction. Lower DRD2 levels are associated with addiction and a
      decreased sense of pleasure. Excessive weight gain also contributes to the onset of impaired
      insulin signaling (insulin resistance). In the brain insulin regulates monoamines and has
      trophic effects. We propose that the previous reports of low DRD2 in individuals with obesity
      will be associated with the degree of insulin resistance. Using PET imaging, we aim to
      determine DRD2 binding potential (BP) in the striatum and hypothesize these measurements will
      be associated with insulin resistance and potentially other neuroendocrine hormone levels.
      Obese participants will be compared to lean, sex and age similar participants. We also aim to
      determine the effect of caloric restriction on DRD2 BP in obese subjects. We hypothesize the
      caloric restriction will improve insulin resistance and that changes in DRD2 binding will be
      associated with changes in insulin signaling.
