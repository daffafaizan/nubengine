      the United States. It is caused by damage to the blood vessels of the retina, which is the
      light-sensitive outer layer of the eye. Retinal blood vessels are often affected by the high
      blood sugar levels associated with diabetes. Older people have an increased risk of
      developing DR; however, DR is likely to occur earlier and be more severe in anyone who has
      poorly controlled diabetes. Almost everyone who has had diabetes for more than 30 years will
      eventually show signs of DR. Symptoms of DR include poor night vision, seeing spots in front
      of the eyes, blurred vision, and blindness. The ACCORD study is a study that is examining the
      effects of different treatments on cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes.
      Participants in the ACCORD study will receive one of eight different combinations of
      treatment, including blood sugar control, blood pressure control, and cholesterol-controlling
      medication. This study will enroll participants in the ACCORD study and will examine the
      effects of the study treatments on DR. The results from this study may be used to develop new
      treatments to help prevent diabetes-related blindness.

      Study visits will occur at baseline and Year 4. At each study visit, participants will have
      an eye exam and specialized fundus photographs taken of the back of the eye and retina.
