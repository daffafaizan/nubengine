      training using a brace for gait rehabilitation.

      Method The brace was developed with the aim of promoting better biomechanical alignment, as
      well as providing proprioceptive information in order to stimulate action in the knee's
      flexor muscle groups, thus facilitating the activation pattern contrary to what occurs during
      genu recurvatum. We conducted a quasi-experimental "before and after" study with twelve
      hemiparetic adult patients who had genu recurvatum in the gait. The plantar pressure peaks
      were compared at the various moments of the study.
