      is still valuable and can be used as a dietary fiber. The previous study demonstrated that
      dietary fiber containing cassava fiber was safe for consumption without any contamination of
      the cyanide and heavy metals. Moreover, the microbial contaminations were within the safety
      range. The toxicity study revealed that the LD50 of the cassava dietary fiber was more than 5
      g/kg body weight (BW) and NOAEL was 3 g/kg BW. The NOAEL was used to calculate the human
      equivalent dose for determining the effect of cassava dietary fiber in a clinical study.

      Cassava dietary fiber consists of water-insoluble fiber such as cellulose more than 50%. The
      previous study showed that insoluble fiber decreased the risk of type 2 diabetes and
      increased insulin release. Moreover, a high fiber diet also decreased the fasting glucose and
      HbA1C in type 2 diabetes volunteer. In addition, the effect of dietary fiber on the reduction
      of cholesterol was also reported. The previous study reported that the cassava dietary fiber
      could decrease the total cholesterol, triglyceride but increase high-density lipoprotein in a
      dyslipidemia rat model. Therefore, the cassava fiber might be the potential food supplement
      for the control of blood sugar and lipid profiles in human. However, less scientific data
      support the effect of cassava dietary fiber in human.
