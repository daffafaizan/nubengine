      oral valacyclovir pills to kill tumor cells and stimulate a cancer vaccine effect. The
      current protocol is designed to deliver multiple courses of GMCI in combination with standard
      of care chemoradiation and surgery to capitalize on the synergies with the different
      treatment modalities.

      This protocol includes two phases:

        -  Phase 1b - completed.

        -  The Phase 2 is a randomized study comparing a test group receiving GMCI added to
           chemoradiation and surgery to a control arm receiving chemoradiation followed by
           surgery. Participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to GMCI plus standard of care or
           standard of care alone. Both arms receive standard of care treatment and evaluations.
