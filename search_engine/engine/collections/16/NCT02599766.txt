    
      This study is designed as a controlled cross-over, within-subject trial with repeated
      measurement. The experimental condition is the standardised therapy session using therapy
      animals (AAT), while the control condition is the comparable "standard" therapy session
      without the presence of an animal.

      Over a period of six weeks, patients have four standardised therapy sessions per week, that
      alternate in a way that two sessions in two consecutive weeks are similar except for one is
      with the presence of animals and one without. In this way, data is collected over 24 therapy
      sessions (12 experimental, 12 control) for each patient.

      Each therapy session lasts 30 minutes with an additional 5 minutes before and 10 minutes
      after the session for filling in the questionnaires.

      The study takes place at REHAB Basel. Animal-assisted therapies will be held at the
      "Therapie-Tiergarten" at REHAB Basel in the presence of one or more animals that will be
      selected by the therapist and the patient together and with which the patient has a
      relationship.

      Patients who are willing to join the study will be selected and allocated randomly to start
      with either the experimental or the control condition.

      Participation in the study will be cancelled if a patient wishes to do so or if they choose
      to withdraw from the animal-assisted therapy program. Other criteria for withdrawal are if
      the patient is harmed by an animal or if the animals are abused by the patient.
