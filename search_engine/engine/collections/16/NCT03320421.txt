      Primary:

      To determine the toxicity with adjuvant hypofractionated whole breast radiation with
      simultaneous tumor bed boost (SIB) in women with early breast cancer after breast conserving
      surgery.

      Secondary:

      To determine the short term cosmetic and quality of life of the participants treated with
      this regimen.

      To determine the local control of the participants treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo adjuvant hypofractionated whole breast radiation with simultaneous
      tumor bed boost once daily a week for 3 weeks. Toxicity, quality of life and cosmetic result
      is assessed before radiation, at the end of the radiation, within 2, 4, 6 weeks after
      completion of radiotherapy, and then every 3 months for 1 ear.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 participants will be accrued for this study.
