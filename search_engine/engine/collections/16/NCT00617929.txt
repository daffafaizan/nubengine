    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine the rate of sustained donor engraftment at 42 days and survival at 100 days
           post transplantation in patients treated with anti-thymocyte globulin, clofarabine, and
           rituximab.

      Secondary

        -  To determine incidence of treatment-related mortality at day 100 post transplantation.

        -  To determine incidence of neutrophil recovery by day 42 post transplantation.

        -  To determine survival at day 100 and 1 year post transplantation.

        -  To determine the proportion of patients with chimerism at day 28 post transplantation.

        -  To determine incidence and severity of grades II-IV acute graft-vs-host disease by day
           100 post transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Conditioning regimen: Patients receive rituximab intravenously (IV) on day -7,
           anti-thymocyte globulin IV over 4-6 hours on days -6 to -4, and clofarabine IV over 1
           hour on days -4 to -2.

        -  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT): Patients undergo HSCT on day 0. Patients
           may receive umbilical cord blood, peripheral blood stem cells, or bone marrow from
           unrelated or related donors.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis: Patients receive oral cyclosporine twice daily
           or cyclosporine IV every 8 hours beginning on day -3 and continuing for 100 or 180 days
           post transplantation followed by a taper; mycophenolate mofetil IV every 8 hours
           beginning on day -3 and continuing for 30 days (or 7 days after engraftment with no
           evidence of GVHD); and filgrastim (G-CSF) IV once daily beginning on day 1 and
           continuing until blood counts recover.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed on days 100, 180, and 360.
