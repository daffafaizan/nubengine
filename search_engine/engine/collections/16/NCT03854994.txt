      antibody fragment (Scfv). This CAR has a CD8 hinge and transmembrane domains and a 4-1BB
      costimulatory domain; T cells expressing this CAR release relatively low levels of cytokines.
      Subjects with relapsed/refractory CD19-positive B-cell Lymphoma and B-ALL can participate if
      all eligibility criteria are met. Subjects receive chemotherapy prior to the infusion of
      KD-019 CAR-T cells. After the infusion, subjects will accept follow-up for side effects and
      effect of KD-019 CAR-T cells by the sponsor. Study procedures may be performed while
      hospitalized.
