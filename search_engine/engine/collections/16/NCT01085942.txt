      Clinical, sonographic and MRI reexamination of these subjects is performed after an interval
      of three years. Findings of interest include: (1) the symptomatic status of the subjects
      (still asymptomatic or symptomatic); (2)tear size on sonography and MRI (unchanged or
      increased); (3)degree of muscle atrophy on MRI (unchanged or deteriorated); (4)degree of
      fatty muscle degeneration on MRI (unchanged or deteriorated). We want to analyze whether a
      change in these tear characteristics is associated with a change of the symptomatic status of
      these subjects.
