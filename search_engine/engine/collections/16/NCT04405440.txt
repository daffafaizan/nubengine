      outcome. Fear of weight gain and diet restrictions are considered the core symptoms of AN.
      Although from a diagnostic perspective AN is conceptualized as an eating-related disorder
      connected to an extremely low Body Mass Index (BMI) and body image distortion, AN might
      represent a specific phenotype of anxiety disorders characterized by tenacious avoidance
      behaviors, especially the restrictive subtype. To date, avoidance in AN is often investigated
      as a general personality trait (e.g. harm avoidance) but poorly examined in its behavioral
      form (which is life-threatening, such as food-avoidance). Hence, the investigators will
      perform a systematic investigation of excessive avoidance behaviors within a laboratory
      setting. Within a learning perspective, the investigators will investigate excessive
      avoidance in a group of 30 AN patients and 30 healthy volunteers. To achieve this, a
      well-validated avoidance paradigm will be used. Most critically, the investigators will
      examine whether patients with a diagnosis of anorexia nervosa show persistent avoidance
      behaviors compared to a control group. Additionally, the investigators will examine if, in
      the anorexia group, higher subjective relief to successful omissions of negative events
      during avoidance learning predicts persistent (excessive) avoidance behaviors after fear
      extinction.
