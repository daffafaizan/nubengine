      increased intra-abdominal pressure for postural stability and continence. Expiration
      additionally produces automatic activation of the PF. No study to date has investigated the
      effects of forced expiration on PF displacement and squeeze pressure. The purpose of this
      study was to investigate the effects of variations in forced expiration effort on PF muscles'
      automatic activation.
