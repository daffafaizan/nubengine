      I. Determine the feasibility of adjuvant radiation in the management of high-risk disease.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Prospectively evaluate patterns of failure in high-risk bladder cancer patients after
      cystectomy and aggressive adjuvant therapy.

      II. Define surgical and histopathologic parameters predictive of local and distant outcomes
      (e.g. grade, lymphovascular space invasion [LVSI], extent of resection/lymph node dissection
      [LND]).

      III. Assess quality of life (QoL) outcomes after this treatment using a standardized
      questionnaires (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G], FACT-Bladder Cancer
      [BL], Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite [EPIC] Bowel and Urinary).

      OUTLINE:

      Within 24 weeks of surgical resection, patients undergo 3D conformal radiation therapy once
      daily 5 days per week for 28 fractions. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 3 months for
      2 years, every 6 months for 3-5 years, and then annually thereafter.
