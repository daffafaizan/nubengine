      unilateral (anodal or cathodal electrode over primary motor area) and bilateral tDCS (both
      anodal and cathodal electrode over the cortex). Previous studies reported benefits of
      different tDCS montages on muscle performance in healthy participants. However, there is no
      guideline for tDCS montages. This study aims to investigate immediate effects of different
      tDCS montages on muscle strength in healthy participants.
