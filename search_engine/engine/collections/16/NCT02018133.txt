      receive either oral paricalcitol at 2 mcg daily for 2 weeks or placebo. After a washout
      period of 4 weeks, those subjects who received paricalcitol will receive placebo for 2 weeks
      and those who received placebo will receive paricalcitol for 2 weeks. A simple blood draw
      will be obtained from the patient on days 0, 1, and 14 of each treatment arm, and they will
      also be assessed for side effects at the end of each treatment.

      The blood obtained during these visits will be analyzed for any changes that may have
      occurred in the white blood cells (WBC) and/or plasma. These samples will be tested to see if
      there are any markers in the blood that changed after treatment with vitamin D. The samples
      collected will be temporarily stored in the research laboratory and subsequently sent to a
      separate laboratory (Genus Systems Company) in batches for analysis.
