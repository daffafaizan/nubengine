      The most effective strategy for reconstruction of gut microbiota should be fecal microbiota
      transplantation (FMT). This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and safety of FMT for
      epilepsy. Patients were diagnosed as epilepsy by electroencephalogram (EEG) and MRI and
      clinical data when the study began and thent received repeated FMT with fecal from healthy
      donors.Patients were required to stop antiepileptic drugs after FMT and the follow up last
      for 3 months.The primary outcome measure was the frequency of the seizures. Secondary outcome
      measure were the 50% response rate.
