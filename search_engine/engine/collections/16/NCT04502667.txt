      performed through RT-PCR. Upon admission to hospital, a serum determination of Vitamin D,
      interleukins, ferritin and dimer-D will be performed. Subsequently, randomization will be
      performed to identify which group the patient belongs to. In case of being in the vitamin D
      group, in children under 12 months they will be given 1000U and in children over 12 months
      they will be given 2000U every 24 hours orally. Adverse effects will be evaluated on a daily
      basis. Subsequently, serum levels of interleukin (IL) -2, 6, 7,10, ferritin and dimer-D will
      be taken on day 7 of admission. It will be recorded if the patient presents deterioration of
      the respiratory function that requires endotracheal intubation and / or admission to
      intensive care and / or if he dies, and at what time of hospitalization does this outcome
      occur. The study will culminate when the patient is discharged from hospitalization. On the
      day of hospital discharge, a blood sample will be taken to determine vitamin D.
