      MALT lymphomas. And the prevalence of H. pylori is increasing in some parts of the world.

      However, the eradication becomes increasingly difficult due to the growing antibiotic
      resistance. Bismuth-containing quadruple regimens are now recommended to serve as first-line
      therapies. Bismuth-clarithromycin-containing and bismuth-furazolidone-containing quadruple
      regimens are both in the list of the first regimens. And recent antimicrobial susceptibility
      tests showed us that the clarithromycin was increasingly resisted while furazolidone remained
      hardly resisted. The comparison between the effects of bismuth-clarithromycin-containing and
      bismuth-furazolidone-containing quadruple regimens is not so clear.
