      subjective effects of a range of CBD doses (0, 200, 400, or 800 mg, po). Volunteers will
      participate in 4 outpatient laboratory sessions over the course of 4 weeks during which the
      analgesic effects of CBD will be assessed using the Cold-Pressor Test (CPT), a laboratory
      model of pain which has predictive validity for the clinical use of analgesics. The order of
      CBD dose will be randomized across participants. Secondary measures will include subjective
      and physiologic effects of CBD.
