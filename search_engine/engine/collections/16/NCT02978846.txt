      I. To examine the perceptions of side effects and their subjective severity of patients
      treated with radiotherapy with and without concurrent chemotherapy at Los Angeles County
      (LAC) + University of Southern California (USC) Medical Center.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify the most troubling side effects of patients treated with radiotherapy with and
      without concurrent chemotherapy at LAC+USC Medical Center.

      II. To evaluate the impact of chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy, in regards to
      whether or not perceptions of side effects are altered by what cancer treatment is given.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients are shown two groups of cards on the last day of radiation treatment. Group A lists
      48 physical side effects and group B lists 27 psychosocial side effects. The cards are
      shuffled and patients view one card at a time and select the side effects they attribute to
      their current treatment. Patients rank the selected cards from each group by order of
      severity. The top 5 cards from each group are then shuffled together and patients rank the
      remaining 10 cards in order of severity.
