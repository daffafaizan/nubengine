      predicting aneurysm progression is nearly impossible and dissection and rupture also occur at
      diameters under 6 cm. The assessment of aortic hemodynamics and the presence of altered flow
      patterns, as well as distribution and changes in wall shear stress (WSS) and the oscillatory
      shear index (OSI), using 4D phase contrast cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) may
      provide further insights in how aneurysms develop and in assessing the risk of dissection.
      The purpose of this study was to investigate in patients with dilated ascending aorta the
      flow patterns and vessel wall parameters in order to correlate these hemodynamics factors
      with changes in aorta size.
