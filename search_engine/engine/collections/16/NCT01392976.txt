      several solid tumor types, including pancreatic cancer, NSCLC, and ovarian cancer.
      Unfortunately, many patients fail to derive benefit from this treatment. No clinical or
      molecular marker has been established to predict benefit from gemcitabine therapy, so
      patients are treated empirically until evidence of disease progression or worsening
      performance status.

      The potential for human equilibrative nucleoside transporter-1 (hENT1) expression to predict
      survival in gemcitabine-treated patients has been studied, and data suggest that patients
      with low levels of tumor cell hENT1 expression derive less benefit from gemcitabine treatment
      than patients with high levels of tumor cell hENT1 expression. Furthermore, the PK profiles
      of CO-1.01 and gemcitabine are different, and this may also favorably influence the in vivo
      antiproliferative effects of CO-1.01. These data support the hypothesis that patients
      expressing low levels of hENT1 will derive minimal benefit from gemcitabine, but will receive
      benefit from CO-1.01 (gemcitabine elaidate) which enters tumor cells in a hENT1-independent
      fashion.

      The formulation of CO-1.01 that is currently used in clinical studies contains 15 mg/mL of
      gemcitabine-5'-elaidate solubilized in purified phospholipids. Recently, Clovis Oncology
      developed a 30 mg/ml formulation which will be characterized in this study.
