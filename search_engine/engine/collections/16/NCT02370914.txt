      detection of concussions with the Jan Medical Device (JMD). The study will assess the ability
      of this device to demonstrate unique signals that correlate with concussions. The study will
      also test the athletes at baseline at rest and during exertion to determine if there is a
      difference in the signal from exertion alone. The JMD is a non-invasive band that is placed
      around the participants head. The JMD detects a unique pattern of signals based on
      displacement of the skull from changes in blood flow during individual heartbeats. The
      athletes will be tested longitudinally to assess to changes over time, in addition to changes
      after impact
