    
      This is a multi-center, cross-sectional study of women and girls with bleeding disorders
      receiving care at Hemophilia Treatment Centers (HTCs). To further characterize this
      population, WG who receive care at federally funded US HTCs will be approached regarding
      participation. Following assent and/or consent, participants will be asked to complete a
      series of forms. In order to assess their bleeding symptoms, they will complete the self-BAT
      (Bleeding Assessment Tool) as well as the Menstrual Bleeding Questionnaire (MBQ). In order to
      assess their quality of life, they will complete the PROMIS-29 quality of life inventories.
      Patients may be contacted if they miss a question on any of these forms. Phone call should
      take no more than 15 minutes. Study staff will complete an intake form which includes data
      regarding bleeding disorder diagnosis as well as treatment, using information obtained from
      the patient, chart review, and the ATHNdataset.
