      are receiving), multi-center (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study), single-arm study of fentanyl ITS. The study will consist of 2
      phases: screening phase and an open-label treatment phase. The duration of participation in
      the study for an individual participant will be 72 hours. All eligible participants (who
      require pain treatment with strong opioids [morphine like medications] for at least 48 hours
      after an elective spine or elective orthopedic surgery) will be treated with fentanyl ITS,
      delivering 40 microgram (mcg) fentanyl per on-demand dose, each deliver over 10 minutes for a
      maximum of 6 doses per hour (240 mcg per hour) for 24 hours or a maximum of 80 doses (3.2
      milligram). Participants will be analyzed for the use of intravenous (giving a medicine
      directly into a vein) access during postoperative pain treatment with fentanyl ITS.
      Participant's safety will be monitored.
