      cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). CF affects approximately 70,000
      children and adults worldwide (30,000 in the United States) and is the most common fatal
      genetic disease in persons of European descent. Despite progress in the treatment of CF with
      antibiotics and mucolytics, the predicted median age of survival for a person with CF is in
      the mid-30s. Though the disease affects multiple organs, most morbidity and mortality is
      caused by progressive loss of lung function.

      This is a Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose study of
      orally administered VX-809 and VX-770 in healthy subjects. The study will evaluate safety and
      tolerability of co-administration of VX-809 and VX-770 in healthy volunteers.

      Enrollment is planned for 24 subjects at 1 clinical site. Subjects will be randomized to
      receive study drug or placebo during three 14-day treatment periods separated by 14-day
      washout periods. In Treatment Period 1, subjects randomized to study drug will receive VX-809
      every 24 hours. In Treatment Period 2, subjects randomized to study drug will receive VX-770
      every 12 hours. In Treatment Period 3, subjects randomized to study drug will receive VX-809
      every 24 hours and VX-770 every 12 hours. Subjects randomized to placebo will receive placebo
      during all treatment periods.
