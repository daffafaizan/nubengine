      dose steroid. However, there is insufficient effect in about 20-30%. Bortezomib acts not only
      on plasma cells, but also T cells, B cells and dendritic cells. In addition, bortezomib is
      relatively safe drug compared to thymoglobulin which investigators use in the cases of
      steroid failure. Therefore, investigators administer bortezomib with steroid in one group,
      and compared the group with the other group in which conventional steroid treatment is done.
