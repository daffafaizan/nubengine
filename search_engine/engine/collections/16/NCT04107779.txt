      Delivery Systems (ENDS) have less toxicant exposure. This study will serve as a clinical
      evaluation of exclusive-use of selected JUUL ENDS in 2 different nicotine concentrations (5%,
      3%), with the purpose of gaining data to support the hypothesis that exclusive-use of JUUL
      ENDS over the course of 6 days will result in a significant reduction in toxicant exposure
      compared to combustible cigarettes.

      This will be a randomized, open label, parallel group study in adult smokers to be conducted
      at up to 5 sites in the United States. Changes in Biomarkers of Exposure (BoEs) from baseline
      when using four JUUL ENDS with 2 different nicotine concentrations (5%, 3%) relative to Usual
      Brand (UB) of combustible cigarettes and a study group abstaining from any tobacco/nicotine
      product use will be assessed in this study. JUUL ENDS will be used either exclusively or
      partially (dual-use), with subjects in the dual-use group using both JUUL 5% ENDS (choice of
      Virginia Tobacco (VT), Mint, Menthol or Mango flavors) and UB of combustible cigarettes.
