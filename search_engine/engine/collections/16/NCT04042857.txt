      weeks once approved for participation. Analysis will be attained via potassium hydroxide
      examination (KOH test), nail culture, PCR analysis, and photographic imaging. Subjects may
      have both hallux nails sampled at screening for culture and KOH testing if both hallux nails
      appear to meet the criteria for study inclusion. Only subjects with both a positive culture
      and KOH examination will start study treatment. Subjects may have repeat KOH and culture
      testing both performed if the first screening test results in at least one of the tests being
      negative. At investigator's discretion, other affected toenails besides the study target
      hallux nail may be treated but will not be included for analysis. Patients will come for
      in-clinic visits at screening, baseline/randomization visit/week 0, week 4, week 8, week 12,
      week 24, week 36, week 48, and week 52.

      If subjects achieve complete cure (as defined by mycological cure and 0% nail involvement)
      prior to Week 48, patients will be encouraged to continue in the trial with active treatment
      for the full protocol.
