      observational, multicenter (when more than one hospital or medical school team work on a
      medical research study) study to review medical records of adults with a diagnosis of
      Schizophrenia during the time period from 01 January 2009 through 31-December-2013 (only for
      Mexican population). Data will be collected from clinical practice. The medical records of
      participants will be screened and eligible participants data will be collected. The period of
      observation will span from 12 months before initial Long Acting Injectable (LAI) use and in
      12 months after the initial LAIs use. The rate of hospitalization will be primarily
      evaluated.
