    
      Frozen tumor samples from 140 node-negative, breast cancer patients aged between 29 and 70
      years at diagnosis are hybridized on MammaPrint array. Patients were treated with breast
      conserving therapy or mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection between December 1998
      and August 2001 at Osaka Medical Center for Cancer and Cardiovascular Diseases. Samples are
      evaluated by gene expression profiling for the 70-gene MammaPrint profile and classified as
      genomic high risk or genomic low risk.
