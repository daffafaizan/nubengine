    
      The study will be randomized, double blind, placebo and active control, a 3-way, 3-period
      crossover design, where each of the estimated 50 enrolled patients will receive alternately
      (i) NEO6860 (500 mg bid), (ii) placebo and (iii) Naproxen (500 mg bid). To ensure blinding,
      double dummy techniques will be used, so that at each period, patient will receive an oral
      liquid suspension (NEO6860 or its placebo) and one capsule (naproxen or its placebo).

      Following a screening period, a maximum of 28 days before dosing, subjects will be randomized
      to one of the scheduled sequences. At each dosing period, subjects will be requested to
      participate in 2 clinic visits:

        -  One residential visit, the morning of investigational product dosing. Subjects will stay
           in the Clinical Research Unit approximately 13 hours

        -  One end of period visit, 24 h after first dosing A total of 2 washout periods of 1 to 3
           weeks will separate the dosing periods. Once the 3 dosing periods will be completed, the
           subjects will come back to the clinic for a follow up visit (7 to 10 days post last
           dose).

      Note: for a subpopulation, at one site, an assessment of heat pain threshold and tolerance
      will be conducted requiring a residential period of approximately 24 hours.
