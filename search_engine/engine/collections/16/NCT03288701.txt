      Daily measurements of whole body water and body weight will be performed in each person until
      diuretic treatment is stopped or the patient is discharged from hospital, respectively.

      Primary endpoint is the correlation between reduction of whole body water (in kg) and
      reduction of body weight (in kg) in patients with decompensated heart failure receiving
      forced diuretic treatment (max. deviation +/- 1kg).
