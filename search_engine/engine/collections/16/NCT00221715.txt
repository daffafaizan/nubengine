      i.e. above knee femoro popliteal bypass. This bypass can be performed with either DACRON or
      PTFE prosthesis or with the autologous saphenous vein. The principle disadvantages of
      prosthesis are their prejudged worse permeability and the risk of infection. Too few reliable
      randomised, multicentric studies in this indication comparing vein bypasses versus prosthesis
      bypasses have been conducted to firmly confirm the first argument. Thus, the purpose of this
      multicentric, randomised, national study is to compare, 5 years after surgery, the
      permeability rate of above knee femoropopliteal bypass with vein versus prosthesis. Primary
      and secondary permeability, permeability predictive factors, and leg salvage rate will also
      be assessed. One hundred enrolled patients with II to IV level leg arteritis will randomly be
      assigned to one of the surgery groups : vein or prosthesis (50 each). The recruiting period
      will last 3 years and a half, and the follow up 5 years for each patient. The main primary
      outcome, bypass permeability, will be assessed through Doppler ultrasonography during five
      years. Secondary endpoints, mortality and morbidity, will be evaluated during the clinical
      follow up. Permeability predictive factors, primary and secondary permeability, leg salvage
      will also be recorded. If the permeability rates are equivalent between prosthesis and vein,
      the use of prosthesis will be preferred as this surgery is easier and faster, and as it is
      important that the vein remains available for distal revascularisation (where it is more
      efficient) and for revascularisation of coronary arteries
