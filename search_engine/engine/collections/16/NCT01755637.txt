      based granulation process to aqua based granulation process, State Food and Drug
      Administration officially requested Tianjin Smith Kline and French Laboratories to carry out
      a Bioequivalence study to demonstrate bioequivalence between the manufacturing processes.
      This trial will be conducted to support the official requirement via the comparison of the
      pharmacokinetic profiles between both the drugs manufactured under the different processes.

      After oral administration, Albendazole is quickly oxidized into its pharmacologically active
      metabolite, Albendazole sulphoxide (ABZ-SO. Due to extensive metabolism and limited
      absorption, plasma concentration of ABZ after oral administration was found to be too low to
      be measured. Thus, this trial will also compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of ABZ-SO
      manufactured using different solvents.
