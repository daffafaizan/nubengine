      sedation to general anesthesia. During sedation to EBUS increased duration of anesthesia and
      sedative dosing put patients at increased risk for hypoxic events. To avoid this, oxygen
      supplementation is mandatory. There are different techniques for oxygen supplementation
      during the procedure. At this study we will compare to nasal and buccal oxygen
      supplementations during EBUS.
