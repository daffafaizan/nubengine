      are not available. The investigators have discovered thioredoxin-interacting protein (TXNIP),
      as a promising target in this regard and have now found that the commonly used
      anti-hypertensive drug and calcium channel-blocker, verapamil, effectively lowers beta-cell
      TXNIP expression in rodent beta-cells and human islets, promotes beta-cell survival and
      rescues mice from T1D. This makes verapamil a potentially attractive drug for T1D, but
      prospective clinical data are lacking. The investigators primary objective is therefore to
      conduct a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study of the efficacy and safety of
      verapamil in adults with recent-onset T1D and to demonstrate that subjects on oral verapamil
      daily for 12 months will have improved insulin production (as an indirect measure of
      beta-cell mass).

      Results will have major translational implications with potential immediate impact on
      clinical care, encourage large clinical follow-up trials, evaluate markers of beta cell
      health and ultimately help develop a novel therapy that enhances the patient's own beta-cell
      mass and function.
