      either an oral dose of daily B-group vitamins (5 mg folic acid, 5mg vitamin B-2, 50 mg
      vitamin B-6, 0.4 mg vitamin B-12) and antioxidant vitamins [800 IU (727mg) of a-tocopherol
      and 500mg of vitamin C] [n=48], or no supplements [n= 48] daily for 90 days. All subjects
      will have three assessments, at baseline, 3, and 12 months post-randomisation. The assessment
      will include markers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress,
      antioxidants, total plasma homocysteine and risk of infections. A fasting 15-ml of blood will
      be taken for measurements of total plasma homocysteine concentration, markers of
      inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, oxidative damage and vitamin concentrations. Further
      information on clinical variables which may influence endothelial dysfunction, antioxidant
      capacity, immunity and diabetes control status will be collected and adjusted for during
      analysis.

      Potential Significance- the study will help to clarify the temporal relationships between ,
      markers of inflammation, endothelial dysfunction and oxidative stress and risk of infections
      and form the basis of appropriate intervention strategies to minimise the long-term
      complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus.
