      retinoblastoma when treated with carboplatin (CBDCA) and vincristine (VCR) every 3 weeks for
      24 weeks. II. Assess the success of this regimen in delaying radiotherapy and eliminating the
      need for surgery by estimating the cumulative incidence function of treatment failure. III.
      Estimate the cumulative incidence of failure of this regimen as measured by subsequent
      treatment with radiotherapy or surgery.

      OUTLINE: All patients receive carboplatin and vincristine every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8
      courses. Patients with disease progression after at least 2 courses are removed from study
      and considered for alternative therapy. Patients are followed every 6 weeks for 1 year, every
      2 months for 1 year, every 3-4 months for 3 years, and yearly for 12 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 4.5 years.
