      assess the safety, preliminary antitumor activity, immunogenicity, and PK of oleclumab with
      or without durvalumab in combination with chemotherapy administered in subjects with
      metastatic PDAC. Subjects with previously untreated metastatic PDAC (1L metastatic PDAC) with
      be enrolled in Cohort A. Subjects with metastatic PDAC previously treated with
      gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (without exposure to 5-FU, capecitabine, or oxaliplatin, 2L
      metastatic PDAC) will be enrolled in Cohort B. The study consists of 2 parts, dose escalation
      (part 1) and dose expansion (Part 2).
