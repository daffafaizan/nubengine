    
      Subjects admitted to L+D for obstetric or medical indications at a tertiary medical center
      with a BMI > 40 kg/m2 will be asked to participate in a study on post surgical dressings and
      wound outcomes if they undergo cesarean delivery. Subjects will be randomized to either study
      arm at the time of fascial closure during cesarean delivery. Post operative care will not be
      altered. Incisions will be evaluated prior to hospital discharge. Subjects will present for a
      wound evaluation 2 weeks post operatively, and receive phone calls to assess outcomes at both
      2 and 6 weeks post operatively.
