      Beirut, Tripoli, and Saida. The study will enroll children younger than 5 years of age who
      are admitted to the hospital because of gastroenteritis. Enrollment will continue for a
      period of two years at each hospital. Inclusion criteria are age < 5 years, with
      gastroenteritis as the main reason for admission to the hospital or for a stay in the
      Emergency Department longer than 12 hours. Exclusion criteria include onset of symptoms
      beyond 12 hours of admission (health-care associated infection). For all enrolled subjects,
      data will be collected about severity of illness, outcome, and history of vaccination. Stool
      samples will be collected for genotyping of rotavirus.
