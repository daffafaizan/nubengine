      a subepithelial connective tissue graft (SCTG) using the single incision technique and
      collagen haemostatic sponge (CHS) placement, with and without suturing the palate. 36
      subjects were randomized to receive (n=18, Suture group-SG) or not a suture (n=18, no Suture
      group-nSG). Outcomes variables were: Early healing index (EHI) at 7, 14 and 30 days,
      self-reported pain using a visual analogue scale (VAS) at 7 and 14 days, immediate (iB) and
      delayed bleeding (dB). Data obtained were compared by Fisher's exact test, T test for
      independent sample, Mann-Whitney test (U test) and Wilcoxon sign test as appropriate. The
      level of significance was set at p < 0.05. Statistical analysis was performed with Infostat
      version 2015.
