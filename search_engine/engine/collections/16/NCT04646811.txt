      that, on the Packer composite clinical endpoint (CCS) (combining NYHA class, patient global
      assessment (PGA) and major cardio-vascular events), the tricuspid valve percutaneous repair
      strategy with clip for the tricuspid valve is superior to best (optimized) medical treatment
      (BMT) in symptomatic patients with at least severe secondary TR. The Packer clinical
      composite score is eventually a three-level ordered categorical endpoint, each randomized
      patient being classifying as improved, unchanged, or worsen, depending on the clinical
      response over the follow-up period and at 12 months.
