      years), and patients with hepatic dysfunction and HIV infection. However, there are no
      published data on the efficacy, safety or pharmacokinetics of rifapentine in children. This
      lack of data has precluded till now enrollment of children less than 12 years old in TBTC
      Study 26, a study of the effectiveness and tolerability of weekly rifapentine/isoniazid for
      three months versus daily isoniazid for nine months for the treatment of latent tuberculosis
      infection, a phase 3 treatment trial that will enroll 8000 persons with latent tuberculosis
      infection. A recently completed initial evaluation of rifapentine pharmacokinetics among
      children receiving a single dose of rifapentine demonstrated significantly lower exposures of
      rifapentine among children compared to adults, when children were given weight-based doses
      chosen to be comparable to a 600 mg oral dose in adults. This reduced exposure suggested that
      children require higher weight-based doses than adults and a model was constructed to
      estimate rifapentine doses in children that would result in exposures similar to the 900 mg
      dose used for adults in Study 26. Study 26 has been amended to include children ages 2-11
      based on the initial single-dose study and pharmacokinetic modeling. The purpose of Study
      26PK is to evaluate the adequacy of the doses chosen for young children who enrolled in Study
      26.

      Briefly, this study aims to:

        -  determine whether rifapentine exposure is equivalent in young children receiving
           weight-based dosing to adults receiving 900 mg.

        -  correlate rifapentine exposure with toxicity in young children

        -  validate accuracy of weight-based dosing in children

        -  determine rifapentine bioavailability in children

        -  determine association in adults between polymorphisms of MDR1 genotype and rifapentine
           exposure

        -  correlate isoniazid concentrations in adults with acetylator status
