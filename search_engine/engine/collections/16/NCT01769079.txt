      the world, and also the disease that consumes more resources in health in industrialized
      countries. The use of fixed nitrate in patients with stable angina is quite common, but there
      is a scarcity of studies showing the need for this medication in this class pacientes.Este
      study aims to evaluate the consequences of the withdrawal of fixed nitrate in patients with
      stable angina class I and II, hemodynamically stable for the past six months, as the
      frequency and duration of episodes of angina, silent ischemia and functional capacity by
      exercise testing, 24-hour Holter and measurement of quality of life and adherence to therapy.
      For this purpose, a randomized blinded multicenter clinical trial was designed to placebo
      (intervention group) X nitrate (control group) in a follow-up period for 4 months. Both
      groups will receive three evaluations (baseline, 30 days and 120 days) during follow-up.
