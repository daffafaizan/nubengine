    
      Objectives of this study are to gather safety data regarding short term, post-implant events
      and complications needed to support Premarket Approval (PMA) submissions for Mentor Silicone
      Gel-Filled Mammary Prostheses and to maintain a comprehensive record of the patient's ongoing
      medical history. The FDA has placed the devices in a regulatory category as a Class III
      device, pursuant to the Medical Device Amendments to the Federal Food and Drug Act which went
      into effect in May 1976. For devices in this class, FDA requires certain clinical data
      regarding the risks associated with mammary prostheses. Due to several issues surrounding
      possible risks of silicone gel-filled breast implants, the FDA has mandated specific clinical
      study requirements to further assess possible risks and complications of silicone devices.
      Clinical data collected via this study will supplement data which will be collected in more
      extensive "Core" studies for breast reconstruction and augmentation procedures.

      Primary Objective - Safety Assessment

      Specifically, data collected during this study will provide risk and complication data with
      regard to short-term use of silicone breast implants. This safety assessment will include,
      but is not limited to:

        -  Incidence of capsular contracture

        -  Occurrence of complications such as infection and seroma

        -  Rupture rates for the implant

      Secondary Objectives

      This study is not intended to assess rare, long-term or speculative conditions which are not
      proven clinically to be associated with mammary prostheses, such as their relationship to
      Connective Tissue Disorders, an increased risk of cancer or teratogenic effects among breast
      implant patients. This study is also not intended to address issues regarding the effects of
      breast implants on mammography interpretation and occurrence of calcium deposits in the
      tissue surrounding the implant. However, data on these and other complications noted in this
      study, should they occur, will be recorded and analyzed with regard to the objective of the
      study.
