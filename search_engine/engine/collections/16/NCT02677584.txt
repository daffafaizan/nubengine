      in a loading dose of 20 mg/kg (equivalent to 10 mg/kg caffeine base) and a maintenance dose
      of 10 mg/kg/day (equivalent to 5 mg/kg caffeine base) either as a prophylaxis group (1) or
      therapeutic group (2). Prophylactic caffeine (group 1) will be defined as caffeine prescribed
      for preterm infants within the first 72 hours of life prior to manifest apnea , therapeutic
      caffeine ( group 2 ) will be defined as caffeine prescribed for manifest apnea within or
      after the first 72 hours of life .

      Preparation and administration of caffeine will be performed by a Neonatal intensive care
      unit (NICU) nurse.

      Statistical Evaluation:

      Statistical analyses will be performed with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences-SPSS
      version 16 software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Illinois). For categorical variables, the X2 test
      will be used. For group comparisons, the Student T test will be used in normal distribution
      and the Mann-Whitney U test will be used in case of abnormal distribution.

      For repeating measurements, variance analyses and Friedman variance analyses will be used.
      For descriptive statistics, percent, minimum-maximum-median, mean, and standard deviation
      will be used in accordance with the type and distribution of the variable. A P value <.05 was
      considered statistically significant. Informed consent will be obtained from parents, and the
      study will be approved by the local ethical committee.
