      the form of increased rate of periprosthetic infection, longer hospital stay, etc. Reduced
      serum albumin and total lymphocyte count are commonly used to define malnutrition.

      The goal was to evaluate the impact of the nutritional status on the outcomes of primary
      staged bilateral TKAs performed one-week apart during two separate hospitalizations.

      Fifty consecutive patients with mean age of 67 years, mean BMI of 28.9 and 2.3 mean ASA score
      were followed for one year.

      Prior to the first surgery 32% had a TLC <1500 cells/mm3 and 84% had a SA <3.5 g/dL. Before
      the second surgery 62% had a reduced TLC and all but one had a reduced SA.

      Nine patients had a total of 12 perioperative blood transfusions (2 after the first surgery
      and 10 after the second surgery). The average length of stay was 3 days after each TKA.

      None of the patients with the lowest TLC or SA before the first or the second stage had a
      revision.

      Bilateral TKAs performed seven days apart in two separate hospitalizations is a safe and
      practical approach for qualified patients. The postoperative course was similar after each
      surgery. The preoperative nutritional status defined by TLC and SA did not influence the
      postoperative outcomes.
