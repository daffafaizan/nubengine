      standard doses will be assessed in participants with advanced metastatic GEC or CRC. Eligible
      participants will receive oral administration of etrumadenant as well as IV infusion of
      mFOLFOX. The recommended dose for expansion (RDE) of etrumadenant will be determined upon
      completion of the dose-escalation phase.

      In the dose expansion phase, etrumadenant at the RDE in combination with mFOLFOX at standard
      doses may be assessed in participants with advanced metastatic GEC or CRC.

      Overall duration of treatment will depend on how well the treatment is tolerated. Treatment
      may continue until unacceptable toxicity or progressive disease or other reasons specified in
      the protocol.
