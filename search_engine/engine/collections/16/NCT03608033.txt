    
      This is a Phase 3, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, study in patients aged 18
      years and above with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of IgAN and with 24-hour UPE that is > 1
      g/day within 6 months prior to Screening or uPCR > 0.75 by spot urine at Screening. During
      the study, all patients will continue optimized renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade. The
      study consists of five periods: Screening, Run-In, Initial Treatment (Weeks 1-12), Response
      Evaluation (Weeks 13-36), and Follow-Up (Weeks 37-144). Patients are assessed for
      re-treatment based on their response to 24-hour UPE. Additional treatment may be given to
      patients whose 24-hour UPE is > 1 g/day following the Initial Treatment Period and who
      relapse during the Response Evaluation and Follow-Up periods. Patients may be qualified for
      Open-Label Treatment with OMS721 after Week 72.

      Approximately 450 patients are to enrolled in two groups of 225 patients per arm.
