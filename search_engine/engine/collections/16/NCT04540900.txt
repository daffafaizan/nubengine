      Subjects enrolled in Cohort I will present a region of healthy buttock skin as a non-facial
      target area to receive two (2) injectable doses of KB301 (low or high). The objective of this
      cohort is to evaluate COL3A1 transgene expression (as measured by qRT-PCR of skin biopsies)
      and determine the optimal dose for the next 2 cohorts. Subjects enrolled in Cohort II will
      present two (2) bilaterally symmetrical areas of shallow-to-moderately deep facial wrinkles
      as the target areas; these areas will be randomly assigned to receive either KB301 or a
      placebo to determine the extent of wrinkle improvement in the KB 301 arm. Subjects enrolled
      in cohort III will present two (2) bilaterally symmetrical areas of severe atrophic acne
      scars as the target areas; these areas will be randomly assigned to receive either KB301 or a
      placebo to determine the extent of acne scar severity improvement in the KB301 arm.
      Throughout the study participants will complete questionnaires, have images captured of the
      target areas, undergo physical examinations, and have safety labs monitored.
