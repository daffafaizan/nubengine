      with increased morbidity and mortality and high healthcare costs. Not all obese patients have
      the same metabolic risk. It is pejorated in case of increase in the fat mass (FM) and
      especially when it predominates at the visceral abdominal level.

      Clinical trials have established the efficacy of lifestyle and behavioral interventions in
      obesity.

      The recent development of telerehabilitation is a promising approach that has only been the
      subject of pilot studies Therefore, the investigators aim to test the effects of 3 months of
      telerehabilitation solution on fat mass evaluated by impedance analysis.

      The telerehabilitation program Telemouv includes physical activity sessions with low
      intensity endurance training targeted at the level of maximal oxidation, nutritional
      monitoring, therapeutic education tools and motivational support

      Patients with BMI > 30 kg/mÂ² will be randomized for the intervention.

      The investigators also will analyse the effects of the solution on different anthropometric,
      metabolic,cardiovascular and psychological parameters, and on rest and exercise metabolism.
      Moreover, we will assess behavioural changes in physical activity and nutrition

      At the end of the study, patients in the control group will be able to benefit from the
      telemouv solution in an ancillary study with a follow-up of three months.

      For a alpha threshold of 5% and a study power of 90%, the study should include 22 patients in
      each group. Taking in account a possible 10% of dropout the study will need to include 25
      patients by randomized arm to demonstrate an effect.
