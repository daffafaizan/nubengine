      demanding alternative to paravertebral block and thoracic epidural in the management of post
      operative VATS associated pain . Recently, another new block, the Erector Spinae Block (ESP
      Block) has been described for use in thoracic wall surgery. It has also been claimed to be
      easier to perform than these more traditional methods of regional anaesthesia. No study to
      date has compared ESP to SAP blocks in terms of efficacy of post operative analgesia after
      VATS surgery. Furthermore, patient-centres outcome studies now demand that researchers
      evaluate more than acute pain in the early postoperative period: A 15-parameter Quality of
      Recovery score (QoR-15) has been recommended as the optimum tool to evaluate overall
      patient-centres measures of recovery after surgery, including pain. This study will test the
      hypothesis that patients receiving ESP Block have higher QoR-15 scores and better post
      operative analgesia in comparison with patients receiving SAP Block after VATS surgery.
