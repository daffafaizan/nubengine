      and for clinicians caring for the babies. There is a wide range of monitors in a very
      clinical environment that does not take into account the comfort of neonates.

      The Dashboard works in parallel with EHR and systems of record, and provides a cohesive view
      of the patient's status and planned clinical workflow in a single location for both parents
      and staff. Accessories such as environmental sensors and cameras are used to ensure that the
      environment is comfortable and promotes optimal development of the baby. Caregivers can
      educate and coach parents to facilitate integrating them into their infant's care. The NICU
      Dashboard also supports a family view to facilitate education and assist the family in
      tracking core measures and developmental milestones.
