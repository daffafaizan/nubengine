      risks are available, but little evidence exists regarding the impact of long-term soy protein
      consumption among type 2 diabetic patients with nephropathy.

      Objectives: To determine the effects of long-term soy consumption on cardiovascular risks,
      C-reactive protein and kidney-function indices among type 2 diabetic patients with
      nephropathy.

      Design: This longitudinal randomized clinical trial was conducted among 41 type 2 diabetic
      patients with nephropathy (18 men and 23 women). Twenty patients in soy protein group
      consumed a diet containing 0.8 g protein/kg body weight (35% animal proteins, 35% textured
      soy protein, and 30% vegetable proteins) and 21 patients in control group consumed a similar
      diet containing 70% animal proteins and 30% vegetable proteins for 4-years.
