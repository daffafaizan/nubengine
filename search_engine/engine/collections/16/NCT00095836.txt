      Primary

        -  Determine the all-measurable-disease response rate in patients with iodine-refractory
           locally advanced or metastatic thyroid cancer treated with gefitinib.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study.
