      extracts; including recall and mental arithmetic ability. Aspects of mood have also shown
      improvements; e.g. increased alertness, calmness and contentedness and reduced mental
      fatigue. These effects are believed to be underpinned by interactions with cholinergic and
      GABA pathways. Polyphenols too have shown promise in boosting cognition and mood and
      interaction with vasodilatory pathways and GABA neurotransmission are purported to be the
      likely mechanisms involved. Research has yet to investigate if a combination of sage terpenes
      and polyphenols could be even more efficacious via synergistic interaction.The current study
      investigates the effects of a 600 mg sage/polyphenol combination on cognition and mood in
      N=90 healthy male and female participants between the ages of 30-60 yrs acutely; on day 1 of
      supplementation, and chronically; after 29 days. Cognitive and mood data will also be
      collected every 7 days in the interim via a mobile phone cognitive task battery.
