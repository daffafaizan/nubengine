    
      This is a randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Sixty healthy untrained male
      subjects will be randomly allocated to six experimental groups: Placebo, Control, PBMT 5
      mins, PBMT 3h, PBMT 6h and PBMT 24 hours. PBMT will be applied precisely two minutes after
      baseline MVC test. Then, after five minutes, 3, 6 hours or 1 day (24 hours) of PBMT the
      eccentric exercise protocol will be performed. We will analyze maximum voluntary contraction
      (MVC), creatine kinase (CK) activity and delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS). Assessments
      will be performed at baseline, immediately after (1 minute), 1 hour, 24 and 48 hours after
      the eccentric exercise protocol.
