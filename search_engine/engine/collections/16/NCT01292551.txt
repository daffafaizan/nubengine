      primary endpoint and predefined subgroups in order to distinguish responders from
      non-responders to the treatment. The predefined subgroups are:

      NT-proBNP > 100 (yes/no) Ventricular anatomy (RV/LV) CT-proEndothelin-1. In the latter, the
      investigators do not wish to predefine a specific value, due to limited experience with this
      analysis. We wish to use the data from the study to find a cut-off value, that is able to
      predict positive response to treatment.
