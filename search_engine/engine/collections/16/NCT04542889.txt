    
      All patients presenting for STEMI by occlusion of a proximal coronary artery, vascularizing a
      large volume of myocardium corresponding to an APPROACH score> 21, in the first 12 hours
      following the onset of chest pain, will be included.

      Data relating to medical history, lifestyle (sedentary lifestyle, smoking, drug use),
      cardiovascular risk factors will be collected.

      The management of acute coronary syndrome will be carried out in accordance with the European
      Society of Cardiology guidelines of 2015. An emergency coronary angiography will be used to
      revascularise the patient as indicated. Thromboaspiration, stenting, antithrombotic agents
      and other treatments will be administered according to angiographic and clinical criteria.

      The FFR guide (PressureWire® Certus® from St Jude Medical Abbott) will be used to make
      pressure and temperature measurements. It has been used in daily practice since the FAME
      study in 2011 to guide the therapeutic decision in patients with an intermediate lesion.

      An injected cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be performed between 48 hours and 7
      days following the infarction in accordance with current practices.The initial trans-thoracic
      ultrasonography as well as the various blood samplings will be performed according to
      standard practice.

      The Rayflow® microcatheter will be used to allow the optimal delivery of physiological saline
      solution into the studied artery. It will be mounted on the FFR guide already in place as
      part of the angioplasty procedure. Bayer's Medrad® Mark 7 Arterion® infuser will be used to
      deliver saline continuously at a flow rate of 15-20 mL/min through the Rayflow® microcatheter
