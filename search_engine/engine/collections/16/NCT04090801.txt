      minoxidil 5% in 90% ethanol and 5% propylene glycol, group B will apply topical minoxidil 5%
      in pure ethanol alone and group C will apply pure ethanol (placebo) twice daily.

      The treatment will be continued for six months with regular visits at 3 months intervals.

      The medications will be provided in bottles which were identical in shape and color, and were
      coded by a third party.

      Both patients and investigator will be blinded to the medication. Disclosure of the codes
      will be done, by a third party, at the end of the study.
