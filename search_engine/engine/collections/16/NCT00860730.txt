      traditional flexible prostheses (stented and stentless biological valves) using conventional
      open-heart surgery. As a result of the sutureless implant procedure, in fact, patients could
      benefit from:

      Reducing aortic clamp times, with subsequent overall reduction of surgical timing and
      therefore reduction in related risks; Avoiding to pass the stitches through the annulus and
      sutures knotting, with consequent less risk of tearing aortic annulus and wall, damaging the
      bundle of His, embolizing foreign material in the vascular system.
