      treatment of children's scoliosis and adolescents.

      The techniques provide a satisfactory correction of the deformity in the coronal plane but
      remain insufficient in the sagittal plane and in particular for the correction of thoracic
      hypokyphosis.

      Dr. Clarke and his team have shown that ST2R reduction technique (Simultaneous Translation on
      Two Rods) associated with the PASS ® system gave a good correction of the thoracic
      hypokyphosis of idiopathic scoliosis. The results of his single-center studies have shown
      that ST2R technique allowed to restore normal thoracic kyphosis with an average gain of 23 °
      in patients preoperatively hypokyphosis, higher than the gains made by other techniques
      (rotation of the shaft, close off Gradually, in situ bending), while providing a frontal
      correction 70%, similar to results reported by other techniques. The results of this
      technique for non idiopathic scoliosis are still to be analyzed.

      The creation of an observatory of children's and adolescents scoliosis (idiopathic,
      neuromuscular, etc ...) operated by the technique of reduction by simultaneous translation on
      two rods with the same instrumentation will:

        -  Firstly, to confirm or refute the first published results idiopathic scoliosis

        -  And secondly to analyze the results of the same technique on all other scoliosis.

      The impact of the intervention on the quality of life of patients is an essential element
      that will be evaluated.
