      positive bacteria-methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant
      enterococci (VRE) among patients in adult intensive care units (ICUs) are lower in ICUs that
      use an intensive infection control strategy plus standard care compared to ICUs that use
      standard care alone. The intensive control strategy involves: 1) identifying patients who are
      colonized with MRSA or VRE by reporting the results of surveillance cultures of the anterior
      nares and stool or perianal area; 2) Universal Gloving (use of gloves during interactions
      with the patient or the patient's environment) until the patients are discharged or their
      surveillance culture results show they are not colonized with MRSA or VRE (whichever happens
      first); and 3) Contact Precautions (use of gloves and gowns during interactions with the
      patient or the patient's environment) during care of patients who are colonized with MRSA or
      VRE. Standard care involves proper hand hygiene (handwashing or use of a waterless hand
      antiseptic) and use of Standard Precautions (use of gloves and other barriers as needed for
      interactions involving contact with mucous membranes, wounds, and body fluids) and collection
      of surveillance cultures, but not reporting of results to these sites. The surveillance
      cultures will be performed by obtaining swabs of the nose and stool or perianal area from
      patients upon admission to the ICU, at weekly intervals thereafter, and upon discharge from
      the ICU. The results of the surveillance cultures will be used to compare the rate of
      colonization with MRSA and VRE in ICUs using the intensive control strategy with those that
      use standard care alone.
