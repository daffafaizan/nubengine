      option for the treatment of allergic respiratory diseases. Its clinical efficacy is well
      demonstrated, although the mechanism of action is still under study.

      The main purpose of immunotherapy is to induce an allergen-specific tolerance so that the
      natural exposure to the allergen does not cause clinical symptoms.

      The clinical efficacy of standard subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is known. A meta-analysis
      Cochrane on the clinical efficacy of SCIT in allergic rhinitis 51 double-blind studies with a
      total 2871 patients) demonstrated a reduction in symptoms in 73% of patients and a reduction
      in the use of drugs in 57%.

      Other studies also show that SCIT was effective in the long term (at least 3-5 years of
      suspension) reduces sensitization to new allergens, prevents progression of allergic rhinitis
      in asthma and significantly improves the symptoms of asthma, hyper- bronchial reactivity and
      the use of asthma medications.

      Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) represents an effective alternative route of administration
      of vaccine therapy with an allergic profile security than the SCIT.
