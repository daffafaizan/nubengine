      limb is frequently affected by CRPS, especially if is preceded by a fracture.

      Recent studies suggest that changes in cortical structures can contribute to the onset of
      CRPS.

      GMI is a approved and efficacy method in CRPS rehabilitation, because it trains modified
      cortical areas throught 3 stadies: left-right discrimination, visual motor imagery and mirror
      therapy.

      Literature shows that there are any studies about GMI efficacy on prevention CRPS in DRF
      after surgery.

      This study would like to demostrate that, appling GMI in the early stages of rehabilitation
      plus standard rehabilitation protocol of DRF after surgery, CRPS cases are reducted.
