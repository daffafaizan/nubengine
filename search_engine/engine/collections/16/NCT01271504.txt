    
      This open-label, multicenter, randomized study will consist of a Phase Ib: a safety run-in
      period with 3 ascending doses of E7050 in combination with sorafenib; and a Phase II portion:
      a randomized 2-arm period. Approximately 95 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma will be
      enrolled in the study (10-15 patients in the Phase Ib portion and 80 patients in the Phase II
      portion). Patients will only participate in either the Phase Ib or the Phase II portion of
      the study. In both Phase Ib and phase II, Patients will receive study treatment (E7050 plus
      sorafenib or sorafenib alone) until the occurrence of progressive disease (PD)for
      approximately six 28-day cycles (24 weeks). After 6 cycles. ath the discretion of the
      Investigator and in consultation with the Medical Monitor, patients who are experiencing
      clinical benefit may continue E7050, with or without sorafenib (Arm 1), or may continue
      sorafenib alone (Arm 2), depending on the original randomization treatment arm, for as long
      as clinical benefit is sustained and the treatment is well tolerated. Patients will be
      followed until death following completion of therapy.
