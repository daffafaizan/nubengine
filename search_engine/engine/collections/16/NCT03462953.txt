    
      In a case control human study The existence and the amount of the indicators and cytokines
      for EMT in the gingival tissue samples taken from the periodontitis patients will be
      investigated and compared to those in healthy individuals using histopathology and real time
      PCR to reveal the role of these factors in periodontal disease incidence in humans.

      Total of 36 participants will be recruited in this study The participants will be divided
      according to their periodontal status into four groups (healthy, mild, moderate and severe
      periodontitis) 9 patients in each group.

      The periodontal screening of patients will be done using mouth mirror and graduated
      Williams's periodontal probe for the following:

        -  Gingival status will be assessed by using gingival index

        -  Periodontal pocket depth.

        -  Clinical attachment loss.

        -  Radiographic examination using panoramic technique. Screening criteria for chronic
           periodontitis was the presence of at least 5 sites with 4 mm horizontal alveolar bone
           loss on radiographs.

      Gingival tissue samples will be harvested during periodontal surgery and extraction of the
      periodontally hopeless tooth for the periodontitis patients and during the premolar
      extraction (Orthodontic ttt) or third molar extraction for the healthy controls.

      The dissected gingival samples will be washed in saline solution and fixed in 4% buffered
      formalin for 48 hours, dehydrated in ascending grades of ethyl alcohol, cleared in xylene and
      embedded in paraffin and will be subjected to the following:.

        1. Sections of 4-5 Âµm in thickness will be obtained, deparaffinized, rehydrated and
           subjected to histological staining and histomorphometric analysis.

        2. Real time- PCR for TGF-B1 ,Vimenten , E-Cadherin .
