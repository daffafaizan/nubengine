      semi-structured diagnostic interview to confirm the diagnoses and assess possible
      comorbidities. All diagnostic assessments were conducted by a fellowship of child and
      adolescent psychiatry. Following assessment, once the participants reached twenty members,
      they were invited to complete child and parent self-report measures. The level of child
      functioning and family relationship functioning were also evaluated. Then they were randomly
      allocated to either parent training (N=20) or a 6 week wait-list (N=22) groups. During 2
      weeks after treatment the assessments were repeated and satisfaction ratings were collected
      for the intervention group.
