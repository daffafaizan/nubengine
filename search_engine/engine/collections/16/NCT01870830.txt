      obstructive pulmonary disease experience nocturnal hypoxemia, periodic breathing and sleep
      disturbances when staying at moderate altitude. Sleep studies and clinical evaluations will
      be performed during 2 days in Zurich (490 m, low altitude baseline) and during 2 days at
      Davos Clavadel (1650 m), and 2 days at Davos Jakobshorn (2590 m).
