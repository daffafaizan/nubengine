    
      This is a Phase 2 study to compare efficacy, safety and PK of palonosetron, a long acting
      5-HT3 receptor antagonist, by buccal film compared to iv injection for moderately emetogenic
      chemotherapy-induced nausea or vomiting (CINV) in cancer patients. Subjects are randomized
      into three treatment groups, two with the experimental study drug palonosetron in buccal film
      at one of two different doses or the control treatment using Palonosetron hydrochloride iv
      injection. Palonosetron PK will be assessed in a subgroup of each treatment group.
