    
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate a new gadolinium-based contrast agent (GBCA)
      gadopiclenol injection for Central Nervous System (CNS) lesion detection and visualization by
      conventional steady-state CNS imaging. .

      This is a multi-center, international, prospective, double-blind, randomized,
      controlled,cross-over with comparator trial in male and female patients presenting with known
      or highly suspected CNS lesion(s) with focal areas of disrupted Blood Brain Barrier (BBB)
      (e.g., primary and secondary tumors) who are scheduled to undergo a routine contrast-enhanced
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the CNS.

      This trial will be conducted in approximately 40 centers worldwide.

      During the course of the trial, two MRIs will be obtained from each patient: one unenhanced
      and gadopiclenol-enhanced MRI; and one unenhanced and gadobutrol-enhanced MRI. MRI
      evaluations will be performed by on-site investigators and three independent off-site blinded
      readers.
