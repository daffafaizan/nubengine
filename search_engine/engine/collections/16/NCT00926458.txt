    
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of various non-invasive methods. The
      study is divided into five substudies:

      Substudy NITRO

      Purpose: To investigate whether a subjective effect of Nitroglycerine is associated with
      significantly narrowed coronary arteries.

      The participants are instructed to alternate between rest and Nitroglycerine as treatment for
      chest pain attacks during a 2 week period. Chest pain score is recorded in a diary handed out
      at day 1 together with 30 tablets Nitroglycerine in the maximal tolerated dose.

      Substudy SCORE

      Aim: To test and compare the ability of different statistical methods using clinical data to
      predict the presence of narrowed coronary arteries in a contemporary Danish population.

      Substudy CONTRAST

      Aim: To evaluate if the blood flow in an area in the heart muscle measured by contrast
      adenosine stress echocardiography can predict the presence of significant stenosis in the
      coronary artery supplying the area.

      Substudy 2D strain

      Aim: To Evaluate if lack of increase in 2D strain during adenosine stress echocardiography
      can predict the presence of narrowed coronary arteries.

      Substudy SPECT

      Aim: To evaluate whether the result of a myocardial scintigraphy can predict symptomatic
      chest pain relief 6 months after a coronary angiography and possible treatment with balloon
      or bypass surgery.

      Participants: Annually around 1,500 coronary angiographies are performed at Region Hospital
      Herning. We intend to include 200 patients referred by their physicians to coronary
      angiography in the study and expect the data collection phase to last 3 years.
