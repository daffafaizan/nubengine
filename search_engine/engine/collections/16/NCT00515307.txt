      despite receiving lipid lowering drugs (e.g. statins, etc). Most of such patients die before
      the age of 20 due to myocardial infarction, etc. Orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) is an
      effective treatment and can decrease their serum cholesterol to near normal levels (Bilheimer
      DW, N Engl J Med 1984; 311:1658-64). Shortage of donor organ is a major problem for OLT.
      Hepatocyte transplantation is an alternative to OLT that may help to overcome the shortage of
      donor organ. There have been reports of successful treatment of different kinds of metabolic
      liver disorders (such as Crigler Najjar Syndrome (Fox IJ, et al. N Engl J Med
      1998;338:1422-6), Factor VII deficiency (Dhawan A et al. Transplantation 2004:78:1812-4),
      Glycogen storage disease type Ia (Muraca M, et al. Lancet 2002;359:317-8), etc) by hepatocyte
      transplantation. The major problem with hepatocyte transplantation is that the source of
      hepatocytes is very limited. Bone marrow stem cells are the potential source of hepatocytes.
      Although, in the in-vivo system there is a controversy that if stem cells transdifferentiate
      into hepatocytes or fusion of stem cells and hepatocytes occur, however, in the in-vitro
      culture system successful and efficient transdifferentiation of mesenchymal stem cells into
      hepatocytes has been documented (Lee KD, et al. Hepatology 2004;40:1275-1284; & Banas A, et
      al. Hepatology. 2007;46:219-28). We have already shown that infusion of mesenchymal stem
      cells is safe and feasible in cirrhosis (Mohamadnejad M, et al. Arch Iran Med 2007; In
      Press). In this study, 2 female patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia will
      be included. The bone marrow of ABO compatible healthy male volunteers with a normal lipid
      profile will be taken, then bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be cultured, and
      then MSCs will be trans-differentiate into hepatocytes in the in-vitro culture system. Then
      the cells will be infused through the portal vein into the patients. The duration of follow
      up will be 6 months post-transplantation.
