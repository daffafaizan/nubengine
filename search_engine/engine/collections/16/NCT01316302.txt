    
      Social Anxiety Disorder (SAD) is recognized as a prevalent, chronic and disabling condition.
      Lifetime prevalence has been estimated at 13% in the National Comorbidity Survey. There is
      good reason to think that Pristiq® would be effective in Social Anxiety Disorder. Effexor XR,
      which is mechanistically similar to Pristiq®, was found effective for subjects with
      Generalized Social Anxiety Disorder in all five of the placebo controlled trials in which it
      was studied.
