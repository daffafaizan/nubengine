      bupicavaine/morphine will result in a better analgesia in hte first 48 hours. Herby the
      patients will require less systemic opioids, which will decrease the side-effects.
      Furthermore, we expect the patients to recover quicker and show an earlier mobilisation and a
      shorter hospital stay.

      The objective of this study is to determine if a single spinal shot of morphine can decrease
      post-operative opioid-use, and thereby decrease opioid side-effects and lead to a quicker
      recovery after surgery.
