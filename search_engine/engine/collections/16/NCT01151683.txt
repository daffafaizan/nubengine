      associated with improved blood pressure control and whether it has beneficial effects on the
      vascular structure and function in non-diabetic hypertensive patients who are receiving r
      diuretic therapy.

      Patients will be evaluated in a prospective, randomized, double-blind study and will be
      admitted to the study if they reach all the inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria.

      In this study, magnesium chelate was chosen because of its better absorption rate. The
      dosages are different in many protocols but in this project the patients will receive 600 mg
      of magnesium element daily divided in 300 mg twice a day. The patients will be divided in two
      main groups according to supplementation with placebo or magnesium chelate 300mg twice a day
      (total of 600mg magnesium element per day). Before and after 3 and 6 months of
      supplementation, the patients will be submitted to clinical and nutritional evaluation,
      biochemical analysis, including intracellular magnesium measurement, and study of the
      macrocirculation with ambulatory blood pressure monitoring, analysis of flow-mediated
      dilation of brachial artery, measurement of carotid intima-media thickness, and
      carotid-femoral and carotid-radial pulse wave velocity to estimate central and peripheral
      arterial stiffness.
