      according to the individual comparisons by group of "haloperidol treated" vs. "placebo
      treated" and "ziprasidone treated" vs. "placebo treated" and also the combined grouping of
      both antipsychotics ("haloperidol plus ziprasidone treated" patients vs. "placebo treated"
      patients). In the latter third of the study, as a result of a paper by Patel S et al AJRCCM
      2014 about rapidly reversible delirium (RRD), we considered modifying delirium assessments to
      detect those who might convert from CAM-ICU positive to negative following SATs, but we
      estimated that only 5 patients per arm would be in this category (and indeed <20 per arm in
      the entire study using the 10% rate published by Patel). With such low numbers and the
      assurance that through randomization we would have all groups analyzed similarly according to
      the study drug assignment, we elected not to alter the protocol and not to conduct subgroup
      analyses according to RRD status.
