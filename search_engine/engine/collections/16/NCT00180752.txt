      have found to have weak quadriceps muscles and study the molecular mechanisms underlying this
      problem. Patients will be well characterised with regard to their physiologic parameters and
      quadriceps muscle biopsies will be taken. These biopsy samples will be analysed with respect
      to NFkappaB activity and HDAC activity by nuclear extraction and for muscle inflammatory
      cytokines. We know that in the lung tissue of COPD patients there is evidence of a reduction
      in HDAC activity which might be responsible for the higher levels of pronflammatory cytokines
      in the lung. We will also study a healthy control group and a small selection of patients who
      are in respiratory failure due to idiopathic scoliosis in the same way.
