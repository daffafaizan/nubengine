    
      Objective: To evaluate efficacy and safety of water-jet assisted POEM (WJ) versus the
      conventional technique (C).

      Interventions: Patients with achalasia diagnosed by symptoms, endoscopy and barium swallow
      eligible for POEM were randomized to either the use of Erbe Hybrid knife (WJ group) or the
      conventional technique using injection and triangle tip knife interchangeably (C group).

      Main outcome measurements: Procedure time in both groups; secondary outcomes were clinical
      efficacy and safety (bleeding complications, pneumothorax or pleural effusion requiring
      intervention)
