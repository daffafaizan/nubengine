      from breaking down and by decreasing unwanted bleeding. It is used in many types of surgeries
      to help reduce surgical complications such as blood loss and blood transfusions.

      In orthopaedic surgeries, such as in total hip and knee replacements, TXA has been shown to
      effectively reduce blood loss and transfusion requirements without an increased risk of side
      effects such as deep venous thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE). The ability to
      decrease blood loss is crucial, as other studies have shown that reducing blood loss
      decreases morbidity and mortality in patients.

      Although, many TXA dosing regimens have been studied - all of which have been useful at
      reducing blood loss and decreasing transfusion requirements - the best TXA dosing regimen and
      the most cost-effective method of TXA administration for patients have yet to be determined.
      Moreover, a thorough and rigorous study on the use and effects of topical and intravenous TXA
      and the effect of TXA on patient outcomes has yet to be conducted.

      Therefore, this research study aims to address those concerns in order to understand how best
      to use TXA to reduce surgical complications in patients undergoing total joint replacements.
