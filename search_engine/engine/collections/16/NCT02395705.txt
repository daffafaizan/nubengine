      squamous cell carcinomas remains the most controversial part of Neo-adjuvant therapy for
      esophageal carcinomas. Therefore, the optimal management of resectable esophageal squamous
      cell carcinomas differs widely among different areas based on local randomized controlled
      trials.

      The neo-adjuvant chemotherapy might be a good strategy if sufficient local control is
      achieved by surgical treatment. This study defined the detail of surgery procedure and the
      region of lymphadenectomy and adopted cisplatin and paclitaxel as neoadjuvant chemotherapy
      regimens. We try to evaluate the efficacy and safety of this neo-adjuvant strategy.
