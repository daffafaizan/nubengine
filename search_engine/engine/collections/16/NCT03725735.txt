      which differs from current treatment within standard care in that focus is more on emotion
      regulation techniques. The treatment consists of an 8- session program delivered by weekly
      sessions. The study is an open trial in order to evaluate the possible benefit of components
      of emotion regulation in treating gambling disorder (GD). Participants with psychiatric
      comorbidities will be included and symptoms of comorbidities will be measured as secondary
      outcomes.

      Once included in the study the participant will be measured weekly on symptoms of gambling
      disorder.

      By increasing competencies in emotion regulation (such as active problem solving, acceptance
      and reappraisal of events in order to change their emotional impact) the hypothesis is that
      the participants will improve on measures of symptoms of GD as well as gambling expenditure
      in terms of time and money.
