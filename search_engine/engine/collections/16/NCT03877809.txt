      precision medicine approach in beta-thalassemia in a clinical trial setting for a repurposed
      drug, namely sirolimus. The presence of high level of Fetal Hemoglobin (HbF) is considered a
      condition predictive of a favourable outcome in thalassemia and its increase induced by
      pharmacological agents is considered a potential way to improve clinical status of the
      patients. In the present trial, in terms of efficacy analysis, the investigators will focus
      their attention on HbF levels.

      Primary objective:

      â€¢ To evaluate the suitability of sirolimus for the treatment of beta-thalassemia patients
      within the frame of a comprehensive project aimed to the reduction of their transfusions need
      (consequently ameliorating their quality of life). This goal can be obtained through a
      pharmacologically mediated increased level of HbF, with a prerequisite to be verified, namely
      the correlation between induction of HbF in vitro and in vivo in single patients.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To assess safety of sirolimus and correlation between administered dose and blood levels
           in beta-thalassemia patients,

        -  To assess the influence of sirolimus on transfusion regimen

        -  To assess the effect of sirolimus on hematopoietic and immune system of thalassemia
           patients.
