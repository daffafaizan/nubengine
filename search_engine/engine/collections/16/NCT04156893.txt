      cell transfusions. RH genotyped donor units will be obtained from the New York Blood Center.
      Patients will be matched with donor units whose RH genotypes predict no foreign Rh protein
      exposure to the patient. This will provide red cell matching at a level above the current
      standard of care (serologic C, E, and K matching). Patients will receive RH matched red cells
      for the duration of their chronic transfusion therapy or up to five years, whichever is
      shorter. It will then be determined whether sufficient RH matched donor units can be
      identified for the patient's RH genotype. Although not powered to determine effectiveness,
      all patients's Rh alloantibody formation will be monitored.

      For subjects with a history of stroke/recurrent transient ischemic attack or other indication
      who require tight control of Hb S, and RH genotyped blood is not available, standard of care
      serologic matched blood would be administered rather than delaying transfusion and risking
      higher Hb S level.

      For all subjects, standard of care serologic matched blood would be administered rather than
      delaying transfusion beyond 7 days.
