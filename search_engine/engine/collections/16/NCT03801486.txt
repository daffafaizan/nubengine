      of semolina flour with sprouted chickpea flour for the use in pasta. Antioxidant capacity
      in-vitro was measured by Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity. Brachial artery
      flow-mediated dilation, a test of in-vivo endothelial function, was performed for assessment
      of effects on post-digestion endothelial function. The investigators hypothesized that FMD
      would be higher after consuming 40% of semolina flour with sprouted chickpea flour pasta vs.
      100% of semolina flour pasta.
