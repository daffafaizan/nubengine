      Factor IX (FIX) activity. FIX is synthesized in the liver and circulates in the blood as a
      proenzyme. Current treatment for hemophilia B is based on replacement of the deficient FIX
      with IV injections of recombinant FIX protein prophylactically or as needed to treat bleeding
      episodes. This clinical program will test a gene transfer approach involving the use of a
      gene delivery vector carrying a FIX gene. This first-in-humans study is intended to evaluate
      the safety, kinetics, and if possible, the dose of AskBio009 required to achieve stable
      plasma FIX activity between 10% and 40% of normal activity.
