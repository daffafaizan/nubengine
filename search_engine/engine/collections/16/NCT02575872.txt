      I. To determine the effect of a 12-week behavior/exercise intervention on moderate-vigorous
      physical activity (> 150 minutes) among ethnically diverse endometrial cancer survivors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of a 12-week behavior/exercise intervention on body composition
      among ethnically diverse endometrial cancer survivors.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the effects of a 12-week behavior/exercise intervention for ethnically
      diverse endometrial cancer survivors on physical function and quality-of-life.

      II. To determine the most important behavioral variables for predicting physical activity
      adherence.

      III. To determine the most significant facilitators and barriers to adherence during the
      12-week intervention.

      IV. To compare the thematic differences between high-adherence and low-adherence participants
      and qualitatively assess the strengths and weaknesses of the 12-week intervention.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 groups

      GROUP I: Participants partake in 30 minutes of group discussions regarding physical activity
      behavior followed by 60 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise comprised of 5 minutes
      warm-up, 25 minutes cardiovascular training, 20 minutes of resistance training exercises
      using body weight and exercise band, and 10 minutes of cool-down and stretching once weekly
      for 12 weeks. Participants also complete a brisk walk for 90 minutes per week outside of
      class for 12 weeks.

      GROUP II: Participants receive a handout indicating the importance of physical activity and
      improved nutrition for health outcomes. After 12 weeks, patients are invited to participate
      in the physical behavior intervention as in Group I.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up at 12 weeks.
