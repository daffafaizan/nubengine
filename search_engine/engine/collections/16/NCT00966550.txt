    
      This study will take three weeks at most, and require one initial screening visit lasting
      approximately 45 minutes and two study visits each lasting approximately 6 - 8 hours. The
      investigators are looking for healthy, non-smoking male and female volunteers between the
      ages of 18 - 65, with no medical history of diabetics, heart, lung, kidney, stomach, or liver
      disease.

      The initial screening visit will determine subject' eligibility through height, weight and
      waist circumference measurements, blood glucose (finger prick) test and a fasting screening
      blood draw. There will be no compensation for the screening visit, other than transportation
      costs.

      If subject qualify, subject will continue to the two study visits. Each visit will require
      subject to have blood drawn several times during subject' study visit (total amount of blood
      equal to approximately 1 Â½ tablespoons). To make this process more tolerable, a registered
      nurse will place a catheter (similar to what happens when you give blood) into subject's vein
      for ease in drawing blood. After the catheter placement and the first blood draw, subject
      will be asked to eat the test meal (tomato or non-tomato meal) and then subject will continue
      to have blood taken at specific time points for the next 6 hours. The investigators will also
      do an ultrasound on subject's arm to measure blood flow both before eating and midway through
      the 6 - hour study visit. The investigators will ask that subject not consume tomatoes or
      tomato products during the course of the study and record all food and beverages consumed on
      certain days.
