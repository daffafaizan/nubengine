      regimen (lidocaine, prilocaine, or Nanorap®) in 3 periods design. Volunteers were submitted
      to clinical and laboratory examination before enrollment. Treatments were carried out on 3
      different days with a washout period of 7 days between each dose.

      After a fasting period (8 h), volunteers received topically 2g of the formulation in a
      delimited area of 16 cm2 in the volar surface of the forearm. The product was applied to the
      left arm and venous blood was collected from the right arm. The remaining product was removed
      with a cotton swab 10 minutes after application. Blood samples (3.5 mL) were collected into
      heparinized tubes before (0:00) and at 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5,
      8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0, 10.5, 11.0, 12.0, 14.0, 16.0 and 24.0 h after the hydrogel
      application.

      Blood samples were centrifuged at 2000 g (4 ⁰C) for 10 minutes and the obtained plasma
      samples were stored at -20 °C until analysis.

      Following dosing, volunteers were monitored for 36 h in a clinical setting safety and
      tolerability (signs, symptoms, adverse events, and laboratory parameters). The vital signs
      (blood pressure and pulse rate) were evaluated. ECGs were obtained before (30 min) and at
      drug Cmax (6 h) for each product application. QT interval corrected by heart rate (QTc) data
      were obtained from a Bionet Cardiocare 2000 and BMS-Plus software program, using Bazett's
      formula: QTc = QT/(sqrt RR Interval).
