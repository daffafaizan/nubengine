      caries. Studies have suggested that oral cavity can benefit immensely from these friendly
      bacteria, although more clinical trials are needed to establish concrete results. Hence, this
      study was undertaken as a 6 month clinical trial to assess the effects of probiotic on the
      most frequent resident of oral micro flora- the mutans streptococci.

      Method- Design: parallel arm design Sample size: 60 subjects (30 subjects in each group)
      Duration: 6 months

      Material used- Intervention/manipulation: 50ml commercially available probiotic drink for one
      group (30 subjects in study group) and 50 ml of plain, unsweetened and unflavored milk to
      control group (30 subjects in control group)for a period of 6 months.

      Indices used: plaque index- Turskey Gilmore-Glikman modification of Quigley-Hein, Plaque
      Index (1970)

      Gingival Index-Loe.H and Silness P. gingival index (1963)

      Both the indices were used twice, at the start of the study, that is, to collect base line
      data and at the end of the intervention period (6 months)as final data collected.

      Sample collection: stimulated saliva was collected (5ml) and analyzed for CFU of
      streptococcus mutans and lactobacilli at the start of the study and after 6 months, at the
      end of the intervention.

      Statistical analysis: students t test, fisher exact test and chi-square test were used to
      compare the baseline data with the final data collected at the end of the intervention.
