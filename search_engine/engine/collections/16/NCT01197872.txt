    
      This study follows previous IRB approved study IVF008: Clinical Use of Parental Support To
      Detect Single Gene Mutations , which we will refer to as "Phase I".

      The purpose of Phase I was to validate clinical use of PS to detect specific genetic
      mutation(s) known to cause severe inheritable diseases in embryos produced by at-risk
      couples, while simultaneously testing these embryos for aneuploidy. The Phase I study
      consisted of first of its kind PGS/D testing to detect disease-associated genetic mutations
      together with aneuploidy screening.

      This study, which we will call "Phase II", will allow patients to continue to access testing
      while clinical data is collected on Phase I. Phase I of the study is nearing enrollment
      targets (40+ participating couples) and Phase I enrollment will be closed while subjects
      complete testing and study data is collected from pregnancies and livebirths. Phase II will
      allow: 1) additional data collection prior to commercial testing launch, 2) eligible patients
      to participate and receive testing.
