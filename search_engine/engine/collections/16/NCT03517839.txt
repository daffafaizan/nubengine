      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) causes respiratory muscle weakness, but also causes
      hypercapnia, dyspnoea, oxygen desaturation, and gait disturbances. In COPD, the main symptom
      is dyspnea and leads to activity limitation. It has been shown that with exercise, the
      diaphragm workload increases in COPD patients and requires more MIP than healthy humans. This
      is associated with dyspnea during exercise and tiredness in the respiratory muscles. Dyspnea
      is defined as the difficulty in breathing of a person. Painful situations are defined as
      'kinesiophobia' as a result of physical injuries and fear of repetition of the problem as a
      result of injury. Similarly, COPD patients avoid themselves from dyspnea-related activities
      or compensate by reducing the rate of activity. This reduces the severity of the symptom that
      precedes the symptom that may occur. As a result, fear of movement occurs due to dyspnea.
      Decrease in the level of activity; social isolation, fear of dyspnea, depression and anxiety
      result in a stubborn cycle, reducing the quality of life. In order to increase respiratory
      muscle strength and endurance, to improve the length tension relationship of respiratory
      muscles and to increase respiratory capacity, respiratory muscle training is performed by
      using the training principle of skeletal muscles. In COPD, inspiratory muscle training has
      been shown in many studies to reduce dyspnoea perception, increase exercise capacity and
      quality of life.
