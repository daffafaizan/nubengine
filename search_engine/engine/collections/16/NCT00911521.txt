      transmitted infections in Hong Kong. Most cases of HPV infection are asymptomatic. However,
      in some individuals, especially those patients who are immunocompromised, HPV infection is
      persistent and may result in genital warts, cervical smear abnormalities, cervical
      intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and rarely cervical cancer.

      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a disease that predominantly affects women of the
      childbearing age. Patients with SLE are at risk of persistent HPV infection. This is because
      of the immunosuppressive state induced by various treatments. The prevalence of abnormal Pap
      smears and cervical squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in SLE patients is higher than
      that in age-matched healthy women. Thus, prevention of HPV infection is important in patients
      with SLE to reduce the incidence of CIN lesions and hence invasive cervical cancers in the
      long run.

      The quadrivalent HPV vaccine, GARDASIL is effective in reducing the occurrence of high-grade
      CIN lesions and anogenital disease elated to HPV-16 and HPV-18 infection. Vaccination of
      young women aged 16 to 23 years resulted in seroconversion rates of more than 99% for all the
      HPV types (6,11,16,18) and was well tolerated. There has been very little information
      regarding the efficacy of the quadrivalent HPV vaccine in immunocompromised hosts. The
      objectives of the current study are to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of the
      quadrivalent HPV vaccine in a group of patients with SLE in terms of antibody conversion.
      Comparison will be made with an equal number of age-matched healthy women.
