    
      The study is a retrospective, observational, descriptive, cohort study, in DM and non-DM
      patients of 0-80 years of age. As a first step the eligible baseline population from CPRD
      will be defined as per the data quality qualifiers, which include subjects aged 0-80 years,
      "acceptable for research" registered in practices classified as "up to standard" by the CPRD
      for the time period 2000- 2012. The following cohorts will be defined from the baseline
      population:

        -  DM cohort: Patients diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 DM, as confirmed by diagnosis
           medical codes with or without a DM related drug or monitoring devices prescription.

        -  Non-DM cohort: Patients with the absence of personal history of DM diagnosis or
           antidiabetic drug or monitoring devices prescriptions.

      From the above defined cohorts, HepB cases will be identified based on clinical diagnosis
      codes, Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) or positive diagnostic laboratory tests results.
