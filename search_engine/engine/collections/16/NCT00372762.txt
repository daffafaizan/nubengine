      worse functional capacity and more severe symptoms of heart failure. The majority of HF
      patients take furosemide on at least a daily basis for symptom relief. Bumetanide is a loop
      diuretic with a similar therapeutic diuretic effect to furosemide. There is evidence from
      observational and small comparative trials that bumetanide has a significantly less
      deleterious effect on indirect measures of insulin resistance compared with furosemide.
      However, a formal comparison between the 2 drugs using rigorous measures of insulin
      resistance has never been conducted in patients with HF. If bumetanide can be demonstrated to
      have a similar diuretic and a superior (less deleterious) effect on insulin resistance in
      patients with HF, the potential exists for bumetanide to have a significantly reduced
      morbidity in patients with heart failure compared to furosemide. In order to prepare for such
      a study, the variance of the MINMOD-derived insulin resistance from the FSIGT (26), in this
      group of patient needs to be determined along with the feasibility of conducting such a
      study. Functional capacity will be determined by duplicate 6-minute walk tests.
