      with monoclonal antibody 17-1A and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor in
      patients with colorectal cancer metastatic to nonhepatic sites and refractory to
      fluorouracil. II. Describe the toxicities associated with this regimen. III. Assess the
      quality of life in these patients.
