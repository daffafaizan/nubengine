      day); without using any other oral care product at this time. A dentist applies the gel on
      all teeth. At baseline and after 3 days plaque will be collected from buccal and labial
      surfaces (except surfaces with tartar). A "split-mouth" concept will be used:

      Subjects in group A:

      Baseline plaque collection: quadrant 1 and 4 Plaque collection after 3 days: quadrant 2 and 3

      Subjects in group B:

      Baseline plaque collection: quadrant 2 and 3 Plaque collection after 3 days: quadrant 1 and 4
      (The time between last application of the gel and plaque collection will be 1 h) The plaque
      will be dried and afterwards the calcium content of the plaque will be quantitively analyzed
      by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).

      For all subjects: Calcium contents of plaque at baseline and after 3 days application will be
      compared by statistical methods.
