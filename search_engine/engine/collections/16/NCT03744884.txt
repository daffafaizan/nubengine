      cerebral palsy demonstrate abnormal muscle tone and motor control. Within the population of
      children with cerebral palsy, between 4% and 17% present dystonic symptoms and between 80% to
      95% of cases present spasticity. In many cases spasticity and dystonia are present in the
      same child and accurate diagnosis may be challenging.

      This study consists of a randomized controlled trial that uses a virtual reality game-based
      intervention incorporating fully-automated robotic haptic feedback to aid the the objective,
      quantitative diagnosis of spasticity and dystonia u=in CP. The study consists of face-to-face
      assessments of movement before, after, and one-month following the completion of the
      six-session game-based intervention. Children with spastic/dystonic cerebral palsy and
      typically developing children between the ages of 7 and 17 will be recruited for this study.
      The investigators anticipate to recruit a total of 68 participants, 34 with cerebral palsy
      and 34 typically developing. Both groups of children will be randomly allocated into an
      intervention or control group using a blocked randomization method. Movement outcomes will be
      examined for changes in quantitative and clinical measures in children with spastic/dystonic
      cerebral palsy and typically developing children to aid on the classification of movement
      disorders. Pair t-tests will be conducted on movement outcomes for both groups of children
      independently. Positive and negative results will be reported and addressed.
