      prostate cancer patients undergoing proton radiation therapy at IUHPTC. With the information
      collected, the investigators will establish pre-existing conditions before proton treatment
      and measure side effects after treatments that are not related to the pre-existing
      conditions. Also, to compare long-term side effects for patients who are treated with hormone
      suppression therapy along with their proton therapy to those patients who do not get treated
      with hormone suppression therapy. This information will help doctors better understand the
      side effects experienced and may help provide valuable information for future patients making
      decisions regarding their treatment options.

      Finally, to develop a database of information regarding the treatment and outcomes for
      patients with prostate cancer in order to improve care of patients with this type of cancer.
