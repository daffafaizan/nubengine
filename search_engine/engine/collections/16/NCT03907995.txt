      disaster like Hurricane Harvey and its aftermath often exacerbates pre-existing issues and/or
      brings new issues, with post-traumatic stress presenting in manners such as anxiety,
      depression, conduct issues and/or somatic issues. Approaches are needed that educate
      community members about both normative and concerning responses to disaster focused on coping
      skills development. A particular approach, peer-led intervention groups have been shown
      effective at delivering these types of intervention. Brief, psycho-educational peer-led
      programs have shown effectiveness in a variety of forums including helping promote adjustment
      among those who have experienced trauma. There will be six group sessions every two weeks.
      Sessions will include how to teach appropriate coping techniques to respond to the distress,
      confronting distressing memories related to the disaster, and emotion regulation techniques.
      After the group sessions end, individuals who require a more intensive service will be
      referred to a higher level of care.
