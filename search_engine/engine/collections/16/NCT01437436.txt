    
      OME was diagnosed by the presence of fluid in the middle ear on otoscopy or tympanometry
      according to clinical practice guidelines . The diagnostic findings of pneumatic otoscopy and
      otomicroscopy include the tympanic membrane dullness, impaired mobility, and an air-fluid
      level or bubble. In addition, the type B or C tympanogram was considered positive for OME.

      Indication for ventilation tub insertion includes history of OME lasting 3 months or longer,
      structural damage to tympanic membrane or middle ear and risk for speech, language learning
      difficulties. Adenoidectomy is also performed when adenoid hypertrophy is founded during
      preoperative assessment.

      Body weight and height were measured before ventilation tube insertion at hospital. Body mass
      index (BMI) was calculated using the formula weight/ height2 (Kg/m2).
