      block of every 4 participants and a stratified randomization according to portal vein cancer
      emboli will be used to restrict randomization. LMWH consisted of nadroparin Ca will be given
      at a dose of 4100 U twice daily during 6 weeks after TACE. The time to progression(TTP) and
      overall survival within two years will be used to evaluate the effect of LMWH on HCC.
