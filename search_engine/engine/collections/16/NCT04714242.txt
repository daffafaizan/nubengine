    
      Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy represents a distinct form of choroidal neovascularization.

      The study investigated the changes in choroidal vascular network after anti-VEGF therapy
      using optical coherence tomography angiography, a novel and non invasive diagnostic technique
      that allows to better understand the pathophysiologic mechanism of this neovascularization.
