      osteoarthritis in order to improve quality of life and relieve pain. But a large number of
      patients who undergo this surgery experience moderate to severe postoperative pain.
      Previously, the investigators used single femoral nerve blockade combined with
      patient-controlled intravenous analgesia for postoperative analgesia for patients after TKA.
      Although this method provides acceptable analgesia, the incidence of opioid-associated side
      effects is relatively high. Low-dose epidural morphine is commonly used in postoperative
      analgesia after cesarean section, and the effect of single dose morphine lasts more than 20
      hours, with low incidences of itching, nausea, vomiting, and respiratory depression. The
      investigators hypothesize that, for patients undergoing TKA, the addition of low-dose
      epidural morphine to single femoral nerve block and intravenous opioids can improve the
      postoperative analgesia, reduce the consumption of intravenous opioids and decrease
      opioid-associated side effects.
