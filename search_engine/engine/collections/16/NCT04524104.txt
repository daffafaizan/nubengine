      ratio to the Lumen treatment arm (n=40) or the wait-list control arm (n=20) Participants in
      both arms will receive encrypted study iPads.

      Lumen treatment arm participants will receive encrypted study iPads to complete PST with
      Lumen (8 sessions, 4 weekly and then 4 biweekly, over 12 weeks) or be on a wait list.
      Participant permission will be obtained to record their PST sessions with Lumen, which will
      be independently rated by PST experts for fidelity. Lumen Treatment arm participants will
      also complete the depressive and anxiety symptoms assessment questionnaires at the start of
      each PST session, and a participant survey of usability, user experience and therapeutic
      alliance at the end of each PST session.

      Participants in both arms will complete measurements of neural target engagement and
      treatment outcomes at both baseline (0 week) and 14 weeks.

      These assessments will include (1) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 2) Surveys of
      PST (3) Surveys of patient-reported outcomes, such as depressive and anxiety symptoms, social
      functioning, and health-related quality of life. Participants also will complete naturalistic
      end-of-day assessments of mood, stress, appraisal, and coping for 7 days every 2 weeks (on
      weeks 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14) - that is, 8 time series.

      Participants in the wait-list control arm will have the option to receive Lumen at the end of
      the study. The PST module on the study iPad will be disabled until their 14-week assessment
      is completed, at which time they will have the option to complete 8 PST sessions on their
      assigned iPads.
