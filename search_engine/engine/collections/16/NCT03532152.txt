      computer engineering, which are used to initiate the physiological process of recreation,
      i.e. allostasis. Literally this term means "achieving stability through change". This is an
      active mechanism playing a part in normalization of the tone of the autonomic nervous system
      and maintaining stability of the body internal environment. The condition in which all our
      functions are implemented fully and sparingly in response to the load, and the level of
      adaptation remains high for a long time. Pure Purr is a software and hardware complex for
      relaxation and recreation based on a virtual reality headset with a display with sufficient
      resolution, built-in processor, memory, and extended-range stereo speakers. Positive effect
      on the cognitive function of the brain and the system of neurohumoral regulation is achieved
      due to the synchronous actuation of a number of stimuli, such as: visual sequence enhanced by
      the effect of virtual reality, harmonious music with the binaural rhythm technology, and
      modified cat purrs. Currently, the use of each technology is a scientifically proven trigger
      for the activation of individual parts of the human nervous system. And combining them in one
      software complex enhances the overall effect.
