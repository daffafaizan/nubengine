      year. There are strong associations between air pollution exposure and heart disease but we
      do not yet understand how these harmful effects are mediated. Understanding this mechanism is
      likely to have a major impact on the way we treat patients with heart disease and have the
      potential to shape future environmental health policy. The upregulation of Endothelin-1
      provides a plausible mechanism for these harmful effects, and we plan to investigate this in
      more depth in the human forearm following exposure to diesel exhaust.
