      of methotrexate with epirubicin improves survival for patients with primary and operable
      breast cancer. In a retrospective evaluation we have also shown that approximately 20% of all
      patients in 89D have tumors with numerical changes of the TOP2A gene, and that only patients
      with abnormal TOP2A benefit from epirubicin. In the current trial the DBCG wishes to clarify
      if recurrence-free and overall life expectancy is longer after docetaxel and cyclophosphamide
      compared to epirubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by docetaxel in patients with TOP2A
      normal and operable breast cancer.
