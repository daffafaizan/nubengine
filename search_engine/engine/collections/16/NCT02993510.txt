    
      -  Prospective, randomized, active treatment-controlled, open-label multicenter study (up
           to 40 sites in the US and EU).

        -  All subjects that meet preoperative screening eligibility criteria will be randomized to
           treatment with Chondro-Gide® either sutured or glued or Microfracture alone.

        -  Eligible and consenting subjects are randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio using centralized
           randomization list to receive one of the following treatments: Group I: Microfracture
           alone; Group II: Microfracture covered with a Chondro-Gide® membrane glued with fibrin
           glue (AMIC glued); Group III: Microfracture covered with a Chondro-Gide® membrane
           sutured (AMIC sutured)

        -  All subjects will be assessed at intervals post-procedure (6 weeks, 3 months, and 1,2
           and 5 years).

        -  Subjects will be required to follow a strict pre-specified post-surgery rehabilitation
           protocol specific to the defect location.

        -  Measures to assess effectiveness and safety will be conducted at all follow-ups.

        -  Safety will be assessed by the collection of adverse events at all timepoints.
