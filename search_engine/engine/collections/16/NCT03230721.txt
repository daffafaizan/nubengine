    
      HoLEP and ThuLEP or EEP have been approved by the current guidelines of the European
      Association of Urology for use in men with substantially enlarged prostates (>80 ml) as
      first-line therapy [1]. This type of operation can be performed by means of several sources
      of energy.

      To our knowledge, there were no studies comparing efficacy and complications of these three
      treatment modalities.

      In this study the investigators have evaluated efficacy of Thulium-fiber laser enucleation
      (120 W thulium fiber laser Urolase, IPG IRE-POLUS, Russia with wavelength of 1940 nm) and
      monopolar enuclation in comparision with HoLEP (VersaPulse Powersuite 100, Lumenis,
      USA/Israel) in reduction of LUTS secondary to BPH in a prospective randomized trial.

      All peri-operative parameters, urinary flow parameters, prostate size changes, erectile
      function and complications associated with the procedures were compared.
