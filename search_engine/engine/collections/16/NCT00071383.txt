      understood. The process whereby tumor cells escape the primary, local tumor, spread to
      distant sites in the body and find and create conditions conducive to growth in these
      disparate tissues remains an area of intense investigation. Metastasis of epithelial tumors,
      such as breast cancer, to the brain is a common problem, with significant consequences with
      respect to neurological dysfunction and shortening of survival.

      Objective: To study two subset of patients with breast cancer metastatic to the brain, to
      identify genes and proteins that facilitate metastasis, particularly in women who
      over-express the growth factor receptor HER2, in which an increased risk of brain metastasis
      has recently been identified.

      Study Population: 78 patients with breast cancer metastatic to the brain (39 women whose
      tumors are HER2-(-) and 39 women whose tumors are HER2-(+)) to compare with published
      microarray studies of non-metastatic breast cancer patients with these tumor types as well as
      with one another to help explain the differential trend toward metastasis in patients treated
      with Herceptin, a new therapy directed at HER-2 over-expressing tumors.

      Anticipated Risks and Benefits: Less than minimal risk to the patients to sample tissue
      already removed from the brain as part of medically-necessary surgery and to sample blood. No
      direct benefit to the patient is expected.

      Outcome Estimate and Potential Meaning for the Field: That this very detailed investigation
      of the genes and proteins expressed differentially between the non-metastatic and metastatic
      breast cancers, as well as between HER2-(-) and HER2-(+) subtypes will identify new or
      previously-unsuspected targets for new therapies to either prevent the development of brain
      metastasis or to treat these brain metastases more effectively.
