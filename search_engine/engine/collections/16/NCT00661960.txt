      anti-HIV medications have substantially reduced morbidity and mortality for those patients
      able to adhere to combination regimens. Despite improved survival, durable virologic
      suppression, and increases in peripheral CD4+T-cell counts in patients receiving potent
      antiretroviral therapy (ART), immune reconstitution remains incomplete as measured by a
      number of additional surrogate markers. Perhaps critically important among areas of apparent
      incomplete immune recovery is the gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), where
      CD4+T-cells repopulate very slowly, if at all. Raltegravir is a new ART agent from a novel
      class of HIV inhibitors, integrase inhibitors, that results in rapid suppression of HIV and
      recovery of peripheral CD4+T-cells. This project proposes to examine whether volunteers
      receiving raltegravir recover GALT immune cells more completely than those taking comparator
      ART.
