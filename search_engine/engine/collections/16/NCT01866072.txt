    
      Transient elastography is a novel non-invasive method that for the assessment of hepatic
      fibrosis in patients with chronic liver diseases, by measuring liver stiffness.

      Acute on chronic liver failure: acute hepatic insult manifesting as jaundice and
      coagulopathy, complicated within 4 weeks by ascites and/or encephalopathy in patients with
      previously diagnosed or undiagnosed chronic liver disease.

      Acute severe hepatitis: Acute severe hepatitis which is characterized by serum bilirubin > or
      = 10.0 mg/dL and international normalized ratio (INR) > or = 1.5.

      Patients with acute severe viral hepatitis or acute on chronic liver failure will be enrolled
      in this prospective study after taking informed written consent. All patients will be
      evaluated at baseline as per standard protocol which include evaluation of etiology of
      disease and tests to exclude underlying liver disease which includes ultrasound/computed
      tomography and if necessary upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and liver biopsy if imaging
      shows any signs of underlying liver disease. the patients will be followed up for 1 month,
      all patients will undergo Fibroscan at the time of admission and thereafter at 1week and 4th
      week .
