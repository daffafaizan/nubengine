      prevalence and incidence of HF is increasing in diabetes and mortality rates remain
      alarmingly high. This highlights the need for novel therapies in diabetes that will reduce HF
      risk and /or delay disease progression.

      Drug options are currently limited as some diabetic therapies such as thiazolidinediones are
      contra-indicated in HF. SGLT2 inhibitors, the newest class of anti-diabetic drugs, are an
      exciting new approach to diabetes management that may have additional beneficial effects in
      diabetes and HF. SGLT2 inhibitors may have beneficial effects on adverse left ventricular
      (LV) remodelling that occurs in patients with diabetes and heart failure by reducing the load
      on the heart through its diuretic and blood pressure lowering actions.

      Exercise intolerance is a cardinal symptom of patients with HF and improving insulin
      sensitivity has been shown to improve exercise capacity. SGLT2 inhibition has been shown to
      improve insulin sensitivity and to reduce weight and therefore has the potential to improve
      exercise capacity in HF.

      This study will assess the potential beneficial effects of the oral SGLT2 inhibitor,
      dapagliflozin, on LV remodelling and exercise capacity in patients with diabetes and HF. The
      findings of this study may help to establish the utility of SGLT2 inhibitors in diabetic
      patients with HF and provide important clinical data on the impact of SGLT2 inhibition on LV
      remodelling.
