    
      This is a Phase 3, 24-week, multicenter study in Taiwan, comprising a 16-week, randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled period ("Randomized Period"), followed by an 8-week
      open-label extension period, where all subjects receive PBF-1681 (ferric citrate) ("Extension
      Period"). The study will consist of 10 visits over a period of 24 weeks. There will be a
      screening period of up to 14 days. Approximately 200 subjects will be randomized into the
      Randomized Period in a 1:1 ratio to receive either PBF-1681 or matching placebo, at baseline.
