      treatment group vs. control group design and a repeated measures design with follow-up
      measurements 3 and 6 months after the intervention. The sample size calculation was made for
      an effect of d = .20 with repeated measures, a power of 1- β = .80 and α = .05. Additionally
      the investigators plan to take measurements (only once) from healthy volunteers matching them
      (age and gender) with the asthma patients.
