    
      Eligible participants, with both a history of recurrent BV and a current episode of BV, will
      receive a seven-day course of oral metronidazole. Participants who are successfully treated
      for their BV, and continue to be eligible, will be randomly assigned to receive either 1%
      SPL7013 Gel or placebo gel on alternate days at bed-time for 16 consecutive weeks.

      The primary endpoint will be determined at the conclusion of this 16 week treatment phase.

      Participants who experience a BV recurrence will be considered to have completed the study.
      Such participants will receive BV treatment in line with local practice and will not attend
      any further study visits.

      Participants who successfully reach Week 16 without a BV recurrence will enter a 12-week
      follow-up phase to Week 28.

      Participants will attend a study visit at 4-weekly intervals throughout the duration of the
      study to Week 28 (or up to the point of BV recurrence) to assess recurrence of BV and adverse
      events.
