      calculation. The 44 patients will be divided in 2 groups, the intervention group receiving a
      quadratus lumborum block (75mg ropivacaine) and the no intervention group receiving the
      current standard care of our hospital -an epidural.

      The primary outcome measure is the acute postoperative need for rescue analgesics. Secondary
      outcomes are acute pain (NRS scale), nausea, vomiting, mobilisation and longterm outcomes
      such as quality of life and persistent pain.
