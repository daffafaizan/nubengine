      ALS, the cause of the cell death is unknown. There is evidence that this cell death may be
      caused by changes in DNA, the body's genetic material. Drugs such as sodium phenylbutyrate
      (NaPB) can increase the expression of genes, block how the motor nerve cells in ALS die, and
      may prove to be an effective therapy for ALS. NaPB has shown an improvement in survival in
      mice with conditions similar to ALS.

      STUDY DESIGN:

      All research participants will take sodium phenylbutyrate for a total of 20 weeks. The dose
      of medication will be increased every 2 to 4 weeks until a maximum, easily tolerated dose is
      achieved (study maximum is 21 g/day).
