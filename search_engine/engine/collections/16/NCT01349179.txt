      underestimate the incidence and the extension of osteolyses perished-acetabular which are
      generally asymptomatic initially. The lack of international consensus on the definition of
      the parameters of interpretation of the radiological follow-up of the PTH makes difficult the
      comparison of the various results. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the presence of
      geodes acetabular and femoral with scan examination.
