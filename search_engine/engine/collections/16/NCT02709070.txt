      cancer-related death worldwide. Resection is considered as the main curative treatment for
      HCC, but recurrence of tumor within the liver remnant is common, with a reported 5-year
      recurrence rate of 70%, which results in poor prognosis of HCC, and the high recurrence rate
      has led efforts to develop adjuvant therapies to reduce recurrence. However, the benefit of
      any form of adjuvant therapy remains unclear. Current guidelines didn't recommend any
      adjuvant therapy after resection. A previous clinical trial from Japan reported that
      cytokine-induced killer(CIK) cell immunotherapy increased recurrence-free survival (RFS)
      after surgical resection of HCC. Immunotherapy has become an optional treatment for HCC.
      Cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTL), a kind of effective T cells that specific recognizing and
      killing antigen targeted cells through cloning amplification after receiving antigen
      information from antigen presented cell and playing key role to clear cancerous cells. There
      is little evidence for adjuvant CTL treatment for HCC receiving resection. So our hypothesis
      is that adjuvant highly-purified CTL is superior to resection alone for HCC. The aim of this
      prospective study is to compare the outcome of resection combined with highly-purified CTL
      with resection for HCC.
