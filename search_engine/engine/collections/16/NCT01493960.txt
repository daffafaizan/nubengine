    
      The study is a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised study to assess the efficacy and
      safety of cobitolimod as an add-on to current practice in treatment refractory ulcerative
      colitis patients. The study population will be chronic active ulcerative colitis patients who
      are no longer responding adequately to standard therapies and who are potential candidates
      for colectomy. Cobitolimod/placebo will be add-on treatment allowing all included patients to
      be on concomitant medication, as well as mandatory steroids at inclusion, throughout the
      study.

      Cobitolimod (DIMS0150) is a modified single strand DNA-based synthetic
      oligodeoxyribonucleotide of 19 bases in length. The drug functions as an immunomodulatory
      agent by targeting the Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) present in immune cells (i.e., B-cells and
      pDCs) residing in high abundance on mucosal surfaces, such as colonic and nasal mucosa. The
      mucosa of the colon and rectum of patients with ulcerative colitis contains active immune
      cells, which produce damage to the tissue. The activation of these cells by cobitolimod
      results in the systemic release of specific cytokines (e.g., IL-10 and type I interferons)
      and chemokines which are believed to be important factors for the clinical effect cobitolimod
      of cobitolimod. 131 eligible patients was randomly assigned in a 2:1 allocation to receive
      two single rectal doses of cobitolimod at 30 mg each, or placebo, at week 0 and 4.

      The primary endpoint is the induction of clinical remission at week 12 and patients will be
      continuously followed for efficacy and safety until 12 months after the first dose. Secondary
      endpoints include the induction of symptomatic remission (number of stools and blood in
      stools), induction of registration remission (clinical and endoscopic remission) and rate of
      colectomy.
