      Applying PEEP in mechanically ventilating patients changes dynamic hemodynamic parameters
      (stroke volume variation, pulse pressure variation), which is more pronounced in hypovolemic
      patients. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the mechanically ventilating patients
      under one-lung ventilation requiring fluid resuscitation by applying PEEP to predict fluid
      responsiveness.

      The investigators hypothesized that applying PEEP in one-lung ventilating patients can also
      change dynamic parameters and the magnitude of the change of stroke volume variation, pulse
      pressure variation can predict fluid responsiveness. The investigator applied PEEP 10 mmHg in
      one-lung ventilating patients and observed the dynamic parameters including stroke volume
      variation, pulse pressure variation and then infused 6ml/kg of crystalloid for fluid
      challenge and diagnosed fluid responsiveness as 10% increase of stroke volume after fluid
      challenge.
