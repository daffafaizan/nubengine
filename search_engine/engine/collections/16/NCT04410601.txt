      thyroidectomy, and can be related to superior and inferior laryngeal nerves dysfunction, but
      it usually appears after an uncomplicated surgical procedure. Aerodigestive symptoms, such as
      discomfort, tightness, lump, foreign body, difficulty or pain during swallowin, can also
      present before operation. If it appears or aggrevates after surgery, laryngeal nerve damage
      (superior laryngeal nerve - SLN, or inferior laryngeal nerve - recurrent, RLN),
      tracheo-malacia and postoperative fibrotic changes should be interrogated. However, in most
      of the cases, an anatomic and/or physiologic defect in the oro-pharngeal region is not easy
      to be detected. Therefore, a subjective feeling of dysphagia is more common.

      Dysphagia has important consequences on the QoL in postoperative period, and should be
      addressed by the primary surgeon/clinician, regardless of whether it is objective or
      subjective.

      The goal of the present study is to better understand the incidence of postoperative
      dysphagia symptoms among patients who have undergone total thyroidectomy for benign or malign
      thyroid disease. Besides, all possible risk factors (pre-intra-post-operative) are also going
      to be evaluated in detail, and the efficacy of a 6-week dysphagia-rehabilitation programme
      will also be employed and results will be shared.
