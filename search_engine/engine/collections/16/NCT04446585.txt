      defibrillation. Despite an increasing number of available AEDs, survival and defibrillation
      rates in residential areas remain poor. Efforts to increase bystander defibrillation has the
      potential to improve survival. Through the strategic deployment of AEDs, training, and
      recruitment of residents as citizen responders, we aim to improve proportions of bystander
      defibrillation and 30-day survival in densely populated residential areas with a high density
      of cardiac arrests.
