      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of sunitinib malate in patients with refractory or relapsed
           metastatic germ cell tumors.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to tumor response and duration of tumor response in patients treated
           with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a open-label study.

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 6
      weeks for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 28 days and then periodically
      thereafter.
