      arterial hypertension in systemic sclerosis, including clinical/disease characteristics,
      antibody status, test results and biomarkers. The frequency of publications featuring a
      risk/association were reported. The following databases were searched: Medline, EMBASE, the
      Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and SCOPUS.

      The following search terms were used:

      ( essential pulmonary hypertension or familial primary pulmonary hypertension or
      hypertension, pulmonary or hypertension,lung or hypertensive pulmonary vascular disease or
      idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension or lung arterial hypertension or lung artery
      hypertension or lung hypertension or primary pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary arterial
      hypertension or pulmonary artery hypertension or pulmonary fixed hypertension or pulmonary
      hypertensive disease or pulmonary hypertensive diseases or pulmonary hypertensive disorder or
      pulmonary hypertensive disorders )

      AND

      ( generalised scleroderma or generalized scleroderma or progressive scleroderma or
      progressive sclerodermia or progressive sclerosis,systemic or progressive systemic sclerosis
      or scleroderma, generalised or scleroderma, generalized or scleroderma, progressive or
      scleroderma, systemic or sclerosis,progressive systemic or sclerosis,systemic or
      sclerosis,systemic progressive or systemic progressive sclerosis or systemic scleroderma or
      systemic sclerosis,progressive or

      scleroderma, limited or limited scleroderma or limited cutaneous scleroderma or

      diffuse scleroderma or progressive diffuse scleroderma or scleroderma, diffuse )

      AND
