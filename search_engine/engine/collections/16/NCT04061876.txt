      immunosuppression as first line therapy. Many patients with high risk aGVHD do not respond to
      primary therapy, high-dose systemic corticosteroids; therefore, survival for those patients
      remains particularly poor. Here we determine the efficacy and safety of combined Ruxolitinib
      With Corticosteroids as First Line Therapy for the Treatment of High risk aGVHD.
