      incidence is rising. MRE (magnetic resonance enterography) is considered the standard of care
      for imaging of pediatric small bowel Crohn's disease. Bowel ultrasound is an emerging
      technology for bowel assessment and offers several advantages over MRE, including lower cost,
      shorter exam time, and lack of need for sedation and contrast materials and bowel medication.
      The researchers goal is to assess the accuracy of bowel ultrasound in the follow-up of known
      pediatric small bowel Crohn disease using MRE and the reference standard.
