      reconstruction. Patients often travel great distances to undergo surgery. The average
      ambulatory breast reconstruction patient travels 76 km from home to hospital, with the
      furthest patient coming from 540 km away.

      Most patients receiving ambulatory breast reconstruction have a low rate of postoperative
      events necessitating clinic visits. However, regular follow-up is still considered important
      in the early post-operative phase. Increasingly, telemedicine is used to overcome the
      distance patients must travel to receive specialized care. Telemedicine data suggests that
      mobile monitoring and follow-up care is valued by patients and can reduce costs to society
      (1-3).

      Currently, Women's College Hospital is using a mobile application (QoC Health Inc., Toronto)
      to complement in-person postoperative follow-up care for breast reconstruction patients.
