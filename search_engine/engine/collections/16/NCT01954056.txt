      term and late preterm newborns admitted to the newborn intensive care unit (NICU) in the
      first few days of age.

      This study proposes to conduct a multicenter, randomized, masked, placebo-controlled trial
      within the Neonatal Research Network (NRN). This trial will evaluate the effects of a 7-day
      course of hydrocortisone therapy on short-term morbidity, cardiovascular function, long-term
      neurodevelopment, and mortality in critically ill, term and late preterm infants diagnosed
      with cardiovascular insufficiency as defined by a need for inotrope therapy in the first 72
      hours of age.
