      malignancies is determined by two main factors: the limiting of regimen-related toxicity and
      the prevention of recurrent leukemia. Over the past 10 years, considerable clinical research
      has been devoted to the reduction of regimen-related toxicity through the use of
      reduced-intensity (nonmyeloablative) transplants. However, leukemic relapse has remained a
      difficult obstacle. Thus, the need for highly effective, yet non-toxic regimens persists,
      particularly for elderly patients for whom very little overall progress has been made.
      Clofarabine is a chemotherapeutic agent with novel myelotoxic properties and proven low
      toxicity in older patients. These qualities suggest clofarabine may be a useful component of
      conditioning regimens for stem cell transplantation.
