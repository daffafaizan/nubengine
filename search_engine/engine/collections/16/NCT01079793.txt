      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum-tolerated dose and dose-limiting toxicity of ixabepilone in
           combination with concurrent intensity-modulated radiation therapy in patients with
           high-risk prostate cancer after prostatectomy. (Phase I)

        -  To determine the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I)

      Secondary

        -  To assess freedom from progression in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  To assess biochemical failure, local failure, and distant failure in patients treated
           with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  To assess disease-specific survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen. (Phase II)

        -  To evaluate acute and late toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ixabepilone followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients undergo adjuvant intensity-modulated radiation therapy once daily, 5 days a week,
      for 7-9 weeks. Patients also receive concurrent ixabepilone IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 8.
      Treatment with ixabepilone repeats every 21 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 3 months for 1 year, every
      6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 6 years.
