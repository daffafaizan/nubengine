      people who have diabetes.

      The study will enroll approximately 750 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the two treatment groups-which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  TAK-875 25 mg once daily

        -  TAK-875 50 mg once daily

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study. All participants will be asked to record any time they have low blood sugar symptoms
      in a diary.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted the Asia Pacific region. The overall time to
      participate in this study is 30 weeks. Participants will make 13 visits to the clinic.

      Due to potential concerns about liver safety, on balance, the benefits of treating patients
      with fasiglifam (TAK-875) do not outweigh the potential risks.

      For this reason, Takeda has decided voluntarily to terminate the development activities for
      fasiglifam.
