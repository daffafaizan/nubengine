    
      This is an ambispective (both retrospective and prospective) cohort study in which any major
      patient, referred for resting (transcutyaneous oxygen pressure = TcpO2) for suspicion of
      critical limb ischemia, is included retrospectively and prospectively from November 2018 to
      October 2020. Tcpo2 recording are analysed to determine specific parameters (signal
      variability and response top oxygen). A morbidity-mortality follow-up is carried out between
      12 and 15 months after the Tcpo2 measurement. A Kaplan Mayer study of these indices against
      MALE (major adverse lower limb events ) and MACE(Major adverse cardiovascular events) will be
      carried out.
