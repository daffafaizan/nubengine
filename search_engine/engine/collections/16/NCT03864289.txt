      The curriculum consists of three units: (1) Delivery of theoretical intervention knowledge
      and analysis of successful training cases; (2) Commenting and making suggestion on
      parent-child interaction videos; (3) Demonstration of intervention skills and practice .The
      contents of the curriculum involved setting up an environment, developing objectives (verbal
      communication, non-verbal communication, social interaction, imitation, fine motor skills,
      etc.), designing activities, dealing with challenging behavior. This study will help parents
      master the basic intervention skills(how to set up an environment, develop objectives, design
      activities, deal with challenging behavior, etc) . At last the investigators will evaluate
      the effectiveness of this parental training style for children with autism spectrum disorder
      in China.
