      ribavirin (800 mg/day) for 24 weeks. Recently studies have demonstrated that a shorter
      treatment duration of 12-16 weeks of peginterferon plus standard weight-based dose of
      ribavirin (800-1400 mg/day) is as effective as a 24-week regimen among HCV genotype 2
      patients with a RVR at week 4 of treatment (rate of sustained virological response, SVR,
      approximately 90%). However, for patients without a RVR at week 4 the efficacy of 24 week
      treatment remains unsatisfied. Individualized therapy with tailored regimen according to
      baseline and on-treatment virological factors, without compromising efficacy, is the future
      strategy in the management of chronic hepatitis C.

      The aims of the present study are

        1. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of low-dose versus standard-dose of ribavirin in
           combination with peginterferon alfa-2a given for 16 weeks in hepatitis C virus (HCV)
           genotype 2 infected, treatment-naïve chronic hepatitis C patients after achieving a
           rapid virologic response (RVR,defined as seronegativity of HCV RNA at week 4 of
           treatment).

        2. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of 24-week versus 48-week regimen of peginterferon
           alfa-2a plus standard-dose of ribavirin in HCV genotype 2 infected, treatment-naïve
           chronic hepatitis C patients who have no RVR.
