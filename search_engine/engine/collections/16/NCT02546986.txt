    
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, international, randomized, placebo controlled, double-blind
      study to assess the safety and efficacy of CC-486 and pembrolizumab combination therapy
      versus pembrolizumab plus placebo in previously treated patients with locally advanced or
      metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who had received one prior platinum-based
      chemotherapy regimen.

      Approximately 100 participants will be randomized 1:1 to receive CC-486 plus pembrolizumab or
      placebo plus pembrolizumab as follows:

        -  Arm A: CC-486 300 mg administered orally daily on days 1 to 14 plus pembrolizumab 200 mg
           administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle

        -  Arm B: Placebo administered orally daily on days 1-14 plus pembrolizumab 200 mg
           administered as a 30-minute IV infusion on day 1 of a 21-day cycle

      Randomization will be stratified between treatment arms by histology (non-squamous versus
      squamous).

      The decision to discontinue a patient, which will not be delayed or refused by the Sponsor,
      remains the responsibility of the treating physician. However, prior to discontinuing a
      patient, the Investigator may contact the medical monitor and forward appropriate supporting
      documents for review and discussion.

      In the follow-up phase, anticancer treatment administered following the last dose of
      investigational product (IP) and survival will be followed every 8 weeks until death,
      withdrawal of consent, or lost-to follow-up, whichever occurs first, or the End of Trial.

      The study will be conducted in compliance with the International Council on Harmonisation
      (ICH) of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use/Good
      Clinical Practice (GCP) and applicable regulatory requirements.

      Primary analysis will be conducted when 70 Progression Free Survival (PFS) events have
      occurred.
