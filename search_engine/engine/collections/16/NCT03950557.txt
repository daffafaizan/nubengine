      after general anaesthesia with Targeted-Controlled-Infusion (TCI), daily used in the
      investigator's Hospital to anesthetize patients undergoing spinal surgery. Aim of this trial
      is to define if neurocognitive tests (Pfeiffer test, Montreal Cognitive Assessment, Trail
      Making Test A and B, Digit Span Test, Confusion Assessment Method) before and after surgery
      relate to concentrations at effector's site (Ec) of propofol and remifentanil TCI, the values
      of Bispectral Index, blood pressure values and usage of drugs to increase arterial blood
      pressure.
