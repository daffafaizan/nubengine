    
      This is the first study in man of Seneca Valley Virus, a virus which seeks and kills certain
      tumors in non-human model systems. Subjects in this trial will be patients with advanced
      cancer displaying certain specified neuroendocrine features, pathologically; they will have
      exhausted standard methods of treatment for their tumor. The primary purpose of the trial is
      to determine if the virus may be administered safely. Additional purposes are to learn about
      the distribution of the virus in the body, the elimination of the virus from the body, the
      immune response to the virus and whether the virus might have some beneficial effects upon
      the tumors which the patients have. The first patients will be treated with low amounts of
      virus and subsequent patients may receive higher amounts. At the end of the trial, it is
      intended to select a dose for further study.
