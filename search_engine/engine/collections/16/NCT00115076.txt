      patient will be seen weekly for 12 weeks and every other week for the 12 weeks of follow up.
      At those visits, the patient can expect that a physical and skin exam will be done. At
      specific weeks, blood work will be drawn, clinical photography taken and a skin biopsy done.
      Two types of skin biopsies will be done after local anesthesia has been administered. One is
      a punch biopsy where a small piece of skin will be taken, the approximate size of a pencil
      eraser. The second type of skin biopsy is shave biopsy, where a postage sized piece of skin
      will be taken.
