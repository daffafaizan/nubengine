      immunocompetent animals attenuates lung injury, such as impaired alveolarization,
      inflammatory response, increased apoptosis, and fibrosis. Human umbilical cord blood (hUCB)
      is considered a better source of MSCs because of their ready availability and greater
      proliferative capacity and less antigenicity than other cell types.

      transplantation of hUCB-derived MSCs should be effective in treating BPD. The safety and
      efficacy of MSC transplantation for prevention of BPD has not been tested previously,
      however.
