      presymptomatic infants. These infants are predicted to have either SMA 1 or 2 given genotype
      and family history of an older sibling with the respective SMA type. Our goal is twofold: 1)
      to collect additional safety and pharmacokinetic data in neonates and young infants
      administered this compound, within the dosing guidelines already in use for urea cycle
      disorder therapy, and 2) to determine possible benefit of early treatment intervention with
      regard to status of denervation and functional motor status at specific time points for which
      we have matched natural history data to perform a comparison. Data obtained from this aim
      will guide future trials designed to determine the efficacy of PBA or other butyrate analogs
      in attenuating disease progression in SMA subjects identified in the presymptomatic period.
