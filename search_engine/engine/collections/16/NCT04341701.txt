      (COPD) are very common and represent a major public health problem. The distinction between
      these two diseases is sometimes difficult. In each of these diseases, several clinical
      phenotypes or biological endotypes have been defined. For example, frequent exacerbating
      patients and / or hypereosinophilic patients are present in both diseases. In the severe
      states, cardiovascular comorbidities are the most frequent comorbidities and alter the
      prognosis.

      In these chronic obstructive patients, computed tomography (CT) allows a multimodal analysis
      of the bronchial wall, the lung parenchyma and pulmonary vessels. CT also allows a score
      analysis of coronary plaques. However, irradiation is significant and increases with repeated
      examinations. CT does not allow a comprehensive analysis of cardiac function, or an estimate
      of pulmonary artery pressure.

      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a proton non-ionizing alternative to CT, in particular
      when using 3D ultra-short echo-time (UTE) sequences. These 3D-UTE sequences decrease the
      effects of magnetic susceptibility and provide morphological and morphometric information on
      bronchi and lung comparable to those obtained by CT. Moreover, dedicated sequences add
      functional information on bronchi. Heart MRI allows more analyses, such as right and left
      ventricular systolic functions, an indirect estimate of pulmonary arterial pressure and the
      amount of diffuse myocardial fibrosis.

      Our project aims to identify morphological phenotypes through the pulmonary and heart MRI in
      patients with obstructive lung disease

      .
