      minutes after apocynin nebulization comparing to placebo (0.43 μM vs. 0.59 μM and 0.41 μM vs.
      0.58 μM respectively, p<0.05). Interestingly, apocynin caused decrease of NO2- concentration
      30, 60 and 120 minutes after apocynin inhalation (3.9 μM vs. 4.5 μM, 3.8 μM vs. 4.5 μM and
      3.7 μM vs. 4,4 μM respectively, p<0.05) comparing to placebo, but did not cause any
      significant changes in concentration of NO3- in any timepoint (p>0.05). No influence of
      apocynin on safety parameters, and no adverse effects has been observed.
