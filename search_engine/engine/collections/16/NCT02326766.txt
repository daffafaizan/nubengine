      and prehypertensive subjects. Over a 12 week test period, the red ginseng group (n=31)
      consumed 10 capsules (total 5g) daily containing red ginseng, while the placebo group (n=31)
      consumed the same product without red ginseng. Fasting plasma metabolomes were profiled using
      UPLC-LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometry.
