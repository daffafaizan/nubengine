      over time. There is a growing public interest in the use of complementary and alternative
      approaches for treating insulin resistance and T2D. Blueberries, blueberry leaves and
      cinnamon have each been reported to improve insulin sensitivity or insulin action. Blueberry
      Boostâ„¢ is a locally produced Blueberry Tea and is a proprietary blend of dried blueberries
      (37% wt/wt), blueberry leaves, raspberry leaves, spearmint leaves and cinnamon.

      It is well established that improving glycemic control is important for managing insulin
      resistance and T2D and the associated vascular pathologies that directly contribute to
      end-organ damage (microvascular disease), hypertension and cardiovascular disease (stroke,
      heart attack and heart failure). We have recently demonstrated that a unique blueberry tea
      blend fully restores the vascular insulin sensitivity in muscle of the high-fat fed
      insulin-resistant rat model and is associated with substantial improvements in muscle glucose
      uptake and whole body insulin sensitivity. We propose to translate these findings to assess
      the efficacy of this nutraceutical as a new treatment for improving glucose tolerance in
      people with T2D.

      Aim: Determine whether chronic consumption (4 weeks) of blueberry tea can improve metabolic
      and vascular health in people with and without T2D.
