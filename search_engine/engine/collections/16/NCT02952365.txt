      study. This includes a slit lamp examination of the front of the eye and a dilated
      fundoscopic examination of the back of the eye. If there is any pathology noted that would
      exclude the participant from the study, then the participant will be informed and given an
      appropriate referral. If the participant is deemed appropriate for the study after a
      comprehensive examination included computerized videokeratography, then they can be enrolled.
      The participant will undergo LASIK flap lift eye surgery.

      Tissue sealant will be applied at to the edge of the LASIK flap at the conclusion of the
      surgery. A bandage contact lens will also be placed. The bandage contact lens is used in the
      usual and customary fashion as in non-study LASIK flap lift surgery.

      The participants will be seen on the day of surgery, post op day one, one month, and three
      months. The participant will receive topical antibiotics in each eye for one week following
      the procedure. The participant will receive pred forte 1% ophthalmic drops for one week after
      treatment. The participant will also receive vigamox ophthalmic drops for seven days after
      treatment. All of this is within the usual and customary standard of care for the treatment
      of participants undergoing LASIK surgery.
