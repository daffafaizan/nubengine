        -  To improve precision of tumor bed localization and definition of clinical target volume,
           and to reduce normal tissue irradiation in women undergoing partial breast or breast
           boost radiotherapy.

        -  To test whether post-operative MRI improves the precision of tumor bed delineation after
           wide-local excision in comparison with the current standard CT scan/clip method.

        -  To determine the impact of tumor position within the excision specimen upon the
           localization of clinical target volume in relation to the tumor bed.

        -  To compare theoretical non-target tissue exposure from partial breast irradiation
           planned in the supine and prone (face-down) positions.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo planned breast-conservation surgery and placement of titanium clips
      to the four radial, the deep, and superficial margins of the excision cavity (for
      localization of tumor bed).

      Within 2 weeks after surgery, patients undergo supine radiotherapy-planning CT scan as
      standard analysis. Patients then undergo a radiotherapy-planning CT scan in the prone
      position. Patients complete a linear analogue questionnaire after both scans designed to
      assess patient comfort and anxiety in each position. Patients then undergo multifunctional
      MRI (including dynamic contrast-enhancement MRI and diffusion-weighted MRI) of the
      ipsilateral breast in the prone position (≥ 3 weeks after surgery). If suspicious lesions ≥ 5
      mm are found on MRI, patients are referred for a second-look ultrasound with biopsy (if
      lesion visible on ultrasound); where suspicious lesions are seen only on MRI, patients
      undergo MRI-guided biopsy. Lesions < 5 mm are included in the whole-breast radiotherapy
      treatment.
