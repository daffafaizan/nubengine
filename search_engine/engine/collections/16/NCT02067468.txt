      (IC), repeat conventional cytology at 6 and 12 months (RC) and HPV triage (HPV) (QIAGEN-The
      digene HPV TestÂ®) for the clinical management of women with ASC-US insured in healthcare
      management organizations (HMO) within the Colombian health security system. This study
      randomized 2,661 20-69 years old women with ASC-US, insured in HMOs in Medellin-Colombia to 3
      arms: IC, RC and HPV. All women are scheduled for a visit at 2 years after recruitment that
      includes HPV-test/cytology and colposcopy either if HPV+ (RLU>=1) or abnormal cytology
      (>=ASC-US). This colposcopy is performed by a trained colposcopist and women are followed-up
      according to a well-defined algorithm. The fewer high-grade cervical neoplasia (CIN2+) rate
      at the end of following will determine the most effective arm. The most efficiency arm will
      be which reach the major effective with the minimum resource (cytologies, colposcopies and
      histologies) consumed. The resource consumed is being retrieved from the HMOs. This study
      also pretends to evaluate the acceptability of the HPV testing. This study will allow us to
      know if within the Colombian health security system, the HPV test will remain superior to
      repeating cytology and/or to immediate colposcopy as it has been demonstrated in randomized
      controlled trials carried out in outside settings.
