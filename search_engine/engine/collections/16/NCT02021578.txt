      and is especially prevalent in those of parenting age. Offspring of depressed parents are at
      increased risk of depression and therefore are a critical target for preventive
      interventions. The current study aims to reduce the rate of depression in parents and their
      children by adopting an innovative, family-based approach to simultaneously preventing
      depression in at-risk youth and in their affected parents. The rationale for this approach is
      based on (a) a conceptual model that integrates parenting processes, stress (particularly
      that which is associated with parental depression), and children's self-regulatory skills in
      the face of stress, (b) evidence that depression runs in families, (c) promising results from
      family- and child-focused depression prevention programs, (d) evidence that in adults,
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) reduces both depressive episodes and their recurrence, and
      (e) growing consensus among scientists, clinicians, and policymakers on the need for
      family-based models of healthcare. This 5- year, two-site randomized controlled trial will
      test a Family Depression Prevention (FDP) program for children (ages 9-15) and their parents
      with depressive disorders (past or current). This "dual prevention" approach is a novel
      synthesis of existing evidence-based intervention techniques drawn from child prevention and
      adult treatment models. Participating families (N=300) will be randomized to either FDP (10
      weekly + 3 monthly sessions) or a written information comparison (WI) condition. All parents
      and children will be evaluated at pre- and post-intervention, and at 6-, 12-months from
      baseline.
