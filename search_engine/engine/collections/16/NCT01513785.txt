      success rates because of high antibiotic resistance and poor compliance. Dual therapy had
      been used before and can be modified to get good eradication rate. The aim of our trial is to
      evaluate and compare the efficacy and safety of dual therapy regimens for initial treatment
      of H. pylori infection. A total of forty patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia and H. pylori
      infection were randomized to receive either Rabeprazole 10 mg b.i.d. and Amoxicillin 1000 mg
      t.i.d., for 14 days (R10A), or high-dose Rabeprazole 20 mg twice a day (b.i.d.) and
      Amoxicillin 1000 mg three times a day (t.i.d) (R20A) for 14 days. H. pylori strains were
      isolated and antibiotic resistance was measured by the twofold agar dilution method. H.
      pylori eradication was assessed by 13C-urea breath test at 4 weeks after treatment.
