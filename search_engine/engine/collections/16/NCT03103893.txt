      multiple factors such as intrinsic aging process and UV light exposure.

      Dermal atrophy, also called skin atrophy or atrophy, is a disorder manifesting thinning or
      depression of skin due to reduction of underlying tissue. Dermal atrophy is a major clinical
      problem in the elderly population. Loss of dermal integrity leads to increased fragility of
      the skin and precludes the use of intravenous lines in many cases. Skin tears are a
      significant concern in elderly individuals directly related to dermal atrophy. Impairment in
      wound healing is an important clinical sequelae of reduced dermal integrity leading to an
      increase in the number of the infections and complications following injury. Seborrheic
      keratosis, which comprise focal areas of epidermal thickening, can occur, possibly
      representing a response to damage. It has been estimated that 100% of individuals over 50
      years of age harbor at least one of these lesion. There is not treatment for dermal atrophy
      and seborrheic keritoses require excision if they become large enough to cause discomfort or
      distress.

      Therefore, there is a need to develop novel compositions and methods for treating or
      preventing certain age-related dermal conditions.

      Rapamycin is an FDA approved drug that has been in clinical use for over 15 years. Systemic
      application of rapamycin has been a central part of immuno suppressive therapy for transplant
      patients in combination with other immuno suppressants. The safety record for systemic use of
      rapamycin is excellent and few side effects are associated with extended use.
