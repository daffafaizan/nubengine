      resistance which is routinely achieved by intravenous adenosine infusion. Adenosine-induced
      hyperemia establishes an optimal vascular environment for FFR measurement. However,
      breathlessness and chest tightness are common adverse events during adenosine infusion and
      severe asthma occurs occasionally. The Introduction of an adenosine-independent index
      (instantaneous wave-free ratio [iFR]) into clinical practice offered easier and
      hyperemia-free method for lesion assessment.

      Physiological changes and clinical evaluation of iFR warrants further research. Therefore,
      the investigators conducted this study to evaluate the functional aspects of iFR-guided
      provisional jailed side-branch intervention strategy and compare clinical endpoints to
      conventional non-iFR-guided operations.
