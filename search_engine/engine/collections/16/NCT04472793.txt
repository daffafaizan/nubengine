      many knowledge gaps remain with regard to the epidemiology and transmission of infection, as
      well as the normal immunological responses after viral exposure. Cincinnati only recently
      (March 14, 2020) had its first confirmed case of COVID-19, and through shelter-in-place and
      social distancing efforts, has avoided the community spread experienced by some other large
      metropolitan areas. As investigators contemplate the gradual reintroduction of the Cincinnati
      Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) workforce back into the hospital, it is imperative
      that investigators determine the current prevalence of infection among CCHMC employees,
      measure the cumulative incidence of infection over the next 12 months, investigate the normal
      antibody patterns after infection, and help elucidate what constitutes a protective
      immunological response. Investigators have a unique but time-limited opportunity to optimally
      track the epidemiology and natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection at CCHMC, including risk
      factors for transmission and immunological recovery. RETURN will investigate epidemiological
      and immunological features of SARS-CoV-2 virus infection in a limited cohort of CCHMC
      employees, as they return from the current shelter-at-home directive toward a normal work
      environment. By collecting and analyzing weekly serial samples for SARS-CoV-2 (nasal swab for
      virus by PCR) and monthly serological exposure (serum antibodies by ELISA), investigators
      will determine the prevalence and cumulative incidence of exposure to SARS-CoV-2; document
      the antibody responses over time; identify cases of apparent viral recrudescence or
      re-infection; and create models of transmission risk among CCHMC employees.
