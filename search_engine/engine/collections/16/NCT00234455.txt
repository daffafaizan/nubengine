      and the US. All patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be treated with the
      sirolimus-coated Bx VELOCITY Balloon-Expandable Stent and Stent Delivery System (SDS). As a
      secondary objective, patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive one stent in the
      main branch with balloon angioplasty by a kissing balloon technique in the side branch
      (stent/PTCA group), or to receive stents in both the main and side branches (stent/stent
      group). It is anticipated that up to 70% of the patients enrolled in the stent/PTCA group
      will be considered treatment failures and require a stent in the side branch. These patients
      will have a sirolimus-coated stent placed in the side branch and will be followed per the
      protocol, but will be analyzed separately. Therefore, it is anticipated that up to 75
      patients will be enrolled in the trial. All patients will have repeat angiography at six
      months, with clinical follow-up to 5 years.
