      neurovascular and neuroinflammatory changes with clinical manifestations of the disease.
      Prior research studies have documented a positive effect of cysteinyl leukotriene type 1
      (cysLT-1) receptor antagonist, particularly Montelukast, on inflammatory processes in the
      brain and on neuronal injury, blood-brain-barrier (BBB) integrity, and amyloid-β42 (Aβ)
      protein accumulation. Although montelukast is currently in use for the treatment of
      inflammatory diseases e.g. bronchial asthma and exercise-induced bronchospasm, its effects on
      memory and thinking abilities and on AD biomarkers are yet to be fully understood.

      This is a single site randomized controlled trial at Emory University that compares the
      effects of montelukast vs. placebo on memory and thinking abilities, as well as on brain
      imaging and markers of brain degeneration. Each participant will undergo a screening process
      following informed consent to determine if they meet study eligibility criteria. Participants
      will be enrolled in the study for 1 year and will be compensated for their participation.
