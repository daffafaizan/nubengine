      surgical site and patients-dependents characteristics. Post surgical pain became chronic when
      it persist beyond two month.

      Chronic post-surgical pain (CPSP) is one of the most common complications after surgery.
      Nerve injury during surgery has been implicated in the development of CPSP. Some patients
      with CPSP have neuropathic pain (NP). NP is pain cause by damage or disease affecting the
      somatosensory nervous system. It may be associated with abnormal cutaneous sensation such as
      hypoesthesia (partial loss of sensitivity to sensory stimuli) or allodynia (pain from
      normally non-painful stimuli)

      Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) present a high risk of injury of the infrapatellar branch of
      the saphenous nerve, thus can cause the appearance of neuropathic post-surgical pain. Only
      few data are available concerning the skin areas affected after this surgery.

      The goal of this study is to analyse the localization of allodynic or hypoasthetic
      territories that may appear after TKA. The investigators will include 200 patients undergoing
      TKA surgery at the CHU-Amiens-Picardie. Patient will be seen the day before their surgery,
      and at follow-up visits at 6 weeks, 6 months and one year postoperatively. A DN diagnostic
      test (DN4 test) will be performed at each visits. The cartography will be performed on each
      DN4-positive patients. In addition, patients will also complete questionnaires to assess the
      intensity of pain, quality of life and level of anxiety.

      Thus, the knowledge of the localization of allodynic or hypoasthetic territories will allow a
      most efficient an faster detection and relief of post-surgical neuropathic pain.
