      al., 2013). Helping Ease Anxiety and Depression (HEADS: UP) is an adapted mindfulness-based
      intervention for people affected by stroke (Lawrence, 2019). This study aligns with the
      feasibility/piloting stage of the Medical Research Council framework (Craig et al., 2008) and
      will optimise intervention delivery and study processes, ensuring all elements are working
      together, ready for testing at a later stage.

      The aim of this mixed methods research is to conduct feasibility pilot testing of HEADS: UP
      to help people affected by stroke self-manage symptoms of anxiety and depression prior to
      Phase III testing in future work.

      This stage is a non-randomised pilot study based in Glasgow, United Kingdom. The purpose of
      the pilot is to assess feasibility and acceptability of delivering HEADS: UP, and recruitment
      and questionnaire data collection processes; identify any additional HEADS: UP adaptions.
