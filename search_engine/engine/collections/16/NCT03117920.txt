    
      MinPAC is an open label, international, multicentre phase II trial that aims to evaluate the
      effects of Minnelide treatment in patients with refractory pancreatic cancer. Eligible
      patients will receive Minnelide until disease progression unless there is evidence of
      unacceptable toxicity or the patient requests to be withdrawn from the study treatment. Once
      disease progression is documented, patients will enter a follow up phase during which data
      will be collected on further disease and survival status. If patients are unable to attend
      hospital visits during the follow up period then data will be collected either via telephone
      or via national registries with the patient's consent. The efficacy of Minnelide will be
      assessed on CT/MRI scan images and tumour and/or blood samples collected at baseline, during
      treatment and on completion of treatment.
