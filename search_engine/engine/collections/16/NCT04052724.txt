    
      Intervention is going to take a form of an Internet based Cognitive Behavioural Treatment
      program (ICBT) consisting of eight modules. These are the themes, as listed chronologically:
      Introduction, Thoughts, Stress and relaxation, Problem Solving, Communication, Anxiety,
      Behavioural Activation, Maintenance. These themes were chosen after considering topics which
      might be the most useful for someone in a role of an informal caregiver, considering the
      trans-diagnostic nature of the intervention.

      Effect of the intervention will be compared against a wait-list control group. Intervention
      is in Lithuanian.
