      a weak immune system. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy is a test that is commonly used to help doctors
      diagnose the type of lung infection and treat it appropriately. It involves passing a thin
      tube with a camera at the end inside the lungs, and taking some fluid samples which are sent
      for analysis. While this procedure is being performed, a small amount of oxygen is delivered
      into the nose (low flow nasal cannula). Occasionally during this procedure, the blood oxygen
      of the patient may drop (even if the patient is receiving oxygen, and especially if the
      patient has severe pneumonia), and the procedure may have to be interrupted or prematurely
      stopped. If the oxygen level drops significantly, an intervention such as increasing the
      oxygen flow, or in the worst-case scenario temporarily placing the patient on a breathing
      machine is required. An alternative device called 'Optiflow' can provide high flow oxygen
      through nasal cannula, and is comfortable for patients. Optiflow was approved by Health
      Canada in 2006, and is commonly used in hospitals in Ontario and around the world to support
      patients whose blood oxygen is low. If Optiflow is used during bronchoscopy, it may prevent
      the blood oxygen from dropping.
