      Mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation for OI pediatric patients irrespective of
      treatment with biphosphonates. Since MSC are inherently non-immunogenic and do not elicit
      proliferation of allogeneic lymphocytes (in co-culture experiments), a cell therapy based on
      HLA-identical or histocompatible (at least 5 shared out of 6 HLA antigens) allogenic MSC may
      be accomplished without subjecting the patients to immunosuppressor treatment. Adverse
      secondary effects due to immunosuppressor treatment will be avoided using this strategy thus
      patients may benefit from two cellular infusions. The patients will be followed for 2 years
      post their fifth and last MSC infusion.
