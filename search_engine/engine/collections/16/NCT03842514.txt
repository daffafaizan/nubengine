    
      A dietary intervention study to investigate the effect, in healthy human volunteers, of
      dietary lecithin (soy lecithin), a commonly used/consumed emulsifier, on markers of gut
      function particularly bacterial translocation (assessed by measure of venous blood bacterial
      DNA, circulating lipopolysaccharide [LPS] binding protein and soluble CD14), gut inflammation
      (assessed by measurement of faecal calprotectin), gut microbiota activity/composition (faecal
      short-chain fatty acid [SCFA] profile and bacterial diversity [16S ribosomal RNA genes]) and
      glucose metabolism (measured by oral glucose tolerance test [OGGT], plasma fasted lipids and
      insulin).
