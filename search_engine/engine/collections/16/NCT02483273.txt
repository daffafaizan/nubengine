      various critical conditions using limited suitable sites available for visualisation.
      However, ocular microcirculation may become a window to specifically cerebral perfusion due
      to related blood supply, close anatomical proximity and easy accessibility for
      videomicroscopy. Cerebral perfusion mainly depends on cerebral flow and intracranial pressure
      and therefore we aim, for the first time, to demonstrate microcirculatory status of ocular
      conjunctiva in clinical conditions when cerebral flow is completely absent.

      In a single center open label observational study investigators analyzed conjunctival and
      sublingual microcirculation using SDF videomicroscopy in brain dead patients after reaching
      systemic hemodynamic targets to optimise perfusion of donor organs. All brain death diagnoses
      were confirmed by cerebral angiography. Microcirculatory images obtained and analyzed using
      standardized published recommendations by experts in this field. Microcirculation of
      sublingual and conjunctival areas were recorded in matching number of healthy volunteers
      using same techniques.
