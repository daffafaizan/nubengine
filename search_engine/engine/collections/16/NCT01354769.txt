      Non-intubated patients - Initiation: As soon as possible after admission and/or extubation
      and no later than 24 hours after either. Termination- either 2 hours after intubation or
      after 8 hours of monitoring overall.

      Intubated patients - Initiation: No later than 24 hours after a decision to begin weaning has
      been made . Termination: Upon ICU (Intensive Care Unit) discharge or for the duration of 10
      days at most.

      Data will be collected using three tools:

        1. CapnoStream raw data (CO2 (Carbon dioxide) waveform, EtCO2 (End-tidal Carbon dioxide),
           respiratory rate, SpO2 (Saturation of peripheral Oxygen), pulse rate, IPI, alarms,
           events and any other messages generated by the monitor) will be transferred from the
           monitor to a laptop via a dedicated recording program.

        2. Ventilator data (settings and resultant patient parameters) will be transferred from the
           monitor to a laptop via a dedicated recording program.

        3. Patient monitoring parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, CVP (Central Venous
           Pressure), temperature, spirometry values etc) shall be recorded from the multi
           parameter monitors already in use in the ICU and transferred online to a laptop using
           dedicated recording software.

      All recorded parameters will be synchronized. Data will be recorded from at least two of the
      tools, the Capnostream and the ventilator.
