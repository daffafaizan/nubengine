      prolapse (POP) surgery and the effect on recurrent POP symptoms, pelvic floor activity and
      general physical fitness.

      Pelvic organ prolapse is a common problem among women and many do need surgery. Little is
      known about recurrence of POP surgeries. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) has positive
      effects on POP symptoms and quality of life. Research shows PFMT can reduce stage of the
      prolapse.

      Before surgery POP-Q stage will be measured by urogynocologist. Pelvic floor muscle activity
      will be measured with EMG vaginal probes. General physical fitness will be tested with 30s
      chair-stand and core strenght with prone bride test. An Icelandic version of The Australian
      Female PelvicFloor questionnaire will be used to assess symptoms and affect on quality of
      life.

      Participants will be randomized into two groups, intervention and control group. The control
      group gets standard care at the hospital. The interventional group gets physiotherapy with
      PFMT, conventional advise and support. During 16 weeks intervention participants get four
      sessions with specialized physiotherapist and two follow up phone calls. Follow up measures
      will be made at 12 months.
