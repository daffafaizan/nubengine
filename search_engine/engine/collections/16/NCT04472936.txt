      anteriorly by the tricuspid annulus and posteriorly by the crista terminalis and eustachian
      ridge. Catheter ablation is the first-line therapy for most patients with typical atrial
      flutter. The most common approach is to create an ablation line across the CTI, from the
      tricuspid annulus to the inferior vena cava. Traditionally, atrial flutter ablation has been
      performed with a conventional approach using two catheters, an ablation catheter and a
      duodecapolar catheter that is placed at the level of the tricuspid annulus that allows to
      evaluate the right atrial activation sequence to confirm the CTI block. Recently, a single
      catheter approach has been described using the behavior of PR interval (PRI) change during
      differential pacing over the ablation line to prove CTI block. The PRIs is measured for three
      different pacing site, 5 o'clock (medial to CTI line), 7 o'clock (lateral to CTI line), and 9
      o'clock position. CTI block was assumed when the PRI at 7 o'clock was >80ms longer than that
      at pacing sites of 5 o'clock and the PRI at 9 o'clock was shorter than the PRI at 7 o'clock.
      However, a direct comparison between this approach and the conventional one was not yet
      performed. This prospective, randomized, multicenter study analyzes the effectivity of a
      single catheter approach compared with conventional approach in terms of clinical outcomes.
      Our research hypothesis is that a single catheter approach has the possible advantages of
      being a faster, more efficient and cheaper procedure than the conventional approach.
      Moreover, as it only requires a single venous access, the risk of complications is decreased.
