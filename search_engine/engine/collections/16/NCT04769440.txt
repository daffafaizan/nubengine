    
      Background and objectives: morbidly obese patients are characterized by a high prevalence of
      restrictive lung disease. Respiratory mechanics are significantly altered in obesity. These
      changes are exacerbated with general anesthesia .Obesity also results in reduced lung and
      chest wall compliance ,increased lung resistance ,reduced oxygenation.MgSo4 is promising in
      managing several respiratory disorders.it cause smooth muscle relaxation and reduce airflow
      obstruction.

      The objective of this trial is to study the effect of mgso4 infusion on oxygenation and lung
      mechanics in morbidly obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery.

      the following will be recorded :intraoperative oxygenation,lung
      mechanics,MAP,HR,EtCO2,plateau and peak airway pressure,sedation score,serum mgso4
      level,change in P/F ratio and dynamic lung compliance,respiratory rate postoperative
