      patients with lung metastases secondary to soft tissue sarcoma treated with high-dose
      doxorubicin and ifosfamide with or without filgrastim (G-CSF) before and after metastasectomy
      vs metastasectomy alone. II. Determine the safety and morbidity of this regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      location of metastases (unilateral vs bilateral). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms. Arm I: Patients are assigned to regimen A or B. Regimen A: Patients receive high-dose
      doxorubicin IV and ifosfamide IV continuously on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously
      on days 3-13. Regimen B: Patients receive chemotherapy as above without G-CSF. Treatment on
      both regimens continues every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Patients then undergo radical pulmonary
      metastasectomy via thoracotomy or sternotomy with wedge resection or lobectomy. Patients with
      responding disease after metastasectomy receive 2 additional courses on the regimen to which
      they were originally assigned. Arm II: Patients undergo radical pulmonary metastasectomy as
      in arm I. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 340 patients (170 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within approximately 4.5 years.
