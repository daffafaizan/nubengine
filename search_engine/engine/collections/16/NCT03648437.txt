    
      Premature infants (born before 37 weeks gestational age) with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)
      are the focus of the study since no trials on the additive efficacy of these two medications
      on the contraction of ductus arteriosus are available. Preterm infants who are diagnosed to
      have a hemodynamically significant PDA and who, according to the decision of the attending
      clinician, need ibuprofen/indomethacin therapy, are eligible to this trial.

      If the parents deny the consent, the patient will be treated according to the standard PDA
      treatment: three days' iv ibuprofen PedeaÂ® 5mg/ml solution infusion (Oulu, Helsinki, Tartu)
      dosing: 10mg/kg + 5mg/kg + 5mg/kg (q24h); or three days' iv indomethacin (Turku) 0.2mg/kg +
      0.1mg/kg + 0.1mg/kg (q24h). In case of any contraindications for ibuprofen/indomethacin, the
      treatment would be surgical ligation.
