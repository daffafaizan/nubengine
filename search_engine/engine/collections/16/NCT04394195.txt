      the Brief Summary) if desired. Do not include the entire protocol; do not duplicate
      information recorded in other data elements, such as eligibility criteria or outcome

      The soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 (SFlt1) is the soluble form of VEGF-A receptor 1
      (VEGFR1). By linking VEGF-A with a high affinity, sFlt1 blocks the VEGF-A / VEFR1 axis and
      impairs endothelial homeostasis. Its production increases during inflammation. We hypothesize
      that sFlt1 is upregulated and correlates with endothelial dysfunction and outcomes in
      critically-ill patients with COVID-19.
