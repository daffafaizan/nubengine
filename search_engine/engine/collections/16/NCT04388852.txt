      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and confirm the safety and tolerability of
      valemetostat (DS3201) given in combination with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic
      aggressive variant prostate cancers (AVPC), urothelial carcinomas (UC) and renal clear cell
      carcinomas (RCC).

      II. To screen for associations between changes in the tumor microenvironment and clinical
      outcomes.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the immunologic and molecular effects on tissue samples of participants treated
      with DS3201 in combination with ipilimumab in patients with metastatic AVPC, UC and RCC.

      II. To estimate the time to treatment failure (TTF) of patients with metastatic AVPC, UC and
      RCC treated with DS3201 in combination with ipilimumab.

      III. To estimate the overall response rate (ORR) of patients with metastatic AVPC, UC and RCC
      treated with DS3201 in combination with ipilimumab (in patients with AVPC ORR will be
      reported separately for prostate specific antigen [PSA], circulating tumor cells [CTC] and
      measurable and non-measurable disease by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      [RECIST] 1.1).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of valemetostat.

      Patients receive valemetostat orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and ipilimumab
      intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on day 1 of cycles 1 and 3. Cycles repeat every 21 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up 30 and 60 days after the last
      valemetostat dose and/or 100 days after the last ipilimumab dose and then every 6 months
      thereafter.
