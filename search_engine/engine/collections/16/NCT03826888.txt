      investigate the presence of AMH isoforms and the levels of Inhibin B in serum among a
      population of participants with low ovarian reserve (AMH blood test below 1.1 ng/ml).
      Transvaginal scan for AFC and blood drawn from participants will be obtained on day 2-3 of
      menstrual period. The serum will be divided for AMH analysis using different assays: Elecsys
      Cobas assay for AMH and AnshLabs AMH isoforms specific assays (picoAMH 24/32 Pro-Mature,
      24/37 Midpro-Midpro, 17/15 Mature-Mature and 10/24 Pro-Midpro) and AnshLabs Inhibin B ELISA.

      Clinically it is not uncommon to see a discrepancy between the AFC count and the levels of
      AMH; this could be potentially explained by the presence of different AMH isoforms not
      measured with conventional commercial assays. Also, the evaluation of Inhibin B may be
      helpful for ovarian reserve assessment. Quantitation of specific Isoforms of AMH by different
      ELISA methods will investigate a possible relationship(s) between specific isoforms of AMH
      and poor responders.
