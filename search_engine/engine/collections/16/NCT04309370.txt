      no studies that have examined the effects of rTMS targeting superficial CCN structures
      (LDLPFC and LSPC) on ACC activity or CCN connectivity in schizophrenia. It is also important
      to note that the vast majority of studies using rTMS in schizophrenia have examined chronic
      populations where confounds associated with prolonged duration of illness may be present. EPP
      is a desirable population to study because these individuals tend to have fewer psychiatric
      and physical comorbidities and less antipsychotic drug exposure, all of which are factors
      that may confound investigations of new treatment interventions for this illness. In light of
      the significant unmet medical need associated with schizophrenia and the grave clinical
      effect of disrupted CC in the illness, rTMS modulating the ACC, and potentially CCN
      circuitry, represents an unexplored and novel potential treatment option.

      The goal of this project is to utilize HF (20 Hz) rTMS, in conjunction with functional
      magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), to provide evidence that rTMS targeting superficial CCN
      structures (LDLPFC and LSPC) modulates: 1) activation in the ACC during in-scanner CC task
      performance and 2) functional connectivity between the CCN structures during in-scanner CC
      task performance. This study will provide vital preliminary data on target engagement
      informing future clinical trials seeking to investigate rTMS as a novel treatment for CC
      impairment in schizophrenia. This study will also seek to refine the understanding of the
      brain circuitry that mediates the potential pro-CC effects of rTMS through the use of fMRI at
      baseline and following the course of rTMS administration.
