      are often limited in the practice of skills being taught during treatment sessions.

      Skills training focused on a particular behavioral strategy can provide parents with an
      experiential component of learning where the information learned as part of a family-based
      obesity treatment intervention is also practiced. Health education simply provides knowledge
      to a family about a topic.
