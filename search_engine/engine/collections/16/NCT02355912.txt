      available. The hierarchical control framework the investigators are developing will be
      equally applicable to any prosthetic leg that needs to be transitioned between ambulation
      modes, including microprocessor-controlled passive devices.

      The overall objective is to develop and evaluate an adaptive framework for controlling lower
      limb prostheses that compensates for changes in EMG signals. When a participant walks on a
      lower limb prosthesis, the output of the high-level controller (or ambulation mode predictor)
      directly influences patterns generated by the participant. After the participant has
      completed the subsequent stride, a gait pattern estimator (GPE), will provide a label of what
      the participant actually did. This may differ from the ambulation mode predictor output if
      there was a misclassification. The label will then be used to update the ambulation mode
      predictor algorithm such that future steps are predicted with higher accuracies. Finally, the
      resulting system will be transferred to an embedded system and tested in real-time with
      transfemoral amputees and compared to a non-adaptive system.
