    
      This is a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel, comparative efficacy and
      safety study of single-dose IV oritavancin/IV placebo versus IV vancomycin for 7 to 10 days
      in adults with acute bacterial skin and skin structure infection (ABSSSI) suspected or proven
      to be caused by Gram-positive pathogens. Approximately 960 patients will be randomized at 100
      centers globally.

      In addition, this study will characterize the PK and PK/PD properties of a single 1200 mg IV
      dose of oritavancin and evaluate the potential health economic benefits offered by this
      dosing strategy.
