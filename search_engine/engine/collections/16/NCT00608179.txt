      control. These agents produce their hypoglycemic effects via stimulation of endogenous
      insulin secretion. Oversecretion of insulin, per se, or a continued relative increase of the
      hormone even when plasma glucose is normal will result in hypoglycemia. This latter situation
      commonly occurs if a patient decides to omit, delay, or reduce the size of a meal. An
      important defense against hypoglycemia in the above situations is glucose dependent
      regulation of insulin secretion. In other words, a low ambient glucose concentration could
      regulate the magnitude of the amount of insulin released in response to a sulfonylurea. Thus
      during hypoglycemic conditions, the sulfonylurea would result in little or no insulin
      secretion, whereas its effects during hyperglycemia would be amplified. Glimepiride and
      glyburide are both second-generation sulfonlyurea drugs used commonly for treatment of type 2
      diabetes. This study will compare the two and ask the following question:

      Is Glimepiride insulin secretion dependent upon glucose concentration in-vivo?
