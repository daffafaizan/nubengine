    
      This is a single center, prospective, non-randomized, comparative, same-setting study of
      Lexiscan MPI SPECT versus state-of-the-art echocardiography. Lexiscan SPECT MPI will be
      performed per routine clinical protocol with Lexiscan administered as per package insert (0.4
      mg in 5 ml IV push over 10 seconds followed by a 5 ml saline flush). Simultaneous
      echo/Doppler will be obtained immediately before (baseline), during and immediately post
      (peak vasodilation) using conventional techniques.
