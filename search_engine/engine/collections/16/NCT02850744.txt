    
      Open-label, non-randomized, two-stage, multi-center study evaluating clinical efficacy,
      safety, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of PQR309 in patients with progressive
      glioblastoma during or after standard temozolomide chemoradiotherapy.

      The first stage of the study will enroll a minimum of 18 patients with glioblastoma at first
      progression during or after temozolomide chemoradiotherapy or temozolomide only. Following
      the completion of recruitment of patients in the first stage of the study, the decision will
      be made by the study team (study investigators and the sponsor), based on the continuous
      evaluation of safety and efficacy data, whether to continue recruitment of patients in the
      second stage while awaiting the data analyses. 17 additional patients may be enrolled for the
      second stage of the study, for a minimum of 35 patients in total. All patients evaluable for
      the primary endpoint will be followed until disease progression or death.
