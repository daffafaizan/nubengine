      karyotypically normal spontaneous primary ovarian insufficiency. We know that more than
      one-half of these patients have primordial follicles remaining in the ovary, and these
      follicles can function intermittently. This protocol permitted baseline clinical evaluation
      of patients with primary ovarian insufficiency and ongoing observation of the natural history
      of the disorder. The protocol is now in the follow up and analysis phase and is not now
      recruiting new patients. Now a major aim of the protocol is to investigate large scale
      medical sequencing as a method by which to uncover mechanisms of primary ovarian
      insufficiency and to assist in the management of women with this condition. This will involve
      a community-based participatory research approach.
