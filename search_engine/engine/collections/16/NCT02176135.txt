      approach exploits the effects of auranofin, a gold based compound which has been used in the
      treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Auranofin induces partially selective apoptosis and
      differentiation towards short-lived phenotypes of the T lymphocyte memory subsets that
      encompass the main viral reservoir in patients. The hypothesis is that the targeted memory
      cells would either die or decrease their persistence in the body, with the associated latent
      viral reservoir being reduced.

      The study will be conducted in two phases: A sequential dose-escalation phase to evaluate two
      doses of auranofin, followed by an expansion at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). A total of
      20 patients are to be treated at the MTD. Auranofin treatment is administered for 12 weeks.

      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated by repeated laboratory panel and physcial
      examination during the 12 weeks of auranofin therapy and 8 for weeks thereafter. The latent
      reservoir will be measured by assessment of the inegrated viral DNA in CD4+ cells in the
      circulating blood and in gut biopsies.
