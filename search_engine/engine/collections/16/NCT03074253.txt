    
      "Cardiovascular Imaging and Biomarker Analyses (CIBER)" is a single-center, prospective and
      observational study evaluating the expression of novel biomarkers in patients undergoing
      cardiacvascular imaging within clinical routine care. It is aimed to evaluate associations
      with biomarker expressions with ascertained cardiac imaging parameters. Furthermore the
      prognostic value of biomarkers and imaging parameters on mid-term and long-term prognosis
      will be evaluated. Novel biomarkers will comprise blood derived biomarkers including
      neurohormones, proteins, cytokines, microRNAs and metabolomics.
