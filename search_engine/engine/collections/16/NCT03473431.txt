      mg / kg ketamine in infusion on depressive symptoms assessed using the scale Yesavage's
      abbreviated Geriatric Depression Scale.

      This is a randomized double-blind follow-up study in patients over 60 years of age with
      ocular pathology who required ophthalmological surgery with retrobulbar block and conscious
      sedation with ketamine. The sample consisted of two groups: a control group and an
      experimental group with ketamine. The dose used for the study was 0.5mg / kg in slow infusion
      for two hours. In both groups the Yesavage's questionnaire was applied at three different
      times; Basally, at the end of the recovery and at 24 hours after the surgery.
