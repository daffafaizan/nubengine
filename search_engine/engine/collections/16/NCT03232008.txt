      in combination with complex carbohydrates; and B) investigating the effects of artificial
      sweeteners in combination with simple sugars.

      A) Participants will be randomly given either the placebo drink (3g of maltodextrin dissolved
      in 250ml of water) or the Canderel drink (3g of Canderel dissolved in 250ml of water)
      alongside an isocaloric high carbohydrate breakfast. Blood glucose measurements will be
      obtained through finger pricking and appetite will be measured using self-reported visual
      analog scores rating hunger, desire to eat, fullness and alertness for up to 3 hours after
      breakfast.

      B)Participants will be randomly given either the placebo drink (3g of Lyle's Golden syrup and
      3g of maltodextrin dissolved in 250ml of water) or the Canderel+sugars drink (3g of Canderel
      and 3g of Lyle's Golden syrup dissolved in 250ml of water) . Blood glucose measurements will
      be obtained through finger pricking and appetite will be measured using self-reported visual
      analog scores rating hunger, desire to eat, fullness and alertness for up to 3 hours after
      drink
