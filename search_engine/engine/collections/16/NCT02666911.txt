      the physiology within the carpal tunnel, which may help select treatment and predict
      treatment outcomes. The investigators have shown in preliminary work that differences in the
      motion of various structures within the carpal tunnel, including the median nerve, flexor
      tendons, and SSCT, vary in normal subjects and those with CTS. A clinical trial is already
      under way to assess conventional ultrasound imaging to predict outcomes of CTS treatments. In
      this study investigators wish to compare the current ultrasound methods, which involve moving
      two dimensional images, with a new technology which captures moving images in three
      dimensions (i.e., four dimensions, or 4D). If successful, a single 4D measurement could
      replace longitudinal and transverse 2D images, saving time and allowing better understanding
      of the relationship between displacements in both planes.
