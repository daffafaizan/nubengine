    
      1. The device will detect significant differences in tissue elasticity and anatomy for
           women with normal pelvic floor versus women with prolapse stage 1.

        2. The device will detect significant differences in tissue elasticity and anatomy for
           patients before and after reconstructive surgery.

        3. The device will detect significant differences in tissue elasticity and anatomy among 3
           groups of patients with prolapse stages 1, 2 and 3.

        4. The device will detect significant differences in tissue elasticity among 3 control
           groups with normal pelvic floor conditions (nulliparous women at age 21-30, parous women
           at age 31-40, and postmenopausal women).
