    
      This research study is a Pilot Study, which is the first time investigators are examining
      this study intervention.

      In this research study, the investigators are studying the combination of FOLFIRINOX followed
      by radiation with paclitaxel and carboplatin before surgery. The investigators believe that
      this intervention may help decrease the growth and spread of the cancer cells.

      FOLFIRINOX has shown to be very effective in patients whom disease has spread. The
      investigators are evaluating this regimen to see if there is an increase in curability when
      the cancer has not spread.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved FOLFIRINOX as a treatment option
      for this disease.

      The FDA has not approved Paclitaxel or Carboplatin for this specific disease but they have
      both been approved for other uses.

      FOLFIRINOX is a combination of 4 chemotherapy agents that may help shrink the tumor before
      surgery.

      Carboplatin may stop the cancer cells from growing and paclitaxel may stop the cancer cells
      from growing and spreading
