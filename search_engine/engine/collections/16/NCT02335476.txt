      technology to observe skin tissue images in ex vivo culture. Parts of melanoma or benign
      pigmented lesions specimens derived from biopsy or surgical excision specimen will be
      observed by 3D optical tomography. A tiny tissue fragment of melanoma or benign pigmented
      lesions will be taken from surgical specimen without interference normal pathological
      evaluation. The location of melanocytic cells in melanoma or benign tissue fragments will be
      mapped by the 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT). The 3D optic tomography system utilize a
      Ce:YAG optical fiber as light source and also combined with confocal microscopy. Taken
      together, these features made the 3D optic tomography system have very high resolution and
      suitable for single cell imaging. This study will not interfere with the normal medical
      practice and had no impact on patient's safety and health. All of the materials will be
      destroyed once the experiments are done. The enrollment criteria will be dermatological
      patients who need to surgical intervention.
