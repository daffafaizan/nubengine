      barrier for glucose and insulin allowing them to reach their target cells in peripheral
      insulin sensitive organ in the human body. It is well known that insulin-resistant type 2
      diabetes patients have an impaired blood flow in skeletal muscle and it is therefore
      important to elucidate means to reverse this metabolic defect.

      The investigators have in a recently published study in type 2 diabetes patients used a drug
      against erectile dysfunction, the PDE-5 inhibitor tadalafil, with known effects on several
      vascular territories, to increase muscle blood flow in type 2 diabetes patients who were
      studied after fasting overnight. In fact, the investigators observed that tadalafil compared
      to placebo increased glucose uptake in muscle in parallel with an augmented capillary
      recruitment in muscle. This was the first publication to show that the pharmacological
      principle to inhibit the enzyme phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE-5) may mediate an increased muscle
      glucose uptake and, hence, may be a novel strategy to lower blood glucose in type 2 diabetes
      patients.

      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that tadalafil, compared to placebo,
      increases muscle glucose uptake and lowers blood glucose following a mixed meal served to
      type 2 diabetes patients.
