      a short-term randomized treatment period. Subjects who complete the short-term period will be
      eligible to enter the long term extension period. Also, subjects in the short-term period who
      have an elevated blood sugar that requires additional medication for blood sugar control will
      be eligible to enter the long-term treatment extension period where they will receive
      metformin (defined as rescue medication) added onto their blinded study medication
