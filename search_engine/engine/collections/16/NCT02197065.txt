    
      -  Thirty statin-naïve patients ≥ 65 years of age admitted to New York Presbyterian
           Hospital or Hospital for Special Surgery with an acute hip fracture, or for elective hip
           or knee arthroplasty will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to atorvastatin 40 mg daily or
           matching placebo.

        -  Atorvastatin will be initiated at least 4 hours prior to hip fracture surgery, or 4 days
           prior to arthroplasty, and will be continued until postoperative day (POD) 45.

        -  Patients will be assessed daily in the hospital for adverse events.

        -  Patients will be contacted by telephone weekly for four weeks after surgery and again on
           POD 45 and POD 90.

        -  Patients will mail back study medication bottles on POD 45 for pill counts to assess
           compliance.

        -  High sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) will be measured pre-operatively (prior to
           atorvastatin therapy) and on POD 2.

        -  High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and a panel of cytokines (IL-1β, IL-2,
           IL-2r, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, IL-17, tumor necrosis factor
           (TNF)-α, interferon (IFN)-γ, and soluble (s)CD-40L) will be measured preoperatively and
           on POD 2.
