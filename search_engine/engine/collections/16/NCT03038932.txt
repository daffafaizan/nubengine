      confer risk of recurrent atopic dermatitis with a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH+), with
      ≥3 eczema herpeticum (EH) episodes.

      A small subgroup of individuals with atopic dermatitis (AD) suffer from life-threatening
      disseminated herpes simplex virus (HSV) skin infections, termed eczema herpeticum (ADEH+).
      The manifestation of ADEH+ however is not simply a consequence of herpes simplex virus type 1
      (HSV-1) infections, since the majority of the US population is latently infected with HSV-1
      from an early age. Most importantly, there is a bimodality in the recurrence of eczema
      herpeticum (EH) episodes; most individuals have only a single episode but a subgroup of ADEH+
      individuals has 3 or more episodes.

      This study aims to conduct an extreme trait investigation of ADEH+ with recurrent EH, ≥3
      episodes, compared to AD without a history of eczema herpeticum (ADEH-), using whole genome
      sequencing.
