    
      Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (T1DM) is among the most common chronic diseases affecting children,
      adolescents and adults. While intensive patient self-management can optimize Blood Glucose
      (BG) to near-normal levels, it is a challenge for many TIDM patients to continuously achieve
      this. These difficulties are compounded in the adolescent population, who struggle with daily
      self-management and therefore may increase their risk of T1DM complications.

      Due to this observation an electronic self-management tool, in the form of an iPhone
      application called bant, was developed. This app guides the analysis of BG data and suggests
      changes in treatment, while also using social network and rewards to encourage and reinforce
      self-care behaviors, such as frequent self-monitoring of blood glucose levels (SMBG). By
      primarily measuring changes in HbA1C levels, the study will assess if bant and its features
      are associated with improved glycemic control in the adolescents who use it.
