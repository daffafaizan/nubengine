      levels increase markedly in dialysis patients and are independently associated with increased
      risk of mortality. Given the fact that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death
      in dialysis patients, the aim of this study was to test if elevated FGF-23 levels might be
      associated with left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and left ventricular index of myocardial
      performance (MPI) in maintenance haemodialysis patients.

      Methods: In this cross-sectional study, plasma FGF-23 concentrations are measured using a
      C-terminal human enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit and echocardiography is performed in
      maintenance haemodialysis patients.

      Serum FGF-23 levels will be measured in patients with a history of coronary artery disease
      and aortic valve calcifications.It will be searched whether patients with MPI>0.47 had higher
      or lower serum FGF-23 levels than those with MPI<0.47. Correlations will be examined between
      log FGF-23 levels and LVMI and MPI. Uni and Multivariable-adjusted regression analyses
      regarding whether increased log FGF-23 concentrations are independently associated with
      increased left ventricular mass index and increased MPI, will be performed.
