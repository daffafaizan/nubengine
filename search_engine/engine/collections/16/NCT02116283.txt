      month. After using the smartphone for two weeks, they will abstain from smoking for 48 hours.
      The phone will passively sense and record information from onboard sensors and send that
      information to a central server. When server based algorithms detect a pattern of signals
      likely associated with smoking behavior, the smoker will be queried regarding their current
      state (smoking?, not smoking but likely to in the next 10 minutes?, etc.). Likewise, when
      smokers are about to smoke but were not queried, they can indicate they are about to smoke.
      This information will be used to update algorithms using machine learning techniques. As
      such, in this study investigators will gain knowledge that will increase understanding of
      antecedents of smoking behavior and improve the accuracy with which smoking risk can be
      detected.
