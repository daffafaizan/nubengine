      novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV2), with a
      massive impact on healthcare resource.

      In Europe, numbers of confirmed cases continue to rise. Europe is currently one of the
      regions with the highest number of Covid-19 cases and deaths due to this emergent diseases.

      Most COVID-19 infected patients present with mild to moderate acute respiratory symptoms,
      including cough, fever, dyspnea and pneumonia. About 20% will present with severe or critical
      manifestations of the disease, including pneumonia, respiratory failure and acute respiratory
      distress syndrome (ARDS).

      Emergency departments are at the front line for triaging patients with suspected Covid-19 and
      referring them to the appropriate level of care.

      In Europe, the number of ED patients with suspected Covid-19 is variable; rate of
      hospitalization from ED reaches 40% for this population.

      COVID-19 is a challenge for emergency physicians.
