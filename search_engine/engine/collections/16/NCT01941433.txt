      promote active involvement of patients in their care, and have led to better treatment and
      health outcomes. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active involvement of patients in monitoring
      their symptoms and their disease activity may facilitate treatment according to current
      recommendations, which emphasize the need for aggressive treatment to suppress inflammation
      and for using a "Treat to Target" approach where treatment is escalated until a target is
      reached and is promptly modified when target is no longer met. In this study, the
      investigators have developed an online tool that aims to help people with RA monitor their
      symptoms and their disease activity and self-manage their arthritis. The investigators will
      perform a proof of concept study assessing how the Arthritis Health Journal affects consumer
      effectiveness, patient self-efficacy, communication with health professionals, shared
      decision-making, and satisfaction with medical care. The investigators will also evaluate the
      feasibility and satisfaction with using the Arthritis Health Journal. The investigators will
      use a stepped wedge study design, in which 50 participants will be randomized to either the
      intervention group (immediate use of the Arthritis Health Journal) or the control group
      (waitlisted for 6 months). Due to the nature of the intervention, the study is not blinded.
