    
      A randomised controlled pilot trial to evaluate whether edge-to-edge technique improves
      clinical and hemodynamic results in patients scheduled to septal myectomy for severely
      symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Patients with proven hypertrophic
      cardiomyopathy and resting left ventricle outflow tract obstruction underwent septal
      myectomy. If patients were suitable for both surgical techniques, they were randomized to
      septal myectomy + edge-to-edge mitral valve repair or isolated septal myectomy. All surgeons
      were experienced at least 50 related procedures.
