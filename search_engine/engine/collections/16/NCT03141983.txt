      end-stage renal disease. Participants will be randomized to receive Anakinra, 100 mg
      administered intravenously 3 times per week at the end of the hemodialysis session, or
      matched placebo. The duration of study drug administration is 24 weeks. There will be an
      additional 24 weeks of follow-up after study drug administration has been completed.
