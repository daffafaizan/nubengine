    
      Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an acute respiratory syndrome caused by the novel
      coronavirus severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The emergence of
      SARS-CoV-2 has led to a pandemic with a wide range of manifestations. One of the hallmarks of
      severe illness is the presence of elevated levels of inflammatory biomarkers, coagulopathy,
      and lymphopenia. Lymphopenia is a robust and consistent predictor of mortality in COVID-19.
      Understanding the intersection of inflammation, complement activation, endothelial damage,
      and coagulation is critical to a better understanding of COVID-19 pathogenesis.

      This is a multisite study that will conducted at the National Institutes of Health Clinical
      Center and other local hospitals. We will recruit patients with mild to severe COVID-19, as
      well as patients who have recently recovered from the disease. Participants will have 1-2
      study visits to have blood drawn via venipuncture or available venous access and optional
      nasal and/or rectal swabs, with optional leukapheresis and echocardiogram for recovered
      patients. Leftover clinical specimens may also be used for research. Blood will be used for
      genetic testing, lymphocyte phenotyping, soluble biomarker analysis, and other research
      tests. Clinical and laboratory data from routine care (eg, basic demographic information,
      vital signs, medications, clinical labs, and radiologic imaging) will also be collected.
