      decreased ability to complete activities of daily living, increased hospitalisation and
      therefore and decreased quality of life.

      In other catabolic conditions, such as cancer or rheumatoid arthritis, exercise is an
      established treatment to reverse muscle wasting. It is uncertain whether exercise has this
      effect in the chronic kidney disease population due to an altered hormone system that may
      prevent the anabolic effects of exercise from occurring. However, progressive resistance
      training, which is exercise that is most effective at eliciting an anabolic response has not
      been effectively carried out with haemodialysis patients.

      Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether or not a twelve week intradialytic
      progressive resistance training programme will have an effect on muscle quantity, physical
      function and quality of life in patients receiving maintenance haemodialysis.
