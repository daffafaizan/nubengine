      localization of verbal working memory and translation systems in normal volunteers who speak
      English as a second language. Several important issues in areas such as language acquisition,
      cortical plasticity, and bilingualism will be advanced by an increased understanding of how
      multiple languages are represented in the brain. There are also an increasing number of
      bilingual patients who need to undergo surgical intervention, particularly for uncontrolled
      epilepsy, or suffer from a variety of neurological disorders affecting different languages to
      varying degrees. It is very important to accurately assess and localize language functions in
      these patients. This study will identify cortical areas activated by the immediate
      translation of words and sentences between native and second languages, as well as
      differences in verbal working memory systems between two languages. It will also evaluate
      differences in verbal working memory and translation systems among subjects with different
      proficiency and different age at acquisition of their second language. This study will
      advance our understanding of the cortical representation that underlies multiple language
      functions.
