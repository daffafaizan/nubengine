      dose-ranging study to demonstrate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of SPN-812 ER as
      monotherapy in the treatment of ADHD in children. Subjects aged 6-12 years were randomized in
      a 1:2:2:2:2 ratio of placebo or active treatment (SPN-812 ER 100 mg, 200 mg, 300 mg, or 400
      mg) and were enrolled in three weeks of titration at 100 mg/week followed by five weeks of
      maintenance therapy for a total of eight weeks of treatment.
