      longevity of resin composite the most frequent reported limitations are related to
      polymerization shrinkage , to overcome these problem attempts have been made to improve the
      mechanical properties , the high viscosity and material stickiness as well as adaptation of
      the material to the walls was difficult and unpredictable .

      Preheating is a method that decreases resin composite viscosity results in better adaptation
      and wettability of the prepared cavity walls reducing the microleakage.

      A new approach based on therm-viscous technology Viscalor bulk (VOCO, Cuxhaven ) a high
      Viscous composite material at room and body temperature by heating to 68 C converted to
      flowable consistency.

      Preheating composite regarding the lab research have significant clinical advantages as
      better adaptation reduced leakage and increase of mechanical properties .

      Follow up Period will be 1 year , Evaluation will be done at baseline , after 6 months and 12
      months .
