      The practice is associated with adverse maternal and child health outcomes and diminished
      long-term economic empowerment. About half of all child marriages occur in South Asia. A
      recent study in four high prevalence South Asian countries showed declines in girl-child
      marriage from 1991-1994 to 2005-2007, however, these declines were concentrated in the
      youngest ages. Namely, significant relative reductions occurred in the marriage of girls
      before age 14 years in all countries, however, little or no change was seen in the marriage
      of 16- to 17-year-old girls for any country except Bangladesh, where the prevalence of such
      marriages increased.

      Tipping Point (TP) is an innovative program developed by Cooperative for Assistance and
      Relief Everywhere, Inc. (CARE) to change community social norms and build capacity among
      adolescent girls to become agents of change in their communities, with the ultimate goal of
      reducing the risk of child marriage.

      The quantitative evaluation of the TP package will involve a three arm Cluster Randomized
      Controlled Trial (CRCT), where the arms are as follows:

        -  Arm 1: Full TP intervention including emphasized social norms change

        -  Arm 2: Light TP intervention without emphasized social norms change

        -  Arm 3: Pure control

      The overall evaluation in Nepal will start with the baseline study, followed by eighteen
      months of interventions. After the intervention phase, there will be a one year 'freeze'
      period, when no interventions will take place. After that one year, the end-line evaluation
      study will be conducted in Nepal to assess the impact of the packages.
