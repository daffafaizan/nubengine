      case of treatment failure , patients are rarely re-treated, and liver fibrosis progresses
      rapidly. The new molecules are not yet available for patients co-infected with HIV, and
      patients having already undergone a first treatment will likely be among the last to be
      included in trials evaluating the effectiveness of these treatments.

      However, recent studies show that it is possible to propose a new treatment "optimized" to
      these patients in the hope to obtain better success rate. Provide antiretroviral treatment,
      use of high doses of Peg-interferon and ribavrine, and supporting patients.
