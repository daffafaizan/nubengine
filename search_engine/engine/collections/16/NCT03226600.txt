      minimum of one site that classified as a Miller Class I, II, or III recession defect were
      included. Patients were randomly assigned to either control (CTG) or OrACELLâ„¢ (test) groups,
      which were treated with identical surgical techniques. All root coverage clinical parameters
      were evaluated at baseline, 3-, and 6-months.
