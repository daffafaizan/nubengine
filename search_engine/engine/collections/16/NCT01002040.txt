      more likely to die with severe infections than were other Canadians. Of 76 deaths attributed
      to date to this new virus, 37% occurred in persons with immune system compromise. Adults with
      human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection constitute a significant proportion of the
      at-risk population with over 56,000 affected individuals. Most such individuals retain some
      capacity to respond to influenza vaccination. The dosing regimen for the pandemic vaccine
      will be based on limited studies in the general population, leaving open the question of
      whether HIV-infected persons can respond satisfactorily to the recommended dosing.
      Availability of an adjuvanted formulation of the pandemic vaccine may improve responsiveness
      but two doses may be required for the best possible response. Thus it would be optimal to
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the pandemic vaccine among the earliest
      HIV-infected persons to receive it, to inform the subsequent vaccination of others.

      The objectives of this study are three-fold:

        1. To evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of H1N12009 influenza vaccine in a convenience
           sample of adults with HIV infection.

        2. To compare immune responses of subjects randomized to receive either one or two doses of
           adjuvanted vaccine to identify the optimal regimen.

        3. To complete this evaluation soon after the pandemic vaccine becomes available so as to
           inform the subsequent use of the vaccine in HIV-infected persons.
