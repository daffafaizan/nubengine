    
      It is the objective of the DTS.DE registry to capture the documentation of all patients who
      have been treated with a Combo Dual Therapy Stent in Germany, and who have been properly
      informed and consented with regards to their participation in the registry. All of these
      patients will be registered in the electronic data capturing system (eCRF) of the DTS.DE
      registry and will be followed and documented for a period of 12 months.
