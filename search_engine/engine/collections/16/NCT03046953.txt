      primary T-cell lymphoma that is refratory to or has relapsed following initial treatment. Up
      to 36 people will be taking part in the AVAIL-T trial at hospitals across the United Kingdom.
      All patients on the trial will be recruited over 2 years and recieve up to 8 cycles of
      avelumab treatment. Avelumab is an anti-PD-L1 antibody that will be given as an infusion once
      every 2 weeks in cycles lasting 28 days. The trial will be looking at the response to
      aveulumab, by mesuring the change in the tumour size using CT scans, and seeing how long that
      response is maintained. The trial will also look at toxicity, overall survival, and
      progression free survival.

      In addition we will analyse blood samples and samples of the cancer to understand better how
      the cancer behaves. This may guide the investigators in developing better treatments in the
      future.
