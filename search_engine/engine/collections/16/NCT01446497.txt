    
      -  Normal tension glaucoma (NTG) is the major type of glaucoma in Korea. (over 90% of
           glaucoma type)

        -  Brimonidine (selective alpha 2 adrenergic agonist): neuroprotection effect by
           suppression of aqueous humor production and increasement of uveoscleral outflow

        -  Timolol (non selective beta blocker): suppression effect of aqueous humor production

        -  Combigan (fixed combination of brimonidine & timolol): more lowering effect of
           intraocular pressure and enhancing the compliance of glaucoma patients
