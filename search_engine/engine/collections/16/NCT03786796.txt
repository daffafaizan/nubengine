      initially treated with olaparib 150mg by mouth twice daily for one month. After one month of
      therapy, the dose of olaparib will be increased to 300mg by mouth twice daily provided there
      are no grade 3 or greater adverse events experienced. All participants will be reassessed at
      least monthly for toxicity, including laboratory investigations. Radiological scans will be
      performed approximately every 3 months to assess for disease response. Treatment will be
      continued until clinical and/or radiographic progression according to RECIST 1.1 criteria or
      unmanageable toxicity requiring cessation.
