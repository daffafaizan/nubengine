    
      Vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC) is a chronic allergic disease, characterised by ocular
      surface inflammation lasting all year with seasonal relapses. Active phases of VKC are
      characterised by intense ocular symptoms and require treatment with topical steroids to
      control inflammation and corneal damage. To date, safe and effective therapies in preventing
      relapses of VKC are not available. Recently, the use of oral administration of probiotics for
      allergic diseases have been proposed. No data are available on the effects of probiotics on
      ocular allergies. This multicenter, double-masked, randomised, controlled clinical trial will
      allow to obtain more data on the efficacy of oral treatment with Lactobacillus Rhamnosus GG
      in patients affected by VKC. Patients with VKC will be treated with Lactobacillus Rhamnosus
      GG or placebo in addition to ketotifen fumarate 0.025% eye drops (standard treatment). The
      number of relapses per year, signs and symptoms of the disease, total symptom score (TSyS),
      total sign score (TSS), biochemical and molecular parameters will be evaluated at different
      time points.
