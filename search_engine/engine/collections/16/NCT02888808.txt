      gastro-intestinal endoscopy were graded using the Los Angeles classification. Patients and
      controls had measurements of body mass index (BMI), WC (waist circumference), Waist hip ratio
      (WHR), and hip circumference (HC). Bio-data was collected from both groups and data were
      analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. A p value of equal to or less than
      0.05 was considered significant.
