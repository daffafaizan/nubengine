      benefit than others. Preliminary work by our laboratory and others suggests that patient
      factors-including cognition-may contribute to differences in how individuals respond to
      altered speech cues, such as those alterations introduced by hearing aid processing. The
      long-term goal of this work is to improve hearing aid outcomes by optimizing hearing aid
      processing for each individual.
