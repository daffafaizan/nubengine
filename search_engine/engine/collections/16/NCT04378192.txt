      bordered by the risk of difficult ventilation and intubation with the subsequent events of
      hypoxia and hypoventilation. When the patient is easy ventilated, it gives some sort of
      confidence and pleasure for the anaesthetist that the way of intubation will not be so hard.

      One problem here is the difficulty of ventilating a morbidly obese patient, in this study the
      investigators used laryngeal mask airway as a bridge before inserting the endotracheal tube
