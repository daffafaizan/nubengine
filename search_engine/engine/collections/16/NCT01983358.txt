      JPI-289 treatment(PARP-1 inhibitor) showed treating efficacy more than 10 hours after stroke
      onset. PARP-1 inhibitor add-on therapy of tPA will be very useful to prevent social, economic
      loss from physical, and mental disable by stroke.

      This clinical trial progresses to explore safety, tolerability,
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic properties of JPI-289 by single dose escalation(7cohort).
      Investigational product medication of each level within 4 weeks evaluate safety and
      tolerability of patient through Data Safety Monitoring Board(DSMB) which is composed of more
      than 3 experts except principal investigator until the last visit. In each level 6 patients
      for investigational product and 2 patients for placebo will be allocated respectively in
      double blind manner.
