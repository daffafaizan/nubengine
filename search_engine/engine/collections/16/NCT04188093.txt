      developing complications after surgery. Described patient groups are monitored for at least
      24 hours in PACU before returning to the ward.

      In Denmark physiological parameters are assessed in the PACU every hour until discharge using
      the DASAIM discharge criteria (A modified Aldrete score).

      The PACU discharge score is calculated on parameters including sedation, respiratory rate,
      saturation, systolic blood pressure, puls, physical capability (if epidural or spinal
      anesthesia), pain in rest, nausea, diuresis and temperature. Each parameter is given a score
      between 0 and 3. 0 describes no problem and 3 describes a severe problem.

      The investigators will investigate the predictive value of the PACU discharge criteria and
      interventions in the PACU setting, to identify patients at risk of developing postoperative
      complications. Secondary outcome is micro events on the ward. Patients vital signs are
      monitored continuously from PACU discharge until the 5th postoperative day. Micro events are
      defined as deviations of vital parameters from normal range.
