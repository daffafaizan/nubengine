      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take alisertib tablets
      by mouth 2 times each day on Days 1-7 of each 21-day study cycle. You must take your doses of
      alisertib at least 6 hours apart with 1 cup (about 8 ounces) of water.

      If you miss or vomit a dose of alisertib, do not retake that dose. Wait and take the next
      dose as scheduled.

      Study Visits:

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-3 and then every odd-numbered cycle after that (Cycles 5, 7, 9 and so
      on):

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.

      Every 6 weeks while you are on study, you will have a PET-CT scan of your chest, abdomen, and
      pelvis to check the status of the disease.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drug for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drug if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      Your participation on this study will be over after you have completed follow-up.

      Follow up:

      Your study doctor or study team will follow you up 30 days after your last dose by reviewing
      your medical chart or calling you to see if the side effects are resolved. After that, you
      will continue to be followed up at 3 months, 6 months and every 6 months beyond that.

      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.

      Up to 58 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.
