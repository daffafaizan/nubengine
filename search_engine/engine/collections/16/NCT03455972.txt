    
      Adults ages 18-75 with high risk Multiple Myelomas (not achieved VGPR before stem cell
      mobilization or R-ISS III stage or with extramedullary infiltration or with del(17p),
      t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), 1q21+ or Type IgD or IgE or disease progression during
      treatment).

      Design:

      Participants may be screened with:

      Medical history Physical exam Blood and urine tests Heart tests Bone marrow sample Multiple
      scans and X-rays Participants will have apheresis. Blood is removed through a needle in an
      arm. T cells are removed. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other
      arm.

      The cells will be changed in a laboratory. Participants will get auto-HSCT. 14 and 20 days
      after auto-HSCT, participants will get the T cells through the IV within 3 days. Maintenance
      therapy with IMiDs was received beginning at approximately 30 days after combined CAR T
      infusion.

      After this, participants will stay in the hospital for at least 9 days and stay nearby for 2
      weeks. Then they will have blood tests and see a doctor.

      Participants will visit the clinic 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after the infusion, then every
      3 months until disease progression. A bone marrow sample will be taken at the 3-month visit.
