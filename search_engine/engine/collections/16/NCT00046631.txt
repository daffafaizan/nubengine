      The NHLBI-funded multi-centered Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls (TAAG) is a group
      (school)-randomized controlled intervention trial to increase physical activity among a
      cohort of sixth grade girls over 2.5 years.

      DESIGN NARRATIVE:

      Because environmental factors can influence the likelihood that a person will engage in
      physical activity, the study investigates the role of community characteristics in physical
      activity levels. The research forms an ancillary study to the NHLBI-funded multi-centered
      Trial of Activity for Adolescent Girls (TAAG), a group (school)-randomized controlled
      intervention trial to increase physical activity among a cohort of sixth grade girls over 2.5
      years. The parent TAAG study will be collecting measures of physical activity using both
      self-report and CSA accelerometers, small monitors worn at the hip that record acceleration
      and deceleration of movement without the need for any reporting from the participants. Using
      a radius of 5 miles around each participating TAAG school and around the homes of each study
      participant, the investigators plan to use geographic information systems (GIS) to gather
      information documenting proximity of recreational facilities, street design, population
      density, population mix (ethnic/age distribution), crime, availability of mass transit,
      neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES), geographic elevations and topography and types of
      land use. Using hierarchical linear modeling, with girls nested within neighborhoods, while
      controlling for individual level factors such as race and socioeconomic status, they plan to
      investigate the relationship of the environment to individual physical activity. In addition,
      by following girls over time, they plan to investigate whether the effect of the TAAG
      intervention will be modified by community characteristics. This study will be unique in its
      scope of exploring the role of community environments in physical activity across six very
      different urban, suburban, and rural areas: San Diego, CA, Minneapolis, MN, Baltimore, MD,
      New Orleans, LA, Tucson, AZ and Columbia, SC.
