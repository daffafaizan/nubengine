      evaluate the safety and efficacy of GRASPA®, a suspension of red blood cells encapsulating E.
      Coli L-asparaginase, at different doses and in combination with the polychemotherapy regimen
      recommended by the European Working Group on Adult ALL (EWALL) for frontline therapy of
      patients with ALL Ph-, aged 55 years old and over. Patients with a good performance status
      (WHO score ≤2) and a newly diagnosed ALL Ph- were treated with the backbone polychemotherapy
      consisting of a first 4-week induction phase comprising dexamethasone, vincristine and
      idarubicin, a second 4-week induction phase including cyclophosphamide, cytarabine, a 6-month
      consolidation phase consisting of 6 alternating cycles with methotrexate, asparaginase and
      folinic acid (cycles 1, 3 and 5) and high-dose cytarabine (cycles 2, 4 and 6) with
      Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) support followed by a 16-month maintenance
      period with mercaptopurine, methotrexate and vincristine/dexamethasone pulses. GRASPA® was
      administered on day 3 of induction 1 and on day 6 of induction 2 of the chemotherapy regimen.
