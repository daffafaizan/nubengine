      patients with Canadian cardiovascular society angina classification (CCS): II-IV and ischemic
      zones by SPECT but without any option for revascularization. Primary endpoint was to assess
      the safety and feasibility of transendocardial injection of selected CD133+cells. All
      patients were treated for 4-days with granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and underwent
      apheresis. CD133+ cells were selected with CliniMacs system and were injected
      transendocardially guided by the NOGA XP system.
