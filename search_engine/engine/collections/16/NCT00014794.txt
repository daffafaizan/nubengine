      are targeting angiogenesis inhibition as a means of halting synovial growth. Although
      clinical markers of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) activity may function as surrogate endpoints in
      trials of these new agents, a non-invasive technique of assessing synovial blood flow would
      be the ideal outcome measure.

      PET imaging has been used to quantify blood flow to a variety of tissues, with significant
      experience at this institution in the area of tumor blood flow analysis.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of H2 (15)O PET for the
      measurement of synovial blood flow in patients with RA. In 10 RA patients with active knee
      synovitis, clinical and radiological (H2 (15)O PET and dynamic MRI) evaluation will be
      performed. The feasibility of H2 (15)O PET will be evaluated by its reproducibility. We will
      also evaluate the correlation of dynamic MRI with synovial blood flow measurement by H2 (15)O
      PET.
