      dystrophy affecting children, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), Becker muscular
      dystrophy (BMD) and subtypes of autosomal recessive limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2).
      Pharmaceutical treatments for the cardiomyopathy of muscular dystrophy, including
      angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade, afford
      significant benefit and demonstrate cardiac remodeling in clinical studies. Further studies
      are needed to identify and characterize more sensitive indicators of cardiac dysfunction in
      muscular dystrophy subjects to better stratify subjects for entry into clinical protocols.
