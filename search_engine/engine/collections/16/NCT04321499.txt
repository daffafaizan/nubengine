      cancer diagnosis.

      In this study a control group consisting of COPD patients with a CT-scan of the chest no
      older than 6 weeks and a control group of patients with a nodule and ruled out diagnosis of
      lung cancer will be included.

      A total of 150 patients will be enrolled in this study. SHOX2 and PTGER4 will be analyzed via
      PCR of blood plasma samples.
