      There are two main types of lung cancer, small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell
      lung carcinoma (NSCLC). In 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in
      1.6 million deaths worldwide. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and
      radiotherapy, but in relapsed cancer patients, such treatments often have limited successes.

      In this study, the participant's peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected for
      antigen-specific T cell preparation, and/or modified using an advanced lentiviral vector
      system. Then the antigen-specific T cells, called engineered immune effectors (EIEs) or
      chimeric antigen receptor modified-T cells (CAR T), which can recognize specific molecules
      that are expressed by the lung cancer cells, are given back to the participant by intravenous
      infusion.

      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of T
      cell immunotherapy targeting single or multiple cancer antigens. The lung cancer antigens
      include known tumor antigens such as MAGE-A1, MAGE-A4, MucI, GD2, and mesothelin, as well as
      novel cancer antigens. Another goal of the study is to learn more about the persistence and
      function of the specific CAR T cells in the body.
