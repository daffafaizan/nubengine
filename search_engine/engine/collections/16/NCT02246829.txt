      first or second intravitreal injection of Aflibercept (EYLEA®) 2mg and in that event, to
      determine the proportion of these patients The analysis of the characteristics could help
      identify a morphotype that would predict whether and when the retina will dry up within the
      first 3 months of treatment. For some patients having an early drying-up, the third monthly
      injection might be not necessary 50 naïve patients will be included and will receive a
      monthly injection over 12 weeks with a biweekly follow-up. Morphological and functional
      characteristics will be recorded at each visit and will be analyzed. The rate of patients
      with dry SD-OCT will be assessed.

      The study includes 7 visits. The visits are scheduled on an every 2-week basis from baseline
      to Week 12. V1 (baseline), V3 and V5, the patient will be injected with Aflibercept (EYLEA®)
      2mg. In the other visits, the visual acuity test, Fundus photography, SD-OCT, and/or
      Fluorescein Angiography are performed
