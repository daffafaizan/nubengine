    
      Regulating Emotions Like An eXpert (RELAX) consists of 8 weekly 90-minute group sessions and
      1 booster session 8 weeks after the completion of the RELAX intervention. The first 60
      minutes of each group involve separate parent and adolescent groups. Adolescents (ages 11-16)
      attend an emotion regulation and conflict management skills group, while parents attend a
      group focused on how to support utilization of these skills in adolescents at home and school
      through use of modeling their own emotion regulation skills and use of supportive emotion
      socialization practices. For the final 30 minutes of the session, parents and adolescents
      combine and complete a collaborative activity and skill rehearsal homework is discussed for
      the week. Homework will be discussed at the beginning of the separate group meetings the
      following week. The primary overall goal of the RELAX intervention is to assist adolescents
      and parents in traveling down the Path of RELAXation by working on the three C's
      (communication, coping, and conflict management skills). A multimethod assessment of
      emotional, social, and family functioning will be assessed pre- and post-intervention and at
      an 8 week follow-up.
