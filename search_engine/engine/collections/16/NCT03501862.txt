      disorder episodes are common in psychotic disorders particularly in the acute phase of
      illness.

      Affective symptoms are a significant risk factor accounting for approximately 5-6% of suicide
      rates which remain or becomes higher shortly after a psychotic episode or hospital discharge
      (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). It has been proved that the emotion management and
      cognitive reappraisal were negatively associated with schizophrenia.

      In the study, it is hypothesized that the intervention will have a positive impact on
      psychotic symptoms, quality of life and re-hospitalization by facilitating strategies on
      emotion regulation.
