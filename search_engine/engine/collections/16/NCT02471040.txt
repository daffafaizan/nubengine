      hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp with concomitant BHB or saline (control) infusion in
      random order. During each experimental condition the participants will complete a battery of
      validated cognitive tests that are sensitive to the cognitive impairment typically caused by
      hypoglycemia.
