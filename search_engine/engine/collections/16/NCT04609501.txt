      Participants completed a comprehensive online questionnaire including demographic,
      socioeconomic, obstetric, and postnatal mental-health questionnaires. Data were verified with
      each center's perinatal database and information regarding physiological stress during
      pregnancy/birth was also collected. Fear of COVID-19 was evaluated using the validated Fear
      of COVID-19 Scale and postnatal depression was evaluated using the EPDS. Pre-existing
      maternal disability was defined as prior physiological or psychological chronic health
      condition.
