      ascending doses of intravenous artensunate (AS) to determine it's safety, tolerability, and
      PK in healthy subjects. Subjects were screened within 21 days of dosing. At the screening
      visit, subject underwent baseline assessments: vital signs were recorded; a physical
      examination, urinalysis, urine drug screen, and urine pregnancy test were performed; a
      complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential and indices, reticulocyte count,
      coagulation markers, and blood chemistry assessments were performed and medical and
      medication history was collected. Eligible subjects were scheduled for a 6-hour pre-dose
      electrocardiogram (ECG) and vital sign assessment with measurements taken at approx. the same
      times as Day 1 (dosing day). On Day 0, subjects were admitted to the clinical pharmacology
      unit to begin the inpatient phase of the study. Subjects had a brief physical examination and
      all procedures for the inpatient stay were reviewed. On Day 1, pre-dose vital signs and ECG
      were performed. Subjects then received study drug or placebo by IV bolus infusion. Subjects
      were closely monitored by evaluating hemodynamic measurements, periodic ECGs, and assessment
      of spontaneously reported AEs. Blood was drawn for blood count and chemistry analysis 6h and
      24h after each dose. PK blood samples were drawn pre-dose and approx. 5min, 20min, 40min, 1h,
      2h, 4h, 6h, and 24h after each dose. On Days 2 and 3 subjects received their second and third
      doses, respectively, of study drug or placebo with the same monitoring and laboratory
      measurements as for the first dose. Subjects were discharged 24 hours after the 3rd dose of
      drug or placebo and were followed as outpatients on Days 7, 10, and 15.
