      control and single dose increment. The test group will be conducted in the order of
      incremental dose from 150μg to 1200μg 5 dose groups, with 1 positive control groups (EPIAO).
      After 7 days of administration, the researchers looked at the drug safety tolerance of the
      test to determine whether to proceed with the next higher dose group test.
