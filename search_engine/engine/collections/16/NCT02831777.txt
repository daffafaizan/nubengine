      self-calibration to the same performance standard as its predicate device. That device
      demonstrated efficacy by showing substantial equivalence to the performance of classical
      sphygmomanometry using a Riva-Rocci/Korotkoff (RRK) measurement on the brachial artery,
      meeting a bias of at least 5 mmHg and a standard deviation of 8 mmHg across 3 paired readings
      from at least 85 patients, for a total of at least 255 paired readings.

      The study was performed at the University of Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville,
      Virginia. UVA's Institutional Review Board approved (#18686) and supervised the study for
      subjects who were University of Virginia hospital patients and staff > 18 years of age and
      who were able to give verbal consent.
