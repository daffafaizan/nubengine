      and mortality. Although the precise cause remains unknown, disturbances in the intestinal
      microbial community and changes in the crosstalk between the microbiota and the mucosal
      immune system have been linked to its pathogenesis. As current therapies are limited, there
      is a medical need for new therapies. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has been proven
      to be effective in managing relapsing Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) and preliminary
      results indicated that also the transfer of filtrates of donor stool (FMFT) drives
      gastrointestinal microbiota changes and eliminate symptoms in CDI patients. FRESCO is a
      randomized, longitudinal, prospective, three arm, multicentre, double blind study to
      determine safety and efficacy of repeated FMT or FMFT compared to placebo using oral, frozen
      capsules in 174 randomized patients with mild to moderate active UC. The primary outcome will
      be clinical and endoscopic remission at week 12. This proposal aims to examine: (a) the
      efficacy of FMT / FMFT as a therapy for mild-moderate UC, (b) the short- and long-term safety
      of FMT / FMFT in patients with UC and (c) the microbial and immunologic changes that occur
      after FMT / FMFT, to help understand how and why it works in this group of patients. All
      analyses will be conducted in both intention-to-treat (primary) and per-protocol (sensitivity
      analyses) populations, and the differences in remission rates and relapse rates between the
      groups will be statistically analysed to determine the efficiency of FMT versus FMFT.
