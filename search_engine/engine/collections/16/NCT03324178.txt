      of neurofeedback training, from Tuesday to Friday, distributed over the course of four weeks.
      Sessions will be performed at the same time each day. Each 30-min NFB session will consist of
      7 x 3-minute blocks of training flanked by a 3-minute resting state block with eyes-open.
      During the training blocks participants will seat in front of a laptop screen displaying an
      image that will change according the brain activity produced by the participant. One
      electrode will be located at the centro parietal region of the scalp (Pz) and another one in
      the earlobe as a reference. Participants taking part in the control group will play video
      games for 30 minutes during the same number of sessions, also distributed across four weeks.
      The same experimental set-up will be used, but EEG activity will not be recorded.
      Participants will follow the same structure as the NFB group, playing video games during 7 x
      3-minute blocks flanked by a 3-minute seated relaxation.

      Each participant will be involved in the study for a maximum of 5 weeks. The NFB training and
      control sessions for all participants are expected to be completed over the course of five
      months.
