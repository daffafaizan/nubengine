      observational, transversal and multicenter survey carried out during two weeks, at the
      consultations of general medicine / family medicine. The main objective of the survey is to
      describe the reasons for consultation in general medicine / family medicine. The results
      obtained from this survey will make it possible to specify the specificities inherent to the
      reasons for consultations of Tunisians but especially to the peculiarities of the local
      health system (public and private). This survey will help us to assimilate our practices and
      harmonize them in order to optimize patient care and reposition family medicine in the
      patient's care path as well as the degree of adherence of practitioners to international
      recommendations in the care of the patient.
