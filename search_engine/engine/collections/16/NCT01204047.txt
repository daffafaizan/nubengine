      life for individuals with a spinal cord injury. This ability is related in part to an
      individual's strength, power, and endurance, but it is unknown which of these measures is
      most important to achieve a high level of wheelchair function. Identification of which
      physical performance parameters are best related to wheeled mobility performance is essential
      in developing interventions to improve said performance. Currently, clinic-friendly
      assessments of a person's wheeled mobility ability do not exist. We have developed a
      modified, clinic-friendly version of validated wheelchair mobility assessment that can be
      completed in most clinics. Before it can be implemented by clinicians its reliability must be
      established. Crossvalidating it against standard measures of physical performance will allow
      for the identification of the most appropriate exercise interventions to improve independent
      wheeled mobility.
