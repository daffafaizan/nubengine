      nutritional supplement for 8 months. After documenting the ALS symptom history at baseline,
      the disease severity, and the motor muscles functions will be assessed at baseline and every
      two months (0, 2 , 4, 6, 8 months of the treatment). Adverse events and side effect will be
      assessed on every visit and throughout the experiment. In addition, the level of renal
      function, liver function and electrolytes will be evaluated from blood samples taken at
      baseline, 4, and 8 months visits.
