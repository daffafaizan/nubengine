    
      Alopecia Areata (AA) is a T-Cell mediated, non-scarring, polygenic, autoimmune disease of the
      hair follicle. It has been reported to be associated with other autoimmune diseases,
      especially autoimmune thyroid disease and vitiligo. It is more common in females. Recently,
      vitamin D deficiency has been claimed to contribute to the pathogenesis of multiple
      autoimmune disease. There is a strong inverse correlation between the level of
      25-hydroxyvitamin D levels and the autoimmune disease in adolescents.
