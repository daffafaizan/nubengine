    
      This is a randomized, open-label, 4-way crossover, single dose study in healthy male
      volunteers to evaluate the pharmacokinetic profiles of paliperidone ER tablets with slow,
      target, and fast in vitro release rates and paliperidone IR. The study consists of a 21 day
      screening phase, an open-label treatment phase consisting of 4 single-dose treatment periods
      (IR, slow, fast, and target formulations), and an end-of-study or early withdrawal phase. A
      10- to 21 day washout period (i.e., >5 times the half-life) will separate each study drug
      administration (i.e., each open label treatment period). In the first period, all volunteers
      are given a 1-mg dose of paliperidone IR solution, administered as a single oral dose under
      fasted conditions (Treatment A). On Day 1 of Period 2, prior to study drug administration,
      all volunteers will be randomly assigned to 1 of 6 possible treatment sequences to ensure
      that they receive all of the following treatments, one in each period: 12-mg paliperidone ER
      tablet with a target in vitro release under fasted condition (Treatment B); 12-mg
      paliperidone ER tablet with a slow in vitro release under fasted condition (Treatment C);
      12-mg paliperidone ER tablet with a fast in vitro release under fasted condition (Treatment
      D). In each treatment period, volunteers will enter the study center at least 10 hours before
      the study drug administration on Day 1 and will remain there until after collection of the 96
      hour pharmacokinetic samples on Day 5 if the investigator considers that the volunteer is
      ready for discharge. It is expected that the differences in the in vitro release rate will
      not affect the relative bioavailability of paliperidone in vivo. Safety and tolerability of
      the different paliperidone ER formulations will be monitored throughout the study.

      Single oral doses of paliperidone ER 12 mg tablets with different release rates (target,
      fast, and slow); single oral dose of paliperidone IR 1 mg
