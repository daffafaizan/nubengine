      I. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of increasing doses of MEK162 (binimetinib) with
      docetaxel 75 mg/m2 every 21 days in patients with stage IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
      that have progressed after at least one prior systemic therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine objective tumor response rate (RR) as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria In
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 with MEK162 and standard doses of docetaxel in stage IV NSCLC.

      II. Determine progression free survival (PFS) of MEK162 and standard doses of docetaxel.

      III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of MEK162 when given along with docetaxel.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate tissue biomarkers in baseline tumors and at the time of progression to correlate
      with clinical outcome II. Assess the activation status of extracellular signal-regulated
      kinase (ERK), protein kinase B (Akt) and ribosomal protein S6 kinase (S6K) in tumor biopsy
      samples at baseline and at the time of progression.

      III. Determine the cytokine profile before and after treatment in patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of binimetinib.

      Patients receive binimetinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21 and docetaxel
      intravenously (IV) on day 21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have stable disease or
      better after completing 6 courses of binimetinib and docetaxel may continue receiving
      binimetinib PO BID in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then annually
      for up to 5 years.
