      non-muscle invasive (TaT1) Tis superficial bladder cancer often develop adverse effects
      (urinary tract symptoms) which limit the dose (and therefore the efficacy) of therapy and
      result in poor quality of life. Genistein is a nutritional supplement with anti-inflammatory
      properties which might help alleviate adverse effects of intravesical therapy that are due to
      inflammation. Additionally, genistein also has anti-tumor and immunopotentiating properties
      and has been shown to have no known side effects. Our hypothesis is that genistein given
      together with BCG intravesical therapy will reduce its adverse effects and improve the
      efficacy of therapy. Patients (N=88) scheduled for intravesical therapy will be randomly
      assigned to take 30 mg tablets PO TID of genistein supplement (N=44) or placebo (N=44) during
      therapy and one month post therapy.
