      manufactured by Changchun Institute of Biological Products Co.,Ltd in China), retrospectively
      collect the AEFI cases reported from national AEFI surveillance system in Sichuan province of
      China in 2013, compare the incidence and proportion of local and general reactions, with
      other influenza vaccine.

      Adverse events were collected through the National Immunization Information System's National
      Adverse Events Following Immunization (AEFI) Surveillance System, which was established in
      2005 on the basis of World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. According to the Guideline
      for the Identification of Adverse Reaction after Immunization issued by the Chinese Ministry
      of Health in 2008, Sichuan CDC and local prefectural CDC must organize an expert panel to
      investigate adverse events and assess causality, using criteria based on Chinese Standard
      Procedures for Vaccination.

      At the time of vaccination, vaccinees were instructed to report any adverse event to
      physicians or vaccination providers. Adverse events that were fatal or that resulted in
      disability and clusters of events (i.e., notably high numbers of similar adverse events
      related to a certain vaccine) were required to be reported within 2 hours after their
      occurrence. The following adverse events were required to be reported within 2 days after
      their occurrence: anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions occurring within 24 hours after
      vaccination; fever (axillary temperature, >37.5°C), angioedema, or a local injection-site
      reaction (diameter, >2.5 cm) occurring within 5 days after vaccination; purpura, an Arthus
      reaction, febrile convulsion, seizure, or polyneuritis occurring within 15 days after
      vaccination; and the Guillain-Barré syndrome occurring within 3 months after vaccination.
      Other reactions that were common and minor (e.g., mild pain and fatigue) were not required to
      be reported.
