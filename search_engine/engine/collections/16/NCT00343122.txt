      is established via contrast enhanced echocardiography. One used method is the contrast agent
      agitated saline and another frequently used method is the contrast agent polygeline. The
      purpose of this study is to compare these two echocardiographic contrast agents with respect
      to their ability to detect intrapulmonary vasodilatation.
