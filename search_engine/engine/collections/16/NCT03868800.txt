      deliver the intervention by tailoring to patients' needs and using three different
      communication skills: mirroring, active listening and value clarification. The patient
      decision aid was designed to be utilised during and between the SDM-DC meetings. The patient
      decision aid is in paper format and consists of a set of tools: a decision map, an overview
      of uremic symptoms, an overview of options, and the Ottawa Personal Decision Guide. More
      specifically, the patient decision aid makes explicit the dialysis decision, describes
      options, benefits and harms using the best available evidence, and intends to help patients
      clarify their values by indicating the importance of the benefits and harms out of scale from
      (0) to (5). Four videos with personal stories were available to be shown and discussed at the
      meetings if the patient preferred to see the reason why another patient has chosen a specific
      option. Each video showed one option with a patient telling why he/she chose that option, and
      how he/she weighed the advantages and disadvantages.
