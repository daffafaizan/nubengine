      I-III undergoing to radiotherapy will be included. The participants will be allocated into an
      intervention group (laser therapy in 26 patients) or a control group ( in 26 patients the
      laser will be disabled without affecting its apparent function) , five days a week before
      radiotherapy . The low level laser therapy used in this trial will be Photon Lase III (DMC,
      approved by ANVISA for medicinal purposes). This InGaAIP laser emits a pulsed 660 nanometer
      beam with an average output of 80 milliwatts and the average energy density delivered to the
      breast will be 3 J/cm2. Skin reactions will be graded weekly by a nurse, by a radiotherapist
      and by an oncologist using the common toxicity criteria (CTC -developed by the National
      Cancer Institute ) and Acute Radiation Morbidity Scoring Criteria (developed by Radiation
      Therapy Oncology Group). The patients will answer the modified visual analogue scale for pain
      (patient self-evaluation).
