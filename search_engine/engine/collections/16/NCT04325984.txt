      consumption in thoracic patients, who were administered dexamethasone compared to who didn't
      received the drug.

      The research wants to assess the presence of additional analgesic properties, besides the
      well known antiemetic effect, in the intraoperative administration of dexamethasone, and the
      possible postoperative complications, such as wound infections and hyperglycaemia.

      The rational is to ameliorate the anaesthesiological management, in particular with a view to
      a opioid-sparing analgesia in thoracic patients.

      To do so, we enrolled thoracic patients, who underwent elective lobectomy, segmentectomy or
      atypical resection surgery with a mini-thoracotomy approach or video-assisted thoracoscopic
      surgery (VATS).

      We selected two groups: one in which patients were administered dexamethasone 8 mg at the
      moment of induction, and the other one in which patients didn't received dexamethasone, but
      ondansetron 4 mg at the end of surgery. Both groups received other antiemetic drugs based on
      Apfel score and multimodal analgesia, comprising loco-regional analgesia, opioids and other
      analgesic drugs administration.

      The we checked morphine consumption and Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) values for pain in the
      first 24 hours after surgery.

      Moreover we evaluate Post-Operative Nausea and Vomiting (PONV), intra- and post-operative
      blood glucose levels and wound infection.
