      Primary

        -  Determine the time to progression in patients with stage III or IV squamous cell
           carcinoma of the head and neck treated with bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel
           and radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Compare the objective response rate, locoregional control rate, duration of response,
           patterns of failure, and overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for 8 weeks and receive
      docetaxel IV over 1 hour once a week for 8 weeks. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes once every 2 weeks for up to 1 year.

      Approximately 8-10 weeks after the completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients may undergo neck
      dissection. Bevacizumab, which stops 8 weeks before surgery, may restart 4 weeks after
      surgery and continue for 9 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
