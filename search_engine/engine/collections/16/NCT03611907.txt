      retrieval in the last four years the choice of the needle is an operator choice, usually
      influenced by the number of follicles present at human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) trigger.

      This prospective randomized controlled clinical trial is designed to highlight differences
      between Double Lumen Aspiration Needle and Single Lumen Needle among 2 double lumen and 2
      single lumen needles commonly used in Humanitas' clinical practice in terms of:

      Number of oocytes retrieved, oocyte recovery percentage per aspirated follicles, recovery
      time for single oocyte, percentage of Metaphase II (MII) oocytes retrieved.

      Standard protocols will be used for controlled ovarian hyper stimulation. Trans vaginal
      ultrasound-guided oocyte retrieval will be performed 36 hours Â± 2 after hCG injection with
      the patient under deep sedation.

      One hundred patients per each needle will be enrolled in this trial.
