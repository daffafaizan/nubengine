    
      This is a single arm, prospective study of 625 HIV-positive women attending ART clinics in
      Lilongwe, Malawi. The primary objectives of this study are to assess completion of a novel
      ICC screen-and-treat strategy among HIV-positive women in Lilongwe, Malawi, using
      self-collected vaginal brush for hr-HPV testing, followed by same-day VIA and
      thermocoagulation for HPV-positive/VIA-positive/ablation-eligible (by colposcopy) women, and
      to determine the 24-week efficacy of thermocoagulation among HIV-positive women with CIN2/3.
      The secondary objective will be to evaluate the performance of the ICC screen-and-treat
      strategy by estimating overtreatment for women who are
      HPV-positive/VIA-positive/ablation-eligible, and undertreatment among
      HPV-positive/VIA-negative women.
