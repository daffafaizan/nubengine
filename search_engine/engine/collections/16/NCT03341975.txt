    
      In a randomized controlled trial at a pediatric emergency department, sexually active
      adolescents will receive the control (i.e., printed materials) or intervention (i.e.,
      motivationally-guided facilitation) arm delivered by a health educator. The tablet-based,
      interactive intervention includes motivational techniques to promote risk reduction, condom
      skills training, and tailored service recommendations. The primary outcome is uptake of â‰¥1
      service at the index visit (i.e., counseling, condoms, emergency contraception for immediate
      or future use, pregnancy/sexually transmitted infection (STI)/HIV testing, STI treatment, and
      clinic referral). We assess feasibility (i.e., intervention completion, recommendations
      discussed, and satisfaction). Participants report sexual risk and care-seeking behaviors at
      2, 4, and 6 months. We compare uptake between arms using Fisher exact tests.
