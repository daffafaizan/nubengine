      language instruments to measure knowledge of and attitudes towards biospecimen donation and
      banking, as well as intention to donate biospecimens to a biobank (Part A). Once developed,
      the instruments will be used to evaluate biobanking educational priming tools by conducting
      two independent RCTs. Wherein English educational materials will be tested with 75
      participants recruited from an urban clinic, and Spanish educational materials will be tested
      with 75 participant recruited form a rural community health center network. For each RCT
      following baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to either: 1) educational
      priming tools (DVD and booklet) developed by the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN);
      or 2) an NCI-developed brochure entitled "Providing Your Tissue for Research: What You Need
      to Know." Seven to 28 days later participants will be given a telephone follow up interview.
