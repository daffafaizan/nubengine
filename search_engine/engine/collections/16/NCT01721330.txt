      of adult ADHD with naltrexone monotherapy. Eligible and consenting subjects will be recruited
      into the study. The first visit will consist of a meeting with a study clinician who obtains
      consent, assesses for eligibility, and completes study rating scales. After this evaluation,
      subjects will complete a neuropsychological assessment and study rating scales (two hours;
      this visit can take place over multiple days, if necessary). Subjects will then be randomized
      to naltrexone (50 mg) once a day with breakfast or placebo at a ratio of 1:1 to be increased,
      if tolerated, to 100 mg by week 1.

      Blood will be drawn for prolactin, basic metabolic panel, CBC, and LFT's at pre-baseline and
      upon completion of the study. Ten cc's (approximately two teaspoons) of blood will be
      required for the basic metabolic panel, CBC, and LFT's at each drawing. An additional five
      cc's (approximately one teaspoon) of blood will be required for laboratory testing of
      prolactin levels at each drawing. Dipstick urine drug testing will be done at pre-baseline.

      Women of child bearing age will also have a urine pregnancy test at pre-baseline.

      Although every effort will be made to encourage subjects to keep regularly scheduled
      appointments, in the event that a subject is unable to come into the office within a
      reasonable timeframe of a scheduled visit, and the treating research clinician feels that
      subject safety will not be jeopardized by doing so, the clinician can conduct the visit with
      the subject over the telephone. However, study evaluation visit (pre-baseline), baseline
      visit, mid-point visit (week 3), or the final study visit may not be conducted over the
      phone. Additionally, phone visits may not occur for two consecutive visits.
