      recent study that a brief 15-minute hypnosis intervention was effective in reducing a number
      of common side effects, including pain, fatigue and nausea. The scripted session includes a
      relaxation-based induction, suggestions for pleasant visual imagery, suggestions to
      experience relaxation and peace, and specific symptom-focused suggestions. The intervention
      will be professionally translated into Norwegian, and adapted and modified as necessary to
      the specific context of this study. The PI, who is a an experienced clinical psychologist,
      will hold the session in the pilot study. Patients will further be instructed to use hypnosis
      on their own following the intervention session.

      The patients will further be invited to participate in semi-structured interviews upon
      completion of the intervention, either by phone or in person, to discuss their experiences
      with the intervention, and share any advice for modifications or changes to the interventions
      or procedures. Systematic text condensation will be applied in the analyses of the
      interviews.
