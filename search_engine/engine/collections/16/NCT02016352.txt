      and therapeutic decision-making. But the low protein concentration in CSF and the low volumes
      typically obtained after lumbar puncture precludes the conventional use of proteomic
      analysis. We miniaturized the method to be compatible with low-volume samples by combination
      of nanoLC-MS/MS analysis and combinatorial peptide ligand library technology to reduce the
      dynamic range of protein concentration in CSF and unmask previously undetected proteins. We
      demonstrated that this deep proteomic analysis allows profiling the CSF proteome with a
      reasonable depth, in short analytical times and good accuracy. We settled a
      clinically-compatible proteomics strategy targeting the deep CSF proteome discovery.

      The PROLIPHYC study is a prospective study that aims at analysing CSF proteome with our new
      strategy in a cohort of patients suspected of normal pressure hydrocephalus and/or related
      neurodegenerative diseases. The PROLIPHYC project combines detailed clinical and
      neuropsychological evaluation, gait analysis, MRI brain imaging, lumbar CSF dynamics and deep
      proteome. We hypothesize in the PROLIPHYC study that a specific cluster of polypeptides can
      be associated with Alzheimer disease, vascular dementia and normal pressure hydrocephalus
      profiles. Validating this hypothesis might be a significant step towards a proteomic lexicon
      of aging brain, neurodegenerative diseases and dementia.

      Neurosciences department and Alzheimer disease centre from the Toulouse University Hospital
      are both involved in this project. The deep proteomic study is performed in Toulouse by the
      Institute of Pharmacology and Structural Biology with the academic support of the Institute
      of Mathematics of Toulouse.
