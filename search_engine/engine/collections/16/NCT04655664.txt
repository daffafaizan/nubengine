      which indicate circulating vitamin D levels. While serum 1.25 (OH) D levels are less
      frequently utilized, they represent the active form of vitamin D and could be a substitute
      for checking vitamin D levels.This study aims to find the correlation between vitamin D
      levels, namely 25 (OH) D and 1.25 (OH) D saliva, which correlate with serum 25 (OH) D and
      1.25 (OH) D levels in the examination of salivary vitamin D, and which could be a substitute
      for checking serum vitamin D levels.This study is a cross-sectional study involving healthy
      men and women, aged 20-50 years, from Lima Puluh Village, Batubara District, North Sumatra
      Province, Indonesia. The parameters studied were 25 (OH) D and 1.25 (OH) D levels of saliva
      and serum.
