      own stem cells and/or platelet rich plasma and deliver the product back to the patient
      same-day through an intravenous catheter. This study is limited to patients diagnosed with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is a double-blinded prospective, cohort
      trial using cross-over methodology. The aim of this study is to determine if stem cell
      therapy is better than placebo among a group of patients with COPD.

      50 participants will be recruited for each arm of the study.

      Cohort A will receive three days of cell therapy using the venous procedure (three
      consecutive days of blood harvest, cell separation and cell application). Cohort A will
      return in three months and receive three consecutive days of placebo.

      Cohort B will receive three consecutive days of placebo. Cohort B will return in three months
      and receive three consecutive days of cell therapy using the venous procedure.
