      taking more than the standard approved dose. This dosing is required to attain adequate
      control of the gastric and intraesophageal pH in order to affect the desired clinical
      improvement. It is recognized that the b.i.d dosing strategy increases the intragastric pH
      control of <4 from approximately 12 hours to almost 16 hours. The refinement of the S isomer
      of omeprazole (Nexium)has led to a way to more effectively control acid exposure. Comparative
      trials with all the PPIs have shown significantly greater pH control of <4 and head to head
      comparisons as well as a recent crossover study. One study suggests that Nexium dosing
      contains approximately 16.5 hours of a pH control of <4. Conceivably, this duration of pH
      control suggests that b.i.d. dosing of other PPIs might be avoided. Furthermore, it suggests
      that patients currently taking b.i.d. PPIs might be successful candidates for conversion to
      q.d. Nexium. This would provide a considerable cost implication to health care plans and for
      patients who are responsible for paying for their PPI therapy. To date, esomeprazole has not
      been studied in comparison to b.i.d. dosing with other PPIs. There is pharmacologic evidence
      to suggest, however, that it is comparable. In this proposed study, we believe that by
      beginning with patients who were well controlled should make for a cleaner definition and a
      higher likelihood to demonstrate efficacy.
