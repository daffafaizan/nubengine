      environment, where antibiotics are frequently ordered in electronic medical record systems as
      a one-time dose and the second dose is delayed or missed. This has been described in the
      literature, a 2017 article in Critical Care Medicine noted in a single academic center that
      33% of sepsis cases had 2nd-dose-antibiotic delays greater than 25% of the recommend interval
      and this was associated with significantly increased hospital mortality (OR 1.61) and
      mechanical ventilation (OR 2.44).

      An Epic Best Practice Advisory (BPA) was created by the Mass General Brigham eCare Decision
      Support team to address this patient safety concern. The BPA alerts providers in the ED or ED
      Observation when the next dose of broad-spectrum antibiotic dose is due for a patient if no
      future administration has been ordered, based on patient characteristics (such as renal
      function) and antibiotic selection. The objective of this study is to analyze the impact of
      this BPA on our performance in terms of on-time antibiotics through a randomized controlled
      trial. Patients whose medical record number (MRN) are odd will be assigned to the treatment
      group, while those whose MRNs are even will be assigned to the control group. The BPA will
      only be displayed to the patient's providers for the treatment group. We will then compare
      the performance of on-time antibiotics between the groups and the resulting impact on patient
      outcomes, such as overall hospital length of stay, admission to the intensive care unit
      (ICU), and in-hospital mortality.
