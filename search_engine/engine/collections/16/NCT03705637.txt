      their burns. As a result, they often require considerable amounts of narcotics. Given the
      concern for opiate addiction and the national opiate crisis the investigators have tried to
      explore other non-opiate means of pain control. One of the newest methods for pain relief is
      with liposomal bupivacaine, which can provide local analgesia for up to 72 hours at the site
      of injection. This medication has been used with good effect in multiple contexts.

      Skin graft donor sites are the most painful portion of their surgical treatment and the pain
      typically is most severe during the first few days after surgery. For this reason, the
      investigators believe the addition of Exparel to the donor site will help with improved
      multi-modal pain control, making patients more comfortable. It also may decrease opiate
      requirements which would be beneficial for burn patients.

      Few previous studies have been conducted using Exparel at the donor sites of skin grafted
      burn patients. One case series compares usage of Exparel from two different institutions,
      however the sample size at each was relatively small (n=20, 5, respectively). Their findings
      suggest that Exparel may be an effective way of managing postsurgical donor site pain. Based
      on these limited data there is a need for more robust studies, which is the motivation for
      doing this larger evaluation of patients.

      The investigators believe that the use of Exparel can decrease pain for patients after
      surgery, in particular at their skin graft donor sites. The investigators want to conduct
      this study to evaluate whether Exparel can improve pain control for their patients and
      decrease their need for opiate narcotics.
