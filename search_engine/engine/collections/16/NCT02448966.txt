      radical esophagectomy is the cornerstone of multimodality treatment with curative intent.
      Transthoracic esophagectomy is the preferred surgical approach worldwide allowing for en-bloc
      resection of the tumor. However, the percentage of cardiopulmonary complications associated
      with the traditional three-incision esophagectomy is high.Recent studies have shown that the
      minimally invasive thorascopic and laparoscopic esophagectomy is at least equivalent to the
      open transthoracic approach for esophageal cancer in terms of short-term oncological
      outcomes,including reduced blood loss, shorter ICU stay,and lower pulmonary complication
      rate, but the evidence is not ample because the sample size is not enough.The objective of
      this study is to compare the efficacy, perioperative complications, lymph node dissection and
      long term survival between the thoracic esophageal cancer patients treated by minimally
      invasive thorascopic/laparoscopic esophagectomy and open transthoracic esophagectomy by three
      incisions.
