      and the obturator nerve accessible to ultrasound-guided regional anaesthesia. This technique,
      also called the PENG block, has recently been described with a substantial benefit on pain at
      rest and induced by mobilization in cases series of patients undergoing hip fracture surgery.
      To investigators knowledge, no randomized data concerning the analgesic efficacy of the PENG
      block has been published in the setting of elective total hip arthroplasty.

      The PENG block would allow a significant analgesic contribution when added to intra- and
      peri-articular infiltration of local anaesthetics while being well tolerated with few
      undesirable effects. Moreover, the PENG block could spare the motor function of the
      quadriceps and adductor muscles allowing enhanced recovery after surgery
