      first undergo chemotherapy or hormonal therapy. The main goal of the therapy is to reduce the
      size of the tumor before it is removed. Unfortunately, therapy response varies a lot between
      patients. The development of an effective therapy response monitoring method could reduce the
      time that a patient undergoes ineffectual therapy or unnecessary therapy after complete
      response.

      Dedicated breast computed tomography (or breast CT), a new way of imaging the breast, has
      been introduced in the last few years. Breast CT is an x-ray exam that uses 3D imaging to
      show the breast in its real three dimensional shape. Combined with the use of special
      chemicals called iodine contrast enhancement, breast CT can provide images of both the
      anatomy and the blood flow in the breast. We propose to use breast CT to carefully monitor
      the response to therapy of breast cancer patients undergoing therapy before surgery.
