      pathological process where a central role is played by the progressive loss of the
      microvascular bed, with the consequent fibrotic changes in the involved organs and tissues.

      The most advanced stages of capillary loss may induce the formation of digital ulcers (DUs)
      on the fingertips.The healing of DUs is often a lengthy process requiring accurate and
      intensive topical and systemic treatment. Nevertheless, in a significant number of cases this
      therapeutic approach is ineffective and distal necrosis with subsequent tissue loss or
      phalangeal amputation may eventually occur.

      In a recent open pilot study performed by Del Papa et al., it has been demonstrated that
      autologous adipose tissue grafting (AT-G), which is known to contain both adipose-derived
      stem cells and a stromal/vascular fraction, was effective in inducing prompt healing of long
      lasting DUs localized in the fingertips of a small number of patients with SSc. The DU
      healing was accompanied by the rapid disappearance of local ischemic pain and evidence of a
      partial restoration of the capillary bed in the digits when assessed by nailfold
      videocapillaroscopy (NVC).

      With the purpose of confirming these preliminary results, the investigators have designed a
      monocentric randomized controlled study. In accordance with the study protocol, patients with
      a typical SSc-related DU on the fingertip will be randomized to undergo a regional AT-G with
      autologous fat as active therapy or a 'sham' procedure (SP) - that simulates the active
      treatment - as placebo treatment. All of the patients with SSc enrolled in both arms will be
      blind regarding the treatment received. Furthermore, during the study period all of the
      enrolled patients will receive the same systemic vasoactive and topical therapy.
