    
      The study will be conducted in a group of 200 people aged 19-25. Posture assessment will
      concern the measurement of curvatures in the sagittal plane of the spine using a
      gravitational Rippstein plurimeter and performing a three-dimensional analysis of the spine
      using the DIERS 3D device. In addition, a modified Matthias test will be performed using the
      DIERS 3D device, where kyphosis and lordosis parameters in the sagittal plane of the spine at
      isometric tension of the spinal muscles will be assessed. The spinal motion in the sagittal
      and frontal planes will also be measured using a digital inclinometer. In the second stage of
      the study, the participants will participate in the activity in the form of endurance
      training "Nordic Walking" (NW) for a period of 8 weeks 3 times a week. The recording of
      energy expenditure during a normal day of activity will be done using an Actigraph GT3X
      accelerometer. After a period of 8 weeks, all measurements will be repeated.
