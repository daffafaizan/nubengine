      thoracolumbar SCI who are already undergoing routine UDS studies as part of their care.
      Following their routine UDS, a non-functioning UroMonitor device will be inserted and removed
      after 3 hours. Participants' symptoms will be monitored after the UroMonitor is inserted,
      following the 3 hour monitoring period, and again after UroMonitor removal. A second
      cystoscopy will be conducted for research purposes after removal to examine the urethra and
      bladder for any irritation or trauma. During insertion and removal, the urologist will
      document the time required for insertion and any difficulties encountered
