      MAGE-A4-specific TCR gene transduced T lymphocytes are transferred to HLA-A*24:02 positive
      patients with solid tumors which are 1) unresectable, refractory to standard therapy
      (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, etc), metastatic or recurrent, and 2) MAGE-A4-expressing. The
      primary objective is to evaluate the safety and in vivo kinetics, and the secondary is to
      evaluate clinical effect.
