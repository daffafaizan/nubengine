    
      This is a 28-day micro-randomized pilot trial (i.e., a sequential factorial design) of a
      just-in-time adaptive intervention (JITAI) called AYA ADAPTS (ADherence Assessments and
      Personalized Timely Support). AYA ADAPTS is an app that integrate contextually-tailored
      mobile messages designed to promote oral chemotherapy adherence. Participants in the study
      will electronically-monitor 6MP adherence with MEMS TrackCaps and complete short ecological
      momentary assessment (EMA) surveys each afternoon, at the same time prior to the evening 6MP
      dose, for the 28-day period.

      AYA ADAPTS will deliver contextually-tailored text messages triggered based on EMA responses
      (e.g., based on fatigue, mood) and objective data (e.g., time of day, weekend vs. weekday).
      After receiving a contextually-tailored message, AYA will be asked to acknowledge receipt of
      the message by pressing a "thumbs up" or "thumbs down" button, to indicate whether or not
      they liked the message, or a "snooze" button indicating that it was not a good time to
      receive the message.

      Following the 28-day intervention period, MEMS TrackCaps will be returned and downloaded
      during the clinic appointment. AYA will complete a brief acceptability survey electronically
      via REDCAP, rating AYA ADAPTS on a 5-point Likert scale to assess satisfaction, perceived
      appropriateness, perceive positive effects, perceived demands, and potential for future use.
      Exit interviews will also be conducted, audio-recorded, and transcribed to further assess
      acceptability. For feasibility, the following variables will be tracked: (1) screening rates,
      (2) recruitment rates, (3) % acknowledged micro-randomized messages, (4) technical
      difficulties (e.g., micro-randomized messages received when intended), (5) retention rates,
      and (6) completed assessments (EMA, MEMS, post-measures).
