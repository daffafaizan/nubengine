      communication and exposure of tumor to peritoneum. Recently, endo-laparoscopic full-thickness
      resection with simple suturing technique which did not expose gastric mucosa to peritoneum
      (simple non-exposure EFTR) was developed. This new technique includes the steps of
      laparoscopic seromuscular suturing with a barbed suture thread (V-Loc), which results in
      inversion of the stomach wall; EFTR of the inverted stomach wall from inside the stomach; and
      finally, endoscopic mucosal suturing with endoloops and clips.

      This study evaluates the feasibility of simple non-exposure EFTR technique in patients with
      gastric tumor. This study is single arm study and will be performed in single center.
