    
      This four-period crossover study with 12 treatment sequences includes relacorilant
      administered at therapeutic (400 mg once daily [QD]) and supra-therapeutic (800 mg QD) doses,
      placebo for relacorilant as a negative control, and oral moxifloxacin as a positive control.
      The positive control will serve to determine the sensitivity of the assay to detect small
      increases from baseline in the QTc interval. Each of the four treatment periods will last 5
      days with a washout of at least 10 days between periods. Relacorilant and placebo to
      relacorilant will be administered double-blind; moxifloxacin will be administered open label.
