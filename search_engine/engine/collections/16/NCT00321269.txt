      Between 4 and 5% of patients seen at Veterans Affairs Medical Centers suffer heart failure.
      HF is the number one discharge diagnosis within the VHA. One of the most significant
      comorbidities in heart failure is depression. Depression predicts increased hospitalization
      and mortality even after controlling for key prognostic indicators. This HSR&D study aimed to
      test the effectiveness of a psychotherapy intervention for depression combined with illness
      management to illness management alone in veterans with heart failure.

      Objectives:

      To demonstrate better depression, health-related quality-of-life, and adherence outcomes for
      an illness management combined with psychotherapy intervention (COMBO) as compared to an
      illness management alone program (IMO).

      Methods:

      This was a two-site, two-arm, randomized controlled trial comparing COMBO to IMO. The total
      number of patients recruited for the study was 148. Retention was comparable between groups,
      though depression severity predicted drop out in the IMO condition but not the COMBO
      condition. Patients completed study assessments at baseline, week 4, week 8
      (post-intervention) and at 26- and 52-week follow-up.

      Status:

      The main study analyses have been conducted. The project team is conducting analysis of
      secondary hypotheses
