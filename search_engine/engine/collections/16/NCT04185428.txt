      consisting of still meditation, meditative movement, relaxation techniques, and massage
      therapy to patients at the bedside. This mixed methods feasibility pilot aims to move toward
      optimal use of the Integrative Therapies service amongst AML patients undergoing induction
      chemotherapy by: 1) examining the feasibility and acceptability of this intervention and
      describing the distribution of variables, 2) developing a greater understanding of patient
      experience, and 3) exploring facilitators and barriers to engagement with the service. The
      investigators intend to use the data collected from this study to inform a subsequent
      multi-site study with a larger sample size and adjustments depending on the results from this
      investigation.

      The study team will also explore the acceptability to participation in Integrative Therapies
      bedside service by conducting a qualitative, phenomenological thematic analysis of patient
      interviews. The intent of a convergent design is to merge the analyses of the quantitative
      and qualitative data that are gathered during the implementation of Integrative Therapies
      bedside service.
