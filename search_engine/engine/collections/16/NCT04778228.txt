      process of the Lungs, characterized clinically by severe hypoxemia and bilateral pulmonary
      infiltrates. The hospital mortality ranges between 35% and 45% (1). Traditionally, critically
      ill patients requiring mechanical ventilation (MV) were ventilated using high tidal volumes
      (Vt) and high airway pressures, until the pivotal ARDS net randomized controlled trial (RCT)
      demonstrated that a "lung-protective" MV strategy using a Vt of 4-8 mL/kg predicted body
      weight (PBW) and moderate levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) improved survival
      (2).

      The driving pressure (DP) (calculated as the Pplat minus applied PEEP) has been suggested as
      a major determinant for the beneficial effects of the three main components of
      lung-protective MV, namely, Vt, Pplat, and PEEP. and also a given DP would have different
      effects on outcome depending on the Vt, Pplat, and PEEP (3).

      A retrospective analysis of several trials in patients with ARDS comparing different PEEP
      levels at the same VT or different VT levels at the same PEEP, or a combination of both,
      found that Î”Prs is the stronger predictor of mortality as compared with Pplats (3).
