      (RCT). Randomization (WE, WE + cap) will be based on computer generated random numbers placed
      inside opaque sealed envelopes. The envelope (in pre-arranged order set up by statistics
      consultant) will be opened to reveal the code when the colonoscopist is ready to insert the
      endoscope to begin the examination. This will be a comparison of two arms (WE, WE + cap) to
      see which one is less painful.

      Patients who are willing to participate will sign an informed consent before starting the
      colonoscopy procedure. Separate parallel randomization will be set up at each site,
      stratified type of colonoscopy (screening, surveillance, diagnostic). All subjects will have
      scheduled unsedated colonoscopy as a result of lack of escort or personal preference for no
      sedation. Randomization will be set up by statistics consultant.

      Control Method: One arm of the study will include unsedated colonoscopy with water exchange
      (WE) as the control method. Residual air in the colon will be removed and water will be
      infused to guide insertion through an airless lumen. Infused water will be removed by
      suction, along with residual fecal debris, predominantly during insertion.

      Study method: The other arm will include unsedated colonoscopy with water exchange (WE) and
      the addition of a cap, fitted to the colonoscope per manufacturer instruction.
