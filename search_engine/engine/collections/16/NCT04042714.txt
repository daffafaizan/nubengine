      For intermediate/high grade and poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas (NEC) that
      occur outside the lung, there is no acceptable standard of care. Most patients are treated
      with a platinum-based chemotherapy in the front-line setting and evidence for therapies in
      the second line setting is minimal representing a significant unmet need. However, the
      response rates have been unsatisfactory with progression-free survival of only 2.3 to 6.2
      months, and there is an unmet need for an effective treatment for patients with refractory
      disease.

      TAS-102 is a novel combination medicinal product consisting of a thymidine-based nucleoside
      analogue (trifluridine; FTD) as the active component and the thymidine phosphorylase
      inhibitor tipiracil hydrochloride (TPI) that has shown promising activity in phase I trials
      in patients with solid tumors and phase II in patients with gastric cancer. FTD enters cancer
      cells, interferes with DNA synthesis, inhibits cell proliferation and inhibit tumor growth.
      TPI helps FTD sustain its level in cells without degradation by thymidine phosphorylase
      (Tpase).Thus TAS-102 uses dual approach to inhibit rapid degradation of trifluridine and
      subsequent tumor growth.

      Given the safety profile and efficacy, the study is designed to explore/evaluate efficacy of
      TAS-102 and identify characteristics of patients who may respond to this treatment.
