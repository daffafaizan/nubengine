      keratinized mucosa KM (gingiva-like tissue that normally surrounds natural teeth) are more
      prone to persistent gingival inflammation, faster disease progression and compromised plaque
      control. Ridge augmentation procedure can alter the quality of tissue in the sites where it
      will receive dental implants. Soft tissue grating aims at changing the nature of peri-implant
      soft tissue by creating or increasing the zone of keratinized mucosa (KM) surrounding
      implants. CTG or ADM will be grafted at the same time of lateral ridge augmentation
      procedure.

      Specific aims for this project include the evaluation of:

        1. To evaluate the quality of soft tissue regenerated with the use of the two available
           soft tissue grafts via histological analysis.

        2. To evaluate whether CTG or ADM influences the outcomes of Guided Bone Regeneration (GBR)
           procedures.

        3. To quantify the soft tissue augmentation achieved by the two available soft tissue
           grafts by direct clinical measurements after the healing
