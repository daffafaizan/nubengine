    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine/verify the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of panitumumab conjugated to the
      optical dye IRDye800CW (panitumumab-IRDye800), as an imaging agent in patients undergoing
      surgery for malignant glioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the efficacy of panitumumab IRDye800 in identifying malignant glioma compared to
      surrounding normal central nervous system tissue.

      II. Determine whether a loading dose of panitumumab is necessary to achieve an effective
      tumor-to-background ratio.

      III. Determine the optimal timing of the surgical procedure to maximize the
      tumor-to-background ratio.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of panitumumab-IRDye800 followed by a phase
      II study.
