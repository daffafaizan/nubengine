      defibrillators will be linked with measurements of the concentration and constituents of
      ambient particulate air pollution. Time series methods will be used to assess temporal
      associations, adjusting for seasonal, weekly, and diurnal patterns, meteorology, and
      co-pollutants. Characteristics of subjects showing the strongest air pollution associations
      will be assessed, as well as effect modification by medication and co-morbidities.

      ICD patients are followed up clinically every three to six months. The ICD device is
      interrogated and data are retrieved by non-invasive radio frequency retrieval from the
      implanted device. Device performance is checked. Detected arrhythmias and therapeutic
      interventions are listed. For each detected episode, date and time is recorded, along with a
      short electrogram of the heartbeats immediately before and during the event.

      Daily ambient particle mass (PM10 and PM2.5) and particle constituents have been measured in
      Boston since January 1995. The Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection has
      measured concentrations of gaseous pollutants including carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide,
      ozone, and sulfur dioxide. Meteorological factors including temperature, humidity, and
      barometric pressure have been measured at the National Weather Service station at Logan
      airport. Meteorologic factors and gaseous co-pollutants will be considered as independent
      predictors of arrhythmic events, and as confounders of the particulate air pollution
      associations.
