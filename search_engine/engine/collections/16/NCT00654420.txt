      Factor Receptor (IGF-1R). Dalotuzumab may act through:

        -  Inhibition of IGF-1-mediated cell signaling to cause reductions in tumor growth and
           spread

        -  Antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity

      In preclinical studies, dalotuzumab improved the activity of an anti-Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor (EGFR) mAb and the activity of Erlotinib, a small molecule inhibitor of EGFR

      Trial Duration of Treatment: Participants will continue on the study for as long as their
      disease is not progressing and they do not have unmanageable side effects from the treatment.
