      randomized in two treatment arms: (1) capecitabina orally 825mg/m2 bid. 5 days a week for 5
      weeks and (2) bolus intravenous 5-FU/LV 350mg/m2/20 mg/m2 D1-D5 on the first and fifth weeks,
      both combined to pelvic radiotherapy, total dose 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions. Clinical stage
      before and after CRT was determined using pelvic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), endorectal
      ultrasonography (ERUS) and chest, abdominal and pelvic Computer Tomography. Surgery was
      planned 6 to 8 weeks after CRT. Sphincter preservation was always considered when negative
      margins were possible. Pathological assessment included stage (TNM 7th Ed.) and Mandard's
      Tumor Regression Grade (TRG). QOL questionnaires QLQ-C30 and CR38 were completed by patients
      before and after CRT, after surgery and during follow-up.
