    
      This is a randomised, double-blind study of the effects of creatine supplementation on muscle
      energetics and cognitive function, using 31P-MRS and fMRI. 31P-MRS data will be acquired
      continuously during exercise phase and in the post-exercise metabolic recovery phase.
      Participants will undergo a fMRI scan of the brain to record changes in the blood oxygen
      level dependent (BOLD) signal during a series of cognitive tests. In addition, participants
      will undergo a resting state BOLD scan and a structural MRI scan for localization of brain
      regions.
