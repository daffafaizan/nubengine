      This open label (all participants know the identity of the study drug), multicenter (more
      than one study site), first-in-human study consisting of 2 parts. Part 1 is a dose escalation
      and Part 2 is a dose expansion cohort. Part 1 has been completed.

      Part 2 new patient populations examined:

        -  Group F: Patients with NSCLC with documented NRG1 fusion

        -  Group G: Patients with pancreatic cancer with documented NRG1 fusion

        -  Group H: Patients with any other solid tumor with documented NRG1 fusion

      For these new patient populations, Part 2 will further characterize the safety and
      tolerability of the selected dose level of zenocutuzumab (MCLA-128), as well as assessment of
      CBR, defined as the proportion of patients with a CR, PR or durable SD (SD for at least 12
      weeks in duration). For the new patient populations, overall response rate (ORR) and duration
      of response (DOR) will be described.

      The study consists of 3 periods: Screening period (up to 28 days prior to the first dose of
      study drug); Treatment period (treatment cycles of 28 days); and Follow Up period (through 30
      days after the last dose and quarterly checks for survival data for up to 2 years).
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.

      Number of Sites:

      Up to 40 sites are estimated to be involved during Parts 1 and 2 of the study. Additional
      sites may be added to ensure there is an acceptable enrollment rate or to replace
      non-enrolling/withdrawn sites.
