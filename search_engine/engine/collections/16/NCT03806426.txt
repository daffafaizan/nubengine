      acid is a safe and well tolerated treatment in reducing the number of polypectomies FAP
      patients with an APC gene mutation have over a 2 year treatment period and to assess the
      effect that this has on clinical disease progression. Planned Sample Size This study will
      enrol 204 subjects (102 subjects per treatment group). Primary Objective is to determine the
      efficacy of EPA-FFA gastro-resistant capsules in patients with FAP in reducing polypectomy.

      Secondary objectives is to evaluate the clinical disease progression and the long-term safety
      and tolerability of EPA-FFA.
