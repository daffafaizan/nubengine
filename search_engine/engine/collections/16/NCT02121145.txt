    
      Many Salmonella spp causing gastroenteritis share O antigen serotypes with Salmonella
      enteritidis subsp. enterica serovar Typhi (S.typhi) and could therefore be in 'reach' of the
      protective efficacy of the oral live typhoid fever vaccine Vivotif®. Some of these
      Salmonellae are common causes of diarrhoea in travellers (0-30% of travellers diarrhea
      depending on the area). In a recent controlled study, the investigators showed that a
      cross-reactive immune response is elicited against different Salmonella spp. in healthy
      volunteers immunized with either the oral (Vivotif® ) or parenteral (Typherix®) typhoid
      vaccines (ISRCTN68125331).

      In the present study immune responses will be studied in a group receiving both of these
      vaccines and in previously immunized volunteers after booster immunization (same groups
      receive same vaccines 2-4 years after primary immunization; groups: Vivotif / Typherix /
      Vivotif + Typherix). The results are compared to those obtained after primary immunization.
