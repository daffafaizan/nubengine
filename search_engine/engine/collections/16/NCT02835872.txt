      otherwise healthy men and women. Subjects will be generally healthy men and women
      (approximately equal number of men and women) 21-79 years of age, inclusive, each with a
      fasting LDL-C level â‰¥130 mg/dL and <190 mg/dL.

      This randomized, controlled, 28-day parallel study will include one screening Visit (Visit 1,
      Day -14), two baseline visits (Visits 2 and 3; Days -3 and 0) and three test visits (Visits
      4, 5, and 6; Days 14, 25, and 28), and two contact reminders (Days 7 and 21).

      Study ingredients will be provided in three servings of study products each day. During the
      study, subjects will be instructed to consume one serving of study product at each mealtime.

      The primary outcome variable will be the percent change in LDL-C concentration from baseline
      (average of Days -3 and 0) to the end of each intervention condition (average of Days 25 and
      28).
