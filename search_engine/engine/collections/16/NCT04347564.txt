      impression (metamorphopsia). The usability of a novel on-screen test to categorize
      metamorphopsia is to be examined with the questionnaire "SUS" to determine how user-friendly
      the software is perceived.

      Purpose To examine the usability of the software for persons perceiving metamorphopsia
      employing the questionnaire SUS.

      Aim of the work Improvement of the software in terms of user-friendliness.

      Methods For this observational pilot study, 30 persons are to be recruited from the patient
      pool of a private practice.

      Primary endpoint: Score of the SUS questionnaire.

      Each participating person performs the test once with each eye wearing appropriate near
      correction. The test shows on a screen 4 square fields with a grid pattern of horizontal and
      vertical lines. All 4 fields have lines that are partially distorted. The task of the test
      person is to select the field with more distinctively distorted lines when viewed with one
      eye.This selection must be made 20 times or less per eye: an algorithm determines the
      smallest correctly named distortion difference. Afterwards each person answers the System
      Usability Scale (SUS) questionnaire, SUS contains five positive and five negative statements
      on the usability of the system being evaluated. For each statement, the study participant
      gives his or her approval or rejection in the form of a scale ranging from 1= "strong
      approval" to 5= "strong rejection" of the statement. The results of the SUS questionnaire are
      used to calculate a numerical value (SUS score).
