      plexus block to the supraclavicular brachial plexus block or other brachial plexus blocks.
      The aim of this study is to evaluate differences between ultrasound guided supraclavicular
      versus retroclavicular brachial plexus blocks, with primary focus on the incidence of
      diminished ipsilateral hemidiaphramatic excursion (ipsilateral phrenic nerve blockade). We
      will also evaluate differences between the two techniques in the success of producing
      surgical anesthesia, procedural time to perform the block (including imaging time and
      needling time), block onset time, ease of quality ultrasound needle visualization, and
      incidence of paresthesias, vascular puncture and pneumothorax. Lastly, we will observe and
      compare the distribution of motor and sensory blockade of the two techniques
