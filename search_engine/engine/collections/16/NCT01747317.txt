      determining the physiologic significance of coronary artery disease (CAD), which will help
      physicians in clinical decision-making and decrease the medical cost, but its ability to
      identify patients with ischemia has not been adequately examined to date.

      Available data from registered clinical trials has testified the diagnostic performance of
      FFRCT, but the diagnostic accuracy among them are not consistent.

      Thus, the investigators designed a collaborative individual patient-data pooled-analysis
      aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of FFRCT and find the possible cause for
      inconsistency
