      baseline, and approximately 1 and 2 weeks for follow up assessment. At each visit, dry skin
      severity will be evaluated by a trained observer using a validated Dry Skin Score, skin
      barrier biophysical properties (transepidermal water loss and hydration) will be measured,
      and digital photos of the test sites will be taken for image analysis.
