      Primary

        -  Determine the feasibility and accuracy of real time magnetic resonance-based
           non-invasive thermometry in patients with grade 2 or 3 soft tissue sarcoma of the
           extremity receiving combination hyperthermia, radiotherapy, surgery, and optional
           high-dose ifosfamide and doxorubicin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the local control, disease-free survival, and overall survival of patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine acute and late toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Correlate measurements of tumor physiology, defined by gadolinium-enhanced magnetic
           resonance imaging, magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and tumor oxygenation, with clinical
           and/or pathological response and/or metastatic potential in patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients may receive high-dose ifosfamide IV continuously over 6 days (144 hours).
      Beginning 3 weeks after the completion of ifosfamide, patients undergo radiotherapy once
      daily, 5 days a week, for 5 weeks. Beginning 1 hour after radiotherapy, patients also undergo
      hyperthermia (with heat measured by conventional and magnetic resonance-based thermometry)
      over 1-2 hours once weekly for 5 weeks. Approximately 4 weeks after the completion of
      radiotherapy and hyperthermia, patients undergo surgery. Approximately 1 month after surgery,
      patients may then receive high-dose doxorubicin IV once every 4 weeks for 4 courses.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-6 years.
