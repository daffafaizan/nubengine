      month), they will receive a standard training program on performing bag exchange and
      education on the prevention of peritonitis.

      Then the participants will be randomized into three groups: retraining via operation
      inspection (G1), retraining via verbal education (G2) and usual care (G3). Retraining will be
      performed every 2 months in G1 and G2 group.

      During the following 2 years or a longer period, all the participants will be followed up
      frequently with outcome events recorded.
