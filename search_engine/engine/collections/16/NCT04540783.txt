      patients will be recruited, with closed TBI for at least 6 months, of both sexes. The
      sequence of randomization will provide the allocation 1: 1: 1 in parallel groups: G1 n = 12
      active (CTB), G2 n = 12 active (DLPFC), and G3 n = 12 (Sham). The tDCS will be held with the
      intensity of 2 mA for 20 minutes per session and online cognitive training (concurrent with
      the ETCC). All patients, after the screening and randomization, will make a baseline
      neuropsychological assessment (T0) and receive 10 sessions of stimulation concomitant to
      cognitive training. Patients will undergo neuropsychological reassessment one week (T1) and
      two months (T2) after the last tDCS session. We will evaluate performance on episodic memory
      tests, working memory and attention in the three periods (T0, T1, and T2). The significance
      adopted is the level of 5% (Î± = 0.05), analysis of 80% power and bicaudal curve. Analysis of
      the results will be done by intention to treat (ITT).
