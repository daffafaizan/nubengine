      study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate beef as a nutritional
      intervention to optimize visual cognitive training performance in generally healthy, normally
      menstruating women. Female subjects of reproductive age (18-40) will be randomly placed in
      one of two dietary treatment groups: one serving of beef per day for 30 days or a non-meat
      protein replacement control. Cognitive performance will be measured in 15 training sessions
      over 10 days using the sophisticated NeuroTrackerâ„¢ CORE (NT) 3-Dimensional (3D) software
      program. It is hypothesized that women consuming 1 serving of beef per day for 30 days will
      have the highest plasma levels of the beef rich nutrients and demonstrate the highest visual
      cognitive performance and improvement as compared to the no beef control.
