    
      This was a randomized, open-label, multi-center study of the safety, overall tolerability,
      and antiviral activity of BCV, as compared with SoC, in pediatric (and young adults in the
      United States) recipients of high-risk (i.e., T cell-depleted and/or unrelated cord blood
      graft, or a T cell-replete graft from ahaploidentical donor with post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide administration) allogeneic HCT. Subjects with AdV detected in plasma after
      their qualifying transplant could be screened for participation in the study. Subjects who
      met all applicable entry criteria were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either BCV or SoC
      (i.e., investigator-assigned therapy). The formulation of BCV used in this study was oral
      tablet/suspension. Subjects were randomized within 100 days post-transplant; for study
      purposes, the day of randomization was defined as Day 1. During randomization, subjects were
      stratified based on the following variables: last AdV viremia (≥10,000 copies/mL versus
      <10,000 copies/mL) measurement available from the designated central virology laboratory
      prior to randomization, time from transplant to randomization (≥28 days versus <28 days), and
      T cell-depletion methodology (receipt of alemtuzumab or ex vivo depletion versus receipt of
      anti-thymocyte globulin [ATG] or no T cell depletion).
