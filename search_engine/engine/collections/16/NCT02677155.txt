      this study. Staging includes PET/CT, CT and bone marrow specimens. Lymphoma nodes must be
      available for surgical biopsy, radiation and intranodal treatment. Additionally, there must
      be evaluable lesions for measuring systemic effects. The patient undergo leukapheresis for
      collection of monocytes then cultured ex vivo to obtain immature dendritic cells (DC). The
      treatment targets single lymphoma nodes with radiation (single fraction of 8 Gy),
      ultrasound-guided injections of autologous DCs , low-dose rituximab (5 mg) and GM-CSF sc.
      This sequential intranodal immunotherapy (SIIT) is repeated three times, targeting different
      lymphoma nodes. Anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody (Pembrolizumab) is given iv at each cycle of
      SIIT and then every third week for a total of 11 cycles. Patients are evaluated for clinical
      response with PET/CT, CT and bone marrow analysis. CD8 and CD4 T cell responses against
      autologous tumor cells are measured in blood after treatment by flow cytometry. The primary
      aims are to induce systemic clinical responses and correlated T cell responses which may
      prolong time to next standard therapy.
