      public health problem that has been neglected in HIV prevention research. In Zimbabwe , and
      across sub-Saharan Africa, the vast majority of HIV-infected individuals are adults of
      reproductive age. Pregnancy and the desire for children are common among HIV-infected
      individuals, and HIV-discordant couples face a difficult choice between attempting pregnancy
      and risking HIV transmission to their partners. Recent surveys have found that 30-50% of
      HIV-infected individuals in sub-Saharan Africa are involved in stable, HIV-discordant
      relationships, and HIV transmission within married, cohabitating HIV-discordant couples
      accounts for 44-60% of new HIV infections in some regions of sub-Saharan Africa. While
      knowledge of HIV discordance can lead to increased condom use, many discordant couples have
      unprotected intercourse often motivated by the desire to conceive. Currently, HIV discordant
      couples who attempt to conceive place themselves at considerable risk of transmission. This
      research study aims to help promote couples' rights to conceive while at the same time
      decreasing the risk of HIV transmission.
