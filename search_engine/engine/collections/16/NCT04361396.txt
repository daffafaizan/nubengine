      2019 and has spread rapidly worlwide. COVID-19, the disease caused by this virus, has a very
      polymorphous clinical presentation, which ranges from upper respiratory tract infections to
      acute respiratory distress syndrome. Research institutions are working restlessly to
      elucidate the physiopathology of COVID-19 to develop new and more efficacious strategies on
      diagnosis, treatment and prevention planning. However, many aspects of the disease process
      are still unknown. Despite the lack of complete understanding of COVID-19, recommandations
      from world health authorities to surgical societies have been published in order to prevent
      viral transmission within the hospital setting. Concerning prevention of viral transmission
      during laparoscopy on confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases, strict measures were taken to
      protect surgical and anesthesia staff. These recommandations are mainly based on avoiding
      leak of pneumoperitoneum during surgical exploration as it may represent a potential source
      of viral transmission, eventhough there is no scientific evidence on it. The lack of evidence
      of this mode of transmission makes difficult to develop more appropriate and efficacious
      recommandations. This study is designed to assess for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in the
      peritoneal serosa during emergency laparoscopy on confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases.
      During laparoscopic surgical exploration, 3 samples of pneumoperitoneum will be taken in 3
      standardized steps of the procedure. Two more other samples of peritoneal effusion or
      peritoneal lavage (in the absence of peritoneal effusion) and bile (if cholecystectomy is
      performed) will also be collected.
