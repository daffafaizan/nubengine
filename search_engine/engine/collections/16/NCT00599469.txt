    
      Alzheimer's destroys brain cells, causing problems with memory, thinking and behaviour severe
      enough to affect work, lifelong hobbies or social life. Alzheimer's gets worse over time and
      it is fatal.

      Alzheimer's, which has no current cure, is the most common form of dementia. It is hereby
      postulated that far infrared radiation of the central nervous and endocrine systems will help
      with the management of the disease and possibly cure the disease.
