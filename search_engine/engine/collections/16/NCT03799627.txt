      vadadustat for the treatment of anemia in hemodialysis participants converting from epoetin
      alfa therapy. The study will be conducted in two parts running in parallel: Part 1, Main
      Study in a hemodialysis population on maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa; Part 2 is in a
      hemodialysis population that are erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) hyporesponders on
      maintenance treatment with epoetin alfa. For all participants (Main and ESA hyporesponder
      parallel study), the study will include a Screening Period, a Treatment Period, and a Safety
      Follow-Up Period. PK and PD sampling will be done throughout the study. The aim is to achieve
      and maintain hemoglobin (Hb) levels within the target range of 10.0 to 11.0 grams per
      deciliter (g/dL), inclusive, while targeting the middle of the range and minimizing
      excursions outside the target range.
