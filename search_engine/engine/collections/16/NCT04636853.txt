      induce anatomic-functional impairment of the rods.

      After selecting the patients to be enrolled, the study will proceed with the vitrectomy
      surgery and a subretinal injection of umbilical cord blood platelet-rich plasma (CB-PRP)
      provided by the Umbilical Cord Bank according to the procedures provided for by the current
      legislation on blood components for non-transfusion use.

      A complete ophthalmological examination will be performed at 1, 3, 6 and 12 months. They will
      include:

        -  Anterior segment biomicroscopy

        -  direct and indirect ophthalmoscopy

        -  ETDRS visual acuity assessment

        -  intraocular pressure measurement

        -  optical coherence tomography (OCT)

        -  OCT Angiography (OCTA)

      The following assessments will be performed at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.

        -  Microperimetry

        -  ERG (elettroretinogramma) -

        -  PEV (potenziali evocati visivi)

        -  contrast sensitivity (MARS tables)

        -  Goldmann perimetry

      The some morpho-functional data will also be collected in the contralateral eye and used as
      control group.

      To ensure the best safety for the patient, the first 5 eyes will be separated by a minimum of
      20 days in order to observe the post-surgical evolution.
