    
      Primary aim: To evaluate effect of a culturally and linguistically tailored,
      telephone-delivered behavioral intervention, versus an attention-control condition, on
      adherence to recommended assessment and treatment of sleep apnea.

      Secondary aims: 1) To evaluate the maintenance of intervention effects on adherence 6 months
      post-intervention; and 2) To assess treatment effects on components of the metabolic syndrome
      (waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid level, and fasting plasma glucose/HbA1C).

      Exploratory aim: To identify the mediators of adherence to recommended sleep apnea assessment
      and treatment following exposure to the intervention.
