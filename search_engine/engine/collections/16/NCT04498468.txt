      favorable results. However, the requirement of frequent instillation of drops by the patients
      is problematic causing discomfort and blurring of vision and requires remembering and
      dexterity for instillation, poor compliance is not uncommon. In addition Investigators
      believe that instillation of drops disturbs the homeostasis of the natural tear film due to
      physical and chemical trauma due to large drop volume (50 microliters) hammering on the eye
      surface (which can only hold 7 to 10 microliters). Particularly washing away of the mucin
      layer that holds all the "good ingredients" in the tears is harmful to the ocular surface.
      Therefore, "dropless" treatment of dry eye is desirable.

      Dextenza® (dexamethasone ophthalmic insert, Ocular Therapeutix Inc., Bedford, MA) is a
      corticosteroid intracanalicular insert approved by US-FDA in November 2018 for the treatment
      of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain. It is inserted into the lower lacrimal punctum
      and into the canaliculus. A single insert releases a 0.4 mg dose of dexamethasone for up to
      30 days following insertion. Dextenza® is resorbable and does not require removal.
      Investigators hypothesize that Dextenza® could mimic short-term topical steroid use in a
      tapering manner in patients with clinically significant dry eye and show efficacy in
      improving its symptoms and signs, as was previously shown with other steroid preparations. If
      proven, the use of Dextenza® may shift paradigms in the management of the clinically
      significant ocular surface disease. To test this hypothesis, investigators propose to study
      the effects of Dextenza® in the treatment of clinically significant dry eye.
