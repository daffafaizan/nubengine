      significant pain and disability. Although radiographs can identify characteristic patterns of
      joint space narrowing and erosive changes, these findings are typically late findings and
      represent irreversible damage. With the development of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs
      (DMARDs), the goal is now to identify the pre-erosive inflammatory features and identify the
      patients that progress further into severe functional debility if not treated immediately.

      MRI with gadolinium enhancement is proven to be very effective in early detection of soft
      tissue, bone erosions, synovitis, the integrity of ligaments, cartilage and bone marrow
      edema. However, MRI is expensive, may be impractical for assessing multiple joints and has
      relatively long examination time. Some patients may have claustrophobia and some may have
      contraindications to gadolinium administration. The investigators overarching goal is to
      determine whether the perfusion information provided by novel ultrasound based techniques
      such as, contrast enhanced ultrasound and superb microvascular imaging, can be used for
      assessment of treatment response to DMARD therapy for inflammatory arthritis. The recent
      advances in evaluation of vascularity of the tumors using contrast ultrasound technique can
      also be applied to rheumatological diseases. It is ideal to develop a sensitive imaging
      technique that can be routinely available and is relatively cheap. Ultrasound is available
      and has low cost and can be used for assessment of treatment response to DMARD therapy
