      the published guidelines. This observational cross-sectional study was performed with 110
      chronic low back pain patients. All participants were asked to complete Back Beliefs
      Questionnaire and also fill the socio-demographic data form and evaluation tools (Numeric
      rating scale-pain, Oswestry Disability Index, Fear Avoidance Beliefs Questionnaire, Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale). Internal consistency was evaluated with Cronbach's alfa
      coefficient. Intraclass correlation coefficient was used to assess test-retest reliability.
      Structural validity was assessed by correlations with other tools.

      Back Beliefs Questionnaire had a good internal consistency (Cronbach alfa= 0.79) and an
      excellent test-retest reliability (Intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.84). A moderate
      correlation was determined between Back Beliefs Questionnaire and Fear Avoidance Beliefs
      Questionnaire. Correlations with Numeric rating scale-pain, Oswestry Disability Index,
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale were fair.

      Turkish version of Back Beliefs Questionnaire is a valid and reliable questionnaire that can
      be used to evaluate beliefs about pain in patients with chronic low back pain.
