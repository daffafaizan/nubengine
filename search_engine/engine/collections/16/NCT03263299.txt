      diluted doses of the GnRH agonist leuprolide acetate 40 µg, given subcutaneously twice daily.
      Two days later, stimulation is initiated by intramuscular (IM) injections of HMG (Merional,
      IBSA, Germany) in a dose of 300 IU/day.

      Follicular monitoring began from the ninth day of the cycle by serial vaginal ultrasonography
      and measurement of serum E2 levels. IM injections of 10000 IU HCG (Choriomon; IBSA, Germany)
      were injected when at least 2 follicles 18 mm were observed on ultrasonography.

      Oocytes were retrieved 36 hours after hCG injection using a 17-gauge aspiration needle under
      transvaginal ultrasound guidance. The pelvis is evaluated with ultrasound to ensure that
      there is no internal bleeding.

      After fertilization was confirmed when two polar bodies and two pronuclear were observed
      18-20 hours after insemination, one to three grade A embryos were transferred at day 3
      fertilization.

      The luteal phase support was initiated from the day of oocyte retrieval for all patients with
      (Cyclogest 400 mg, Actavis pharmaceutical, UK) vaginal suppositories per day till the day of
      serum pregnancy test was done.

      Serum β-hCG was performed 14 days after the embryo transfer to confirm chemical pregnancy.
      Clinical pregnancy was confirmed when there was an evidence of gestational sac, embryo and
      fetal heart activity at time of transvaginal ultrasound evaluation by the 6th week.
