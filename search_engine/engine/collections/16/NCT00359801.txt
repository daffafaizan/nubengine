      committed to continued marketing until it returned the licensing rights for the technology to
      Nektar. Following the announcement, enrollment was halted. Subjects already enrolled and
      receiving treatment at the time of the halt in enrollment could continue in the study in
      accordance with the protocol. Nektar, the company from which Pfizer licensed Exubera,
      announced on April 9, 2008 that it had stopped its search for a new marketing partner.
      Accordingly, there will be no commercial availability of Exubera. As a result, an amendment
      was filed on April 16, 2008 specifying that all subjects randomized to Exubera had to be
      transitioned to usual diabetes care, and all study subjects followed for serious adverse
      events for 6 months. In accordance with this amendment, study A2171069 was terminated on
      April 29, 2009. Neither safety nor efficacy reasons were the cause of the study termination.
