    
      Primary Objective:

      To estimate the treatment effect as measured by progression free survival (PFS) of subjects
      with recurrent ovarian cancer receiving AMG 386 (either 3 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg IV QW) in
      combination with paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 IV QW; 3 on/1 off)compared to subjects receiving
      paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 IV QW; 3 on/1 off) plus placebo

      Secondary Objective(s):

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination regimen of AMG 386/paclitaxel

        -  To estimate other measures of treatment effect (by parameters other than PFS) of
           subjects receiving AMG 386 in combination with paclitaxel compared to subjects receiving
           paclitaxel plus placebo

        -  To evaluate the AMG 386 pharmacokinetics parameters (Cmax and Cmin ) when administered
           with paclitaxel in subjects with recurrent ovarian cancer

        -  To estimate the incidence of occurrence of anti-AMG 386 antibody formation

        -  To estimate the change and duration of change on blood levels of CA-125

        -  To evaluate the clinical benefit among subjects receiving AMG 386 10 mg/kg monotherapy
           after disease progression on paclitaxel

        -  To estimate the impact of AMG 386 on patient reported ovarian cancer specific symptoms
           and HRQoL using the FACT-O, the FACT-O ovarian cancer subscale (OCS), and the FACT-O
           3-item (O1, O2, O3) cancer symptom specific subscale (OCS 3-item subscale)

      Exploratory Objective(s):

        -  To explore the associations between progression free survival, objective response,
           CA-125, and continuous measures of tumor burden (the percentage change from baseline in
           the sum of the longest diameters of target lesions)

        -  To explore the pharmacodynamic (PD) response as assessed by changes in blood levels of
           angiogenic cytokines, tumor apoptosis, CA-125 and other markers

        -  To investigate the effects of genetic variation in drug metabolism, cancer genes and
           drug target genes on ovarian cancer and subject response to investigational product
           (separate informed consent)

        -  To explore the impact of AMG 386 on patient reported overall health status as measured
           by the EuroQoL (EQ-5D)

      Hypothesis:

      This study will provide an estimate and corresponding 2-sided 80% confidence interval with an
      approximate maximum half-width of 0.22 of the efficacy, as measured by the PFS hazard ratio
      of AMG 386 in combination with paclitaxel versus paclitaxel alone for 2 pooled dose groups of
      AMG 386 (10 mg/kg QW and 3 mg/kg QW) in combination with paclitaxel versus the paclitaxel
      plus placebo group.
