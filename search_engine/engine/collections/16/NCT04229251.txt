      often persist to adulthood. In Malaysia, the Chinese ethnic is having the highest prevalence
      rate of hyperactivity symptoms. Nevertheless, there are only limited evidence-based treatment
      options targeting the core symptoms of ADHD, as well as executive functions in adulthood. In
      addition, conventional psychotherapeutic approaches for adults with ADHD have found to be
      highly labor-intensive. Emerging adulthood is a distinct developmental stage of 18 - 29 years
      old, with unique challenges that rarely addressed in mental health system. Recently,
      mindfulness-based intervention appears to be a promising treatment for adults living with
      ADHD but it has not been evaluated among Malaysian emerging adults with ADHD. The
      investigators proposed a two-arm randomized controlled trial, comparing an eight-week online
      mindfulness-based intervention program with an online introductory psychology program. The
      outcomes include changes of inattention symptom, changes of hyperactivity-impulsivity
      symptom, and changes of executive functions from pretest to posttest, 1-month follow-up and
      3-month follow-up. To investigators' best knowledge, this randomized controlled trial will be
      the first to test the efficacious of online mindfulness-based intervention for ADHD among
      emerging adults. It will provide evidence on the efficacious of online treatment for this
      often-overlooked population in the mental healthcare system.
