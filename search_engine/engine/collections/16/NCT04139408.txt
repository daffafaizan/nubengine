      undergo VATS within 24h after the placement of the Marker, then the Marker and targeted
      nodule will be removed during VATS. Subjects will be followed up intraoperatively,
      immediately after placement procedure to the end of VATS resection, 7 days after placement
      procedure/before discharge (whichever occurs earlier), and 30 days after Marker placement
      procedure. Demographic and baseline information of subjects, immediate operation success rate
      of marker placement, positioning success rate, and adverse events will be collected and
      recorded in this study.
