    
      The overall aims of this study are

        -  Identify biomarkers and gene expression profiles that determine progressive fibrotic
           lung disease regardless of aetiology

        -  To prospectively assess biomarkers which predict progressive fibrosis in patients with
           fibrosing lung disease of alternate aetiology, including RA-UIP, Asbestosis, Chronic
           Hypersensitivity Pneumonitis and Unclassifiable fibrotic lung disease

        -  Investigate genetic associations and epigenetic modifications which affect fibrotic
           disease severity and progression

        -  Prospectively evaluate longitudinal disease behaviour in patients with non IPF-fibrotic
           lung diseases with a view to developing composite clinical end-points for subsequent use
           in intervention studies in patients
