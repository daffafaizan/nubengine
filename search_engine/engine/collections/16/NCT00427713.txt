        -  Compare the efficacy of adjuvant chemotherapy comprising capecitabine and oxaliplatin vs
           standard follow-up care, in terms of disease-free and overall survival, in patients with
           clear margins after complete resection of locally advanced rectal cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, randomized, controlled, prospective, multicenter study.
      Patients are stratified according to surgeon and nodal status (node positive vs node negative
      vs unknown). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard follow up.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14 and oxaliplatin IV
           over 2 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every
      6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter.
