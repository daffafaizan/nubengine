      response rate (analgesic consumption, pain intensity, performance status, and weight change),
      and objective response rate in chemotherapy-naive patients with unresectable locally advanced
      or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the pancreas treated with oral nitrocamptothecin vs
      gemcitabine. II. Compare the toxicity of these 2 regimens in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to measurable disease (yes vs no), Karnofsky performance status (50-70% vs
      70-100%), and prior radiotherapy. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I:
      Patients receive oral nitrocamptothecin on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every week for 8
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable
      or responding disease after week 8 may receive additional courses. Arm II: Patients receive
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every week for 7 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo 1 week of
      rest. Patients with stable or responding disease after week 8 may receive gemcitabine IV over
      30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks. Pain is assessed within 7 days
      prior to study, at days 28 and 56 during study, and then every 28 days after completion of
      study. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year or until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 994 patients (497 per arm) will be accrued for this study
      within 22 months.
