      potential positive interactions on the immune regulatory side, non-overlapping toxicities,
      and potential for prolongation and increased number of responses based on murine studies
      conducted at the University of Pittsburgh. This study is a multi-center phase II study
      designed to estimate the efficacy of combination therapy of standard high dose bolus IL-2 and
      various doses of hydroxychloroquine therapy in metastatic RCC patients.
