      Prospective, open phase II trial

      Treatment:

      Capecitabine 2000 mg/m² orally day 1-14 q day 22 until progression, unacceptable toxicity,
      patient's request or withdrawal from study

      Primary objective

      To determine the time to disease progression in patients with HER2 negative metastatic breast
      cancer after 1st line monochemotherapy with capecitabine

      Secondary objectives

        1. To determine the objective response rate

        2. To determine the duration of response

        3. To determine the clinical benefit defined as CR, PR, or stable disease ≥ 24 weeks

        4. To evaluate the safety and toxicity of capecitabine

        5. To assess quality of life within 1 year after start of capecitabine treatment

        6. To determine overall survival

        7. To determine the objective response rate in male patients

        8. To evaluate QoL the modified Brunner Score (Appendix 7 )

      Tertiary objective

      To determine the DPD and Proteomics in serum
