      hypertension (PHT) in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD), and to
      determine the role of the hypoxic response in its pathogenesis. In this regard, proliferative
      vascular responses mediated by (i) hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-regulated pathways and (ii)
      nitric oxide (NO)-scavenging will be compared between patients with SCD and patients with
      Chuvash polycythemia (CP), another hematological disorder characterized by increased risk for
      PHT. High throughput microarray and genotyping technologies will be employed to identify
      candidate gene pholymorphisms involved in pathologic responses to hypoxia in SCD and CP
      patients with and without PHT.
