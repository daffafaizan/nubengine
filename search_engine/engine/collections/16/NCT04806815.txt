      which plays a key role in the entry of the COVID-19 virus into the cell, is also highly
      expressed in the ovary, uterus, vagina, and placenta in the female genital system, which can
      also pose a risk to female reproductive health. It has been examined that menstruation volume
      decreased or cycle lengthened in one-fifth of women who had COVID-19, and this condition was
      more intense in those who had severe COVID-19. Studies have shown that the possible effects
      of COVID-19 on the female genital system often remain theoretical hypotheses. In the
      literature, there was no study in which menstrual dysfunctions and secondary problems caused
      by the state of inactivity entering our lives during pandemic were discussed in a wide
      spectrum of women who had COVID-19. Therefore the aim of this study is to evaluate menstrual
      cycle-induced pain, fatigue and anxiety in women who suffered from COVID-19.
