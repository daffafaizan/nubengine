    
      -  An observational, prospective cohort study of patients ≥ 50 years old with a Herpes
           Zoster (HZ) diagnosis, carried out by a national random sample of community first line
           practitioners concerned by HZ diagnosis: general practitioners, dermatologists and
           ophthalmologists.

        -  All patients ≥ 50 years old with a HZ diagnosis (as the primary diagnoses and without
           history of previous HZ) during approximately 6 months inclusion period will be included
           in the HZ cohort, until total study target is achieved.

        -  All Patients of the HZ cohort presenting a Post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) 3 months after
           onset of the HZ rash onset will be included secondarily in the PHN cohort

        -  Patients of the HZ cohort will be followed-up for 3 months (i.e. 1 and 3 months after HZ
           rash onset) and patients of the PHN cohort will be followed-up for additional 6 months
           (i.e., 6 and 9 months after HZ rash onset) using phone interviews with a nurse.

        -  250 cases of HZ and 40 cases of PHN are expected, with the hypothesis of 16% of PHN 3
           months after HZ rash onset.
