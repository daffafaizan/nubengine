      Extension Phase. Participants 18 years of age and over, who meet all the eligibility
      requirements will be randomized into the study. It will require that splenectomized
      participants make up at least 35% of the study population and no single platelet count is
      greater than 35x10^9/L. Participants will be centrally stratified at randomization by
      splenectomy status, baseline platelet count, and use of concomitant ITP medication at
      baseline and randomized to receive either double-blind avatrombopag or eltrombopag in a 1:1
      ratio. Participants will receive blinded therapy at a starting dose of 20 mg avatrombopag
      once daily or 50 mg eltrombopag once daily. Participants will be allowed to have their dose
      titrated up (maximum dose 40 mg avatrombopag and 75 mg for eltrombopag) or down (minimum dose
      5 mg for avatrombopag and 25 mg for eltrombopag) depending on their response to study drug.
      The goal of dose modification is to maintain the platelet count at levels greater than or
      equal to 50x10^9/L and less than or equal to 150x10^9/L, and to decrease the need for
      ITP-directed concomitant medications. The duration of treatment in the Core study and the
      Extension Phase is approximately 26 and 104 weeks, respectively.
