    
      Primary objective is to measure the change in the levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in
      Cohort 1 (MRD+) due to the addition of platinum doublet chemotherapy in subjects with stage
      III unresectable disease with positive DNA treated with consolidation chemotherapy and
      immunotherapy.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To determine the proportion of subjects in Cohort 1 MRD+ for whom ctDNA becomes
           undetectable after chemotherapy

        -  To describe overall survival (OS) of subjects with baseline detectable ctDNA (Cohort 1
           MRD+) vs baseline undetectable ctDNA (Cohort 2 MRD ) ·To describe progression free
           survival (PFS) between subjects with baseline detectable (Cohort 1 MRD+) vs baseline
           undetectable ctDNA (Cohort 2 MRD ) ·To describe the frequency and severity of toxicity
           of consolidation durvalumab plus chemotherapy
