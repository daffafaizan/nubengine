      protocol of TKA rehabilitation consisting of 1-hour sessions for 10 days; and 2) Group II
      (IVT): 1-hour IVT sessions for 10 days (5 sessions under a therapist's supervision to verify
      the absence of medical complications + 5 sessions performed at home). The IVT is an
      interactive virtual software-hardware platform that facilitates the development of remote
      rehabilitation therapy for multiple diseases. Patients receive information required to
      perform exercise and the therapist remotely monitors the patient's performance. For the
      purpose of this trial, the IVT system was designed for lower limb motor recovery in patients
      undergoing TKA.
