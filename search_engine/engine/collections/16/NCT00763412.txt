      arising. CF-Related Diabetes (CFRD) has emerged as a major complication. Years prior to the
      diagnosis of CFRD, patients have decreasing insulin secretion, glucose intolerance,
      deteriorating pulmonary function, and nutritional impairment. There are no current standard
      recommendations for the treatment of CF patients with prediabetes, and there is little
      evidence that treatment of this prediabetic state in CF patients will prevent the
      deterioration of the lung function, nutritional status and potentially slow the progression
      to manifest CFRD.

      To determine the feasibility of testing this hypothesis, we will perform a pilot,
      double-blinded, randomized controlled trial in 20 CF pancreatic insufficient patients ages of
      12 to 24 years old with impaired glucose tolerance test (IGT) or CFRD without fasting
      hyperglycemia (CFRD-No FH) and assign them to either placebo or Repaglinide 0.5 mg PO 3 - 4
      times a day before meals for two years. Patients will monitor their blood glucose daily and
      will be followed every 3 months for 2 years to determine changes in nutritional status by BMI
      and DEXA, lung function tests, frequency of hospitalizations, antibiotic courses, and degree
      of glucose tolerance, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity.

      In addition, based on the evidence of increased inflammation in type 2 diabetes, correlation
      of systemic inflammatory response at different degrees of glucose tolerance and after
      treatment, will be assessed in these subjects, as well as in another 20 CF pancreatic
      insufficient matched patients with normal glucose tolerance who will be studied once without
      intervention
