      marrow transplant), which is an intensive medical treatment for cancers such as leukemia,
      lymphoma, and multiple myeloma as well as other diseases. Because it is a physically and
      emotionally demanding treatment, many people report having ongoing physical and emotional
      difficulties after having a transplant. The Sharing Our Strength study is being conducted to
      help us understand people's transplant experiences and to test a new program designed to help
      them recover physically and emotionally after transplant. All parts of the study are
      completed by mail and telephone. Participants will receive compensation for their time.
