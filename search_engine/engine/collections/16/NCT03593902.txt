      investigational procedure that uses cyclophosphamide and fludarabine (chemotherapy), rabbit
      anti-thymocyte globulin (rATG) (a protein that kills the immune cells that are thought to be
      causing your disease), and rituximab (a biologic drug that targets B cells of your immune
      system). After use of these treatments, the patient will receive their own previously
      collected blood stem cells (autologous stem cell transplant). The ability of these
      experimental treatments to stop relapses and progression (worsening) of your systemic
      sclerosis will be assessed.
