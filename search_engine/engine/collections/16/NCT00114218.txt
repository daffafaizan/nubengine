      I. Determine the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and docetaxel in patients with recurrent
      or persistent uterine carcinosarcoma.

      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a non-randomized, multicenter study. Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30
      minutes followed by docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-4 years.
