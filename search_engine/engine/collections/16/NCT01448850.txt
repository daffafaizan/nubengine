    
      A Phase 2 double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy of MEDI8968 in
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. The study will have a screening phase of 23 days,
      treatment phase from Week 1 to 53 and follow-up phase from Week 53 to 69. Participants will
      receive either MEDI8968 600 milligram (mg) as intravenous (IV) infusion on Day 1 followed by
      300 mg injection subcutaneously (SC) every 4 weeks up to Week 53 or matching placebo in the
      same fashion. Participants will primarily be assessed for incidence rate of moderate or
      severe acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (AECOPD). Safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
