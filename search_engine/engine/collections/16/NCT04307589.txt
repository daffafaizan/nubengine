      physical activity and sedentary behavior among caregiving grandparents in relation to their
      body composition and health-related quality of life (including both physical and mental
      function), and to identify to what extent these outcome measures are associated with the
      number, sex and age of the grandchild(ren) as well as with the intensity of grandparents'
      provision of child care, while taking some demographic characteristics of the grandparent
      (i.e., age, sex, marital status, socio-economic status (SES)) into account.

      The second objective is to compare caregiving grandparents' energy-expenditure related
      behaviors (i.e., physical activity and sedentary behavior) and their link with health-related
      measures of interest (i.e., body composition and quality of life) with both non-caregiving
      grandparents and non-grandparent peers as relevant control groups.

      The third objective is to investigate (age-related) changes in physical activity and
      sedentary behavior linked to body composition and health-related quality of life among
      caregiving grandparents versus non-caregiving grandparents as well as non-grandparents both
      in the short and the longer term, and to identify possible predictors of these changes over
      time. Additionally, it is the intention to examine the impact of middle-aged and older adults
      making the transition to (caregiving) grandparenthood on both energy-expenditure related
      behaviors as well as the health-related measures of interest.
