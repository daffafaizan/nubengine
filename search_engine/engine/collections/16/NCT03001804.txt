      characterised by tumour proliferation and suppression of the immune system. It is a rare but
      incurable disease. On average, multiple myeloma is diagnosed in people 65-74 years of age,
      and the majority of newly diagnosed patients may not be eligible for more aggressive
      treatment options such as high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant. In February 2015
      REVLIMID® (lenalidomide) was approved in combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of
      adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for
      transplant. Furthermore, in May 2019 REVLIMID® was approved in combination with bortezomib
      and dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple
      myeloma who are not eligible for transplant.

      Looking in more detail at the combination of lenalidomide and dexamethasone, the role and
      especially the most adequate and effective dosage of dexamethasone in long term use with
      lenalidomide is not clearly defined or well characterised It is therefore of great relevance
      to gain insights into the clinical practice and the routine of dexamethasone management and
      dosing in long term use with Revlimid.
