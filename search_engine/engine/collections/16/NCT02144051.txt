      Recommended Phase 2 Dose, safety, tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of AZD5312. This is a
      multicentre study with sites in the United States and United Kingdom. Approximately 90
      patients are expected to be enrolled in this study.The study involves two parts, Part A, Dose
      Escalation and Part B, Dose Expansion.

      AZD5312 will be given intravenously (IV) as an infusion, over one hour. For the purpose of
      planning, each 4 week period (28 days) will be called a Cycle. AZD5312 will initially be
      administered 4 times within the first 11 days, (on Days [1, 4, 8 and 11]± 2), with no dosing
      on sequential days. Patients will receive weekly treatments on Days 15 and 22 to complete
      Cycle.

      1. During the subsequent cycles, patients will receive weekly treatment on Days 1, 8, 15 and
      22 (±2). The AZD5312 dose will not change unless dose reductions are required due to
      treatment-related toxicity. Patients will continue to receive AZD5312 until disease
      progression, intolerable toxicity, or discontinuation criteria have been met. Toxicity,
      Pharmacokinetics and biomarker data will be assessed throughout the study. Alternative
      infusion durations and/or treatment schedules may be explored if preliminary data suggest
      these would be more appropriate.
