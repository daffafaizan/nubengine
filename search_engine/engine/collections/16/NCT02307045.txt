      transdermal nicotine patches and/or varenicline at before, 4, 12, 24 and 48 weeks after
      treatment during validated smoking cessation program. The investigators will measure changes
      between baseline and 4,12,24, and 48 weeks after treatment of :

        1. exhaled carbon monoxide (CO, ppm) and self-reported number of cigarretes/day

        2. carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWVc m/sec-Complior SP ALAM) and augmentation index
           (AI %-Arteriograph,TensioMed)

        3. perfused boundary region (PBR) of the sublingual arterial microvessels (ranged from 5-25
           micrometers) using Sideview Darkfield imaging (Microscan, Glycocheck). The PBR in
           microvessels is the cell-poor layer which results from the phase separation between the
           flowing red blood cells (RBC) and plasma. The PBR includes the most luminal part of
           glycocalyx that does allow cell penetration. Increased PBR is considered an accurate
           index of reduced endothelial glucocalyx thickness because of a for deeper penetration of
           the RBC in the glucocalyx

        4. oxidative stress, thrombosis and inflammatory biomarkers in blood samples.

      Non smokers of similar age and sex will serve as controls.
