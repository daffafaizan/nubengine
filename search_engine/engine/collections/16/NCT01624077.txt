      pre-transplant patients, followed by a course (up to 24 months) of tacrolimus (5-10 ng/ml)
      treatment (to prevent chronic rejection) and the administration of the CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs
      (1 x 106 cells/kg) at several intervals (for tolerance induction). The immunesuppress drugs
      will be gradully withdraw within one year. The number of CD4+CD25+ Tregs needed is based on
      the assumption that the frequencies of alloreactive CD4+ T cells with direct and indirect
      allospecificity were 1/104 and 1/105, respectively.

      The second trial will be carried out in 1-10 year post living donor liver transplantation
      patients currently under immunosuppressive drug treatment. The investigators will isolate
      CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs from these patients, and expand them with mismatched living donor
      antigens. The patients will be subsequently treated with the expanded donor-antigen specific
      CD4+CD25+CD127- Tregs (1 x 106 cells/kg) at several intervals, and immunosuppressive drug
      treatment will be withdrawn.

      In both clinical trials, the investigators will monitor the number of allospecific Tregs in
      patients at different time periods, and to test their suppressive functions in vitro. If
      there will be any signs of graft rejection, patients will be switched back to
      immunosuppressive drug treatment. The investigators expect that the innovative Tregs
      immunosuppressive regimen will lead to achieve permanent liver transplantation tolerance
      without the use of conventional immunosuppressive drugs: the holygrail in clinical
      transplantation medicine.
