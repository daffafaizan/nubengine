      detriment to personal health. Using an evidence-based model of population health by bringing
      the care into the high-risk population's community setting reduces the transportation and
      socioeconomic barriers of the most vulnerable at risk populations.

      It is estimated that 35% to 65% of Opioid Substitution Treatment Patients (OST), are infected
      with HCV. Therefore, OPT programs that are already operating will be engaged and will be a
      primary focus for patient screening and recruitment for these services. In addition, high
      volume venues attracting high-risk populations will also be targeted to encourage HCV
      screening, education, and treatment.

      Primary Objectives:

      To screen Opioid Substitution Treatment Patients (OST), high-risk individual at Opioid
      Treatment Programs (OTP), and/or all high-risk populations in outlying sites (Anti-HCV
      prevalence)

      To initiate HCV treatment of OST patients and other high-risk individuals at OTP facilities
      and/or high risk populations in outlying sites (linkage of care)

      To maintain the successful HCV therapy and cure [Sustained Viral Response (SVR)] in OST
      patients and other high-risk individuals at OPT facility and/or high risk populations in
      outlying sites (retention)

      To facilitate the use of a patient navigator and nursing case management staff to reduce
      barriers to initial screening and patient education
