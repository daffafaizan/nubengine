      who were diagnosed with antiphospholipid syndrome in our departmental clinic in 2000-2017 It
      is very important to diagnose Fabri that then the treatment of patients can vary
      dramatically.

      The study will include 100 adult patients (18-100) men and women. Testing for the Fabri test
      in men is an enzyme test and will be performed subject to their consent to sign informed
      consent. In the women, an enzyme test will be carried out, and the plasma Lys-3-3 plasma
      storage, as recommended in the recently published diagnostic algorithms, is examined. If
      diagnosed, a patient will be referred to a genetic institute for further genetic counseling
