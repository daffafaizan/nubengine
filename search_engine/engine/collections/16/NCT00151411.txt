      also characterized by insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Several recent studies in a
      variety of non-hospital based populations have provided evidence that the incidence of
      hyperandrogenic chronic anovulation is in the range of 4-6% of the female population.
      Improvements in insulin sensitivity in women with PCOS, either through lifestyle changes or
      through pharmaceutical intervention, have consistently resulted in a marked improvement in
      the reproductive and metabolic abnormalities in PCOS. The primary objective in the adult
      female population is to determine that combination therapy will improve ovulatory frequency.
      Secondary objective is to improve circulating hyperandrogenemia and insulin sensitivity then
      single agent therapy. The primary objective of the adolescent population is to determine that
      the combination therapy will improve hyperandrogenemia. Secondary objective is to improve
      ovulatory frequency and insulin sensitivity than just the use of a single agent therapy.
