    
      The study was designed as a prospective, randomized controlled and double blind trial.

      Patients complaining of tinnitus were firstly subjected to otologic and audiologic evaluation
      by an otolaryngologist. Tinnitus characteristics, such as severity (Tinnitus handicap Index,
      tinnitus Visual Analog Scale- tinnitus VAS) , type (pulsatile/non-pulsatile), localization
      (unilateral/ bilateral) and the frequency (number of days with symptoms) were recorded.
      Patients were excluded if they had objective tinnitus, subjective tinnitus with hearing loss
      or Meniere's disease, vertigo, middle ear pathologies, intracranial pathologies, whiplash
      injury, previous cervical spinal surgery, pregnancy, infection, malignancy and if they
      received cervical physical rehabilitation program in the past 3 months.

      Patients who diagnosed with somatosensory tinnitus and concomitant neck complaints
      (cervical-VAS score >2) at least 6 weeks were referred to physical medicine and
      rehabilitation outpatient clinic. Before the treatment, participants' demographics data
      including age, gender, Body-Mass Index (BMI) and cervical pain VAS score were recorded and
      physical examinations (cervical joint range of motion (cervical-ROM), cervical manual muscle
      testing (cervical-MMT) and myofascial trigger points for sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezium
      and levator scapulae muscles) were performed by one investigator.

      Banding application performed for both groups once a week for four weeks. Tinnitus handicap
      index score, tinnitus VAS, ROM of the cervical joint, cervical MMT, cervical pain VAS, Neck
      Disability index score and myofascial trigger points of sternocleidomastoid, upper trapezium,
      levator scapula was evaluated in all subjects by the same investigator.
