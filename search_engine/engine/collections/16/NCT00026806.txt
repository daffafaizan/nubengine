      projected for them in the past. As the number of survivors of vertically or transfusion
      associated pediatric HIV disease increases, attention to the psychosocial adjustment of these
      adolescents and young adults becomes increasingly important. Studies in the late 1990s
      described child and adolescent survivors as generally well adjusted, though difficulties
      become more apparent as the child approached the age of 18. Nothing is known about these HIV
      positive youngsters as they enter late adolescence and young adulthood. This study will
      examine psychosocial factors associated with long-term survival of HIV/AIDS, including the
      prevalence of psychiatric diagnoses, risk behaviors, evaluation of self competence, and the
      impact that multiple losses has on the adolescents' emotional well-being. In addition, data
      will be collected from the primary caregivers on the prevalence of parenting stress compared
      to national norms. Subjects will include children who have been infected (either perinatally
      or through transfusion) for at least eight years and who are aware of their diagnosis.
