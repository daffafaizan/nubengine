      will be obtained prior to 6 days of confinement at the clinic site. Up to 20 subjects will be
      randomized. Subjects will be stratified to include an equal number of male and female
      subjects who will receive active drug within each dose cohort, and an equal number of male
      and female subjects in the combined placebo group. Separate groups of volunteers will be used
      for each dose cohort. There will be 4 dose cohorts in this study with active drug doses of
      10, 50, 100, and 200 mg nafamostat in succeeding cohorts. Each cohort of 5 subjects will
      enroll 2 male and 2 female to receive active drug and 1 subject (male or female) to receive
      placebo for a total of 20 subjects. The placebo subject from each cohort will be combined
      into a placebo cohort that will have 4 subjects to compare to 4 subjects in each of the
      active dose groups.
