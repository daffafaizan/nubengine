      Axonpen™ System is a neuroendoscope combined with the functions of hematoma aspiration and
      irrigation, aiming to minimize surgical brain injury, optimize surgical procedure, and be
      available for early hematoma evacuation.

      The technique of minimally invasive endoscopic neurosurgery for ICH is still considered in
      development; however, a retrospective study [Kuo et al.] has shown that early and complete
      evacuation of ICH may lead to improved outcomes in selected patients, where the surgery
      utilized combination of the existing instruments, such as a rod-lens endoscope with
      irrigation system and a suction coagulator, to enable visualization, aspiration, and
      irrigation of the hematoma to be worked simultaneously. The technology employed and the
      results revealed in this study provide a proof of concept for the Axonpen™ system, and also
      imply that the current device could be safe and effective in the management of ICH.
