      first-time, unilateral, ischemic subcortical stroke in the middle cerebral artery territory
      with mild to moderate hand weakness. All subjects will be randomly allocated to receive daily
      bihemispheric tDCS (anodal tDCS to ipsilesional M1 and cathodal tDCS to contralesional M1
      with 2 mA stimulation for 20 min) or daily sham tDCS (same but stimulation for only 30
      seconds) with simultaneous physical/occupational therapy, for total 10 sessions. Changes in
      upper extremity motor function score (Fugl-Meyer test and Action Research Arm test),
      corticospinal excitability from the transcranial magnetic stimulation(TMS), and sensorimotor
      oscillations from the magnetoencephalography (MEG) will be assessed before and after
      intervention, as well as 3 months after stroke. All stroke patients will receive tDCS and
      standard medical, rehabilitation treatments in rehabilitation ward.
