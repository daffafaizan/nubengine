      observations of behavioral and facial responses to its taste) and its relation to children's
      acceptance (defined here as consumption), could provide important insights into the capacity
      for these products to transition from being perceived as "medicine" to being accepted as
      "food," or part of the usual child diet. A clearer understanding of the relation between
      observed child indicators of palatability and acceptance, both initially and over time (i.e.,
      repeated exposure effects), is important for predicting the longer-term impacts on children's
      dietary intake, growth and health. Further, a better grasp of caregiver perceptions of the
      acceptability of these products, both their child's and their own, is critical in paving the
      way for overcoming barriers and identifying facilitators associated with longer-term
      acceptance of these nutritional supplements.

      We secondarily will also explore the effects of potential mediators on caregiver persistence
      and infant acceptance of a sweetened and an unsweetened small-quantity lipid nutrition
      supplement (SQ-LNS) such as:

        -  Maternal feeding self-efficacy

        -  Caregiver food neophobia

        -  Caregiver feeding styles using the Infant Feeding Style Questionnaire

        -  Infant feeding history and food experience

        -  Toddler eating behaviors using the Child Eating Behavior Questionnaire for Toddlers

        -  Infant behaviors using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (Garstein & Rothbart
           2003 Inf Behav Dev)
