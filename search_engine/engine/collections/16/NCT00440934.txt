      million two hundred thousand new patients are diagnosed each year. The prognosis of patients
      suffering from advanced hepatocarcinoma is poor with an average survival of less than six
      months. Therapies for hepatocarcinoma are limited. Resection of the primary tumor is the
      therapeutic approach of first choice when possible. Although this intervention results in
      long-term survival for some patients, only a minority of them are surgical candidates because
      of limitations due to tumor size, patient's overall condition or presence of hepatic
      cirrhosis.

      Phase I data suggest that low levels of amplitude-modulated electromagnetic fields
      administered intrabucally with a portable and programmable device are a safe and potentially
      effective treatment for advanced cancer. The device is connected to a spoon-like coupler
      placed in the patient's mouth during treatment. Patients with advanced HCC and limited
      therapeutic options will be offered treatment with a combination of HCC-specific frequencies.

      The patients will be offered ambulatory treatment, which will be administered three times a
      day for 60 min until disease progression or death.
