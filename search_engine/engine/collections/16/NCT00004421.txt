      of an implanted pulse generator (IPG) in the chest and a wire lead in the globus pallidum
      internal. After the lead has been implanted, the brain stimulation system is tested. Patients
      are examined at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery. A double blinded evaluation, during
      which the IPG is either off or on, is carried out at 3 and 6 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months as long as the brain stimulation system remains in
      place.
