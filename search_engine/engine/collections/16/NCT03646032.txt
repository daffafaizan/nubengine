      Washington, DC (n=100) and Birmingham, Alabama (n=100). At both data collection sites,
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups during the pilot. The two groups
      are:

        1. Intervention group (n=100) - will consist of 50 AAA males / 50 AAA females randomly
           selected participants who will receive a download of the SAAFE game and play for at
           least 30 minutes and as long as an hour, if desired.

        2. Control group (n=100) - will consist of 50 AAA males / 50 AAA females randomly selected
           participants. This group will receive dating sim game (called Choices). They will also
           receive pamphlets that provide information on the testing location and care if they have
           HIV/STI.
