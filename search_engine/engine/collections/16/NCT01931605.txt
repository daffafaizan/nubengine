      approach, usually the right femoral artery. Initially, pelvic angiography is performed to
      evaluate the iliac and prostatic arteries. Then, a 5-F catheter is introduced in right
      femoral artery to catheterize the left hypogastric artery and reach its anterior division.
      The inferior vesical artery and finally the prostatic vessels are selectively catheterized
      with a 3-F coaxial microcatheter. For embolization, nonspherical 100-300 Î¼m PVA particles is
      used. The endpoint chosen for embolization is slow flow or near-stasis in the prostatic
      vessels with interruption of the arterial flow and prostatic gland opacification. When
      embolization of the left prostatic arteries was finished, the right prostatic arteries were
      embolized in the same way.

      Urinary catheter is removed 10 days after the embolization procedure. Voiding trials is
      performed and the successfull urination after urethral catheter removal is defined as three
      consecutive spontaneous micturitions with postvoid residual less than 100% of each
      micturition volume. If the patient is unable to urinate, a urethral catheter will replace
      before hospitalization discharge and the patient will return to our outpatient clinic for
      another voiding trial until the end of protocol. Assessments were carried out 10, 30 and 90
      days after initial embolization allocation.
