      self-limiting, and probably declining in frequency, with only 3-5% of cases posing a threat
      to eyesight, remaining a pathogenetic enigma and a therapeutic dilemma. In its nonsevere
      expression, the symptoms and signs include Photophobia, Foreign body sensation, Eyelid
      retraction, increased intraocular pressure, Lagophthalmos, and Mild diplopia. In its severe
      expression, it is a disfiguring and invalidating disease with the optic nerve damaged.
      However, in this study, we want to find if the retinal vessels is affected in the early stage
      of the disease through observing the oxygen saturation of the retinal vessels and compare it
      with that of the normal people.
