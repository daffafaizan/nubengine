      included. The diagnostic criteria for acute pancreatitis were epigastric pain, serum amylase
      > 3 x upper normal range, elevated serum CRP and signs of acute pancreatitis in imaging.
      Other etiologies were excluded. Alcohol consumption and dependency were detected. Serum and
      fecal markers of the endocrine and exocrine function and secretin stimulated MRCP were
      studied. The patients were followed median 38 (25 - 61) months for the recurrences and had a
      follow up visit at two years to investigate trends in the alcohol consumption.
