    
      Target patients for the C-MIC System are patients with idiopathic dilative cardiomyopathy who
      have systolic left ventricular dysfunction (NYHA class III - NYHA class IV) despite adequate
      therapy of heart failure and a left ventricular ejection fraction ranging from 25% to 35%
      with a history of heart failure of more than 1 year but less than 5 years.

      Study objective is to determine the safety and effectiveness of C-MIC therapy in patients
      with moderate to severe heart failure under optimal medical therapy. Data from a pilot study
      (C-MIC-I) indicate that an increase of ≥ 8% of the left ventricular ejection fraction can be
      achieved within a treatment period of 6 month. Hence, study hypothesis is that an increase in
      LVEF of ≥ 8% can be achieved.

      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive the C-MIC System in addition to optimal
      medical management or to receive optimal medical management alone without device. Due to the
      risks associated with the implantation, a sham (placebo) procedure is not justified.

      The primary endpoint will be the change of left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) from
      baseline after 6 months assessed via cardiac ultrasound in %. LVEF measurements will be
      verified by a core lab at baseline, week 4 (only C-MIC group), month 4 and month 6.
