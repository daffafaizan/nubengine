      cancer patients about their disease, treatment options - and potential benefits and side
      effects of the planned therapy than information provided during a regular doctor
      consultation.

      The investigators believe that standardizing and repeating the information as well as having
      more time for questions in an open environment for reflections will improve the amount of
      information patients can perceive. Furthermore, all patients will be given written
      information.

      Better-informed patients may be more motivated and may contact health care personnel earlier
      than other patients when they develop side effects. This may reduce the risk of serious
      treatment-related complications and increase the chances of patients completing the planned
      treatment. But none have compared to what extent an organization like Vardesenteret improves
      the patients' knowledge and whether patients are more satisfied with these methods for
      informing them. Results from studies on the influence of patient anxiety and distress on
      patient's abilities to perceive information are conflicting.Two large groups of relatively
      homogenous cancer patients are patients with lower-stage breast cancer patients who are
      eligible for adjuvant chemotherapy and patients with localized prostate cancer eligible for
      curative radiotherapy.
