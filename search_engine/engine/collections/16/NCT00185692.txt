      non-myeloablative conditioning regimen. This regime would consist of both; total lymphoid
      irradiation (TLI) and anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG). Used in combination to achieve
      engraftment of haploidentical CD34+ selected peripheral blood stem cells in older patients or
      patients with underlying medical conditions that preclude standard allogeneic treatment. The
      expected results of this transplant regime will be expected to result in hematopoietic and
      immunologic reconstitution, decreased deaths related to the treatment regimen and decreased
      gravft-vs-host disease (GVHD).
