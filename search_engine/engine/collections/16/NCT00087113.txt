        -  Determine the antitumor activity of pemetrexed disodium in patients with recurrent
           carcinoma of the cervix that failed higher priority treatment protocols.

        -  Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive pemetrexed disodium IV over 10 minutes on day 1. Courses repeat every 21
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Beginning 7 days before and continuing until 3 weeks after the last dose of pemetrexed
      disodium, patients also receive oral folic acid daily and cyanocobalamin (vitamin B_12)
      intramuscularly every 9 weeks.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 22-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2
      years.
