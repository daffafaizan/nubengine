      growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in enhancing neovascularization processes. Some studies have shown
      the efficacy of intravitreal Avastin in reducing level of VEGF-A to improve NVG. On the other
      hand, recent pathological studies demonstrated that neutralization of VEGF reduced
      vascularity and decreased scar formation during wound healing, showing that VEGF strongly
      influence scar tissue formation. This may reduce the formation of encapsulated cyst after
      glaucoma surgeries and thus might improve the surgical success rate. The effect of
      subconjunctival bevacizumab as an adjunctive therapy in filtering glaucoma surgeries has been
      recently illustrated.

      We aim to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of subconjunctival injection of Avastin as an
      adjunctive therapy for Ahmed valve glaucoma implant in patients with refractory glaucoma.
