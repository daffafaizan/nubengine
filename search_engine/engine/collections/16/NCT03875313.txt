    
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation and dose-expansion study. In Part 1,
      escalating doses of CB-839 will be paired with the standard dose of talazoparib in order to
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the RP2D of the regimen and to characterize
      the safety and tolerability profile of the combination in participants with
      advanced/metastatic solid tumors.

      In Part 2, the combination of CB-839 and talazoparib will be evaluated at the RP2D determined
      in Part 1 to evaluate the anti-cancer activity of the regimen in participants with
      advanced/metastatic clear cell RCC, TNBC or CRC.
