    
      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blind, multicenter, pivotal trial that
      will evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Adherus Dural Sealant when used in conjunction
      with standard methods of dural repair in spinal procedures. This trial uses the commercially
      available DuraSeal Exact as an active control. The trial is designed to demonstrate
      non-inferiority of Adherus Dural Sealant to DuraSeal Exact.

      Subjects who are undergoing spinal surgery, consent to participate in this trial and
      experience a durotomy will be considered for study enrollment. Following a two-tiered
      inclusion/exclusion consideration, subjects will be randomized intraoperatively using a 1:1
      randomization ratio. Up to 256 subjects will be randomized to treatment with either Adherus
      Dural Sealant or DuraSeal Exact with at least 50% of subjects undergoing procedures at lumbar
      or lumbosacral levels. Up to 30 investigational sites within the United States will
      participate in this trial.

      A primary composite endpoint evaluating safety and effectiveness will be measured within a
      90-day required follow-up period post-procedure. Subjects will be followed at discharge or
      between postoperative days (POD) 1-4 from the index procedure (whichever occurs first) and at
      30 days and 90 days post-index procedure.
