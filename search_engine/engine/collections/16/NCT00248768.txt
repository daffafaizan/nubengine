      repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in patients with refractory depression.
      (Please Note: The original requirement for comorbid Parkinson's disease has been dropped from
      this study).

      Research Plan: This inpatient study will provide an initial test for the hypothesis that
      accelerated rTMS is an effective treatment for depression. Followup testing will help
      delineate the time course of response.

      Methods: The rTMS treatment site over left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be 5.5cm
      anterior to the hand motor area. Treatments consisting of 1000 total pulses at 10 Hz and 100%
      motor threshold will be administered hourly for 1.5 days, totaling 15 sessions. A
      comprehensive test battery will be administered just before and after treatment, at 3 weeks,
      and at 6 weeks after treatment.

      Clinical Relevance: We expect that accelerated rTMS treatments will lessen the degree of
      depression to the same extent as rTMS treatments of longer duration, but far more rapidly. A
      much shorter hospitalization would be more easily tolerated. In addition, reducing the
      duration of hospitalization substantially reduces burdens and costs to hospital, staff, and
      caregivers, while more rapidly enhancing function and quality of life.
