      studies indicate that a causal relationship exists between the surgical or traumatic injury
      and the predisposition to develop septic/infectious complications and multiple organ failure;
      this is attributable to uncontrolled inflammatory response. Since neonates have an immature
      immune system, they are in a higher risk to develop uncontrolled inflammatory response and
      adverse clinical outcomes.

      N-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (L-PUFAs) such as docosapentaenoic and
      docosahexaenoic acids (EPA and DHA) have been shown to reduce the inflammatory response by
      reducing cytokines, infection rates and length of hospitalization in patients with abdominal
      surgery. Therefore, acute and enteral administration of DHA may improve clinical outcomes in
      neonates with cardiovascular surgery
