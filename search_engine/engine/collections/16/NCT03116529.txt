    
      The main purposes of this study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of
      Durvalumab and Tremelimumab in combination with radiation prior to surgical resection of
      high-risk soft tissue sarcoma in the pelvis and extremities.

      Patients will receive the same radiation therapy and surgical care they would receive
      normally and with no change in timing or duration of each treatment. They will also receive
      two immunotherapy agents, Durvalumab and Tremelimumab, during radiation prior to surgery, and
      a single agent, Durvalumab, after surgery.
