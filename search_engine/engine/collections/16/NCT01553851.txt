      findings demonstrating that (a) activation of the ERK1/2 kinases is associated with
      aggressive features, (b) this aggressive phenotype is directly linked to expression of CD44,
      a cell surface hyaluronan receptor and (c) this association between activated ERK1/2 and CD44
      is also identified in human cell lines and primary tumors. These data suggest that ERK1/2 is
      targetable biochemical pathway in CD44 expressing cells. These cells represent putative
      cancer stem cells or tumor initiating cells that have been associated with worse patient
      outcomes. Thus, the application of GSK1120212 to target OCSCC is a specific translational
      application of our laboratory findings.
