      identified as a key risk factor for poor child development outcomes in growth, cognition, and
      overall child health in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Maternal depression during
      a child's infancy predicts negative behavior and lower achievement scores, as well as
      increased absences in elementary school), and has been identified as a significant risk
      factor for poor infant growth in the developing world. There is considerable evidence to
      suggest that a community-based intervention, delivered by trained community volunteers, can
      have a significant impact on perinatal depression and child development outcomes. This
      cluster-randomized trial in Northern Ghana will assess the impact of the Integrated Mothers
      and Babies Course & Early Childhood Development (iMBC/ECD) intervention on the mental
      wellbeing of mothers of children under 2 and their children's attainment of age-appropriate
      developmental milestones. In Ghana, the iMBC/ECD will be implemented in the context of the
      Rural Emergency Health Service and Transport project (REST II). A key activity of REST II is
      Community Pregnancy Surveillance and Targeted Education Sessions (C-PrES). Routine C-PrES is
      delivered via educational group sessions that promote the adoption of key Maternal, Neonatal
      and Child Health and Nutrition (MNCHN) behaviors (e.g. newborn care, exclusive breastfeeding,
      etc.) among pregnant women and mothers of children under age two.
