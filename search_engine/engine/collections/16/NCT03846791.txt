    
      This is an observational cohort study. It evaluates the recovery of 100 patients who are
      having routine robotic hip replacement surgery at a Nuffield Hospital in Bournemouth. Any
      complications from the surgery, or readmissions to hospital, will be reported. Investigators
      will measure how accurately the surgeon, assisted by the robotic-arm, positions the hip
      implant during the surgery using x-rays taken as part of routine care. The study also
      monitors the progress of rehabilitation by assessing pain and functional ability in the year
      following surgery, and will investigate whether there is an association between this recovery
      and a measurement of an area of muscle in the pelvic region, taken from a routine CT scan.

      Patients will be asked to come to the Orthopaedic Research Institute at Bournemouth
      University to be assessed before they have surgery, and again at 3 weeks, 6-8 weeks, 3
      months, 6 months and 12 months following surgery. At these visits they will be asked about
      their pain, how well they can do daily activities, and their quality of life. They will also
      be assessed on their ability to sit-to-stand five times, walk for 40m, and climb some stairs.
      At each visit, except the three weeks visit, they will also have their gait tested on a
      specialised clinical treadmill, and the muscle strength in their legs measured. These visits
      are in addition to the routine clinical follow-up visits at Nuffield Hospital.

      Surgery-related resource use of the procedure will also be reported, such as length of
      hospital stay, time in theatre, unplanned hospital visits, non-routine medication, outpatient
      appointments and physiotherapy appointments.
