      used to select the propensity matched patients will include: age; gender; health plan type
      and region; DCI score; presence/absence of nephropathy; ischemic heart disease;
      cerebrovascular disease; neoplasm; insulin use; and all-cause health plan costs in the 6-mont
      pre-index period.

      Claims information about patients selected for the study will be followed longitudinally to
      the end of data availability. This data stream will be used to determine treatment patterns
      for Metanx®, healthcare resource utilization, and cost.
