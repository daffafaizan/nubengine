      street to families of overweight and obese children between 7-17 years of age referred from
      selected pediatric practices on the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Western Maryland with use
      of noninvasive lifestyle tracking options (drink water aquarium app for water consumption and
      fitbit charge 3- steps, sleep monitoring) provides novel options for expansion of family-
      based lifestyle intervention to underserved areas. Investigators plan as a pilot study to
      assess the sensitivity of noninvasive measures for the detection of sleep apnea (pediatric
      sleep questionnaire (PSQ) and fitbit charge 3 sleep data) in comparison to clinically
      indicated polysomnography among children with clinical suspicion for sleep apnea.
