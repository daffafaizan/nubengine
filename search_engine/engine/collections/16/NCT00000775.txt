      effective vaccines against HIV-1. SynVac is a synthetic candidate vaccine based on eight
      V3-derived peptides attached to a heptalysyl core to form radial octamers. In animal studies,
      the vaccine appears safe and demonstrates the capability for producing immune responses.

      Twelve volunteers are entered at one of three dose levels of SynVac. At each dose level, 10
      volunteers receive vaccine and two receive placebo. At least eight volunteers at each dose
      level must be monitored for 1 week before subsequent volunteers are entered at the next
      higher level. Intramuscular injections are given on day 0, 28, and 168. Approximately 12
      clinic visits are required.
