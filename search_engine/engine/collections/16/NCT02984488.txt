      tissue, bacteria, or inflammatory products within the root canal system.

      Endodontic treatment used to take multiple visits to complete, with one of the main reasons
      for this being that it required a considerable amount of time to complete the treatment.

      The single-visit treatment was bought back in the 1950s by Ferranti, who advocated the use of
      diathermy for pulpal disinfection and hydrogen peroxide for irrigation.

      The use of contemporary endodontic techniques and equipment, such as use of rubber dam,
      magnifying devices, electronic apex locators, engine-driven rotary nickel titanium files, and
      so forth, not only increases the success rate of endodontic treatment but also, shortens the
      time needed for the treatment. Endodontic treatment may therefore be completed in a single
      visit.

      It is generally agreed upon that the prepared canals can never be sterile before obturation,
      no matter how potent the antibacterial irrigants or intracanal medications are. There are
      currently two measures to reduce bacterial persistence and reinfection in the canals. We can
      either dress the canals with antibacterial agents in multiple visits or immediately obturate
      the canals, to reduce the space for bacterial colonization, in a single-visit approach.
      Calcium hydroxide is the most commonly used intracanal medicament, however its efficacy
      towards Enterococcus faecalis is questionable.
