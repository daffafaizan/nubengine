      tremelimumab in the treatment of different cohorts of patients with selected advanced solid
      tumors. If eligible and at the discretion of the Investigator, after confirmed disease
      progression on tremelimumab monotherapy or during follow-up, patients will have the option of
      being sequenced to MEDI4736 (MedImmune 4736) monotherapy or MEDI4736 + tremelimumab
      combination therapy, for up to 12 months or until disease progression, whichever comes
      sooner.
