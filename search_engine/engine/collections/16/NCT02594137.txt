      randomized by numbered envelopes into 2 groups: with watertight duraplasty (control group)
      vs. without watertight duraplasty / rapid closure DC (test group). In all cases, a large
      trauma flap (i.e. large reverse question mark starting from the tragus and extending to the
      midline) was performed. Skin, galea and muscle layers were elevated according to surgeon
      preference. Thus a wide (at least 12x15cm) craniotomy was performed and the temporal bone was
      removed until flush with the middle fossa floor. After dural opening, watertight duraplasty
      with pericranium or an artificial graft (at surgeon's discretion) was performed in the
      control group, while no watertight duraplasty was performed in the test group, and exposed
      brain parenchyma was covered with SurgicelÂ®. Usual closure was then performed. Patients were
      then monitored daily by evaluators blinded to the randomization (control or test group) from
      the date of surgery until hospital discharge or death.
