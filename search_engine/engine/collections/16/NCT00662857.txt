      parameters of two 15 U TI Inhalation Powder cartridges versus one 30 U TI Inhalation Powder
      cartridge, according to a randomized, 2-way crossover design. Additionally, bioavailability
      of one 30 U TI Inhalation Powder cartridge to a single subcutaneous injection of 10 IU of RAA
      will be compared.
