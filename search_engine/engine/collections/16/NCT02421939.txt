      informed consent may participate in this study. Participants will be randomized in a 2:1
      ratio to receive ASP2215 or salvage chemotherapy. Participants will enter the screening
      period up to 14 days prior to the start of treatment. Prior to randomization, a salvage
      chemotherapy regimen will be pre-selected for each participant; options will include low-dose
      cytarabine (LoDAC), azacitidine, mitoxantrone, etoposide, and intermediate-dose cytarabine
      (MEC), or fludarabine, cytarabine, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) with
      idarubicin (FLAG-IDA). The randomization will be stratified by response to first-line therapy
      and pre-selected salvage chemotherapy. Participants will be administered treatment over
      continuous 28-day cycles.

      After treatment discontinuation, participants will have a pre-hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT)/end-of-treatment visit within 7 days after treatment discontinuation,
      followed by a 30-day follow-up for safety, in which a telephone contact with the participant
      is sufficient unless any assessment must be repeated for resolution of treatment-related
      adverse events (AEs). After that, long term follow-up will be done every 3 months up to 3
      years from the participant's end-of-treatment visit.
