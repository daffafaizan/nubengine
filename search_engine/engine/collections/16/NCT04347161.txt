      project is to identify effective strategies for improving lung cancer outcomes by helping
      patients to better manage symptoms and adhere to oral therapies. Given the rapid increase in
      FDA-approved targeted therapies, the need for such strategies will continue to grow. Our
      central hypothesis is that conversational agent will improve adherence to oral therapies by
      targeting patient-level determinants of behavior change. The specific aims are to: 1) Test
      the effects of a patient-directed intervention (conversational agent) to improve adherence to
      oral targeted therapies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.; and 2) Use
      mixed-methods approaches with clinicians and patients to explore multilevel factors shaping
      the acceptability, effectiveness, and future implementation of intervention into routine
      cancer care. Primary trial outcomes (adherence and persistence) will be measured using
      microelectronic monitoring system (MEMS) caps. Secondary outcomes will be assessed using
      longitudinal surveys and medical record data.
