      cigarettes among African American menthol and nonmenthol smokers.

      Primary Hypothesis: At 8 weeks and 24 weeks post-enrollment, there will be a significant
      association between use of electronic cigarettes and biomarkers of smoking exposure such that
      changes in biomarkers from baseline to follow-up will be higher among participants randomized
      to the active e-cigarette condition.
