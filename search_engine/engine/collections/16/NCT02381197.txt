      congophilia in pregnancy using the Congo Red Dot test by following patients longitudinally
      across gestation in Bangladesh and Mexico City. A total of 2000 women presenting for prenatal
      care will be enrolled (1000 at each site). In Bangladesh, pregnant women will be identified
      during monthly home visits of Community Health Workers (CHW) affiliated with Matlab in
      Chandpur and asked to participate. In Mexico, women will be identified at routine antenatal
      appointments. If the woman agrees to participate, investigators will ask her to consent to
      donation of urine for testing (Congo Red Dot test and Proteinuria dipstick test) at the time
      of enrollment, four times during her pregnancy (first trimester 6-12 weeks; second trimester
      13-28 weeks; third trimester 29-36 weeks; term 37-41 weeks) and possibly three times
      postpartum (24 hours after delivery and daily until discharge). As a result, the enrolled
      patients will be followed longitudinally throughout pregnancy until delivery of the baby
      either at term for an uncomplicated gestation or preterm/term for preeclampsia. The group of
      women who develop preeclampsia will represent the study group. At the end of the study, the
      results will be analyzed to identify how many weeks in advance the women who developed
      preeclampsia displayed congophilia.
