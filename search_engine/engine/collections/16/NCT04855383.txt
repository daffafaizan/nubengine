      important role. The endometrium secrets cytokines and growth factors that modulate embryonic
      differentiation and early development. One of the important molecular messages between the
      embryo and endometrium is human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). HCG is expressed by the
      blastocyst before the implantation, while increasingly produced after implantation by the
      syncytiotrophoblast. In order to study the direct effect of HCG on the endometrium at
      implantation, this randomized, controlled clinical trial evaluated whether HCG
      supplementation would be beneficial for pregnancy outcomes of cryopreserved-thawed embryo
      transfer with estrogen/ progesterone replacement cycles at Royan Institute.

      Block randomization method is designed by epidemiologist using STATA software version 13 and
      the number of blocks considered is 6. The random allocation list for patients is solely
      available to the epidemiologist. In order to hide the random allocation process, a total of
      200 envelopes are prepared, and only the methodologist has been aware of table of random
      numbers. When the doctor declared the patient's eligibility, the methodologist provided the
      doctor with the envelope. The group will be selected and based on the type of group mentioned
      in the envelope.
