    
      Primary Objective: To evaluate the percentage of pancreatic cancer patients able to complete
      the full 4 months of preoperative chemotherapy and undergo a resection.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To assess the percentage of patients able to complete all therapy, including
           preoperative chemotherapy, surgery, and postoperative therapy.

        -  To assess treatment-related toxicity during preoperative therapy

        -  To assess intra-operative and post-operative complications

        -  To assess the histopathologic (R0/R1) resection rate after preoperative therapy

        -  To determine disease free survival (DFS) for patients who undergo resection.

        -  To determine progression free survival (PFS) for all patients

        -  To determine overall survival (OS) from the date of first treatment
