        -  Determine the effect of melatonin, used as radiosensitization/radioprotection, on
           overall survival and clinical deterioration in patients with brain metastases who are
           undergoing radiotherapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      planned chemotherapy after whole brain irradiation (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1
      of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo whole brain irradiation once daily 5 days a week for 2 weeks.
           Patients receive oral melatonin once daily every morning.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo whole brain irradiation as in arm I. Patients receive oral
           melatonin once daily every evening.

      All patients continue on melatonin for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed at months 6 and 12 from start of radiotherapy and then every 6 months
      thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 128 patients (64 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 5 months.
