    
      In this trial patients will submit germline (blood) and tumor tissue samples as part of two
      existing sample collection protocols for analysis of genetic and molecular markers governing
      response to chemotherapy. Pathologic review of tissue samples after neoadjuvant therapy will
      allow determination of the complete response rate (pT0 rate) and this will be compared
      between patients with "susceptible" and "resistant" genetic/molecular cisplatin
      susceptibility variants.

      Primary Endpoint: Analysis of whether a small set of previously-identified germline
      "cisplatin susceptibility" polymorphisms associate with achievement of a complete pathologic
      response to neoadjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy in urothelial cancer patients.

      Secondary Endpoints: To perform companion genetic or molecular analyses of other
      previously-identified gene, SNP, or microRNA "cisplatin susceptibility" candidates in these
      patients, using tumor and/or germline tissue.

      Exploratory Endpoints: To perform unbiased, hypothesis-generating SNP, gene, or microRNA
      array studies to identify novel germline or tumor determinants which may predict response to
      cisplatin-based chemotherapy.
