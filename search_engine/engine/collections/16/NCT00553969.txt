           on Rasmussen Disease Score in a controlled study with an inactive substance (placebo).

        -  Study patients will have pre-hypertensive (slightly elevated) blood pressures not
           requiring therapy.

        -  Lisinopril is an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor. Angiotensin is a
           chemical that is made by the body continuously. Angiotensin narrows blood vessels and
           thereby maintains (elevates) blood pressure. When the enzyme is blocked by lisinopril,
           angiotensin cannot be converted into its active form. As a result, blood pressure is
           lowered. Lisinopril is a drug that has been approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug
           Administration (FDA) and health authorities for the treatment of high blood pressure and
           heart failure.

        -  Coreg CR is a once-a-day heart medication that is part of a class of drugs known as
           beta-blockers. Beta-blockers prevent beta-adrenergic substances such as adrenaline from
           activating parts of the nervous system, including the heart. Beta-blockers therefore
           relieve stress on the heart by slowing heart beat, decreasing the force of heart muscle
           contractions, and reducing blood pressure. Coreg has also been approved by the FDA for
           the treatment of hypertension and various other cardiovascular conditions.

        -  It is possible that the beta blocker could increase the benefits of the ACE inhibitor by
           inhibiting renin production, which is an important step in angiotensin production. These
           two drugs may act together to provide even more protection to blood vessels and the
           heart.
