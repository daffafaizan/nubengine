      However, patients differ in their ability to learn control over their own brain activity with
      neurofeedback. It is thus crucial to understand the brain networks that mediate learned
      self-regulation with real-time fMRI. The objective of the present study is thus to identify
      brain networks in patients that contribute to successfully learning self-regulation with
      real-time fMRI. To achieve this goal, patients suffering from depression, post-traumatic
      stress disorder, and nicotine addiction will be trained to improve their self-regulation
      skills using established real-time fMRI neurofeedback protocols.
