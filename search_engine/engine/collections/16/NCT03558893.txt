      across all circadian phases, this protocol will allow us specifically to:

        1. To determine if poor sleep, while controlling for circadian phase, contributes to the
           higher overall BP and reduced nocturnal drop in BP in Blacks compared to Whites.

        2. To determine if reduced BP responses to standardized behavioral changes across the day
           and night contribute to the higher overall BP and reduced nocturnal drop in BP in Blacks
           compared to Whites.

        3. To determine if reduced circadian amplitude of BP contributes to the higher overall BP
           and reduced nocturnal drop in BP in Blacks compared to Whites.
