      opportunity to become collaborative partners in their care. In addition, by bridging
      information gaps and improving workflow efficiency, continuity of care is optimized and the
      potential risk for error is reduced. Triage time for kiosk self-triage and nurse-initiated
      triage will be compared in terms of 1) triage time; 2) accuracy of medical history obtained;
      and 3) patient satisfaction.
