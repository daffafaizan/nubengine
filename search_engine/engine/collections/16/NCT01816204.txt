      have paid the health fee, and who are seeking treatment for anxiety and the Counseling and
      Wellness Center. Students who meet criteria and agree to participate will select from two
      treatments, individual face-to-face or therapist assisted on-line treatment. Prior to each
      session of individual therapy, or on-line treatment participants will complete the Behavioral
      Health Measure-20 is a normal part of treatment at the CWC.

      If a participant is assigned to the Therapist-assisted on-line (TAO) treatment he/she will be
      asked to complete a seven module on-line treatment. Each module includes interactive,
      educational materials and weekly assignments. Subjects may participate in an on-line
      discussion forum with other participants for each module. The forum will use only first names
      or a pseudonym to protect confidentiality. In addition, participants in the TAO treatment
      will receive a 10-20 minute video-conference weekly with a doctoral level therapist.
      Therapists will review assignments, answer questions, and help to apply the educational
      materials contained in the modules to the subjects life.

      The video conference will be on Adobe Connect. This involves a free download for a computer,
      tablet, or smart phone. Medical records will be kept for ten years, per UF policy. Adobe
      connect is HIPAA and HITECH compliant. Research records will be de-identified and use an
      identifier number that cannot be connected to individual participants.

      Only 2 arms were actually used, Face-to-face therapy and TAO treatment.
