    
      This is a factorial randomized controlled trial of comparative effectiveness and precision
      medicine. Participants will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1:2:1 to one of four arms:
      telemonitoring of blood pressure by smart phone, text message for lifestyle changes, both
      interventions (telemonitoring and messages) or usual clinical care. At randomization, all
      participants will receive a printed booklet with lifestyle modification guidelines. The
      standardized recommendation to adhere to the pharmacological treatment prescribed by the
      attending physician will also be implemented. These types of interventions do not allow the
      research assistant responsible for monitoring to be blinded, but the researcher resposible
      for the assessment of the outcome will be blinded to the allocated arm and the results will
      be evaluated through objective measurements.
