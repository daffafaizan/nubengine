      be approached to enroll in a one year clinical trial looking at decreasing fatigue in persons
      with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The intervention group will receive individual
      coaching based in motivational interviewing sessions focusing on physical activity and
      nutrition while the control group will receive individual calls focusing on SLE
      self-management. This study is designed to evaluate the LIFT intervention to decreased
      fatigue (primary outcome), improve physical activity (secondary outcome) and dietary behavior
      (exploratory outcome) in persons with SLE.
