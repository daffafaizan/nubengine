      including increased risk for syncope and in severe cases even cardiogenic shock. Yet,
      anemia-associated symptoms might manifest relatively late after the patient have lost a fair
      amount of blood, which was not diagnosed early enough. To date, there are not acceptable
      guidelines for monitoring hemoglobin levels after delivery. Theoretically, there are 2
      approaches for hemoglobin monitoring - one by taking hemoglobin levels in order to diagnose
      anemia in patients reporting anemia-associated symptoms. The other approach is by screening
      of women at increased risk for post-partum anemia. In the present study we aimed to compare
      those 2 approaches.
