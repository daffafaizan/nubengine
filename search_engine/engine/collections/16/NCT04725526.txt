      clinical practice, to improve health literacy and self-management of the multiple
      pathological patient with heart failure and complex health needs.

      Hypothesis: the proposed mHealth intervention is more effective than usual clinical practice,
      favoring health literacy and self-management of multiple pathological patients with heart
      failure and complex health needs, so its use would be relevant as part of the assistance
      process.

      Methodology: randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical trial for the evaluation of the
      efficacy of an mHealth intervention with two groups: a control group (routine clinical
      practice) and an experimental group (routine clinical practice together with ad hoc designed
      mHealth intervention).

      In this project, the design and content validation of the mHealth tool will be carried out,
      evaluating its relevance and suitability.
