      the effect of multiple doses of mipomersen (200 mg SC given every other day for a total of 4
      doses) on the PD and PK of warfarin and to evaluate the PK of mipomersen when administered
      alone and in combination with warfarin. Subjects will be admitted to the clinic on Day -1
      until discharge from the clinic on Day 18 and return for outpatient visits on Days 19, 20,
      and 78. All subjects will receive a single 25-mg oral dose of warfarin given alone on Day 1
      (designated the reference treatment). All subjects will then receive 200-mg SC doses of
      mipomersen given every other day on Days 8, 10, 12, and 14 (total of 800 mg mipomersen) with
      a single 25-mg oral dose of warfarin also given on Day 14 (combination designated the test
      treatment).
