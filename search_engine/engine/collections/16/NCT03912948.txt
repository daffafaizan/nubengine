      block (injection of local anesthetic around the serratus muscle under ultrasound guidance) in
      the prevalence of chronic pain 3 months after a conservative breast cancer surgery.

      Information on the present survey was given during pre-operative consultation and signed
      informed consent was obtained to enter the study.

      The management of patients undergoing minor surgery for breast cancer is standardized within
      our department and reported in our previous study. After starting the induction of anesthesia
      and insertion of a laryngeal mask, a regional analgesia technique was performed under
      ultrasonography. Twenty ml of ropivacaine 3.75mg/ml were injected under the serratus muscle,
      at the lateral edge of the minor pectoralis muscle. In the absence of contraindications,
      multimodal analgesia consisted of paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and
      nefopam. Postoperative intravenous morphine titration was possible in patients presenting a
      pain score >3/10 (numeric pain intensity scale from 0 = no pain to 10 = maximum imaginable
      pain) in the recovery room. If 0.1mg/kg of morphine did not permit to alleviate pain,
      ketamine titration was initiated by the anesthesiologist.

      The incidence of patients that required opioids titration in the recovery room (and the dose
      injected) was recorded.

      The questionnaire sent to the patients 3 months after their surgery was mainly composed of
      closed questions. This questionnaire included pain score, location of pain, analgesic drugs
      consumption, neuropathic component (self-administered questionnaire derived from the
      Neuropathic Pain 4 Questions - DN4 questionnaire), impact of quality of life using the Brief
      Pain Inventory.
