    
      The study will include a multidisciplinary consultation with:

        -  Targeted behavioral assessment auditory processing disorder (APD): speech-in-noise
           perception, phonemic identification and discrimination, dichotic listening test,
           temporal processing tests, Random Gap Detection Threshold (RGDT) test.

        -  Psychometric assessment: assessment of visual / auditory working memory, visual /
           auditory attention, study of cognitive functions.

        -  Ear, Nose, Throat (ENT) examination with otoscopy, tonal and vocal audiometry and ABR
           recording.

        -  Genetic analysis

        -  Cortical auditory evoked potential (AEP) recording, compared with the automatized
           cortical AEP recording on Hear Lab machine.

      The purpose of the study is looking for objective biomarkers of APD:

        -  Compare EEG results with MRI-fMRI results

        -  Analyze the cortical maturation of children who are fitted with hearings aids: second
           record of cortical APD performed one year after the fitting.

        -  Compare the results after one year between group 1 ( with or without hearing aids) and
           children from group 2.

        -  MRI-fMRI : to analyze the flow of perfusion, the DTI sequences, and the blood oxygen
           level-dependent (BOLD) effect (fMRI)

      With this multidisciplinary evaluation, the investigators wish to improve the diagnosis of
      APD in suspected children by associating clinical, radiological, electro-physiological and
      genetic criteria.

      Better understanding and more accurate diagnosis of APD's will improve the care management of
      these children.
