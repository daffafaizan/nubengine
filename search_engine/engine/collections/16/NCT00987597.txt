      first, then two "cigaret exposures cessions" during hospitalisation. Thereafter-one week
      after he's out- the patient will come for 5 follow up visits consisting in the specific
      technique of cigaret exposure and nicotinic treatment adjustment. Then the last visit, at six
      months, will tell us if the patient is an effective non smoker or not; We'll be also
      collecting psychological and medical informations (such as the treatment, IMC, cardiovascular
      check up and psychological tests). The control group : This group is managed as "usual" : the
      nurse gives very rapid recommendations to the patients concerning smoking cessation.
      Nicotinic substitutes are proposed to the patients but the patient must find them by itself.
