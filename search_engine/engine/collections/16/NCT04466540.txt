    
      Pragmatic, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized parallel-group, two-arm clinical trial
      (with allocation ratio 1:1), evaluating hydroxychloroquine (800 mg at 1st day, and 400 mg
      from day 2 to 7) for prevention of hospitalization and respiratory complications in
      non-hospitalized confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases. Key inclusion criteria are adults
      (equal to or greater tahn 18 years) seeking medical care with suspected or confirmed
      COVID-19, with time between symptoms and inclusion ≤ 07 days, presenting mild symptoms,
      without indication of hospitalization and at least one risk factor for complication (> 65
      years; hypertension; diabetes mellitus; asthma; Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)
      or other chronic lung diseases; smoking; immunosuppression; obesity (Defined as BMI equal to
      or greater than 30 Kg/m2). Primary endpoint is to assess if the treatment with
      hydroxychloroquine is able to avoid hospitalization due to a COVID-19-related clinical reason
      within 30 days of randomization in an outpatient setting. Hospitalization is considered to be
      hospital stay for a period > 24h or an additional hospitalized calendar day. The primary
      endpoint is centrally adjudicated by an independent clinical events committee blinded to the
      assigned treatment groups. Secondary endpoints include uncontrolled asthma after ≥ 5 days of
      starting study medication; pneumonia; otitis media; fever resolution time; time to improve
      respiratory symptoms; hospitalization in the Intensive Care Unit; need for orotracheal
      intubation; mechanical ventilation time; mortality. Safety outcomes will be hypoglycemia;
      palpitations; reduced visual acuity; diarrhea; anorexia; and emotional lability. The
      evaluation of the primary outcome (hospitalization within 30 days) will be performed for the
      included population following the principle of intention-to-treat (ITT), which will consist
      of all randomized cases. A modified intention-to-treat analysis (mITT), in which cases
      definitely confirmed as negative for COVID-19 will be excluded, will also be performed.
