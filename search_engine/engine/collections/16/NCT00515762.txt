      been recently described. Docetaxel is toxic to skin and skin annexes and can produce nail
      toxicity and persistent alopecia. Nail toxicity has been successfully prevented by means of
      hypothermic gloves and slippers (Elasto-gel, Southwest Technologies, Inc, North Kansas City,
      MO). This pilot trial explores the capacity of a cooling cap (Elasto-gel) to prevent
      persistent alopecia in breast cancer patients treated with adjuvant docetaxel regimens.
