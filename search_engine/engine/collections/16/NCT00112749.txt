        -  Determine the association between the body's immune system and energy, sleep, mood, and
           other symptoms in postmenopausal women who have undergone treatment for stage 0-II
           breast cancer.

        -  Determine whether treatment with infliximab affects energy and immune function in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive infliximab IV over 2 hours.

      Patients complete a diary twice daily for 14 days before and for 14 days after infliximab
      administration to assess fatigue and other symptoms, including mood, pain, and sleep.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 2 weeks and then monthly for 3
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study.
