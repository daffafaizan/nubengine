    
      SPECIFIC AIM: The specific aims of this study are to evaluate the long term outcomes of
      patients previously enrolled in the STRokE DOC ("STRokE DOC Trial (NCT00283868)")
      telemedicine clinical trial.

      AIM 1: Aim 1 is a non- randomized, retrospective, data collection study assessing long term
      patient outcomes of patients previously enrolled in a telemedicine vs. telephone clinical
      trial (STRokE DOC Trial ("STRokE DOC Trial (NCT00283868)"); now completed). STRokE DOC-LTO
      will evaluate, (only for those patients previously enrolled in the original telemedicine vs.
      telephone clinical research trial), the long term patient outcomes; comparing telemedicine
      versus telephone-only consultations.

      Specific Protocol Information: The protocol will contact these patients by telephone. One of
      5 Stroke Center team members will contact the patient, using strict telephone scripted
      language (approved by the IRB) and ask questions regarding

        1. current functional status

        2. death

        3. Hemorrhage

        4. Recurrent Stroke

        5. Disposition for 3 time periods (6 months after index event, 12 months after index event,
           and "current" time of contact.
