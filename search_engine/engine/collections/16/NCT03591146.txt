    
      A Phase I/II, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled, dose-escalation study to
      assess the safety, PK, and efficacy of single postsurgical application of TLC590 compared
      with Naropin® via a single infiltrative local administration in adult subjects following
      inguinal hernia repair surgery.

      Approximately 64 evaluable subjects across 4 cohorts. Dose escalation of a single
      postsurgical administration of TLC590 or Naropin® will be performed. Dose escalation will be
      determined by review of treatment-related adverse events and all serious AEs by a safety
      monitoring committee.
