    
      Upon discharge from hospital for COVID-19 infection (or during a telephone call for patients
      already discharged at the start of the study), patients will be informed of the study. An
      ophthalmology appointment will be given to them between 4 and 6 months after their discharge.

      During the ophthalmology appointment, the patient's clinical data will be collected during an
      interview (medical and treatment history, blood group). The patient will benefit from a full
      ophthalmological examination.
