      outcomes. Yet, the implementation of deceptive placebos in clinical practice is incompatible
      with key principles of openness and patient autonomy. However, recent research suggests that
      placebos remain effective even if they openly described as placebos (so-called Open-Label
      Placebos (OLP)), hence questioning the necessity of deception in clinical trials. However,
      research identifying the specific mechanisms underlying OLP is lacking. Therefore, the
      current study aims to examine hope and expectations as components of OLP in pain.

      For this purpose, experimentally induced heat pain is examined. First, all participants
      receive heat pain stimuli and evaluate them. Next, participants are randomly assigned to one
      of four groups: (1) a traditional deceptive placebo (DP) group, which is told that they
      receive an effective analgesic cream, (2) an OLP group inducing hope among the participants
      that the placebo cream could help them tolerating painful stimuli (OLP hope), (3) and OLP
      group raising the expectation that the placebo cream will help participants tolerating heat
      pain (OLP expectation), (4) a control group receiving no cream. Finally, participants receive
      and evaluate heat pain again.
