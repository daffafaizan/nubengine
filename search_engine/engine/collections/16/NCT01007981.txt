      selected patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure on optimal medical therapy and
      evidence of left ventricular (LV) conduction delay and contraction dyssynchrony. It can
      improve quality of life and results in better survival in this selected group of patients.
      However, patients have different responses to CRT, and up to 30% of those implanted show no
      response at all. Ongoing trials, whether prospective or retrospective, have been trying to
      define best predictors of response to CRT and to measure ventricular dyssynchrony. Despite
      this, no single echo criterion to date can predict successful CRT over current guidelines.

      In this study, we propose to compare LV muscle mechanical dyssynchrony assessment by speckle
      tracking to hemodynamic dyssynchrony assessment by 4D segmental ejection fraction (EF), a
      novel modality brought recently by University of Missouri Echocardiography laboratory.
