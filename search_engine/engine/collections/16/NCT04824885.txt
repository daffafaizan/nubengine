      containing acetate After inclusion, patients will be randomly divided into two groups.
      Patients in group 1 will first be treated with the acetate-free dialysate (A-D) for 6 months
      and then the acetate-containing dialysate (A + D) for 6 months. Group 2 patients will
      continue on the usual dialysate (A + D) for 6 months and then switch to A-D dialysate for the
      next 6 months. Patients will be blinded from study treatment.

      Patients will be followed for 1 year.

      A the beginning then every 3 months will be carried out:

        -  A measurement of body composition by multi-frequency bioimpedancemetry

        -  A measurement of the gripping force by a dynamometer (hand grip force )

        -  A 4-meter walk test

        -  A SARC-F Sarcopenia Assessment Questionnaire A blood test for the usual biological
           analyzes carried out as part of the recommendations for monitoring patients on
           hemodialysis will be carried out every month.

      An additional blood sample (5.5 mL) for quantification of the levels of expression of
      potential blood biomarkers of muscle condition will be taken initially, at 6 months and at 12
      months (i.e. 16.5 mL more compared to current practice). ).
