      they are officially enrolled in the study and sent a link confirming their enrollment and the
      study group in which they have been assigned. Participants are sequentially enrolled in the
      study with enrollment first into the usual care group. Once enrollment in the usual care
      group is complete, enrollment into the decision aid group will occur.

      The study includes two non-randomized groups:

      Arm 1 (Usual care group): Women in this group will undergo usual care and complete the survey
      questions on knowledge of risks and benefits of TOLAC (also referred to as VBAC) and planned
      repeat cesarean (PRCS), certainty of their decision, and involvement in the decision for
      trial of labor (TOLAC) or repeat cesarean delivery.

      Arm 2: (Decision aid group- group receiving the decision tool): Women in this group will
      receive a decision aid prior to undergoing counseling by their physician. Following
      completion of the decision aid and physician counseling, they will complete a series of
      survey questions to assess their knowledge of the risks and benefits of TOLAC and PRCS,
      certainty of their decision, and involvement in the decision for repeat cesarean or TOLAC.

      The decision aid group will be compared with women who do not receive the decision aid (usual
      care group).
