      or 1g/kg/day Omegaven速 10%. Infants randomized to Intralipid速 whose conjugated bilirubin
      level rises >100umol/L will be crossed over to receive 1g/kg/day Omegaven速. Monitoring
      includes liver function tests (AST, ALT,ALP, GGT, Conjugated Bilirubin), Fatty Acid Profile
      (RBC and serum fatty acids; triene/tetraene ratio), INR (coagulation profile) and cytokine
      measure (inflammatory markers).
