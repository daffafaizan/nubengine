      combination with VRC07-523LS on persistent HIV-1 Infection in HIV-infected individuals
      suppressed on ART.

      The investigators hypothesize that combination therapy with VRC07-523LS and VOR will be safe
      and well-tolerated by HIV-1-infected participants suppressed on ART.

      In Step 1, all participants will undergo study screening and enrollment. Participants will
      complete a baseline Leukapheresis (#1). In order to advance to Step 2, participants must be
      found to have a baseline measurement of the frequency of resting CD4 T cell infection â‰¥ 0.3
      infectious units per million (IUPM) determined by Quantitative Viral Outgrowth Assay (QVOA)
      (lower limit of detection is 0.03 IUPM), as a further decrease from this low frequency of
      infection cannot be definitively measured given the QVOA assay threshold.

      These criteria assure that eligible enrolled participants will have a measurable endpoint,
      thus decreasing risk of study participation for participants who would not have a measurable
      outcome.

      Participants progressing to Steps 2 and 3 will receive two series of a single VRC07-523LS
      infusion followed by multiple doses of VOR.

      In the first series (Step 2), participants will receive one VRC07-523LS 40 mg/kg infusion
      (infusion #1) on Day 0 followed by the 1st dose of VOR 400 mg PO taken at home on Day 2.
      Participants will take VOR 400 mg PO every 72 hours for a total of 10 doses.

      In the second series (Step 3), participants will receive one VRC07-523LS 40 mg/kg infusion
      (infusion #2) on Day 60 followed by the 1st (of the 2nd series of VOR) dose of VOR 400 mg PO
      on Day 62. As in the previous Step, participants will take VOR 400 mg PO every 72 hours for a
      total of 10 doses.

      Step 4 consists of 2 visits. The post-study treatment leukapheresis (#2) will be completed 5
      - 8 weeks after the 2nd VRC07-523LS infusion. The End of Study Visit (EOS) will be scheduled
      to 2 - 4 weeks following the final leukapheresis (#2) visit.
