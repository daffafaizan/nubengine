      lacrimal glands and is characterized by lymphocytic tissue infiltration and auto-antibody
      production. The pathogenesis of Sjogren's syndrome is unknown. We hypothesize that reduced
      somatostatin activity is an important factor in promoting immune dysregulation in patients
      affected by Sjogren's syndrome. Somatostatin is a multifunctional peptide with potent
      immunomodulatory properties whose effects are reduced lymphocytic activity, reduced
      gastrointestinal secretions, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis,
      anti-inflammatory, etc. As several findings in Sjogren's syndrome are opposite to those
      produced by somatostatin, it is logical to consider that the activity of this peptide is low
      in patients affected by this disease. The purpose of this study is to determine whether basal
      and stimulated plasma levels of somatostatin and its effects on the immune and endocrine
      systems differ between 16 patients affected by primary Sjogren's syndrome and 16 healthy
      control subjects.
