    
      College students diagnosed with ADHD will be randomized to three arms of approximately 8
      weeks duration: (1) standard care plus a tai chi class, (2) standard care plus an exercise
      class, and (3) standard care alone. The exercise class will control for the social and motor
      components of tai chi training. The investigators will determine methodological parameters
      relevant to a subsequent full scale trial including recruitment and retention rates,
      acceptance of randomization, adherence to the interventions, and variance in outcome
      measures. The primary clinical outcome measure of this pilot randomized controlled trial
      (RCT) will be pre- to post-intervention change in inattention, i.e. the Inattentive Symptoms
      subscale of the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale self-report long form (CAARS-S:L, see
      Interviews etc. "Converse_S_L"). Secondary measures to be explored will include self- and
      informant-report, neurocognitive measures, psychophysiological measures, and academic
      performance. Practice time will be assessed daily and follow-up self-report of ADHD symptoms
      will be gathered monthly for 3 months beyond the end of the intervention.
