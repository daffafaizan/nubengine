        -  Dasatinib -100 mg administered once daily per oral route for 28 consecutive days.

        -  Leuprolide acetate - 7.5 mg administered subcutaneously on day 1 every 28 days (+ 7
           days).

      The 28 days of dasatinib and leuprolide injection (plus the time required to recover from
      toxicity if encountered) is defined as a cycle. Patients will be treated for up to a maximum
      of 3 cycles of dasatinib and leuprolide acetate.

      Radical Prostatectomy should be performed no sooner than 8 hours but preferably within 24
      hours of the last administered dasatinib dose. All attempts should be made for the patient to
      have their surgery after 8 hours but within 24 hours of their last dose of dasatinib. If
      surgery delay is imperative, dasatinib therapy should continue until at least 24 hours before
      planned surgery.
