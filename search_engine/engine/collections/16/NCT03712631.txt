      A 5-year survival rate of up to98.3% for implants placed in grafted bone has been reported.

      Autologous bone grafts are considered the gold standard.However, the success rate of the
      grafting procedure may beinfluenced by various risk factors.

      A particular challenge isposed by an extensive graft of the alveolar ridge, with
      relativelyhigh complication rates of up to 20% being reported, mostcommonly dehiscence. More
      serious complications such asdehiscence or mobilization of the graft were observed in one
      third of smokers compared to a complication rate of only 7.7%for non-smokers. Complications
      such as flap necroses, dehiscenceand resorption are frequently soft-tissue complications.

      A tension-free wound closure is a key factor in the successof bone grafts. Periosteal
      incisions are a common techniquefor flap extension. However, too many relief incisions in the
      periosteum may also result in an excessively thin or stretched wound flap.

      This type of soft-tissue management may result in perforation or flap necrosis above the bone
      graft.

      In 1987 HÃ¤rle reported on a tunneling access in connectionwith a technique for preprosthetic
      jaw ridge grafting in the mandibular side-tooth region with bone replacement materials.

      In the clinical experience of the authors the use of a tunneling technique for preparation
      without a crestal incision can present an alternative with autologous bone grafts to
      conventional surgical procedures with a trapezoid flap design.
