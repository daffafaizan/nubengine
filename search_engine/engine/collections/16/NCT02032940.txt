      contrast enhanced imaging techniques to establish the diagnosic benefits of t-SLIP compared
      to contrast enhanced MR techniques. The t-SLIP Investigational Study Sequences will be used
      for vascular MRI Imaging including, but no limited to, MRA of the renal, mesenteric,
      abdominal aortic, iliac and femoral arteries. We will be targeting all adult patients
      undergoing standard body MRA examinations without anesthesia.

      The time spatial labeling inversion pulse (t-SLIP) technique is used for non contrast
      enhanced MR angiography imaging. It produces bright blood spin labeling images by using a
      single acquisition with a combination of a spatially nonselective inversion pulse and a
      spatially selective inversion pulse. The nonselective pulse inverts the magnetization of the
      entire imaging area. The spatially selective pulse, applied upstream of the arteries of
      interest, reverts those protons to full magnetization. A pre defined time delay between
      tagging and imaging allows the tagged spins to reach the imaging region and suppresses
      background tissue within the imaging region to some extent.
