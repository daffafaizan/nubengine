    
      This is a pilot study to examine the efficacy and safety of an extracorporeal circuit to
      remove carbon dioxide (CO2) from the blood in patients with an acute exacerbation of COPD
      resulting in acute or acute on chronic respiratory failure. The extracorporeal circuit
      consists of venovenous configuration through a percutaneously inserted 18 F double lumen
      catheter placed in a central vein. Centrifugal pump and heparin bonded circuit are used and
      patient is heparinized to maintain an activated clotting time (ACT) > 180. Circuit blood flow
      and gas sweep speed will be adjusted to maximize CO2 removal and minimize ventilator settings
      and patient's work of breathing. Patients will remain on the extracorporeal circuit for a
      maximum of four days as tolerated. Plasma Hemoglobin will be monitored daily.
