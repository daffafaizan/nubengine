      serious risk factor for the development of major depressive disorder, yet is under recognized
      and under treated. Researchers have determined that patients with minor depression frequently
      seek treatment from general practitioners and are often treated with prescription
      antidepressants. There is a need to evaluate the effectiveness of St. John's Wort in the
      management of minor depression. If the proposed study demonstrates the efficacy of St. John's
      Wort and/or citalopram, it will suggest treatment paradigms that can be tested and applied in
      primary care settings.

      Subjects participated in a 12-week double-blind randomized study comparing St. John's Wort,
      citalopram, and placebo. Subjects were recruited through clinical referrals and community
      advertising. Data were obtained at the baseline visit (just prior to randomization) and at
      postrandomization visits conducted at 2-week intervals for the next 12 weeks, for a modified
      intent-to-treat sample consisting of all 73 subjects with at least 1 post-randomization visit
      (evaluable sample).
