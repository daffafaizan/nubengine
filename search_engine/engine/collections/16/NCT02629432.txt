      different COPD phenotypes, such as the "emphysema-type" and the "airway-type", is important
      because therapy and prognosis will be different. Imaging might play a central role in
      diagnosing these phenotypes. So far computed tomography (CT) is regarded as the gold
      standard, but it involves ionizing radiation and lacks functional information. The medical
      problem addressed in this trial is the image-based phenotyping of COPD. The principal
      research question is whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can replace CT for the
      characterization of COPD by "structural and functional phenotyping" on a regional basis. The
      sensitivity and specificity of MRI will be compared to CT serving as the gold standard. To
      achieve this goal, MRI and CT of the lung will be performed in a multi-centre cohort of 625
      COPD-patients from the main Cosyconet cohort. Also, the reliability of the MRI results will
      be demonstrated. MRI phenotypes will be evaluated visually and using software with
      quantitative read-outs. The agreement of both will be determined. The additional information
      of MRI over CT will be assessed. A special focus will be to implement an image-based
      biomarker of pulmonary functional reserve derived from the MRI measurement of pulmonary
      perfusion, which will be correlated with results from pulmonary functions tests (e.g. the
      lung transfer factor for carbon monoxide (TLCO)) the 6-minute walking test (6-MWD), and
      extrapulmonary disease manifestations.
