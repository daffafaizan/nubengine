      will sign a confirmed consent. Patients will be randomized between 2 groups of treatment: 1.
      intermittent catheterization applied every 4 hours during labor. 2. foley catheter inserted
      adjacent to epidural anesthesia.

      In patients with a foley catheter, the catheter will be removed soon after delivery.

      either 4 hours after delivery or after the participant urinates to check the bladder volume.
