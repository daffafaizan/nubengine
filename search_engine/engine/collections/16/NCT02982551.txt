      result from food intake. In addition to stimulating glucose uptake in the periphery, insulin
      signals the central nervous system to induce satiety and inhibit feeding behavior.

      To begin to identify the specific effects of circulating insulin on brain networks, the
      current study will recruit healthy participants who will undergo two functional magnetic
      resonance imaging scans. One scan will be performed in the fasted state, and the alternate
      scan will be conducted during an isoglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp.

      This project will allow us to identify the specific effects of circulating insulin on brain
      reactivity to palatable food.
