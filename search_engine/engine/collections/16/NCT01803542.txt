      SBRT was developed in the early 90s at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, and is
      used as an accepted alternative of treatment for patients with early stage lung cancer in
      many centers in Japan and a number of centers in Germany,USA and elsewhere. It is also now
      being used for patients who have lung metastases and extra-thoracic disease (primary or
      metastatic). Many reports indicate excellent local control (80-90% or higher) and minimal
      toxicity in well selected patients treated with thoracic SBRT.

      SBRT has traditionally had the following features:

        1. High doses of radiation, usually in a few large fractions (it is "hypofractionated"
           compared with standard radiotherapy schedules)

        2. Multiple radiation beams coming from different directions in the same plane ('co-planar'
           beams) as well as from different directions and different planes relative to the
           patient's body ('non-coplanar' beams)

        3. Stereotactic beam placement, in that it is guided by a set of coordinates These
           coordinates are defined in relationship to the precise location of the tumor, determined
           from medical imaging (e.g. CT, MRI), rather than to a set of external marks (tattoos) or
           anatomical landmarks (such as bony structures)
