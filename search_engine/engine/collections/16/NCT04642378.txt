      to different physicians. Since 2016, Zhongshan Hospital has set up the Internet-based glucose
      management system (iGMS) to monitor plasma glucose of diabetes patients, and further set up
      an Artificial Intelligence Assisted Insulin Titration System (iNCDSS) to recommend insulin
      regime in 2019. Previous single-center clinical trial (NCT04053959) have indicated the
      efficacy and safety of iNCDSS in glycemic management in patients with type 2 diabetes.

      This multi-center study enrolls 106 patients with Type 2 Diabetes from four sites who are on
      treatment with insulin for at least 3 months. They will be randomly allocated into 2 groups
      at a ratio of 1:1 after screening for the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients in the
      Intervention group (iNCDSS group) receive insulin regimen set by iNCDSS and patients in
      Regular treatment regime group receive insulin regimen recommended by endocrinologists.

      This study will be conducted in the Department of Endocrinology in Shanghai Zhongshan
      Hospital, Shanghai fifth People's Hospital, Shanghai Xuhui Central Hospital and Shanghai
      Qingpu Central Hospital, and will consist of a 7-day intervention period. Patient allocation
      will be stratified by HbA1c, BMI and previous total insulin doses. The primary endpoint is
      the time in target glucose range during the 7-day trial period.
