    
      Subjects planning to initiate testosterone treatment via injection at MHB will be consented
      into the study. Upon enrollment in the study, the randomization will be completed for each
      subject.

      Blood collection will occur before each injection. Subjects will rate pain on the Likert
      scale following each injection. After treatment with the first mode of T administration (SQ
      or IM depending on randomization), subjects will come in for blood draws 3 days and 7 days
      following the injection. Two weeks after the initial injection, subjects will come in for
      treatment with the second mode of T administration (SQ or IM depending on randomization).
      Subjects will come in for blood draws 3 days and 7 days following the second injection. Two
      weeks after the second injection, subjects will complete an end of study assessment with an
      Investigator and will complete a survey assessing their satisfaction with treatment. Subjects
      will likely continue testosterone therapy at Men's Health Boston after completion of the
      study.
