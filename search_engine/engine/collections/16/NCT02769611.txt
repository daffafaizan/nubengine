      The proposed indication for ruboxistaurin in this study is the treatment of adult patients
      with New York Heart Failure Association (NYHA) Class III-IV heart failure. Ruboxistaurin is a
      protein kinase c-alpha (PKC-alpha) inhibitor and thus will produce an inotropic effect in the
      heart which holds the potential to improve cardiac function.
