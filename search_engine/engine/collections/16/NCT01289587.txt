        1. to evaluate the effects (before and after) of a physical activity program (DIAfit
           program) which contains 36 sessions of structured PA and also encourages unstructured PA
           in an unselected population of patients with type 2 diabetes independent of the selected
           variant of the program

        2. to compare the effects of a standard DIAfit program (3 times per week for 12 weeks) with
           and alternative program which suggests a more progressive PA activity intensity
           (starting with one PA session per week during 4 weeks and then twice a week over a
           period of 16 more weeks (20 weeks total). In total the program also consist of 36
           sessions)
