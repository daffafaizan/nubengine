      activation and dysfunction that leads to systemic microvascular leak and multiple-organ
      failure. Emerging evidence indicates that platelets occupy a central role in maintaining the
      balance between vascular health and the response to environmental changes and vascular
      injury. Platelets are essential for vascular development and required for normal endothelial
      integrity. Platelets also function at the interface between thrombosis and inflammation. This
      study will identify patients that have sepsis with thrombocytopenia and randomize them to
      receive a unit of platelets or an equivalent volume of saline.

      Our overall hypotheis is that normal platelet function is required to maintain vascular
      integrity and can be at least partially restored over the first 24 hours by platelet
      transfusion in septic patients with thrombocytopenia.
