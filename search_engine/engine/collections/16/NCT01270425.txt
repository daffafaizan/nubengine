      classification will be included in the study. The patients, followed-up regularly in an
      out-patient clinic, will be tested for their thyroid function tests as well as the presence
      of thyroid auto antibodies. Clinical data will be collected from their medical records.
      Ultrasonographic examination of the thyroid gland will be performed by a single examiner. The
      gland will be characterized in detail with regards to its size and echotexture and cervical
      lymph nodes will be detected. The number and size of its nodules will be described as well as
      their echoic pattern (iso, hyperechoic or hypoechoic) calcifications (micro and macro), and
      borders status. Large nodules (â‰¥ 1 cm in diameter) or with malignancy- associated
      characteristics will be aspirated according to current clinical practice. Treatment will be
      given according to the cytology diagnosis. Thyroid hormone supplementation will be
      recommended when thyrotropin level >8 mIU/L or according to clinical judgment of the
