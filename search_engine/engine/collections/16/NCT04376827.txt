      affinity and blocks binding of extracellular IL-23 to cell surface IL-23 receptor, inhibiting
      IL 23 specific intracellular signaling and subsequent activation and cytokine production. It
      is used in treatment of psoriatic arthritis, generalized pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic
      psoriasis. Lupus is a heterogeneous autoimmune disease with lesions confined to skin
      (cutaneous lupus erythematosus [CLE]) to others that involve 1 or more vital internal organs
      (systemic lupus erythematosus [SLE]). Renal involvement due to SLE is termed lupus nephritis
      (LN). There is a high unmet need for new treatment options in LN that are safe and effective,
      especially new therapies that can provide improved long-term efficacy over currently
      available therapies. This study will evaluate safety and efficacy of guselkumab added to
      standard-of-care compared to placebo added to standard-of-care. Total duration of study is up
      to 68 weeks: a less than or equal to 8 week screening period, a 48 week double-blind
      treatment period, a 12 week safety follow-up period after last dose. Hypothesis of this study
      is that guselkumab plus standard-of-care is superior to placebo plus standard-of-care in
      participants with active LN as measured by the proportion of participants inducing at least a
      50 percentage reduction of proteinuria with protocol specified steroid tapering regimen at
      Week 24. Safety assessments include Adverse event (AEs), clinical laboratory tests
      (hematology and chemistry), systolic and diastolic blood pressures over time, monitoring for
      hypersensitivity reactions, AEs temporally associated with infusion, injection-site
      reactions, suicidality assessment, and early detection of active tuberculosis (TB).
