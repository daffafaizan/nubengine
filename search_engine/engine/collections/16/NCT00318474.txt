    
      A multi-center, randomized, controlled clinical trial to test the hypothesis that treatment
      with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) will lead to significant and sustained improvement in
      proteinuria in patients with IgA Nephropathy who have been pre-treated (and continue to be
      treated) with ACEi and FOS compared to a placebo control group of patients receiving
      comparable doses of ACEi and FOS without MMF. Data for this outcome will be examined every
      six months and at the end of 2 years of study. Comparisons will be made between the two
      treatment groups for change from entry level in urine protein to creatinine (UPr/Cr) ratio,
      24-hour urine protein excretion rate and estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR).
