      strict supine position within the first few days after surgery in order to attach the graft
      to the corneal stroma. It has not yet been investigated to what extent the head position
      actually has an effect on the outcome.

      In this study, the participants head position will be continuously monitored within the first
      three days after DMEK. Participants wear a headband in which a small sensor is inserted. The
      degree of deviation from the neutral position will then be correlated with clinical outcomes.
