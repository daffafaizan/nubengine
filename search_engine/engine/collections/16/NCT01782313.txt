      I. To determine the progression-free survival (defined as complete response [CR] + partial
      response [PR] + stable disease [SD]) assessed at 16 weeks for patients treated with
      tivozanib.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall response rate (defined as CR + PR). II. Clinical benefit rate (CR + PR + SD). III.
      Overall survival (up to 2 years beyond progression). IV. Correlation of clinical outcome with
      antibodies for vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) and VEGFR2.

      V. Assess Safety and tolerability.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive tivozanib orally (PO) daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity, or until discontinuation per
      patient preference or physician recommendation.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
