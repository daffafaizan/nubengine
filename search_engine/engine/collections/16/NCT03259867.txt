      Tirapazamine Embolization (TATE) treatment can boost anti-tumor immunity and enhance the
      therapeutic efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitor. Patients with advanced liver cancers
      (primary HCC or metastatic liver cancer derived from colorectal, gastric and NSCLC) will be
      enrolled in the study. Liver lesions will be treated with up to 4 TATE treatments for optimal
      debulking, which also serve as a vaccination process toward tumor. Lesion not treated with
      TATE will be used for monitoring the response toward a PD-1 inhibitor (either Nivolumab or
      Pembrolizumab per investigator decision). If a patient subsequently develops an "escape" to
      the PD-1 inhibitor, patient can have another 2 TATE treatments of the escaped tumor lesion.
      Dosing of the PD-1 inhibitor is per standard FDA-approved dosing schedule and continues until
      progressive disease. The efficacy will be assessed by the response rate (RR) using RECIST and
      irRC for the non-TATE treated lesion, and compared with the historic RR of the PD-1 inhibitor
      in HCC (~16%) and mCRC (almost 0% for those without mismatch repair defect), advanced gastric
      cancer (15%) and metastatic NSCLC who failed to respond to an immune checkpoint inhibitor.
