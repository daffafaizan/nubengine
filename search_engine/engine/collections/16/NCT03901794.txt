      arterial pressure (MAP), stroke volume (SV), cardiac index (CI) and calculated systemic
      vascular resistance (SVR) were collected along with volume removal by hemodialysis on ESRD
      patients. All data were compared and analyzed to detect the sequential body volume status as
      well as the autonomic responses during hemodialysis.
