      starting the feasibility study. Patients were recruited from a large teaching hospital. The
      COPD app provided patients with an 8 week self-management program. The application had three
      views: timeline, information page, and contact page. The start date was each patients' date
      of discharge. The timeline was classified in 8 weeks, and each week included the lung
      exacerbation plan, daily and extra medication, information and education and questionnaires.
      The first week also included a video of a pulmonologist explaining the purpose of the app and
      additional information about the functionalities of the COPD app. The timeline consisted of
      the lung exacerbation action plan, medication overview, weekly questionnaires and monitoring,
      and consultations (video consultation after 4 weeks and face-to-face consultation after 8
      weeks).
