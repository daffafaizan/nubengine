    
      Periodical follow-up of a cohort of inflammatory cardiomyopathy patients (suspected or
      validated inflammatory cardiomyopathy) recruited at baseline by the SFB/TR19 project.
      Participants will be followed up at least every year - or more frequently based on clinical
      need. Standardized protocols will be used for the assessment of medical history and
      examinations, laboratory biomarkers, and the collection of various biomaterials for
      biobanking purposes.
