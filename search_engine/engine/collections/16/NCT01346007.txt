    
      Idiopathic nephrotic syndrome (INS) is the most frequent glomerular disease in children under
      16 years old with incidence rate 2-7/100,000 patients/year depending on ethnicity. Those
      patients are susceptible to invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) including peritonitis,
      pneumonia with or without pleural effusion and meningitis. Due to increased mortality and
      risk of relapses associated with IPD, it has been recommended that children with INS should
      be immunized with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [1]. However, concerns on vaccine safety and
      impaired immunogenicity due to INS pathogenesis and immunosuppressive treatment are a hurdle
      for universal implementation of existing guidelines.

      To thoroughly evaluate safety of 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) in children
      with INS in remission, we will investigate a possible association of vaccination with
      increased risk for recurrences of INS. We will also study immunogenicity and kinetics of
      immune response in INS patients and healthy subjects and the effect of different types of
      treatment on primary immune response and antibody persistence at 12-14 months following
      vaccination with PCV7.
