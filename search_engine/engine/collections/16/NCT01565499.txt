    
      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the percentage of patients with poor
      response [residual cancer burden III (RCB-III) rate] in contrast to good response [residual
      cancer burden 0/I RCB-0/1] measured by the Symmans criteria [20] at surgery, in patients with
      stage II-III luminal breast cancer treated with neoadjuvant nab-paclitaxel.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to determine the residual cancer burden grade III
      (RCB-III) after surgery.

      The total number of patients to be included in this study is 78 patients.

      The duration of the study, from first patient visit to last patient visit will be
      approximately 90 months (Including follow-ups)
