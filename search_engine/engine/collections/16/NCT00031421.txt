      models. Mice treated with ganciclovir experienced an increase in the incidence of tumors of
      the preputial gland (males), harderian gland (males), forestomach (males and females),
      ovaries (females), uterus (females), mammary gland (females), clitoral gland (females),
      vagina (females), and liver (females). While the preputial and clitoral glands, forestomach,
      and harderian glands of mice do not have human counterparts, ganciclovir is considered a
      potential carcinogen in humans. Animal data indicate that administration of ganciclovir
      causes inhibition of spermatogenesis and subsequent infertility, possibly due to inhibition
      of rapidly dividing cell populations including spermatogonia. In the animal models, these
      effects were reversible at lower doses and irreversible at higher doses. In both male and
      female mice, ganciclovir has been shown to cause decreased fertility. Gonadal toxicity in
      rats, mice, and dogs included testicular atrophy in males and, more variable, ovarian atrophy
      in females. There are no data in humans that demonstrate these effects following treatment
      with ganciclovir. This study seeks to formally establish the overall sexual development,
      cancer incidence, and pubertal status of those study subjects who previously received six
      weeks of ganciclovir as they now approach puberty. The original study was performed from 1986
      to 1991, and therefore subjects who were enrolled are now nine to fourteen years of age.
