      disease staging, and overall clinical conditions. Pharmacological treatments and surgeries
      are fundamental therapeutic strategies in many cases and are part of the daily routine of
      integrated cancer treatment services. The calculation of pharmacological doses often takes
      into account the patient's body surface area (BSA) or only weight, without however assessing
      their nutritional status as such. The surgical procedure, on the other hand, may expose the
      patient to an inflammatory response secondary to the operative trauma that requires immediate
      reaction of the diseased organism for an adequate recovery. In this sense, the objective of
      the present study is to evaluate the relationship between the calculated medication's doses
      and the nutritional status of patients submitted topharmacological treatment with neoadjuvant
      or adjuvant intention: patients candidates for surgery. Different instruments will be used
      for nutritional assessment, as well as a questionnaire on quality of life, a specific
      criterion for evaluation of toxicities, laboratory tests and imaging. Patients will be
      observed for 1 year and the data collected will allow the analysis of possible side effects
      and the impact on quality of life.
