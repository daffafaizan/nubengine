    
      This is a randomized (assignment of study drug by chance), double-blind (participants nor
      study staff will know the identity of study drugs), multicenter study to evaluate efficacy
      and safety of guselkumab for the treatment of participants with moderate to severe
      plaque-type psoriasis who had an inadequate response to ustekinumab. The study will consist
      of a screening period, open-label and double-blind treatment periods, and a follow-up period.
      The treatment period will have 2 phases: an open-label treatment phase during which all
      participants will receive ustekinumab at Weeks 0 and 4 and a blinded treatment phase during
      which participants with an inadequate Investigator's Global Assessment response (IGAâ‰¥2) to
      ustekinumab at Week 16 will be randomized to receive either guselkumab or ustekinumab through
      Week 44. Participants with an IGA response of 0 or 1 (cleared or minimal disease) at Week 16
      will continue to receive open-label treatment with ustekinumab every 12 weeks through Week
      40. All participants will complete a follow-up phase through Week 52 for efficacy and through
      Week 60 for safety evaluations. The total duration of the study will be approximately 64
      weeks (includes a 4-week screening period). Participants' safety will be monitored throughout
      the study.
