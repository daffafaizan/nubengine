    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the kinetics of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 as well
      as the kinetics of the immune system's cell subpopulations and cytokines associated with the
      immune system in healthy volunteers receiving the BNT162b2 vaccine against SARS-Cov-2 of the
      Pfizer/BioNTech companies or any other vaccine authorized and administered by the Ministry of
      Health. Immunoassays will be performed at serum collection points before and after
      vaccination, as set out in this study.
