      will investigate the usefulness of prolonged cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture, and profiles
      of blood and CSF inflammatory markers for the differential diagnosis of meningitis. CSF
      culture will be extended upto 2 weeks. Serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein, CSF
      adenosine deaminase levels will be monitored and analyzed for the differential diagnosis of
      meningitis.
