      intubation and acute hypoxia remain among the major contributing factors of anaesthesia
      related deaths. Difficult intubation prevalence in literature is very inconsistent and varies
      between 1.5-20% of cases in general population, to even 50% in obese Thai population.

      There is a number of anthropometric scales and tests used for predicting difficult
      intubation. However, none of them appears to be sensitive and specific enough to effectively
      predict difficult intubation.

      Recently, simple and non-invasive test predicting difficult intubation was
      introduced-thyromental height test (TMHT). It shows promise as a more effective substitution
      for frequently cited anthropometric measures. It is based on the height between the anterior
      border of the thyroid cartilage and the anterior border of the mentum, measured while the
      patient lies in the supine position with closed mouth The main objective of the trial is to
      assess the clinical usefulness of TMHT in prediction of difficult intubation using
      videolaryngoscopy and double lumen endotracheal tubes in patients scheduled for elective
      thoracic surgical procedures. The secondary aim is to evaluate usefulness of other commonly
      used predictive tests associated with difficult intubation.

      During routine, preoperative anaesthetic visit thyromental height, thyromental distance,
      sternomental distance and Mallampati scale score are assessed. Then, during videolaryngoscopy
      and intubation, score in Cormack-Lehane scale and occurrence of difficult intubation are
      noted.
