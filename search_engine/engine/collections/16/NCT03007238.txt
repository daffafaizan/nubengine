      I. To evaluate the anti-cGVHD activity of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP) when combined
      with low dose IL-2 (interleukin 2) (aldesleukin), in patients with steroid refractory cGVHD,
      as assessed by overall cGVHD response rate (complete response [CR]+partial response
      [PR]+stable disease [SD]).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Characterize and evaluate toxicities, including type, frequency, severity, attribution,
      time course and duration.

      II. Estimate overall and failure-free survival, non-relapse mortality (NRM) and relapse,
      through 1 year after initiation of treatment.

      III. Characterize chronic GVHD Symptom Scale scores -self-report (with assistance from
      register nurses [RNs] and medical doctors [MDs]).

      IV. Assess the immunologic effects of low-dose daily subcutaneous (SC) IL-2 + ECP.

      V. Correlate clinical endpoints of response with ECP performance parameters.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) daily for 12 weeks. Patients also undergo
      ECP twice weekly on weeks 1-4 and then receive 2 ECP treatments every 2 weeks on weeks 5-12.
      Patients responding to upfront therapy with aldesleukin and ECP have the option to continue
      combination therapy per the discretion of the treating physician until clinical benefit is
      maintained or toxicities develop.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
