      sedentary) and non-shared experiences of siblings discordant for weight (one sibling is lean
      the other is overweight). To accomplish this, siblings attend four laboratory sessions where
      they consume one of two types of kool-aid, smell the pizza, or rest quietly. Siblings then
      eat a dinner meal. Siblings also wear an activity monitor for one week and record their
      physical activity and sedentary activities in a habit book.
