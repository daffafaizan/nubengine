    
      The METS™ Proximal Humeral system is an endoprosthetic replacement designed to restore the
      length and the function of an arm after the resection of a significant amount of bone tissue;
      due to a malignant tumour in the proximal humerus. This Post Market Clinical Follow up (PMCF)
      study is designed to further support the existing evidence that the system is safe and
      performs as expected, when analysing retrospective patient data that have had a METS™
      Proximal Humeral replacement. The target population is male or female subjects aged between
      18 years and over who have been implanted with a METS™ Proximal Humeral system at the Royal
      National Orthopaedic Hospital, Stanmore; and the patient has been followed up for at least 12
      months following implantation.
