      serious consequences for the surgical patient. A majority of surgical patients continue to
      lose weight after discharge. Nutritional risk screening has not been fully implemented at
      Landssjúkrahúsið - the National Hospital of the Faroe Islands and therefore the prevalence of
      patients at nutritional risk is unknown. The aim of this study is to examine whether an
      intervention with independent nutritional supplements or an intervention combining
      nutritional supplements and resistance training is more effective in preventing loss of
      muscle mass than standard care in surgical patients following discharge. Secondary outcomes
      are changes in body weight, quality of life, muscle strength and activities of daily living.
      Furthermore, we want to screen hospitalized surgical patients for nutritional risk in order
      to get an estimate of the prevalence of nutritional risk.
