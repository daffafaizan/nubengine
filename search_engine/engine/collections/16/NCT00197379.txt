      Thereforem we try to find new effective and safe topical therapy for this disease.
      Roxithromycin has not only antibacterial action but also immunomodulatory and
      anti-inflamatory potency. For example, roxitromycin inhibits T cell responces to mitogens and
      production of cytokines, IL-2 and IL-5. We firstly found that roxitromycin increased human
      and murine hair elongation in vitro to inhibit apoptosis of hair bulb. Then, we wish to apply
      roxithromycin on the therapy for androgenetic alopecia.
