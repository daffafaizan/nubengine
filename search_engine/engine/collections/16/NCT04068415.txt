      of contributing factors. Indeed, one of the most common causes of constipation is the
      existence of irregular habits in stool schedules, including the fact of delaying the time to
      go to the toilet, which causes the subject for a prolonged period of time to inhibit
      symptoms. defecation reflexes.

      These disorders are often increased by the lack of exercise and prolonged bed rest, which
      cause a lack of muscle of the abdominal strap, the abdominals not being able to play their
      role of compression.

      Some drugs are also a major cause of the difficulty of intestinal elimination, including
      opiates, anticholinergics, anti-depressants, etc.

      Finally, an unbalanced diet, a water deficiency are aggravating factors, as is anxiety. In
      the medical and para-medical literature, there is no complete and validated tool for
      assessing the risk of constipation at the admission of a hospital stay. This project is to
      develop a constipation risk assessment scale, which can be used autonomously by nurses, based
      on the risk factors identified in the literature, scales published in English, and 2007
      recommendations from the French National Society of Gastroenterology, recommendations of the
      High Authority of Health and a consensus of experts. The use of such a tool would make it
      possible to identify at an early stage high-risk individuals and to implement the appropriate
      means of prevention.
