    
      This is a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study to investigate the HIV antiviral
      response in CSF when vicriviroc is added for 2 weeks to the subject's failing antiretroviral
      background regimen. The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is the mean change in log10
      CSF HIV RNA from baseline at Week 2. The secondary efficacy endpoint is the proportion of
      subjects achieving CSF HIV RNA <50 copies/mL at Week 2. At Week 2, the subject's background
      regimen will be optimized and vicriviroc continued up to Week 24. After completing Week 24 of
      the study, subjects will be offered the option to continue on open-label VCV 30 mg once
      daily, if appropriate, until commercially available or until the sponsor terminates the
      clinical development of VCV. Subjects who discontinue vicriviroc for any reason will be
      requested to participate in long-term follow up.
