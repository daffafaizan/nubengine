      complex in patients with operatively treated tibial plafond fractures will result in:

        1. increased ankle dorsiflexion when compared to controls

        2. increased ankle functionality as measured by the FAAM, and quality of life as measured
           by the SF-36, when compared to controls

        3. a higher proportion of patients achieving at least 10 degrees of dorsiflexion when
           compared to controls
