      approval of the local Ethics Committee and informed consent from the patients.

      Diaphragm ultrasonography was performed before general anesthesia, after general anesthesia
      in the recovery room, and at the postoperative 24th hour in normal breathing, deep
      inspiration, and sniffing position. For USG evaluation, while the patients sit in the supine
      position at an angle of 45‚Å∞, the 2.5-7.5 Mhz convex probe is placed perpendicular to the
      intercostal spaces through the liver window on the anterior axillary line; The posterior part
      of the right hemidiaphragm was evaluated by directing it medially, cephalad and dorsally.
      Diaphragm movements in M-mode were evaluated after detection of the diaphragm in the B-mode.
      The inspiratory amplitude of the diaphragm (DIA: distance traveled by the diaphragm between
      the beginning and end of inspiration, cm) in M-mode, inspiratory velocity (IV=
      DIA/inspiratory time, cm/sec), and expiratory velocity (EV= DIA/expiratory time, cm/sec)
      measurements were made. VAS scores of the patients were questioned while performing USG.

      Pulmonary function tests (PFT) of patients before surgery and the postoperative first day and
      FVC, FEV1, PEF, FEF25-75, and FEV1/FVC measurements have been recorded.
