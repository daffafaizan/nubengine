      guide to measuring the amount of fluid by looking into the stroke volume to determine if
      there is too little or too much fluid. It has been shown that inadequate fluid administration
      is a cause of increased morbidity and length of stay after elective bowel resection. However,
      there are no data evaluating the Doppler's use in the postoperative period, only
      intraoperatively. Our objective is to evaluate whether postoperative goal-directed fluid
      management with the Deltex CardioQ esophageal Doppler probe leads to shorter hospital stay in
      elective bowel resection patients. All consecutive patients randomized into the 'standard
      fluid' group and the 'goal-directed fluid' group. All will follow standard surgical
      postoperative care with the exception of fluid administration. If eligible, all patients will
      receive an epidural catheter for pain control. The 'goal-directed fluid' group will have a
      Deltex CardioQ probe placed nasally in the operating room by the anesthesia team, and fluid
      management will be administered via anesthesia protocol. The 'standard fluid' group will not
      receive the Deltex CardioQ probe.Patients in the 'goal-directed fluid' group will receive
      fluids according to body weight for the first 24 hours. The probe will be evaluated every15
      minutes in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit and measurements will be taken to determine whether
      fluids will be given to the patient.On the surgical floor, patients in the 'goal-directed
      fluid' group will be evaluated every 8 hours and fluids will be given if necessary according
      to measurements taken via the probe.
