      environmental factors such as atmospheric pressure.

      A case-crossover epidemiological study will be conducted in 14 French hospitals. SP recorded
      from 2009 to 2013 will be exhaustively included. Demographic and clinical characteristics
      will be collected. For each incident case of SP, the period of occurrence of the event (case
      period) will be compared to several other periods temporally distant from the case period
      (control periods prior to and after the event). Exposure will be assessed using
      meteorological stations localized in the vicinity of each patient's home. A potential
      threshold effect and/or time lag effect between exposure and admission for SP will be
      explored.

      The results of this study will help to identify the meteorological factors associated with
      the occurrence of SP, and to deepen our knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms of SP
      especially the influence of meteorological factors on bleb rupture.
