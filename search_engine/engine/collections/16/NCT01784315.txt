      P.falciparum which used to be the most common infections. May be this is mainly due to
      intensive measures taken place in controlling the diseases especially vector control
      measures. So that way P.falciparum has gone now. But on other hand P.vivax has peaked the
      infection. The main reason could be due to resistant to Chloroquine or may be Chloroquine
      dose is inadequate, and it could also mean it could be due to relapses from the hypnozoites
      stage where Primaquine dose could be inadequate. Therefore this study is developed to study
      the efficacy of Chloroquine alone withholding Primaquine for day 28 slightly deviating from
      the current treatment protocol of Bhutan. That parasitic clearance and recurrence rates will
      be recorded while on Chloroquine and Primaquine separately. For those patients whose blood
      stage of parasites doesnt get cleared with standard dose of Chloroquine or for any
      recurrences occurring before day 28, will be treated with second line treatment with ACT, and
      the blood level of Chloroquine(drug concentration) will be determined to say whether that
      could be due to resistance or due to low level of Chloroquine in the blood. And for any
      recurrences occurring after day 28 while of Primaquine or after completion of Primaquine
      dosage for a total of 14 days (from day 29 to day 42) those patients will be treated in a
      similar fashion as initial treatment with Chloroquine and Primaquine and the recurrence rates
      will be recorded so as to develop next level of study where two different doses of Primaquine
      (high dose vs low dose) will be compared to study the efficacy of Primaquine.
