      enucleation or laser vaporisation, is the first line surgical treatment for bladder outlet
      obstruction secondary to benign prostatic hyperplasia. Even if bipolar and laser surgery have
      improved surgical outcomes in terms of length of hospital stay and post-operative
      complications, these procedures remain associated with a significant amount of infectious and
      bleeding complications, as well as with some persistent side effects such as sexual
      dysfunction and urinary incontinence.

      Prostatic urethral lift (Urolift) has been developed as a minimally invasive alternative to
      TURP with no need of general anaesthesia, less need of urinary catheter and less exposure to
      post-operative complication. Its efficacy and safety have been assessed by 2 clinical
      randomized trials with evidence of urinary symptom improvement remaining inferior to TURP but
      durable for 5 years. Urolift preserved overall quality of life better than TURP. Urolift has
      been recommended by the European Association of Urology guidelines and recognized by French
      authorities but cannot be financed by the hospital itself. Reimbursement of the implants by
      healthcare system is therefore needed for the distribution of Urolift in France.

      The additional cost of the implants could be compensated by a reduced length of hospital stay
      and a lower rate of post-operative complications inducing healthcare expenditures. This study
      aims to assess if Urolift could be a cost-effective therapeutic strategy compared to
      transurethral surgery with 2 phases design: a field study comparing patients treated with
      Urolift to those treated with TURP/laser during 1 year follow-up, and an additional study
      comparing healthcare consumptions during 3 years follow-up between each group using data of
      the French National Claims Database (SNDS database).
