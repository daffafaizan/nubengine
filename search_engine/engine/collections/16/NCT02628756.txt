      office hysteroscopy (Karl Storz, Germany). By means of vaginoscopy, a 2.9 mm. continuous-flow
      diagnostic hysteroscope with a 5 Fr. working-channel is guided through the cervical canal
      with normal saline as distension medium, with flow manually regulated through the key of the
      hysteroscopic sheath.

      The examination of the uterine cavity begins by observing its regularity, paying special
      attention to the presence of intrauterine malformations or morphologic alterations such as
      submucous myomas, or uterine septa. Subsequently, A claw forceps will be introduced through a
      2.2 mm working channel, and will be used to generate a local injury on the upper posterior
      endometrium (Endometrial Snip) at midline 10-15 mm from the fundus on D4 to D7 of the ongoing
      menstrual cycle. The depth and width of the injured site will be about 2x2 mm (i.e a single
      bite of the claw forceps). No premedications, antibiotics or hemostatics will be given after
      the procedure.

      Natural cycle folliculometry + timed sexual intercourse will be offered for all participants
      for the ongoing and the immediate subsequent cycles. Once the leading ovarian follicle will
      reach a size of at least 16 mm, 10,000 IU of hCG will be administered to trigger ovulation.
