      arouses the attention of orthopedic surgeons in order to return home early through the fast
      recovery protocols but this goal is also wanted in public health for the sake of overall
      decline health spending in public costs.

      Reducing the LOS after primary hip arthroplasty and knee is studied through many publications
      that found an LOS influenced by the own medical factors of patients (ref) However, no study
      to our knowledge research the influence of the operative day and the LOS.

      For historical reasons, the organization of care is modified on the weekend (Saturday and
      Sunday) in particular by reducing the caregiver and also the lack of physical therapist to
      make the early postoperative get up (D0 or D1).

      The hypothesis is that a patient operated the friday did not have the same care the first 48
      hours that a patient who had surgery at the beggening of the week and that his recovery was
      therefore extended.

      The investigator can also suppose that LOS was shorter for patients returning home for those
      who were transferred to a rehabilitation center or other structure.

      The results will be adjusted according to the literature data on the age more than 80 years,
      sex, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, respiratory diseases.
