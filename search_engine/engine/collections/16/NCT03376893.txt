      hypothesis that the incidence of infarct recurrence (stroke or silent stroke) or new strokes
      in adults with silent strokes treated with hydroxyurea will be greater than in those without
      strokes treated with hydroxyurea. We will test two secondary hypotheses: 1) adults with SCD
      and silent strokes have cognitive morbidity when compared to adults with SCD without silent
      strokes, and 2) adults with SCD and strokes receiving regular blood transfusion will have a
      higher incidence of infarct recurrence than those with SCD without strokes. The aims include
      Aim 1: Compare the incidence of new overt and silent strokes in adults with SCD and silent
      strokes to a comparison group of adults without silent strokes or overt strokes. Aim 2:
      Compare the cognitive morbidity of those with silent strokes and overt strokes to those
      without strokes. Aim 3: Compare the incidence of new overt and silent stroke in adults with
      SCD and overt strokes receiving transfusion to adults with SCD without silent or overt
      strokes treated with hydroxyurea. All clinical information and neuroimaging will be centrally
      adjudicated with masked and experienced neurology and neuroradiology committees. Data
      generated after completion of this proposal are critical for developing the first-ever phase
      III trials for secondary stroke prevention therapies in adults with SCD.
