      is considered to be resectable without evidence of distant metastases. A higher percentage of
      radical resection is reported in studies using neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery
      versus surgery alone. The neoadjuvant chemotherapy may improve overall survival. Neoadjuvant
      chemotherapy with administrations of paclitaxel combined with cisplatin or carboplatin has
      shown effectively. Nimotuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against epidermal growth
      factor receptor (EGFR). The clinical phase I study of the combination of Nimotuzumab
      administered concurrently with chemo-irradiation in patients with local advanced esophageal
      squamous cell carcinoma has shown the safety and the potential efficacy of Nimotuzumab. The
      concurrent trial is a clinical phase II trial designed to assess the efficacy of the
      combination of Nimotuzumab administered concurrently with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in
      patients with resectable Esophageal Squamous Cell Carcinoma, and to further investigate its
      side-effect and toxicity.
