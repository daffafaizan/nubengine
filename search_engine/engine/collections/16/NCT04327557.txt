    
      Baseline (Pre-Class) Visit : Once study eligibility has been confirmed, the participant will
      come to the lab for an in-person visit. If they choose to continue in the study after reading
      and signing the consent form, they will complete a series of questionnaires and collect
      saliva samples at home.

      Childbirth Education Intervention: The participant will be randomly assigned to one of two
      childbirth and parenting education groups (either the MBCP course offered at UW Health or a
      TAU course). Participants in the TAU group will be provided options of courses to select.
      Courses may last up to 9 weeks long. The course is provided as part of the study.
      Participants are asked to complete the course before the 37th week of pregnancy.

      Post-Intervention (Post-Class) Visit: After completing the childbirth and parenting education
      course, the participant will complete a series of questionnaires and collect another set of
      saliva samples. This can happen in person or remotely.

      1-Month Follow-Up Visit: One month after birth, the participant and their child will come to
      the lab for an MRI scan of the child's brain while he or she sleeps as well as complete
      another series of questionnaires.

      3-Month Follow-Up Visit: Three months after birth, the participant will complete a series of
      questionnaires.

      12-Month Follow-Up Visit: Twelve months after birth, the participant and their child will
      come to the lab for one final visit to do a behavioral assessment as well as complete a final
      series of questionnaires.
