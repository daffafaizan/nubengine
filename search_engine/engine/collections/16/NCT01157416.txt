      improvement, they still have some enduring symptoms and functional impairment. Accordingly,
      there is a need for treatment advances.

      D-cycloserine (DCS), an antibiotic that has been used for over 50 years, has also been found
      to have positive effects on cognition and anxiety. DCS was found to enhance learning and
      memory, and also facilitates extinction of fear reactions. However, DCS only produces an
      extinction effect when paired with behavioral training, not when simply given alone. Thus,
      the medication only needs to be given for seven doses in this research and youth do not need
      to take the medication long term. The research also includes a three-month follow-up
      assessment.
