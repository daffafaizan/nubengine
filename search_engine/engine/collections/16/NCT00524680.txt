    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To examine the pattern of response of serum 25(OH) D3 levels following cholecalciferol
           (vitamin D3) supplementation at four different oral doses in patients with prostate
           cancer.

      Secondary

        -  To examine the pattern of response of parathormone (PTH) following vitamin D3
           supplementation in these patients.

        -  To assess the toxicity of vitamin D3 supplementation in men with prostate cancer.

      Tertiary

        -  To track occurrence of infections, deep vein thrombosis, vascular events, and falls in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive 4,000 IU of oral cholecalciferol (vitamin D3) once daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive 6,000 IU of vitamin D3 once daily.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive 8,000 IU of vitamin D3 once daily.

        -  Arm IV: Patients receive 10,000 IU of vitamin D3 once daily. Treatment in all arms
           continues for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
