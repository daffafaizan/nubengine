      patients.

      Older age is often associated with an increase risk of longer stay in the emergency room with
      a high subsequent risk of hospital re-admission. One of the essential care objectives when
      treating these patients is to maintain the autonomy to avoid any dependence in order to keep
      the quality of life, and limit the time of hospitalization.

      Emergency room visits and hospitalizations are too often considered as a source of autonomy
      loss aggravation in the elderly. Many studies have demonstrated the mortality predictive
      factors existence, functional decline, or re-hospitalization of the elderly after an
      emergency room visit or after hospitalization.

      No study until now has investigated the existence of factors directly predictive of
      robustness. Then the goal of this study is to demonstrate that there are robustness
      predictive factors after going to the emergency room.
