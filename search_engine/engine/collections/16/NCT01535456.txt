        1. To evaluate if FLT-PET uptake shows variation during the treatment course in subjects
           with MDS being treated with 5-azacitidine therapy

           Secondary objectives

        2. To assess FLT-PET uptake heterogeneity within given subjects being treated with
           5-azacitidine therapy

        3. To generate preliminary data regarding correlation between FLT-PET imaging parameters
           and clinical responses based on bone marrow aspirate/biopsy
