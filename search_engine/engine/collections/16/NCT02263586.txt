      for the appearance of hyponatremia during competitions. The loss of sodium through sweating
      and the excessive fluid intake during the competitions is a primary risk factor for the
      development of hyponatremia.

      Based on the known occurrence of hyponatremia in marathon runners, participants of the
      Ironman European Championship between the years 2005 and 2014 were screened for the
      occurrence of hyponatremia after finishing the race for safety reasons. Subjects were
      approached at random in the athlete's garden and invited to participate. All participants
      were 18 years or older.
