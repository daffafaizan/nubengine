      osteoarthritis is increasing in the elderly population and due to obesity. Balance disorder
      generally disturbed equilibrium and increase risk of fall. There is lack of proprioceptive
      sensation in patients with knee osteoarthritis. The aim of this study to compare improvement
      in balance between BRACE and proprioceptive training in knee osteoarthritis and to compare
      mobility level between proprioceptive and BRACE in knee osteoarthritis. Randomized control
      trial study of 8 week follows up. Sample size will be 22. The patients will be divided into 2
      groups BRACE and proprioceptive training. The patients will get training section for 3 days
      per week for 8 weeks. The measurement will be taken at base line, after 8 weeks. Study
      duration will be 6 months. Individuals of age 50-70 year, Mini-mental state examination
      (MMSE) 20 or higher, Berg Balance Scale (BBS) 30-45 points, Experience of at least one fall
      during the previous 12 months, both Males and Females will be include. Patients will be
      excluded if they exhibited history of cardiovascular or musculoskeletal diseases, previously
      used medication for the central nervous system, occurrence of lower limbs lesions or
      fractures in last six months. Assessment tools will be MMSE, Berg balance scale, TUG, CTSIB,
      6 minute walk test. Data will be analyzed through SPSS 20. Data will be check for its
      normality, within groups comparison paired sample T-test, between groups independent sample
      T-test will be used
