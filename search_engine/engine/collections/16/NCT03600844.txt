      during the course of the TIPTOP project: 1) Proportion of women who have had a pregnancy that
      ended in the past 12 months and have received 1 or more, 2 or more and 3 or more doses of
      IPTp-SP; proportion of women with pregnancy in the past 12 months who attended ANC clinics at
      least once, and who attended at least four times; proportion of pregnant women attending the
      first ANC visit before or at week 14; proportion of women who have had a pregnancy that ended
      in the past 12 months who know about the IPTp service provided by CHWs; and acceptability of
      C-IPTp for community delivery of IPTp (note: results will be disaggregated by provider type,
      age, gravidity and distance from facility). To assess these changes, the study will implement
      structured household surveys targeting potential beneficiaries of the project (pregnant
      women) in the intervention and comparison areas, implemented at three time points: baseline,
      mid- and end-points. In each country an initial implementation area (Phase I) and two
      expansion areas (Phase II) have been selected for the project. This study will establish if
      community deliver of IPTp is effective and feasible and whether it influences antenatal care
      service coverage rates. It is expected that the study will provide information to scale up
      the approach the 4 study countries for the prevention of malaria in pregnancy. This
      information is also meant to inform global guidelines on community IPTp delivery and may also
      be used by other countries.
