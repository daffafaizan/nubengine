      The blood lymphocytes will be given to the subjects through a catheter. If the subjects have
      no complications of the first course of infusions, we may decide to give them "lymphocytes"
      aa second time while subjects are in remission in an attempt to prevent their disease from
      relapsing. A bone marrow test will be taken prior to infusion of lymphocytes as part of the
      clinical evaluation to receive this treatment. After lymphocyte infusions, a bone marrow will
      be examined about every three months for the first year to monitor progress from this
      therapy.
