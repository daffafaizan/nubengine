    
      This study is a multicenter Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      multiple-dose, dose-escalation safety and tolerability study of NPT088 or placebo in patients
      with Probable AD with a MMSE score of 16-27. Enrolled patients will receive an intravenous
      infusion of NPT088 or placebo once a month for six months during this study. Four dose
      cohorts are planned with the first two cohorts enrolling 9 patients each (6 NPT088: 3
      placebo) and the final two cohorts enrolling 24 patients each (16 NPT088: 8 placebo) for a
      total of 66 patients (44 NPT088: 22 placebo).
