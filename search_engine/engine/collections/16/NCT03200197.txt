      in the preoperative period as it stimulates the salivary glands by means of mechano and
      chemoreceptors, increasing the salivary pH and flow, lubricating the oral cavity, acting in
      this way on peripheral thirst, which is triggered by dehydration of the oral mucosa.
      Furthermore, menthol gum stimulates the cold receptors, known as TRPM8, which are responsible
      for deactivating centers of thirst. Thus, the risk of bronchoaspiration due to gastric
      fullness is avoided and the discomfort of a dry mouth is reduced.Preliminary evidence
      indicates that the chewing gum strategy assists in the relief of a dry mouth and thirst in
      patients undergoing dialysis and head and neck radiotherapy. However, there is no scientific
      evidence of controlled studies with results that can be generalized regarding the use of
      chewing gum to reduce thirst and its discomforts in surgical patients in the preoperative
      period when they remain in a fasted state.
