      years with the use of new chemotherapeutic drugs and regimens at the cost of significant
      adverse events such as cardiac toxicity. Asymptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction
      limits the specific treatment of the patients and their long-term survival, since a
      significant proportion of them will relapse within 5 years after front-line therapy and will
      require further salvage treatment, including hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation in most
      instances.

      Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have showed to have preventive effects
      against chemotherapy-induced cardiotoxicity in animal models, and in patients with early
      cardiotoxicity. Carvedilol prevent free radical release, mitochondrial dysfunction,
      apoptosis, and dilated cardiomyopathy in animals treated with anthracyclines, and have shown
      promising results in preventing chemotherapy-induced left ventricular dysfunction in
      patients.

      As demonstrated in post-infarction patients, the combined treatment with an ACEI and
      carvedilol could have additive effects to prevent LV dysfunction in patients with
      hematological malignancies at high risk of cardiac toxicity. Therefore, we designed the
      OVERCOME (preventiOn of left Ventricular dysfunction with Enalapril and caRvedilol in
      patients submitted to intensive ChemOtherapy for the treatment of Malignant hEmopathies)
      study, a prospective, randomized trial to evaluate the combined effect of enalapril and
      carvedilol on the prevention of left ventricular dysfunction in patients with malignant
      hemopathies undergoing intensive chemotherapy.
