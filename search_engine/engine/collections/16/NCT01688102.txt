    
      Potential subjects will be screened for eligibility, including serum 25(OH)D levels <20ng/ml.
      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to receive either: 1) oral vitamin D3, 50,000
      units weekly for 8 weeks or 2) narrow-band UVB radiation, 2 treatments/wk for 8 weeks.
      Duration of treatment will be based on skin type. After 8 weeks, 25(OH)D levels will be
      measured monthly. For participants with levels <35 ng/ml, additional doses of oral vitamin D3
      or UV radiation will be administered.

      A subset of participants from both groups will participate in a skin biopsy cohort, where
      skin biopsies are obtained before and after 8 weeks of treatment.
