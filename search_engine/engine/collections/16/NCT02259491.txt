      head and neck reconstruction. The radial forearm skin flap and fibula osteocutaneous flap are
      commonly used in head and neck reconstruction. After harvest, closure of these donor sites
      often requires split thickness skin grafting. The grafting is usually done from the thigh.
      The grafted free flap donor site along with the STSG donor site is often the source of
      significant post-operative pain and complications including delayed wound healing, graft loss
      and infection. There is no consensus in the literature on the best care for these donor sites
      with surgeons employing a wide variety of surgical dressings for local wound care. There is
      literature dating back centuries on the use of medicinal honey for wound care, with recent
      data suggesting its use in patients suffering from burns or pressure ulcers. However, there
      is a lack of prospective, randomized controlled data on the use of honey as a medicinal agent
      in local wound care.
