      fracture associated with pain especially for those patients with osteoporosis. However, after
      vertebroplasty, the compliance of the bone becomes stronger than the adjacent vertebrae that
      is not treated. So there is always a consideration of future fracture of the adjacent
      vertebral bodies after vertebroplasty done on certain body. In this study, we try to follow
      the patients (5 years) to see if the adjacent vertebral bodies are prone to have fracture
      than the others away from the site of vertebroplasty.Then we try to find out the image
      biomarkers to predict the future fracture in the vertebral bodies. The should be done with CT
      scan raw data, analysis with different algorithms.

      Inclusion criteria; patients with osteoporosis and receiving vertebroplasty and with
      secondary fracture occurring in other spine exclusion criteria: No second vertebral body
      fracture occurred. Primary measurement: the time and location of the 2nd fracture secondary
      measurement: the imaging biomarkers from CT scan.
