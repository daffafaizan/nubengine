      studies and second-generation sequencing technologies, researchers have found hundreds of
      genes and SNPs associated with bone mineral density and osteoporosis fractures. However,
      current studies on osteoporosis and related phenotypes are mainly concentrated in the
      European and American populations, rare in Asia and other regions, and even less in the
      Chinese han population. It is one of the problems to be solved in this project whether the
      genes and SNP loci associated with these strengths can also be applied to han Chinese
      population due to the existence of racial differences. This project aims to collect the
      patients with primary osteoporosis and osteoporosis fracture in the Chinese han population
      through the orthopaedics department, and verify the identified osteoporosis susceptibility
      genes in the Chinese han population.
