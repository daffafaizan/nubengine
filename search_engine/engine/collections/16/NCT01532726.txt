      best interest to be prescribed with adjunctive ESL has to be made before and independently of
      his/her decision to include the patient in the study. At all circumstances during the study
      the patients will be treated and followed according to routine clinical practice. ESL and
      concomitant medication should be managed by the neurologist according to the respective
      Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC).In order to reflect real-life practice and to ensure
      the observational nature of this study, no fixed time-points for study assessment were
      defined. Intermediate follow-up data will be collected whenever a patient attends to the
      study's neurologist consultation.
