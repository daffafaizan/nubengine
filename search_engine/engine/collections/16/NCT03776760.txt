    
      SCALE-C is an interventional cohort study recruiting people with or at risk of HCV infection
      from Aboriginal health services in Australia. Participants will be screened for HCV infection
      using point-of-care testing (anti-HCV antibody and/or HCV RNA). People with current HCV
      infection (HCV RNA positive) will be offered treatment with eight or 12 weeks of
      pan-genotypic DAA therapy, glecaprevir/pibrentasvir or sofosbuvir/velpatasvir, as available
      on the PBS.
