      parallel-groups design to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of Kovacaine Mist delivered
      intranasally for inducing pulpal anesthesia of maxillary permanent teeth numbers 4 to 13
      (maxillary right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar) or maxillary primary
      teeth numbers A to J (maxillary right second primary molar to maxillary left second primary
      molar) sufficient to allow completion of the Study Dental Procedure. The maxillary teeth will
      be categorized in two subsets, anterior teeth (permanent teeth numbers 6 to 11 and primary
      teeth numbers C to H) and posterior teeth (permanent teeth numbers 4, 5, 12, 13 and primary
      teeth numbers A, B, I, J).

      The intent is to treat 90 male and female subjects aged 3 to 17 years, inclusive, at 3 study
      sites, 2:1 randomization within each study site, and an overall goal of 60 subjects treated
      with Kovacaine Mist and 30 treated with placebo. Subjects will receive Kovacaine Mist or
      placebo (2:1) according to the kit randomization plan within three dosing strata (100 µL, 200
      µL or 400 µL) based on subject weight at entry: subjects weighing 10 to <20 kg, 20 to <40 kg
      and ≥ 40 kg will be assigned to the 100 µL, 200 µL or 400 µL dose group, respectively.
      Recruitment will be from diverse pediatric dental patient populations. To ensure adequate
      representation in the 3 dose/weight groups, each stratum will contain at least 25% of
      subjects.
