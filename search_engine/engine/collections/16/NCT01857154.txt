      without the adverse effects often reported with limestone-based forms of calcium, a patented
      technology was developed to increase calcium absorbability using both Zet Mill/Ball Mill
      bottom-up pulverizing technology and 4D top-down ebonite charging technology to create a
      novel form of calcium referred to as micronized calcium carbonate (MCC). In comparison to
      other technologies that use water and high heat, which results in a loss of core nutrients
      and decreased product efficacy, the calcium produced by this unique pulverizing technology is
      micron-sized (0.03um - 10um) and therefore believed to be more effective. While its tiny size
      was thought to increase its absorption, the belief was that the intense activation of zinc
      via the patented ebonite charging process that could maximize the bioavailability of this
      calcium.
