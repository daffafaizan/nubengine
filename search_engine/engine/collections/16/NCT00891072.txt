      I. The primary end point will be to determine the maximum tolerated dose of AT-101 with
      paclitaxel and carboplatin.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the toxicities associated with the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin, and
      AT-101.

      II. To evaluate the human pharmacokinetic disposition of AT-101 in the context of escalating
      doses.

      III. To describe the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel when given concurrently with AT-101.

      IV. To evaluate for evidence of activity for the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin and
      AT-101.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid.

      Patients receive oral R-(-)-gossypol acetic acid twice daily on days 1-3. Patients also
      receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies by
      liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed for 4 weeks.
