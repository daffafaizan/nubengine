      devastating spinal cord injury (SCI), rendering them with a permanent neurologic deficit,
      paraplegia, or paraparesis. Despite huge success over the last several decades with the
      introduction of innovative protective maneuvers, such as the use of cerebrospinal fluid
      drains (CSFDs), the rate of these complications remains around 5%. Spinal cord perfusion can
      be compromised during aortic surgery and the intrathecal decompression achieved by CSFDs
      functions to increase the pressure gradient of blood flow, thereby optimizing spinal cord
      perfusion during aortic surgery. There are two methods commonly used to place cerebrospinal
      fluid drains: blind placement and with fluoroscopic guidance. Prior to 2016, CSFDs at UNC
      hospital were primarily placed without image guidance. However, hospital policy then
      transitioned to having all CSFDs placed using fluoroscopic guidance. To the investigators'
      knowledge, there are no reported studies directly comparing clinical outcomes of CSFDs placed
      by these methods. Given the increased cost and radiation exposure associated with the use of
      fluoroscopy, a better understanding of comparative outcomes has great potential clinical
      value. Therefore, the investigators propose to compare the rate and severity of complications
      associated with CSFD placement either with or without fluoroscopic guidance.
