      the transplant kidney with ultrasound after contrast injection (Sonazoid) to determine if
      contrast in the kidney is detectable by ultrasound and to determine if the amount of
      perfusion can be quantified directly or qualitatively. The investigators aim to have one to
      two subjects in this stage. If perfusion of the kidney can be assessed, then the
      investigators will move to stage two of the study.

      In stage 2, the investigators will look to determine the ability of the contrast enhanced
      ultrasonography method to detect renal transplant rejection using Sonazoid. For this stage
      the investigators will recruit subjects with biopsy confirmed renal transplant rejection.
      Once subjects are consented, they will undergo contrast enhanced ultrasonography with
      Sonazoid and have images taken. These images will be compared to images of renal transplant
      patients that have displayed no rejection or clinical issues. These clinically normal
      subjects will have previously consented to a medical record review so that the investigators
      may use their images.
