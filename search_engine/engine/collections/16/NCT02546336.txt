      procedure that was initially performed as an open surgery. The role of the obturator, femoral
      and sciatic nerves in hip joint innervation was discovered. Several small clinical and
      anatomical studies addressed feasibility and benefits of the radiofrequency hip denervation
      (RFHD). Ultrasound guidance may eliminate equivocality of previously published techniques and
      provide precise image guidance as it a is logical and anatomically sound approach when
      procedural targets include soft tissue, such as nerves, tendons and joint capsule. None of
      these structures can be localized under routine fluoroscopy. Ultrasound is a bedside imaging
      tool that has been accepted as safe and reliable. In two meta-analyses, the use of real-time
      two-dimensional ultrasound for the placement of CVCs substantially decreased mechanical
      complications and reduced the number of attempts at required cannulation and failed attempts
      at cannulation compared with the standard landmark placement. Pertinent to the proposed
      study, recent systematic review and meta-analysis of the accuracy of US-guided versus
      landmark-guided hip joint injections revealed that US-guided injections are significantly
      more accurate than those that are landmark-guided. The significance of this study lies in its
      potential to improve functional activity and pain control in patients with HOA. Also, it may
      eventually lead to a decrease in patients resorting to Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) as an
      ultimate end solution for HOA.
