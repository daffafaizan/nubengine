    
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), multi-center (when
      more than 1 hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study),
      active-controlled, randomized (the study drug is assigned by chance) study to evaluate safety
      and efficacy of OROS extended-release (ER) hydromorhone HCl compared to twice daily morphine
      SR, in Taiwan participants with cancer pain. The study consists of 3 phases: Screening phase
      (14 days before administration of study drug), Dose titration phase (3 to 14 days) and Dose
      maintenance phase (14 days). This study will include 8 visits (Visit 1 [Day 1], Visit 2 [Day
      1-13 telephonic], Visit 3 [Day 14], Visit 4 [Day 15 to Day 21 telephonic], Visit 5 [Day 22],
      Visit 6 [Day 23 to 27 telephonic] and Visit 7 [Day 28]). In dose titration phase,
      participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatments, OROS hydromorphone or
      morphine SR and dose of study medication will be adjusted every 48 hours at Investigator's
      discretion according to participant's analgesic (drug used to control pain) requirements.
      Morphine HCl will be used as rescue medication (maintained at 3 doses per day or less) for
      breakthrough pain. Participants primarily will be evaluated for equivalence of efficacy using
      the "worst pain" item of the brief pain inventory (BPI). Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study duration.
