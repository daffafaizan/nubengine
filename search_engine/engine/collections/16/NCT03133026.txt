    
      Study Design:

      Prospective, multi-center, single arm, post market, observational study

      Two groups:

        -  Sludge group: SEMS occluded due to sludge/stones in SEMS

        -  Ingrowth/overgrowth group: SEMS occluded due to malignant tumor ingrowth or benign
           hyperplastic tissue overgrowth

      Primary Endpoint:

      Successful restoration of bile duct drainage with biliary obstructive symptom and cholangitis
      relief as applicable, without procedure related SAE'S, from procedure through 30 days of
      follow-up.

      Secondary Endpoints:

        1. Occurrence and severity of procedure related serious adverse events from procedure
           through 30 days after procedure

        2. Resolution of cholangitis where applicable

        3. Technical success of procedure performed for restoration of bile duct drainage, overall
           and stratified by treatment group Sludge group: Ability to restore stent patency by
           cleaning the stent content followed by cholangiographically or cholangioscopically
           confirmed restored stent patency Ingrowth / overgrowth group: Ability to perform biliary
           radio frequency ablation (RFA) followed by cholangiographically or cholangioscopically
           confirmed restored stent patency

        4. Improvement of biliary obstructive symptoms at 1 week and 1 month post procedure
           compared to Baseline

        5. Improvement of Laboratory Liver Function Tests (LFT) at 1 week and 1 month post
           procedure compared to Baseline

        6. Biliary Reintervention rate from procedure through 30 days after procedure, including
           reinterventions caused by plastic stent occlusion

        7. Impact of cholangioscopy on current standard of care, which is to place a stent inside
           the occluded SEMS by

             -  Avoiding placement of a second stent (plastic or metal)

             -  Avoiding a repeat ERCP

             -  Reducing associated cost
