    
      Plasma levels of heat shock protein (HSP 70), high mobility group box (HMGB1), S100A9 and
      IL-33 will be measured at four time points (prior to the onset of CPB, Hour 6 postoperative,
      day 1 and day 3 after surgery). HLA-DR gene expression will be determined before surgery and
      at day 3 postoperative. The direct effect of DAMPs release and immune suppression will be
      assessed by in vitro experiments.
