      phosphatase, calcium, phosphorous, and magnesium is evaluated. Anthropometric and dietary
      intake data is also collected. In the second phase, we have 6 experimental groups: (1) plain
      milk; (2) calcium-vitamin D-fortified milk (containing 500 mg Ca and 100 IU vitamin D/200 mL
      package); (3) plain orange juice; (4) fortified orange juice containing equal amounts of
      calcium and vitamin D as fortified milk; (5) calcium-vitamin D supplement (500 mg calcium and
      200 IU vitamin D); and (6) placebo. Each group consists of 40-60 children (9-11 years) from
      both sexes. All above-mentioned biochemical, anthropometric and dietary intake data is
      collected both in the beginning and in the end of interventional period.
