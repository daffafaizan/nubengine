      replacement of the failing valve the preferred option. In addition to surgical aortic valve
      replacement (SAVR), transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) has evolved as an
      alternative treatment option for patients at intermediate and high operative risk. Before
      expansion of TAVI to low-risk and younger patients can be recommended, several questions
      remain to be investigated, e.g. optimal patient selection, periprocedural complications and
      long-term durability. Therefore every patient with a relevant aortic valve disease (aortic
      stenosis, aortic regurgitation or degenerative aortic valve prosthesis) who meets the
      inclusion/exclusion criterias is planned to be involved in the study.

      Predictors of outcome are yet to be defined in patients with aortic valve disease in order to
      improve risk prediction for the different treatment modalities (medical, SAVR, TAVI).

      The primary aim of the study is to identify the optimal treatment modality for the individual
      patient, incorporating the individual patient's risk profile and anticipated clinical
      outcomes. This includes the association of demographic factors, procedural data and
      biomarkers with clinical outcome in a prospective fashion.
