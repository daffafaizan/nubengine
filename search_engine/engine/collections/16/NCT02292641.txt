      or recurrent colorectal cancer can be successfully removed and for selecting which patients
      should undergo this form of more radical surgery as is exenterative surgery. We are proposing
      that by validating the detailed evaluation of imaging of the tumour distribution within the
      pelvis, this will enable clear selection criteria to be established and will improve surgical
      planning. This will result in an overall improvement in curative surgery which is currently
      only 67% at best in global series. Furthermore, overall 3 year cancer specific survival for
      patients undergoing this form of surgery without detailed MRI planning is only 35%. Incorrect
      preoperative staging and planning can result in patients undergoing unnecessary surgery (up
      to 40%) or being refused a potentially curative operation in 17% of the cases.

      The design of the study is to be able to show that we have diagnostic accuracy with the use
      of the proposed staging system. The staging system will be validated against survival
      outcomes, also taking account of surgical morbidity outcomes and Quality Of Life measures.

      The primary endpoint is to demonstrate a histopathological complete resection with clear
      margin rate (R0) of >greater than 67% (that is documented in the current literature) can be
      achieved using MRI compartmental classification planned exenterative surgery.
