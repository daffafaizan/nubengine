      carbohydrate counting and DASH diet dietary interventions and a general dietary intervention
      on glycemic control, maternal and neonatal outcomes among Jordanian pregnant women with GDM.
      Eligibility criteria to be enrolled in the study will be being Jordanian pregnant women with
      GDM at 24 -28 gestational weeks, aged between 25 to 40 with no-personal history of type 1 or
      2 diabetes, or impaired fasting glucose, or chronic diseases and singleton gestation. DASH
      diet; and the third group will follow the diet prescribed by the hospital for GDM. The
      duration of intervention will extend from 24-28 gestational weeks until delivery, which will
      be usually 12-14 weeks later. The glycemic controls outcomes are testing fasting blood
      glucose, HbA1C, insulin and fructosamine at baseline and at end of intervention for three
      dietary interventions. While maternal outcomes are total maternal weight gain (kg), need for
      emergency caesarean section, the presence or absence of pregnancy-induced hypertension and
      preeclampsia. The new born birth weight, length and head circumference, the presence or
      absence of hypoglycemia and shoulder dystocia are the newborn outcomes.
