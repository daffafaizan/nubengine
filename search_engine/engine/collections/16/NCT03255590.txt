      (intervention) applied during motor training in chronic stroke patients can change their
      abnormal flexion synergy. The investigators will study chronic stroke patients , who are
      defined as patients that sustained a stroke at least 6 months prior to our testing date.

      Three functional aspects of each finger will be tested: maximal voluntary contraction (MVC),
      finger dexterity, and hand posture.

      Prior to intervention, participants will have a baseline assessment including clinical tests,
      MVC, the individuation task, and the configuration task. Following the baseline assessment
      patients will receive intervention, training on the configuration task paired with concurrent
      transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) for 5 consecutive days. On the sixth day and
      as a one week follow-up after, subjects will have a post-intervention assessment containing
      the same tests performed in baseline.

      This design will allow us to determine speed and accuracy during the configuration task, the
      individuation index, and possible changes in abnormal flexion synergy.
