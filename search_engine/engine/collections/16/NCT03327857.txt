      homeostasis. The unique mechanism of action provides a natural regulation of T cell
      homeostasis that induces cell death preferentially in late-stage activated T cells without
      affecting resting T cells and early-activated T cells. Because pathogenic T cells underlying
      the inflammatory conditions are usually in late-stage activated state, eliminating this
      population of cells can potentially result in controlling autoimmune inflammation of T cell
      associated diseases, such as GvHD.
