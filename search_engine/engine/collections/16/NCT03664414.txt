    
      Patients will be randomly selected from the outpatient family medicine clinics. Once
      included, patients will be randomly allocated (by a computer-generated randomization list) to
      a study or control group. Over a period of 2 years, patients of the study group will receive
      one PTX tablet (400 mg) orally three times a day (at dinner time), whereas controls will
      receive one cellulose identical tablet on the same schedule.

      All patients will continue with their usual treatment prescribed by their family doctor.
      Monthly visits will be scheduled for clinical and biochemical evaluations. A blood sample
      will be taken at baseline and every six months up to 24 months, for measurement of complete
      blood count, urea, creatinine, glucose, albumin, lipids, electrolytes, liver function tests,
      serum total proteins, (will be measure by usual methods). In serum samples at 0, 6, 12, 18
      and 24 months, high sensibility C reactive protein will be measured by nephelometry, Brain
      natriuretic peptide and Serum Cystatin C will be measured by ELISA. Glomerular filtration
      rate (GFR) will be calculated based in Cystatin C level Grubb's equations. Vitamin C will be
      measured by HPLC. A 24 h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (24 h ABPM), M-mode and
      two-dimensional echocardiographic, and an analysis of body composition by bioelectrical
      impedance will be done at baseline 6, 12, 18 and 24 months. To investigate health-related
      quality of life the short-form 36 (SF-36) questionnaire will be applied. Treatment compliance
      will be recorded by counting tablets left in the container at the end of each monthly visit
      and by the Morinsky Green test.
