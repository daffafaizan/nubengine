    
      This study is a randomized, open-label, multiple dosing, 3-way crossover design to evaluate
      the drug-drug interaction between Atorvastatin (Lipitor) and Fenofibric (Trilipix) acid in
      healthy male subjects. Subjects will receive repeated dose of Atorvastatin (40mg*1Tab/day) or
      Fenofibric acid (135mg*1Cap/day) or Atorvastatin (40mg*1Tab/day)/Fenofibric acid
      (135mg*1Cap/day). Each treatment period was separated by a washout period of at least 8 days.
