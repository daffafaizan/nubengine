    
      Cherubism is a very rare bone disorder where bone gets excessively resorbed only in the jaw
      bones (mandible and maxilla). The resulting cavities in bone fill up with soft fibrous
      (fibro-osseous) tissues that can expand and push the bony shells apart. Thus the
      characteristic facial appearance in patients with progressed cherubism. Bone resorption
      (cherubism lesions) in this disorder occurs always symmetrically in the mandible, the maxilla
      or in both. This distinguishes cherubism from similar disorders. As cherubism progresses, the
      lesions can invade the eye sockets (inferior and/or lateral orbital walls) and displace the
      eye balls and push down the eyelids. As a result the sclera (white of the eye) below the iris
      becomes visible and patients have an upward gazing appearance (cherubic look) which gave the
      name to this fibro-proliferative bone disorder.

      Cherubism typically appears between ages of 2-7 years. It is often diagnosed during dental
      evaluations. At early stages cherubism is accompanied by lymph node swelling. Proliferation
      of the fibro-osseous tissue typically stops after puberty and in many the soft tissue in the
      cherubic bone cavities are replaced by new bone.

      For this study we will:

        -  Send out study participation kits and consent by phone

        -  Collect a saliva sample from eligible individuals

        -  Obtain information regarding cherubism

        -  Document disorder with photos and doctor's letters

        -  If patients undergo surgery for cherubism we ask to obtain some bone tissue that would
           otherwise be discarded

        -  Isolate DNA from the saliva sample

        -  Perform genetic analyses of the DNA with the most up-to-date methods available to
           identify genetic variations

        -  Study in the laboratory why the genetic variations cause the disorder
