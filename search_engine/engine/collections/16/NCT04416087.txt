      many cancers, but very little is currently known clinically and mechanistically about the
      effects of physical activity and exercise on tumor itself. Based on recent evidence from
      pre-clinical studies, it is plausible to expect that changes in tumor blood flow and its
      heterogeneity, oxygenation, and metabolism due to exercise would increase the delivery of
      chemotherapy and other cancer drugs into the tumor increasing the efficacy of cancer
      treatment.

      Twenty (20) newly diagnosed Breast cancer patients will be recruited to investigate whether
      these pre-clinical findings can be extended to humans to serve as an evidence-based
      proof-of-concept for the possible inclusion of exercise in the treatment of cancer during
      chemotherapy. To study the effect of acute physical exercise on tumor blood flow and its
      heterogeneity, supine bicycle exercise in a positron emission tomography (PET) scanner will
      be used to exercise Breast cancer patients. These experiments are additional measurements to
      their normal treatments, and no new interventional approaches will be conducted in this
      study.

      The study consists of one fitness test assessment, and tumor blood flow measurements with PET
      at rest and during supine cycling exercise.
