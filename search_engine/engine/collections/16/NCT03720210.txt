      failed to respond to medical therapy or have developed side effects from medical therapy or
      are considered high risk for such therapy.

      These patients will be offered the option to undergo radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of a
      portion of the thyroid gland in order to decrease thyroid hormone production and/or to
      inactive the existing thyroid hormone store before their leakage into the circulation.

      Investigators will follow these patients to assess their clinical response as well as their
      thyroid values. The safety of the procedure will also be assessed.
