      least one additional CVD risk factor. The trial compared the effects of randomization to a
      treatment program of an intensive SBP goal with randomization to a treatment program of a
      standard goal. Target SBP goals were <120 vs <140 mm Hg, respectively, to create a minimum
      mean difference of 10 mm Hg between the two randomized groups. The primary hypothesis was
      that CVD event rates would be lower in the intensive arm. Participants were recruited at
      approximately 90 clinics within 5 clinical center networks (CCNs) over approximately a 2-year
      period, and were followed for 4-6 years.

      A total of 9361 participants were enrolled. NIH stopped the blood pressure intervention
      earlier than originally planned in order to quickly disseminate the significant preliminary
      results. Follow-up for cognitive and kidney outcomes continues during the post-intervention
      phase through May 2018.
