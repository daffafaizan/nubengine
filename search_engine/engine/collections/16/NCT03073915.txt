      University Hospital will be collected prospectively from the electronic medical records. The
      occurrence of bleeding episodes or thrombotic events will be followed for the next 90 days
      following discharge from the hospital.

      The percent of patients actually treated by LMWH among patients entitled for such therapy
      according to the most updated international guidelines will be evaluated. The risk of minor
      and major bleeding will be compared among those given thromboprophylaxis and those who were
      not treated. Similar comparison will be made for thrombotic events.
