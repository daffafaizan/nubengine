      objective prioritization of liver transplant candidates. The revised Model for End Stage
      Liver Disease (MELD) system is based primarily on laboratory test results. Candidates with
      MELD scores of less than 15 are considered to be low priority for cadaveric liver transplant
      and have limited treatment options. Yet patients with low MELD scores may suffer from an
      array of symptoms associated with liver disease such as fatigue, sleep disturbances, and
      depression - all of which erode health-related quality of life (HRQoL). No previous studies
      were found that examined HRQoL in low MELD transplant patients. A better understanding of the
      HRQoL of these patients will allow clinicians to better meet their needs. Therefore, the aims
      of the proposed pilot capstone project are to examine HRQoL and to identify demographic and
      clinical characteristics including liver-disease related symptoms, functional status,
      perceived social support, biological functioning and mental health associated with HRQoL in
      pre-liver transplant candidates with low MELD scores. The revised Wilson and Cleary Quality
      of Life Model will be used to guide the project. Fifty pre-transplant liver candidates with
      MELD scores < 15 will be enrolled in the descriptive, cross-sectional pilot study.
      Participants will complete a written questionnaire measuring perceived HRQoL and clinical
      characteristics. Descriptive and correlational statistics will be used to analyze the data.
      Findings from this project will identify trends in factors that contribute to a HRQoL of this
      population and provide the foundation for a larger future project.
