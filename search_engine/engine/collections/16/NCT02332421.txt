      orthodontic treatment of cases that require premolars extraction. The retraction phase of the
      canines into an extraction site with conventional treatment method usually lasts about 4 to 6
      months under normal circumstances. The use of dentoalveolar distraction (DAD) technique has
      been considered a very important step in this field. It has been shown by early case reports
      that this technique can be employed to retract canines within 10 to 14 days.

      Although DAD is thought to accelerate tooth movement during canine retraction, a significant
      amount of tipping (distal tilting) was observed in many case reports. So in this study, there
      is an intention to apply a modified DAD device on one side of the mouth and to compare it
      with the conventional one applied on the opposite side of the mouth in each participating
      patient.
