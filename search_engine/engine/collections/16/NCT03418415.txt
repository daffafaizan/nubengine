      it is assumed that renal denervation (RDN) might improve glucose metabolism and insulin
      sensitivity. Some clinical studies have shown that glucose metabolism is improved in patients
      with resistant hypertension both 1 and 3 months after RDN, and fasting glucose, insulin and
      C-peptide decreased significantly as did insulin resistance assessed by HOMA-IR. But in some
      clinical studies, RDN did not lead to a significant improvement of insulin sensitivity â‰¤12
      months after treatment, and no effect in systemic sympathetic activity was observed after
      RDN. Therefore, the efficacy of RDN on glucose metabolism is still in controversy. The
      investigators wish to investigate the effect of multi-electrode catheter-based RDN on glucose
      metabolism and insulin sensitivity in patients with T2DM.
