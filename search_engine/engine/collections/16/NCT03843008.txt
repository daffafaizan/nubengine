      it comes to improvement in quality of life and morbidity, besides physical and occupational
      therapy. It affects people of all nationalities, creeds, and socioeconomic classes through a
      narrow array of mechanisms. With all those mechanisms, a common outcome is shared:
      derangement of the brain parenchymal architecture. This derangement is non-selective in its
      destruction with obscuration of the blood brain barrier and the glymphatic system, and with
      bleeding as a common sequela; the oxidative stress of the hemoglobin-heme-iron compound
      causing further injury. This study will measure Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a well-documented
      inflammatory biomarker that is increased in the acute phase of stroke, and to compare its
      levels after the administration of melatonin - a well-documented anti-inflammatory and
      anti-oxidant - that regulates circadian rhythm, which helps promote sleep. Any increased time
      spent in a restful state because of melatonin increases the clearance of waste products after
      a catastrophic event, like in stroke.
