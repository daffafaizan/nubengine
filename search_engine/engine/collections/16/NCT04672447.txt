      substrate for endothelial nitric oxide synthesis. Glutathione is a tripeptide with
      antioxidant effects. Postmenopausal women will ingest 6g/d of L-Citrulline or 2g of
      L-Citrulline plus 200mg/d of glutathione or placebo (maltodextrin) for 4 weeks with vascular
      function testing prior to and after the intervention.
