    
      Postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF) is widely regarded as the most threatening
      complication following pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Its clinical impact and sequelae have
      been previously described and shown to contribute to the development of other morbid
      complications and high rates of mortality.

      The aim of the present study was to observe whether the modified pancreatico- jejunostomy (PJ
      ) technique with an isolated pancreatic loop would effectively reduce the POPF rate and
      overall morbidity after PD.

      Methods: We report our early experience using a modified PJ technique with an isolated
      pancreatic loop after after PD in 201 patients between January 2010 and December 2020.
