        -  Determine the pattern of adverse clinical experience in patients with myelodysplastic
           syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, or intermediate-grade or follicular non-Hodgkin's
           lymphoma treated with FR901228 (depsipeptide).

        -  Determine the disease response in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic correlates of this drug, including
           measurement of serum plasma levels, H3 and H4 acetylation, apoptosis induction,
           differentiation, and multidrug-resistant (MDR) phenotype expression in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive FR901228 (depsipeptide) IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 5. Courses
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed monthly.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
