      svgs/d) and do little to no structured physical activity at study entry. Each participant
      will be assigned to a group; one of two experimental groups or a control group. The two
      intervention groups will differ only in the amount of dairy consumed (4 svgs vs. 0-1 svg/d).
      Both will undergo the same exercise program (3x/wk) and will be counseled on healthy eating
      by a trained nutritionist-dietitian every month. The control group will be tested at the
      beginning and end of the study to help account for any growth-related changes during the
      study but will not receive any formal intervention. In each group, the investigators will
      assess body composition (muscle mass, fat mass, % body fat and regional fat mass) and bone
      (bone turnover markers). The investigators will also measure various metabolic and
      inflammatory markers, hormones as well as dietary intake, strength and fitness.

      This study will determine whether increased intake of dairy products improve bone and body
      composition during a 12-week weight management intervention. The investigators expect the two
      groups participating in the intervention to show significant changes in body weight and body
      composition and greater gains in fitness compared to the control group. The investigators
      expect those consuming dairy to show greater improvements in body composition and bone health
      compared to those not consuming added dairy. The investigators also anticipate better vitamin
      D status and less whole-body inflammation in those consuming dairy. Both intervention groups
      should show improvements in fasting insulin, glucose and cholesterol.
