      bitter taste. This gene codes for a G protein that is associated with a flavor receptor
      regulated by phenylthiocarbamide (PTC) and propylthiouracil (PROP) ligands, which by binding
      to the receptor determines the degree of bitter taste. Cruciferous vegetables contain
      glucosinolates and isothiocyanates, which resemble PTC and PROP and thereby affect their
      perception of bitter taste through the TAS2R38 regulated receptor.

      The polymorphism of this gene allows to distinguish three phenotypes:

        -  insensitive to bitter taste [bitter-non tasters]

        -  moderately sensitive to bitter taste [intermediate-bitter tasters]

        -  sensitive to bitter taste [bitter taster] Previous studies have shown that people who
           are carriers of one PAV haplotype experience a bitter taste more than AVI / AVI
           homozygotes, which are less sensitive to bitter taste. Hence, the TAS2R38 gene
           polymorphism is associated with nutritional decisions, including choice of vegetables
           and coffee.

      Aim of the study is to verify effectiveness of the genotype based dietary intervention in
      people with or without polymorphism of TAS2R38 gene.
