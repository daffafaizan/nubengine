      patients who would not get benefit of this treatment. It seems that elastography, cellular
      density and perfusion could be considered as predictors. Fibroid elastography will be
      quantified by MRE ResoundantÂ® system and pelvic ultrasound. Perfusion and cellular density
      will be quantified by MR diffusion.
