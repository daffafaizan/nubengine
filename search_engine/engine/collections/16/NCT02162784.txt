        -  A. Two inhalations of Ventolin 100 mcg,

        -  B. One inhalation of SYN006 180/10 mcg,

        -  C. Two inhalations of SYN006 180/10 mcg.

      Patients will be received the study treatment according to one of the six treatment sequences
      according to the randomization schedule:

        1. A-B-C,

        2. B-A-C,

        3. C-A-B,

        4. C-B-A,

        5. A-C-B,

        6. B-C-A.

      The efficacy endpoint is

        -  The change in Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) within 6 hours.

        -  The change in Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR) within 6 hours.

        -  The change in Force Vital Capacity (FVC) within 6 hours.
