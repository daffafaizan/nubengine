      Transuretheral Resection of the Bladder (TURB) to standard white light TURB in patients with
      suspicion of non-invasive bladder cancer.

      Patients will be followed 4, 8 and 12 months after the initial TURB. This follow-up regimen
      is according to standard clinical practice in Denmark.

      Recurrence of non-invasive bladder cancer is frequent, and this study is designed to
      investigate whether Hexvix assisted TURB can reduce the early recurrence compared to standard
      TURB
