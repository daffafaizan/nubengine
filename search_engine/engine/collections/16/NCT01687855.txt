      deprived of sleep for one night. A series of midline sagittal images of the upper airway were
      obtained. The dynamic alterations of the tongue size and the distance from the tongue to X
      axis (an extended line from the anterior nasal spine to posterior nasal spine) and Y axis (a
      perpendicular line from the center of the pituitary to the X axis) were measured.Statistical
      comparisons between pairs of means were performed via t-tests using Spss10 software. A
      probability level of p<0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.
