      explained by well-recognized medical illness. Such symptoms are common in all settings and
      studies have reported that they accounted for one-fifth of all new presentations in primary
      care. Literature suggests that they are associated with significant levels of psychological
      distress, disability, impairments in quality of life and high levels of healthcare
      utilization. Research also suggests that medically unexplained symptoms cause similar (or
      higher) levels of disability than medically explained symptoms in primary care settings.
      There have been a number of studies that have looked at the cognitive and behavioural basis
      of somatisation, and treatment strategies have been trialed based upon a cognitive behavior
      therapy (CBT)-led approach for these patients.

      In British South Asian patients the difficulties in managing this condition are further
      compounded as culture can have an important role in shaping the experience, interpretation &
      clinical presentation of emotional distress. Patel reported that GPs found it very
      challenging to manage South Asian patients with chronic pain due to the way they present with
      pain, and a greater likelihood of psychosomatic presentations. Language differences as well
      as cultural differences contributed to the challenges, especially among first- generation
      South Asians. Further, they felt that self-management strategies were difficult to address.
      The author concludes by saying 'cultural influences play an important role in the
      consultation process where patients' behaviour is often bound in their cultural view of
      health care. (South Asian) patients' presentation of their condition makes diagnosis
      difficult but can also lead to miscommunication'.
