      volunteer will receive two forearm median nerve blocks separated by a two week washout
      period. One block will be conducted alongside an infusion of normal saline (control). The
      other block will be conducted alongside a randomised dose of IV dexamethasone (2, 4 or 8mg).
      The order of these interventions will be random. Blocks will be assessed quantitatively with
      cold and sharp sensation, electrical stimulation, quantitative sensory testing (thermal
      tolerance) and grip strength dynamometry. Measures or sensory and motor block including
      onset, intensity and duration will be compared between dosing groups.
