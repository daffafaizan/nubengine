      pancreas that release too much insulin. Some children with CHI have these cells throughout
      their pancreas; others have them located in specific areas of the pancreas. Children who have
      them located in specific areas of the pancreas may be cured with surgery. F-DOPA is a
      radioactive drug that may go to these very cells. F-DOPA can also be used for positron
      emission tomography (or PET), an imaging technique used in nuclear medicine departments. In
      this study, researchers will test the possibility of using PET with F-DOPA in the diagnosis
      of children with hyperinsulinism.
