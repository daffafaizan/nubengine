    
      This study is a randomized controlled trial investigating the effect of BIS-guided
      decongestive treatment on clinical outcomes in overhydrated patients scheduled for and
      receiving TAVR.

      Centers participating in this trial are: Medical University of Vienna, Kepler University
      Hospital Linz

      Consecutive adult patients with severe degenerative AS scheduled for TAVR will be
      prospectively enrolled at university-affiliated tertiary centers in Austria. Eligibility and
      decision for TAVR will be determined by a multidisciplinary Heart Team. All patients who are
      willing to participate will undergo assessment of volume status using BIS prior to
      intervention. Overhydrated subjects, defined as a relative fluid overload ≥7% (Rel. FO =
      fluid overload/extracellular water × 100%) and/or absolute fluid overload ≥1L as assessed by
      BIS, will then be randomly assigned to undergo BIS-guided pre- and postprocedural
      decongestion treatment vs. decongestion treatment based on mere clinical judgement of volume
      status in a 1:1 fashion. In order to avoid detection bias, FO patients in the non-BIS group
      as well as their treating physicians shall be blinded for BIS-results. Physicians and study
      participants will only be informed about the targeted dry body weight, if randomized to the
      BIS-guided decongestion group. Decongestion will be performed using standard medication (e.g.
      loop diuretics) and applied orally or intravenously, as appropriate. After TAVR, patients
      with FO will be followed before discharge from the hospital, after 3, 6 and 12 months.

      Methods:

      Patients will undergo standardized evaluation of their fluid status using a portable
      whole-body BIS device, the Body Composition Monitor (BCM, Fresenius Medical Care, Bad
      Homburg, Germany). Patients will be placed in supine position before the evaluation of their
      fluid status. Electrodes will be attached to the nondominant hand and the ipsilateral foot.
      Measurements will be conducted according to the manufacturer's manual. For each patient, only
      one bioelectrical impedance analysis will be performed, as this method has an adequate
      reproducibility. Fluid overload assessed by BCM is expressed as an absolute value in liters
      or as a relative value in %, calculated as the ratio between fluid overload (FO) and the
      content of extracellular water (ECW) and multiplied by 100 (Rel. FO = FO/ECW × 100%).

      Prespecified study visits:

      V0 (14+-13 days prior to TAVR): BIS measurement, pitting edema quantification, demographic
      factors, symptom assessment, cardiovascular risk factors, ECG, laboratory analysis (e.g.
      NT-pro BNP, hs-TnT), frailty assessment, KCCQ questionnaire, transthoracic echocardiography;
      V1 (90+-7 days post TAVR): BIS measurement, pitting edema quantification, demographic
      factors, symptom assessment, ECG, laboratory analysis (e.g. NT-pro BNP, hs-TnT), KCCQ
      questionnaire, transthoracic echocardiography; TV2 (telephone visit, 180+-7 days post TAVR):
      demographic factors, symptom assessment; V3 (360+-7 days post TAVR, =end of treatment): BIS
      measurement, pitting edema quantification, demographic factors, symptom assessment, ECG,
      laboratory analysis (e.g. NT-pro BNP, hs-TnT), KCCQ questionnaire, transthoracic
      echocardiography;

      Outcome:

      Cardiac outcomes (see below) will be assessed 12 months follwing TAVR.
