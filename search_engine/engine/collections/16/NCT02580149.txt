      ticagrelor but not clopidogrel protects against IR injury due to inhibition of cellular
      adenosine uptake and NO-synthase stimulation. It is unclear if this action is part of the
      beneficial clinical effect of ticagrelor in patients with a history of acute coronary
      syndrome. The preventive action of ticagrelor on IR injury may also be of interest for the
      peripheral vasculature, where IR injury is known to result in endothelial dysfunction. This
      study aims to investigate if treatment with ticagrelor can mitigate the transient loss of
      endothelium-dependent vasodilatation of the resistance vasculature following a short period
      of ischemia, compared with clopidogrel at standard clinical doses. We will study the effect
      of ticagrelor or clopidogrel after a loading dose and after a two weeks period of regular
      intake on forearm blood flow (FBF) reactivity in response to the vasodilators acetylcholine
      (ACh; endothelium-dependent agonist) or nitroglycerin (GTN; endothelium-independent
      vasodilator) before and 10 min after a 20 min forearm ischemia, respectively
