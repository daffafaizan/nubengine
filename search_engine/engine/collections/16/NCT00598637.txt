      proportion of the myocardium compromised in this condition, and, in several studies, it has
      been linked to the 6-month mortality after the index procedure. Drug-eluting stents have
      reduced the restenosis rate and the need for target vessel revascularization not only in
      simple lesion but also in high risk subsets of patients and lesions such as diabetics, long
      lesions or bifurcations. There are no data about their efficacy in left main coronary artery
      disease. Thus, the aim of this study is to investigate the performance of two different
      drug-eluting stents (Everolimus and Zotarolimus-eluting) in left main coronary lesions.
