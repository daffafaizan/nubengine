      health benefit on the host. This health-promoting effects have been extensively studied in
      the gastrointestinal niche but it becomes more and more clear that other niches are also
      interesting for the potential of probiotics. Recent breakthroughs in 'next generation
      sequencing' (NGS) technologies are making it now possible to map the microbiota after DNA
      extraction, which is very interesting for bacteria that are not or difficult to cultivate.
      The research into the microbiota of the skin with such new NGS technologies currently
      limited, but shows that there is also an equilibrium in the skin composition of the
      microbiota and that there is a disturbance of the skin microbiota in acne (Murillo & Raoult,
      2013). In acne vulgaris it is known that the condition is multifactorial and that both
      hormonal triggers and environmental factors play a role. However, it is also known that
      Propionibacterium acnes play an important role in the inflammation of the sebaceous gland
      follicles. Probiotic strains with antipathogenic activity against this bacterium and suitable
      for application to the skin is thus potentially able to restore the balance of the skin
      microbiota and reduce acne symptoms.
