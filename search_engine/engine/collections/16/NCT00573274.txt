      cardiac hemodynamic parameters including flow, resistance, contractility and fluid content.
      It involves the application of electrocardiogram (ECG) leads on the neck and the thorax to
      measure resistance of pulsatile blood flow. Its benefits are that it is non-invasive, low
      cost, and easy to operate. Thoracic impedance has been validated against the gold standard
      method of PAC. Although the Physioflow device has been validated in non-pregnant patients,
      its use in pregnant patients is very limited.

      Moderate to severe hypotension, experienced by these awake patients, can cause significant
      undesirable symptoms of dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea and vomiting, and also
      compromise fetal well-being. The etiology of hypotension is multi-factorial,and it is
      postulated that decreases in cardiac output (CO), stroke volume (SV) and/or systemic vascular
      resistance (SVR) may precede decreases in blood pressure. Continuous measurement of CO and SV
      by the Physioflow Impedance device may provide a better understanding of the cause of
      hypotension so that future management of these patients may include pharmacological
      interventions used prior to hypotension in order to avoid any undesirable symptoms.
