      results in a small, NIMH-funded randomized pilot trial (R21 MH 064568). We will assess
      patients biweekly during the active treatment phase and follow them for 12 months after the
      end of treatment to obtain data on long-term treatment outcome. We hypothesize that CMBT will
      show higher efficacy and retention than CBT in the treatment phase, and that gains will be
      maintained at a higher rate during follow-up.

      A second major purpose of the proposed study is to elucidate the presumed mechanisms of
      change by examining potential mediators (readiness to change, irrational beliefs about
      gambling, coping skills, therapeutic alliance) and moderators (psychiatric comorbidity with
      Axis I and II disorders, family history of PG, impulsivity, and baseline motivation to
      change) of treatment response. A better understanding of how the proposed interventions work
      will help advance the science and treatment of PG and will be helpful in the future
      refinement and adaptation of CMBT. Identifying patient subgroups for which the intervention
      is particularly effective is essential for rational treatment selection. Thus, the immediate
      goal of the project is to compare CBMT versus CBT for the treatment of PG. A long-term goal
      of the proposed research is to establish effective treatment procedures that reduce the
      considerable individual and social costs of PG.
