      interferons or pegylated interferons for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C (HCV).
      Extensive clinical studies have demonstrated that combination therapy with ribavirin and
      interferons or pegylated interferons are efficacious treatments for HCV. However, ribavirin
      has been assigned a FDA Pregnancy Category X classification, indicating that it should not be
      used in women who are pregnant or in men whose partners may become pregnant. Because the
      incidence of HCV is highest in the group with the highest reproductive potential, the 25 - 45
      year age group, (CDC, 2001) it is likely that inadvertent pregnancy exposures will occur and
      should be monitored. The primary objectives of this Registry are:

        -  To evaluate the association between ribavirin and birth defects occurring in offspring
           of female patients exposed to ribavirin during pregnancy or within six months after
           therapy has stopped.

        -  To evaluate the association between ribavirin and birth defects occurring in offspring
           of females exposed to ribavirin during pregnancy or within six months after therapy has
           stopped, through their male sexual partners taking ribavirin.
