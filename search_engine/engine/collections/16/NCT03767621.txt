      renders serious limitations. In the case of intermediate stenoses (25-60%), invasive imaging
      tests, intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence tomography (OCT) or functional by
      determining the Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR), have been proposed to identify those patients
      who could benefit from revascularization.

      Studies with a limited number of patients have shown that a value of FFR above 0.80 identify
      a low risk of events in case of not performing revascularization in patients with
      intermediate stenosis in the LMCA. Although iFR (Instant wave Free Ratio) has recently been
      found equivalent to FFR in assessing the prognosis of patients with intermediate lesions, the
      validation of the prognostic power of this index in patients with intermediate LMCA lesions
      has not been demonstrated, although it is used in clinical practice assuming the results in
      other locations of the lesions.

      The demonstration of the prognostic utility of iFR in patients with LMCA intermediate lesions
      could have an important clinical impact and justify its systematic use for the treatment
      decision in these high-risk patients.
