      superfamily, is upregulated on phagocytic cells in the presence of bacteria or fungi
      infection and weakly expressed in samples from patients with noninfectious inflammatory
      disorders. In addition, TREM-1 is shed from the membrane of activated phagocytes and can be
      found in a soluble form (sTREM-1) in body fluids. The level and serial change of a serum
      sTREM-1 from cirtical ill patients has been shown to be a good diagnostic and prognostic
      indicator of ventilation associated pneumonia (VAP) and severe sepsis.
