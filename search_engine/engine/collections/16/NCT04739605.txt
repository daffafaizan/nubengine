    
      For several years, we have been applying the concept of Enhanced Recovery Program (ERP) for
      colorectal surgery at CHU Liége (Belgium). Since October 2015, the University Hospital of
      Liège has been labelled as reference center for ERP after colorectal surgery by a
      French-speaking organization GRACE (French-speaking group for Enhanced Recovery after
      Surgery; www.grace-asso.fr). Despite the benefits for the patient and the economic benefits
      of such programs, few studies have investigated postoperative patient-related quality of
      recovery of patients who have had ERP.

      This observational study will evaluate the patient reported outcomes and postoperative
      patient-related quality of recovery in 150 patients undergoing colorectal surgery according
      to an ERP at CHU Liège.The QoR15 survey will be performed preoperatively and repeated
      postoperatively at hospital or via telephone calls on Day + 1, Day +2; Day + 3, Day 7 and Day
      + 14. The total score and the answers at the subsections will be correlated with the medical
      and surgical characteristics of the patients.
