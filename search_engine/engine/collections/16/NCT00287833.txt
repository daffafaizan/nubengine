      I. Determine the toxic effects of Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate, administered as an
      orange juice suspension, in healthy male participants.

      II. Determine a safe dose range of this drug in these participants. III. Determine a
      recommended phase II dose of this drug in these participants.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these participants.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-escalation study.

      Participants are sequentially assigned to 1 of 4 dose level cohorts. One participant in each
      dose level cohort is randomized to receive placebo. Participants receive 1 of 4 escalating
      doses of oral Bowman-Birk inhibitor concentrate or placebo, as an orange juice suspension, on
      day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed periodically for 4 weeks.
