    
      Treatment will be administered in 2 phases, a neoadjuvant phase and a postoperative phase.
      The neoadjuvant phase will be 18 weeks for patients enrolled in the experimental arm and 16
      weeks for those enrolled in the control arm.

      Following the neoadjuvant phase, all subjects will undergo determination of their current
      response status and appropriate breast surgery and node dissection after which assessment for
      pCR will be conducted following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy. Pathologists
      interpreting surgical specimens for pCR assessment will be blinded to the treatment arm.

      All subjects, regardless of whether or not they have achieved a pCR, will then enter the
      postoperative phase where they will receive adjuvant treatment. A small portion of the
      corresponding neoadjuvant therapy, either nab-paclitaxel or paclitaxel, will be administered
      as adjuvant treatment postoperatively. Adjuvant treatment will continue in the postoperative
      phase until the subject experiences unacceptable toxicity (not correctable with dose
      reduction), withdraws consent, or if the Investigator feels it is no longer in the subject's
      best interest to continue treatment.
