      fully investigated. A new device has been developed that combines cold and intermittent
      pneumatic compression in a single system. A well-controlled clinical study evaluating the
      clinical effectiveness of cryotherapy with compression in an orthopedic postoperative
      application is the subject of this protocol. Patients diagnosed with osteoarthritis of the
      knee and scheduled for primary total knee arthroplasty procedure will be invited to
      participate in this study.
