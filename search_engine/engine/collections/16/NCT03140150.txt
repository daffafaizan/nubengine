      double-chamber pacemaker, stimuli-dependent or not, for 2 years, by means of data
      transmissions of the devices by Carelink Express during the usual consultations with the
      treating cardiologist significantly reduces the number of unnecessary consultations in the
      implant centers (without any change in treatment or pacemaker programming) compared to the
      usual follow-up mode recommended for this type of device.
