      The primary objective of this project was to develop and evaluate a computerized program that
      would enhance Veterans Health Administration (VHA) employees� awareness of women veterans and
      their health-care needs. The program was designed to challenge negative stereotypes about
      female patients (gender-role ideology), increase empathy toward female patients� needs
      (gender sensitivity), and enhance knowledge regarding women veterans and aspects of their VHA
      care (knowledge).

      DESIGN/METHODS:

      Phases I involved generating content for the computerized interactive program. Phase II
      involved creating the 30-minute program. The Phase III evaluation of the program involved a
      two-group pretest�posttest�follow-up equivalent control group design at two facilities with a
      third facility comparison group. At the first two facilities, employees who provide either
      direct or ancillary care to patients were randomly assigned to either the treatment or the
      control group. Participants in the treatment group completed the program entitled Caring for
      Women Veterans. Participants in the control group and those at the third site completed a
      30-minute program entitled Managing Stress. The data from the third site were included to
      test for infusion of the treatment effect within same-site groups. Gender awareness was
      evaluated at three time points using the Gender Awareness Inventory-VA (GAI-VA). Participants
      completed the GAI-VA several weeks prior to completing the computerized program (Time 1, n
      =339), immediately after completing the program (Time 2, n = 249), and approximately one
      month after the program (Time 3, n = 167). Participants also completed a qualitative
      evaluation of the program at Time 2.
