      to a complex genetic trait. It is rare to have two or more affected siblings, or sibpairs,
      within one family. The JRA ASP (Affected Sibpair) Registry is a nationwide effort and will
      collect information and blood samples from JRA sibpairs and their families. Unaffected family
      members (e.g., mother, father, and unaffected children) are also invited to participate.

      Patients and their families may enroll in the registry in one of two ways: patients may
      contact the registry directly, or they may be referred to the registry through their
      physician. Once the family has qualified to join the registry, the family will be asked to
      complete a questionnaire on the medical history of their JRA-affected members. Physicians of
      the JRA-affected members will be asked to complete questionnaires about their patients'
      conditions. Family members will also be invited to provide a one-time blood sample.
      Information collected through the registry will help researchers identify genes involved in
      JRA susceptibility.
