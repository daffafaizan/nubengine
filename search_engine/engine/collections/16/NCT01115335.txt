      is important to understand the acceptability, feasibility, and safety of implementing NMC
      services in various clinical settings.

      In this study, we will examine the acceptability of neonatal male circumcision among parents
      in several ways. First, we will administer a structured questionnaire on NMC to 1000
      consenting parents of newborn boys at a tertiary care institution and 1-2 primary care
      clinics in Lusaka. All parents approached, regardless of whether or not they complete the
      survey, will also be offered an opportunity to have their sons circumcised. Uptake will be
      calculated as the percent of parents approached who consent for their sons to be circumcised.
      Finally, we will assess parental satisfaction with results of the procedure.

      To examine the feasibility of training providers and implementing neonatal male circumcision
      services in various clinical settings, we will train a group of 15-20 health care providers
      in three different circumcision methods (Gomco clamp, Mogen clamp, and Plastibell) at 2-3
      study sites. We will recruit 600 infants to be circumcised during the training. We will use
      structured questionnaires and skill assessments to evaluate provider competence after
      completing the training curriculum, provider preferences among the three circumcision
      methods, and opinion about how NMC should be scaled up within the existing health care
      system. We will also document logistical difficulties of scaling up NMC services at the study
      sites.

      Finally, we will examine the safety of implementing NMC by collecting and analyzing data on
      complications resulting from the different circumcision methods.
