      due to excessive activity in the neurons of the brain. However, it is technically difficult
      to record the activity of neurons, especially in the brain of human patients. Therefore,
      there are gaps in what scientists know of what exactly goes wrong in neurons during epileptic
      seizures.

      In this study, an array of micro-electrodes will be inserted into the brain of patients with
      epilepsy while they are undergoing a clinically indicated assessment with intracranial
      electroencephalography (EEG). The micro-electrode array is able to continuously record the
      activity of neurons in the human brain. In combination with the standard intracranial EEG,
      the recordings of the micro-electrode array will allow a better understanding of the
      relationship between epileptic seizures and the activity of neurons.
