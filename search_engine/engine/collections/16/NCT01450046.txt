      by the Cohort Review Committee (CRC) based on safety after the last subject in the current
      cohort has completed the Study Treatment Period. The study will consist of the following
      procedures:

        -  Pre-Treatment Period: The screening period must occur within 7 days of dosing.

        -  Study Treatment Period (14 days): Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol will be administered orally
           twice daily for 14 consecutive days

        -  Post-Treatment Period: Subject will return to the study site 7 days after the dose of
           Vitamin E δ-Tocotrienol for an end-of-treatment assessment. On day 8 (± 2 days) after
           the last dose of study drug, the investigator will obtain follow-up information. Any
           serious adverse events (SAEs) present at 7 days after the last dose and possibly related
           to study drug will be followed until resolution, stabilization, or initiation of
           treatment that confounds the ability to assess the event.
