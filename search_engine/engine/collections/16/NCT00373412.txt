    
      This is a Phase 1, single-center, randomized, open-label trial of the live, attenuated Towne
      CMV vaccine administered as a "challenge" to healthy, CMV-seronegative, adult subjects who
      previously receive the CMV immunotherapeutic trivalent pDNA-based vaccine, VCL-CT02, given by
      intramuscular route at Days 1, 7 and 14 or who receive no VCL-CT02.

      Up to 12 healthy, CMV-seronegative subjects will be enrolled. If a subject consents and meets
      all eligibility criteria, the subject will be randomized to the VCL CT02 (N=6)or control
      (N=6) groups. VCL CT02-assigned subjects will receive VCL CT02 (1 mg weekly x 3) and then on
      Day 77 will received Towne vacine (3000 pfu subcutaneously). Control-assigned subjects will
      receive Towne alone. Safety will be monitored and both antibody to CMV gB and T-cell
      responses to CMV antigens will be measured at specified intervals for 252 days post Towne
      challenge.
