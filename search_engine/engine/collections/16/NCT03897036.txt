      inhibitory effect of PTCH1 on Smoothened (SMO). Signal transduction by SMO then leads to the
      activation and nuclear localization of GLI1 transcription factors and induction of Hh target
      genes, many of which are involved in proliferation, survival, and angiogenesis. Hedgehog
      pathway inhibitors, such as vismodegib6 and sonidegib phosphate, target the G-protein-coupled
      receptor Smoothened (SMO) and are recommended as first-line treatment for advanced BCC or
      mBCC by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network. CK2 affects the terminal-most Hh signaling
      components. Given the roles of CK2 on the terminal step of the hedgehog signaling pathway,
      CK2 inhibition is unlikely to be overcome by downstream mutations within this pathway. These
      data thus suggest an immediately practical application of CX-4945 in Hh-driven tumors and
      possibly tumors resistant to SMO inhibitors.
