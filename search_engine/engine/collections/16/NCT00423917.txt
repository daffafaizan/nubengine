    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the efficacy of fulvestrant and bevacizumab, in terms of 6-month progression-free
           survival (PFS), in patients with metastatic breast cancer previously treated with an
           aromatase inhibitor.

      Secondary

        -  Assess the quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the adverse-event profile in these patients.

        -  Determine the PFS and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Determine the confirmed response rate, duration of response, time to treatment failure,
           and time to first cytotoxic agent in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly on day 1 and bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes
      on days 1 and 15. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to every other course, and at the completion
      of study treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 51 patients will be accrued for this study.
