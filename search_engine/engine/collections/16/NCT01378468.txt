      combined oral triglyceride and glucose tolerance test in patients who had a first ischemic
      stroke. Follow-up after one year primarily assesses wether or not a recurrent stroke has
      occured. The glucose tolerance test is meant to identify patients with metabolic syndrome
      (and diabetes), since this condition is per se associated with increased levels of
      triglycerides. Potentially, the post-challenge triglyceride levels only play a role in
      patients without diabetes or metabolic syndrome. For further details see Ebinger et al. 'The
      Berlin 'Cream&Sugar' Study: the prognostic impact of an oral triglyceride tolerance test in
      patients after acute ischaemic stroke', IJS; 2010,5, 47-51.
