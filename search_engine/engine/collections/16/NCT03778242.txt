      PPH cases. PPH is the leading cause of maternal morbidity and mortality worldwide, resulting
      in up to 28% of maternal deaths. Therefore, inducing a rapid and effective uterine
      contraction following delivery is an important issue. Risk factors of uterine atony include
      obesity, White or Hispanic race/ethnicity, polyhydramnios, preeclampsia, anemia, and
      chorioamnionitis as well as a twin pregnancy.

      With the increasingly common use of ovulation induction and assisted reproduction techniques,
      the incidence of multiple gestation pregnancies has progressively increased. Suzuki et al.
      reported that elective cesarean delivery of twin pregnancy at a gestational age of 37 weeks
      or greater may increase the risk of blood transfusion. Several uterotonic agents are used to
      prevent PPH because of uterine atony, including oxytocin, an ergot alkaloid, and
      prostaglandin. Oxytocin is the most commonly used uterotonic agent for the prevention of PPH.
      The advantage of oxytocin over other uterotonic agents is its lower cost and rapid onset of
      action. However, the disadvantage is its short duration of action.The aim of the study to
      evaluate the effects of oxytocin with or without intravenous tranexamic acid (TA) on reducing
      post-partum hemorrhage in pregnant women with twin pregnancy undergoing an elective cesarean.
