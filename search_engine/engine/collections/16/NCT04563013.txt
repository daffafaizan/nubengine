      is to recruit 130 patients diagnosed with above specific types of cancer undergoing radical
      radiotherapy/neoadjuvant/adjuvant radiotherapy. Participants were randomly assigned to the
      two groups with 65 in each group. According to treatment mode (radical radiotherapy vs
      neoadjuvant or adjuvant radiotherapy) and staging (stage I-II vs stage III), the participants
      were randomly divided into two groups: 1) sham tVNS with conventional radiotherapy and
      chemotherapy (control group); 2) tVNS with conventional radiotherapy and chemotherapy
      (intervention group). tVNS was conducted at every radiotherapy day for at least 4 weeks. tVNS
      stimulation method: in the control group, the ear clip electrodes were clamped at the
      earlobe; in the intervention group, the ear clip electrode was clamped at the tragus.
      Stimulation duration would last for 30 minutes, and the stimulation intensity was adjusted to
      the minimum value of pain threshold. The Chinese version of the Concise Fatigue Scale
      (BFI-C), the European Organization for Reasearch and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life
      Questionnaire(EORTC QLQ-C30), Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and Hospital Anxiety and
      Depression Scale (HADS) assessment, lymphocyte subpopulations,level of proinflammatory
      factors, blood routine testing and electrocardiogram testing were performed within 2 weeks
      before treatment (baseline), 4 weeks after intervention, at the end of chemoradiation, 1
      month and 4 month after the end of chemoradiation; weekly blood routine testing during
      intervention under radiotherapy and chemotherapy; the incidence of side effects and sleep
      quality score were evaluated at baseline, 2 weeks and 4 weeks after the intervention, at the
      end of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and 1 month after the end of radiotherapy. The number
      of recruited participants met the statistical requirements.
