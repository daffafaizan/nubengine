      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of navitoclax and
      sorafenib tosylate (sorafenib) in patients with advanced solid tumors. (Dose escalation
      cohort) II. To better characterize the toxicity profile of the combination of navitoclax and
      sorafenib. (Dose expansion cohort)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To identify any activity of this treatment combination in patients with metastatic cancer.
      (Dose escalation cohort) II. To seek preliminary evidence of activity of this treatment
      combination in patients with hepatoma. (Dose expansion cohort)

      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the combination of navitoclax and sorafenib induces apoptosis that
      can be detected by peripheral blood biomarker analysis. (Dose escalation cohort) II. To
      assess peripheral blood biomarkers and pharmacokinetics in a more homogenous population.
      (Dose expansion cohort) III. To determine whether treatment is associated with Mcl-1 down
      regulation in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) at the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). (Dose
      expansion cohort) IV. To assess in a preliminary fashion whether pretreatment tumor cell
      levels of Mcl-1 predict response to this regimen through serial biopsies. (Dose expansion
      cohort)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of navitoclax.

      Patients receive navitoclax orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 (days 1-28 cycle of 1
      only) and sorafenib tosylate PO twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.
