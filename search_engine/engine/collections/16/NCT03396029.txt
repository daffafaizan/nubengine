      study aims to investigate the effect of minimal, but individually tailored lifestyle advice
      and a standard leaflet on healthy lifestyle given at a colorectal cancer screening context on
      one-year changes in these behaviours in a population-based sample of men and women.

      Individuals invited to sigmoidoscopy screening in the piloting of Norwegian Bowel Cancer
      Screening are additionally invited to this lifestyle intervention study. Changes in lifestyle
      are measured by a brief lifestyle questionnaire administered at prescreening and after one
      year. The intervention to the intervention arms is given after completion of the prescreening
      lifestyle questionnaire.
