      doxorubicin and pembrolizumab in previously treated or untreated subjects with unresectable
      or metastatic soft tissue sarcoma. The secondary objectives are to assess overall survival,
      and response rate, duration of response, and progression-free survival (PFS) with this
      regimen using RECIST 1.1 criteria. The exploratory objectives are to assess PFS, overall
      response rate, duration of response, and disease control rate using the immune-related RECIST
      (irRECIST) criteria, evaluate the correlation between PD-L1 expression levels and antitumor
      activity of MK-3475, investigate other biomarkers that may correlate with tumor responses,
      and evaluate differences in tumor tissue characteristics in biopsies taken during or
      post-treatment with MK-3475 versus baseline.
