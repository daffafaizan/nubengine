      sintilimab). However, the CR rate of PD-1 antibody monotherapy is too low. Previous studies
      have demonstrated that decitabine may activate the T cells and enhance the efficacy of PD-1
      antibodies in Hodgkin Lymphoma. Thus, the investigators aim to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of sintilimab in combination with decitabine in the treatment of NK/T cell lymphoma.
