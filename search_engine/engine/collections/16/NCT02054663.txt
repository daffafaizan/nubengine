      being switched from a regimen of ticagrelor to clopidogrel. In a randomized pharmacodynamics
      study of 48 patients, we will conduct serial measurements of platelet function/inhibition
      using the Accumetrics Verifynow assay (platelet inhibition will be expressed as P2Y12
      reaction unit [PRU]). Platelet inhibition will be assessed at specific time points over the
      first 72 hours following the change in medications, which will enable us to determine whether
      patients in the 2 different strategies may be at increased ischemic or bleeding risks. We
      hypothesize that a bolus dose of clopidogrel during the switch will confer better ischemic
      protection without increasing bleeding risk for patients undergoing a switch in therapy.

      SPECIFIC AIMS:

        1. Primary Aim: To determine with platelet function testing the pharmacodynamics effects of
           a 600mg bolus dose of clopidogrel compared with no bolusing among patients being
           switched from ticagrelor to clopidogrel.

        2. To determine if patients receiving a clopidogrel bolus have improvement in ischemic
           protection relative to patients without a bolus dose.

        3. To determine if patients receiving a clopidogrel bolus may be exposed to increase
           bleeding risk relative to those without a bolus dose.
