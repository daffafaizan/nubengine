      bleeding and infection, with a potentially fatal outcome. Manual removal of placenta is the
      current standard of management of retained placenta which usually requires general or
      regional anaesthesia at a hospital and it is an invasive procedure that may lead to bleeding,
      trauma and infection. Intraumbilical injection of uterotonic agent( misoprostol) is an easy,
      non invasive procedure. A randomized clinical trial are required to determine the difference
      between two doses of misoprostol 400 versus 800 micro gram for management of retained
      placenta
