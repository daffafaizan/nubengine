      enhanced approaches to breast density notification. Usual care involves sending written
      notification along with the mammogram report; all women will receive usual care. In addition,
      some women will receive written educational materials about breast density, with or without
      interaction with a promotora (culturally congruent health educator). Study outcomes include
      short and long term assessments of psychological (anxiety, knowledge) and behavioral
      (continued mammography screening, discussion with primary care provider) outcomes. The study
      also includes qualitative inquiry and a cost analysis.
