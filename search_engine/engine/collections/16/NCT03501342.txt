      randomly assigned to three groups, the "immersive virtual reality (IVR)" group, the "dynamic
      balance training (DBT)" group and the control group. The trainings will be twice a week for 8
      weeks. In the IVR group, firstly 30 minutes of Pilates training, 10 minutes of rest and then
      20 minutes of virtual reality will be applied. In the DBT group, 20 minutes of dynamic
      balance exercises will be applied after Pilates training. In dynamic balance training,
      exercises will consist of similar movements required by virtual reality games. The control
      group will be taught relaxation exercises and will be asked to perform the exercises 2 times
      for 8 weeks at home.

      Statistical analyses will be performed using the SPSS software version 15 (SPSS Inc. Chicago,
      IL, USA). The pre-training and post-training measurements of groups will be compared with the
      Wilcoxon Test. The significance level was set at p< 0.05.
