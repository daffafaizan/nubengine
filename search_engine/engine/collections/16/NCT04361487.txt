      Meniscal Repair (NOVOSTITCH PRO) system. The meniscus is a tissue in the knee joint. The
      NOVOSTITCH PRO is used during surgery to fix meniscus tears in the knee. It is unknown
      whether fixing a meniscus tear is better than the approach of removing the tear. Data will be
      collected on participants prior to surgery, at surgery, and for 2 years after surgery.

      There are different types of tears in the meniscus. This study includes 2 of the tear types:
      horizontal cleavage and complex meniscal tears.

      Participants will be consented and enrolled in the study prior to knee surgery. Participants
      will complete surveys before surgery and data obtained from the medical record. In addition,
      standard of care x-rays and MRIs of the knee will be sent to the study. Participants will
      have their standard of care surgery to repair the knee using NOVOSTITCH PRO. Images and
      videos inside the knee during surgery may be sent to the study.

      Participants will be followed 2 years after surgery. There are a total of 5 follow-up visits:
      2 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2 years after surgery. Data will be obtained from
      medical records, surveys, MRIs, and radiographs. Up to 30 participants will have an optional
      needle endoscopy at the 6-month follow-up visit.
