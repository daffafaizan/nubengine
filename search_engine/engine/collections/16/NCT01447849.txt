    
      Specific Aim 1. To test the effect of Lubiprostone, 24 mcg twice a day (BID) for 1 week, on
      gastric mucus production in 20 asymptomatic volunteers and 20 patients with chronic
      constipation in basal conditions (primary outcome).

      Specific Aim 2. To explore the effect of Lubiprostone, 24 mcg twice a day (BID) for 1 week,
      on gastric mucus production in 20 asymptomatic volunteers and 20 patients with chronic
      constipation during stimulation of gastric secretion with pentagastrin, mimicking the
      meal-stimulated conditions (primary outcome).

      Specific Aim 3. To address the influence of Lubiprostone, 24 mcg twice a day (BID) for 1
      week, on gastric mucin production, the major component of mucus, in 20 asymptomatic
      volunteers and 20 patients with chronic constipation in basal conditions (primary outcome).

      Specific Aim 4. To test the influence of Lubiprostone, 24 mcg twice a day (BID) for 1 week,
      on gastric mucin production, the major component of mucus, in 20 asymptomatic volunteers and
      20 patients with chronic constipation during stimulation of gastric secretion with
      pentagastrin, mimicking the meal-stimulated conditions (primary outcome).

      Specific Aim 5. To explore the impact of Lubiprostone, 24 mcg twice a day (BID) for 1 week,
      on viscoelasticity of gastric mucus in 20 asymptomatic volunteers and 20 patients with
      chronic constipation in basal conditions (secondary outcome).

      Specific Aim 6. To address the impact of Lubiprostone, 24 mcg twice a day (BID) for 1 week,
      on viscoelasticity of gastric mucus in 20 asymptomatic volunteers and 20 patients with
      chronic constipation during stimulation of gastric secretion with pentagastrin, mimicking the
      meal-stimulated conditions (secondary outcome).
