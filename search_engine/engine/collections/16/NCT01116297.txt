      epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap breast reconstruction. This type of reconstruction uses
      skin and fat from the abdomen to reconstruct a new breast shape. The construct is
      vascularized through perforating arteries and veins that provide a blood supply to this
      tissue.

      Current techniques to evaluate vessel selection rely on a handheld Doppler used for
      confirmation of blood flow and perfusion; however, this modality is limited as it only
      assesses a specific point within the flap.

      The S-FLARE imaging system will be used to visualize vascularization in the DIEP flaps, and
      this study will compare measurements by the S-FLARE imaging system and the standard-of-care
      ViOptix point probe.
