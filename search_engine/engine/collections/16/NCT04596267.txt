      exploring the potential of a novel anticonvulsant, Pitolisant as a candidate medication for
      the treatment of AUD. Pitolisant is an H-3 receptor inverse agonist that is FDA-approved for
      treating narcolepsy which has been found to have effects of on alcohol craving and
      consumption in preclinical studies. The aims of this study are to test the effects of
      Pitolisant on alcohol self-administration and craving among a sample of non-treatment seeking
      heavy drinkers. The effects of 5-days of pitolisant (8.9mg) or placebo will be evaluated in a
      human laboratory using an alcohol self-administration methodology. In this within-subjects
      crossover design, heavy drinkers (N=28) will be randomized to the order of exposure
      (Pitolisant or placebo) prior to completing two alcohol self-administration trials. Subjects
      will receive a priming drink of alcohol and will have access to 8 alcoholic drinks over a
      2-hour period. The investigators anticipate that subjects will consume less alcohol during an
      alcohol self-administration trial when receiving Pitolisant compared to when they are
      receiving placebo. Significant Pitolisant-induced reductions in the quantity of alcohol
      self-administered will be considered to be an indication that this drug may have value as an
      AUD medication. This study may provide a rationale for phase II clinical studies testing
      Pitolisant with a treatment-seeking AUD population.
