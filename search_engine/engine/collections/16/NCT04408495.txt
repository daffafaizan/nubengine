      pulmonary complications will be assigned to intraoperative ventilation with high PEEP and RM
      or intraoperative mechanical ventilation with low PEEP and without RM. The primary endpoint
      will be a composite endpoint including major postoperative complications within the first
      postoperative week and death within the 28 days after surgery
