      placebo-controlled studies have shown that BTX administered by intramural injection into the
      bladder wall in patients with OAB leads to significant improvement in urodynamic parameters
      and quality of life. (Schurch 2008). On the other hand, the animal study suggests that
      intravesically applied BTX acts to decrease frequency of bladder contraction by inhibiting
      sensory mechanism in the urothelium rather than directly through inhibition of the smooth
      muscle contraction. (Khera 2005). The efficacy of intravesical BTX instillation was only
      tested in a few open label trials for overactive bladder patients whereby the clinical
      improvement observed was short-lasting with a mean duration of 6.8 weeks (Petrou 2009, Krhut
      2011). The short exposure duration of the urothelium to BTX could be one of the factors
      responsible for the lack of a sustained effect. TC-3 is a hydrogel with reverse thermal
      gelation properties that when mixed with BTX and instilled intravesically serves as the drug
      reservoir allowing for gradual release of BTX and thereby for its extended contact with
      bladder urothelium.
