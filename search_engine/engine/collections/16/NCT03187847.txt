      neurological disease in young adults. The greatest incidence of MS is found in Europe (108
      per 100'000). Over 50% of the patients with MS suffer from fatigue and reduced physical
      activity. The association between inactivity and fatigue is low in patients with mild
      disability.

      Rehabilitation in Valens includes intensive strength and endurance training. Endurance and
      walking improve in most patients, evaluated during rehabilitation with the Timed-Up and Go
      (TUG) and 2 minute walking tests (2MWT). However, Clinic Valens occasionally gets feedback
      from physical therapists in the ambulatory setting, that outcome after rehabilitation is
      sometimes poor and some patients with MS (pwMS) seem to be over trained, less mobile, more
      fatigued and need to recover for several weeks. Physical therapists in Valens know that
      training is fatiguing. If they knew how many, and which patients are more fatigued and less
      active after rehabilitation they could reduce treatment intensity and prevent overtraining.

      To the knowledge of the investigators no study evaluated changes after rehabilitation in
      fatigue, assessed with a disease specific questionnaire (FSMC), and mobility at home using
      accelerometers. Potential predictors of poor outcome are disease severity (EDSS),
      pre-rehabilitation fatigue and depression.

      The primary goal of this study therefore is to evaluate changes in fatigue and physical
      activity (step counts) in pwMS assessed before rehabilitation, after rehabilitation and at 2
      months follow-up.
