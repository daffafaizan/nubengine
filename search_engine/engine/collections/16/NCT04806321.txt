      before adulthood that warrants treatment, yet 80% of these adolescents will never receive
      care. This need-to-access gap appears to be heightened during the current coronavirus disease
      pandemic and its resulting disruptions to healthcare and education systems. Both within and
      beyond the context of the pandemic, preventive mental health interventions are positioned to
      help adolescents build and strengthen coping strategies that can preclude the emergence of
      mental health difficulties that require more resource-intensive levels of clinical care.
      Preventive mental health interventions delivered via digital platforms and within
      school-based settings might be especially scalable.

      The current school-based trial is designed to test one such strategy that harnesses
      technology to boost the scalability of adolescent mental health interventions: a brief (one
      30 minute session) digital program designed to empower adolescents (10-14 years old) to
      solve, rather than be overwhelmed by, everyday problems (Project SOLVE). Single-session
      interventions designed to help adolescents cultivate adaptive mindsets have reduced anxiety
      and depression among adolescents with and without elevated symptoms of these disorders.
      Building on this strong foundation, Project SOLVE targets these mental health challenges with
      problem solving skills-one of the most versatile, commonly used, and potent therapeutic
      techniques for adolescents.
