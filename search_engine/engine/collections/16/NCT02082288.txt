      International Islamic Center for Population Studies and Research (IICPSR), Al-Azhar
      University.

      Embryos which reached the two cell stage at 25-27 hr were classified as EC, and the remaining
      as Non Early Cleavage embryos (NEC). Embryos were assessed again at 64-68 hours post-ICSI for
      day three embryo morphology score (Loi et al.,2008). The best two or three embryos, according
      to day 3 embryo morphology were transferred. Each patient was given a score according to EIOS
      (female age, number of retrieved oocytes, number of EC embryos, number of good quality
      embryos and number of embryos transferred).
