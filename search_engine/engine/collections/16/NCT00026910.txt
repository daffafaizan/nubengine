      unknown, in vitro studies suggest that abnormalities of the cell cycle and mechanisms of
      apoptosis may play an important role. Clinical studies have now shown that p53, bcl-2 and
      tumor proliferation all have significant effects on clinical drug resistance. To further
      investigate the role of genes that control the cell cycle and apoptosis, we wish to correlate
      the expression of multiple molecular targets using immunohistochemistry and cDNA microarray
      expression profiling (including but not restricted to bcl-2, BAX, bcl-6, MIB-1, p53, p21,
      p27, p16, cyclin D1, cyclin A, cyclin E, mdm-2, cpp 32, mcl-1, EBER-1, ALK, and a panel of B,
      T and other cell lineage markers), involving these pathways, with clinical outcome following
      treatment with combination chemotherapy. All clinical data and tissue samples for this study
      will come from patients who have been previously enrolled on two protocols for the initial
      treatment of aggressive lymphomas. No new patients will be enrolled for this study.
