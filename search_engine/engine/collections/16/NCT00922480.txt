    
      Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K), a selective blocker of AT1 receptor subtype, showed the rapid and
      potent antihypertensive effect in many hypertensive models. Phase I study, Fimasartan
      (BR-A-657-K) 20mg ~ 480mg single dosing with healthy subjects, demonstrated that the
      Fimasartan(BR-A-657-K) was very safe and well tolerated. Another phase I study, Fimasartan
      (BR-A-657-K) 120mg and 360mg dosing for 7 days, also showed that Fimasartan (BR-A-657-K) was
      safe and tolerable though one temporal adverse event was observed in high dose.

      A Randomized, Double-blind, Losartan-controlled, Parallel Group Comparison Dose Titration
      Clinical Study to Evaluate the Antihypertensive Efficacy and Safety of Fimasartan
      (BR-A-657â€¢K) 60mg~120mg in Patients with Mild to Moderate Essential Hypertension.

      Approximately 480 patients will be enrolled over 12 months in 24 centers nationwide.

      After 2 weeks of placebo run-in period, all subjects will be randomized into one of the
      following 2 groups. Subjects will take test/control drug for 12 weeks of treatment period.
      And Extensin study have 12 weeks in treatment period.

      If subjects take any antihypertensive medications before screening, the subjects will have 1
      week of wash-out period.

      If the hypertension is not controlled well, there is a possibility of dose titration.
