      pregnancy women in the US. To date, the only means we have of monitoring the amount of blood
      loss during a delivery is by the physician estimating the amount. This has been shown to not
      be very accurate and leads to confusion on when and how much a women should be transfused
      during a hemorrhage. New devices have been developed over the last few years to monitor blood
      levels in a accurate and non-invasive fashion. We aim here to use a non-invasive blood
      monitoring system to evaluate normal blood loss in women undergoing scheduled cesarean
      delivery. We hope that this will allow us to create a baseline that can be used in subsequent
      studies to identify women who are losing more blood than normal so that we may intervene
      faster and avoid unnecessary morbidity.
