      of daily living. Patients across the country travel to tertiary referral centers to have this
      problem addressed. Followup is critical and can often be difficult given distances between
      patients home and their healthcare provider. Measuring postoperative outcomes requires
      accurate and reliable documentation of range of motion. Previously, the investigators have
      validated digital photography as a means of accurately measuring elbow range of motion. In
      that study, photographs were taken by a non-professional photographer. With the advance in
      personal technology, patients now have the ability to take photos themselves. This study
      seeks to validate self photography, which will ultimately improve patient follow up and
      improve clinical monitoring
