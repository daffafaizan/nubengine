      chronic kidney disease and kidney failure in nearly one third of patients with sickle cell
      disease. Some patients develop kidney damage at a young age and others show mild kidney
      damage at older ages. We do not know the natural progression of kidney damage in sickle cell
      disease patients, nor do we know who is more prone to develop severe kidney damage.
      Therefore, currently, there are no preventative measures or treatments for sickle cell
      related kidney disease. The purpose of this research study is to collect data that will help
      in assessing the progression of kidney damage in sickle cell disease, develop novel urine and
      blood tests that can predict kidney damage early, and developing treatment ideas for
      intervention and prevention of kidney damage that eventually leads to kidney failure.
