      optimize the development of peak bone mass during adolescence. Because calcium is the main
      mineral component of bone, maximizing calcium absorption and retention during adolescence is
      important to maximize peak bone mass.

      Our two research arms address two different mechanisms by which calcium absorption and
      retention may be increased:

        1. We hypothesize that a smaller particle size calcium carbonate supplement (than that
           which is now commercially available) may be better absorbed and lead to higher calcium
           retention in adolescents.

        2. We hypothesize that vitamin D supplementation will increased calcium absorption and
           retention in adolescents.

      Subjects will be assigned to one of the two research arms.

      1)Small and large particle size calcium supplements or placebo or 2) calcium supplements with
      or without vitamin D supplements will be given to subjects during two 3-week study periods in
      which subjects live on-site.

      Calcium absorption will be measured by parathyroid hormone suppression after a calcium load
      and by stable calcium isotope in some subjects.

      Calcium retention will be measured by calcium intake minus calcium excretion.
