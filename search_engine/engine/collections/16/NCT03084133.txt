      patients with CRC or advanced adenoma. In the high-risk CCR population defined by a family
      history at the first stage of CRC or advanced adenoma before age 60, total colonoscopy is the
      recommended screening test. In France, the rate of screening colonoscopy in this population
      at high risk of CRC is insufficient, which limits the effectiveness of this targeted
      screening.
