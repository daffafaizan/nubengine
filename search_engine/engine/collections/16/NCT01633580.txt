      activity. It offers novel and effective treatment option for potential normal responder
      patients undergoing ovarian stimulation with GnRH antagonist co-treatment for IVF or in vitro
      fertilisation resulting in a high ongoing pregnancy rate, equal to that achieved with daily
      rFSH. Normally, this medication is started on day 2 of the cycle. In the present randomised
      trial, we want to evaluate whether this agent can be clinically used when started on day 4 of
      the cycle.
