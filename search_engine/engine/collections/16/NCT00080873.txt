        -  Compare the efficacy of Traumeel® S vs placebo in reducing the severity and duration of
           chemotherapy-induced (with or without total body irradiation) mucositis in pediatric
           patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the safety of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are stratified according to treatment with total body irradiation during conditioning
      chemotherapy (yes vs no), type of transplantation (autologous vs allogeneic), and
      participating institution (COG vs foreign). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral Traumeel® S mouth rinse 5 times daily beginning on day -1
           before transplantation.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo mouth rinse 5 times daily beginning on day -1
           before transplantation.

      In both arms, treatment continues until day 20 post-transplantation OR until mucositis
      resolves to Walsh score ≤ 1 for 2 consecutive days.

      Patients are followed until day 100 post-transplantation.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 180 patients (90 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this
      study within 2 years.
