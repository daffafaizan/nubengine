      many factors that can cause high blood pressure, including family history and genetic traits,
      kidney disease, stress, diabetes, and diet. If left untreated, high blood pressure can
      increase one's risk for coronary heart disease (CHD), stroke, heart attack, and heart
      failure. While high blood pressure can be managed with medication, people receiving
      medication treatment for high blood pressure are still variably at risk for CHD and other
      cardiovascular conditions. This risk variation may stem from varying drug reactions that are
      likely due to genetics. This study will use genetic analysis to determine whether particular
      genes interact with high blood pressure medications to modify the risk of certain
      cardiovascular diseases.

      This is a continuation study to the antihypertensive and lipid-lowering treatment to prevent
      heart attack trial (ALLHAT), which included a randomized trial of the four high blood
      pressure drugs chlorthalidone, amlodipine, lisinopril, and doxazosin. Using samples from
      ALLHAT participants, this study will analyze the interactions of candidate gene pathways of
      relevance with medications from the ALLHAT study. Researchers will examine both single DNA
      building blocks and multiple genes in the candidate gene pathways and determine whether their
      interaction with the ALLHAT drugs modifies the risk of cardiovascular outcomes. Researchers
      will perform genetic analysis on 96 genetic markers using structured association testing
      (SAT) and false discovery rate (FDR) methods. These methods will control for population
      stratification and multiple testing. Finally, the study will establish a mechanism for other
      researchers to continue further analysis of the genetic variants examined in this study.
