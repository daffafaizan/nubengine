      I. Estimate the overall clinical response rate (complete and partial responses) in patients
      with previously treated ovarian epithelial, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer
      treated with oxaliplatin and topotecan.

      II. Determine the toxic effects in patients treated with this regimen.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the time to progression and overall clinical response duration in patients
      treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      response to prior platinum therapy (resistant vs sensitive).

      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 15 and topotecan IV continuously
      on days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 30 days.
