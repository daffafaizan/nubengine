    
      The protocol is designed to evaluate the following objectives:

        1. The prevalence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and human herpes 6 virus DNA in
           inflamed intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn's colitis and ulcerative colitis
           compared to their prevalence in healthy intestinal mucosa of patients not affected by
           these conditions;

        2. To evaluate the prevalence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and human herpes 6
           virus DNA in the intestinal mucosa of patients with Crohn's colitis and ulcerative
           colitis compared to that in inflamed mucosa caused by other conditions (non specific
           colitis);

        3. To compare the prevalence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and human herpes 6
           virus DNA in inflamed and healthy tissue in the same patients with Crohn's colitis and
           ulcerative colitis;

        4. To determine whether the presence of cytomegalovirus, Epstein Barr virus and human
           herpes 6 virus DNA detected by nPCR correlates with immunohistochemical detection of
           viral protein in colonic tissue.

        5. To determine whether the relative viral quantity of CMV, EBV or HHV-6 is related to
           severity of disease activity.
