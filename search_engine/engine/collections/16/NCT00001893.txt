      bronchoprovocation model of atopic asthma. The goal of this study is to assess whether
      inhibition of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) bioactivity can attenuate airway inflammation in
      mild-to-moderate allergic asthmatics. This protocol will utilize a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial design. TNF bioactivity will be inhibited via systemic
      administration (e.g., subcutaneous injection) of a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the
      extracellular ligand- binding domain of the 75-kilodalton TNF receptor linked to the Fc
      portion of human IgG1 (TNFR:Fc, Immunex). The data generated by this study will address the
      utility of anti-TNF therapy for patients with asthma.
