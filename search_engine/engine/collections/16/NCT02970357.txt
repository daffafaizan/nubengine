    
      Structuring a therapeutic education program for patients with a chronic disease was the
      initiative of the French High Health Authority in June 2007.

      The Prevention and Care of Pediatric Obesity and Pediatric Diabetes Organization of Mulhouse
      is a partner of the Mulhouse Hospital. Besides the usual care given at the hospital of
      Mulhouse for patients with a type 1 diabetes, both organizations also provide therapeutic
      education to these patients.

      Each therapeutic education program is organized according to the patient's age. They can also
      be organized in a group or individually.

      The aim of the therapeutic education is to help the young patients to cope with diabetes in
      their daily activities. Therapeutic education is known to bring good results for patients
      with diabetes, but there is no studies in France for children and teens with a type 1
      diabetes.
