        -  Compare disease-free survival of patients with resected primary renal cell carcinoma at
           high- or intermediate-risk of relapse treated with a placebo for 3 years vs a placebo
           for 2 years and sorafenib tosylate for 1 year vs sorafenib tosylate for 3 years.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, open-label, multicenter
      study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily for 3 years in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily for 1 year and oral placebo
           twice daily for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily for 3 years in the absence
           of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients in arms I and II with progressive disease may cross over and receive treatment in
      arm III.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
