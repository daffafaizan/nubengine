      responsible for the metabolism of erythromycin and when given together, the possibility
      exists that one drug inhibits the metabolism of the other leading to an increase in plasma
      concentration. The magnitude of this interaction is not known. It is therefore important to
      define this effect because diltiazem is a drug that is used commonly to treat hypertension,
      angina and atrial fibrillation and these patients may be given erythromycin for the treatment
      of intercurrent bacterial infections.
