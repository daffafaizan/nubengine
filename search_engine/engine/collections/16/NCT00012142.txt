      cancer. II. Determine the effects of CCI-779 on prostate-specific antigen levels in these
      patients. III. Assess the pharmacokinetic parameters of CCI-779 in these patients. IV. Assess
      the possible pharmacodynamic relationship of CCI-779 with clinical response in these
      patients. V. Determine the impact of CCI-779 on the quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients
      are randomized to 1 of 4 arms. Arm I: Patients receive low-dose CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes
      weekly. Arm II: Patients receive high-dose CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes weekly. Arm III:
      Patients receive low-dose placebo IV over 30 minutes weekly. Arm IV: Patients receive
      high-dose placebo IV over 30 minutes weekly. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who develop progressive disease while
      receiving placebo may cross over to the equivalent dose of CCI-779. Quality of life is
      assessed at baseline; at weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, and 36; and at final/cross-over visit. Patients
      are followed every 3 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 150 patients will be accrued for this study.
