    
      This clinical trial is a multicenter, open label, randomized controlled study in cirrhotic
      chronic hepatitis B patients with low-level viremia beyond treatment indications by current
      guidelines.

      Approximately 400 subjects meeting eligibility criteria will be enrolled and randomized (1:1)
      to Treatment Arm (A) or Observational Arm (B), as below:

        -  Treatment Arm (A): 200 subjects, TAF 25mg once daily with food for 3 years

        -  Observational Arm (B): 200 subjects, best supportive care for 3 years This study was
           designed to randomly assign treatment groups to subjects in order to prevent biases that
           may be intervened, and to increase comparability between the groups. Since HBeAg status
           could affect the clinical outcome in the eligible subjects, randomization will be
           stratified by HBeAg status (positive or negative) at screening at a 1:1 ratio by using
           centralized stratified block randomization.

      Both groups (i.e. Treatment Arm and Observational Arm) are scheduled to be followed up to 3
      years. When subjects in the Observational Arm group meets the treatment indications by
      current guidelines (HBV DNA â‰¥2,000 IU/mL or progressed to decompensated cirrhosis with
      detectable HBV DNA level), antiviral treatment will be initiated.

      The primary endpoint will be analyzed with Kaplan-Meier methods and compared by the log-rank
      test between the two groups. Between-group comparisons of continuous or categorical baseline
      characteristics will be conducted using Student's t-test, Chi-square test or Fisher's exact
      test, as appropriate.
