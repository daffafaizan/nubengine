      we will trace deuterium labeled ß-carotene in intrinsically labeled spirulina, which is
      harvested from a hydroponic system. In the mean time, we will track 13C10 labeled vitamin A
      in humans. In this way we will determine absorption of ß-carotene from spirulina matrix and
      the conversion of the spirulina ß-Carotene to retinol. This will enable us quantitatively
      determine the vitamin A equivalence of spirulina.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To determine labeled ß-C blood response kinetics following an acute dose of
           intrinsically labeled spirulina;

        2. To determine labeled retinol blood response from the intrinsically labeled spirulina;

        3. To determine 13C10 retinol blood response from the isotope reference material 13C10
           retinyl acetate;

        4. To determine s spirulina-vitamin A equivalence.
