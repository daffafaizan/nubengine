      of Pentalogy of Cantrell (POC) or other related syndromes. We will be looking for any
      exomic/genomic mutations that could be associated with this syndrome. We have produced a
      mouse model with a mutation in the gene encoding nonmuscle myosin IIB which exhibit problems
      with ventral wall closure, including extrathoracic location of the heart (ectopia cordis) and
      defects in the abdominal wall with protrusion of the guts and liver. These mice have severe
      defects in both the heart and brain, and resemble humans born with POC, who manifest these
      same abnormalities, and so we take a special interest in mutations in nonmuscle myosin
      proteins.
