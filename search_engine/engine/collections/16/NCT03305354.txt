      physical activity, functioning, or social engagement over and above self-management use of a
      CBTI app alone, the investigators will randomly assign post-9/11 veteran participants with
      chronic, functionally impairing insomnia to either (1) a self-management-based use of an app
      based on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTI; CBTI alone arm) or to (2) a
      self-management-based use of the CBTI app + a physical activity (PA) intervention (CBTI + PA)
      that includes PA monitoring (via a Fitbit device) with individualized goal-setting to
      encourage increased daily steps across the 6 weeks. For the PA goal, the investigators will
      attempt to get all participants to at least the typical 10,000 daily steps goal cited as a
      strong predictor of positive health outcomes (Choi, Pak, & Choi, 2007). The investigators
      will tailor the step goals based on the person's initial level of daily steps, and increment
      step goals weekly to maximize motivation and enhance the likelihood that the participant can
      meet the goal.
