      University of Innsbruck for evaluation of unclear glucosuria in combination with normal blood
      glucose levels. The patient suffered from recurrent urinary tract infections and increased
      urinary frequency, showed a physiological hemoglobin A1c and no further signs of renal
      dysfunction. Sequencing of the SLC5A2 coding region confirmed that the patient was compound
      heterozygous for two SLC5A2 mutations. The patient is a mother of five healthy children which
      are willing to take part in the test. The children show a 50/50 distribution of the mother's
      mutations. The MMTT will take place after 48 hours of alcohol, sport abstinence and an
      overnight fasting period. The patients will be given 6 ml/kg body weight of a standardized
      liquid meal. Blood samples will be collected 10 minutes before consumption of the meal, at
      the time point of consumption and 15, 30, 60, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 minutes after
      consumption. At each time point six blood tubes will be taken, except at time point -10 and
      240 minutes, there is one sample more collected. The investigators aim to assess glucagon,
      insulin, c-peptide, gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP), Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1),
      Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) levels.

      Glucose tolerance will be assessed by using the 4 hours area under the curve (AUC) for
      glucose. To evaluate the beta-cell function the 4h-AUC's for insulin, c-peptide and the
      4h-AUC insulin:glucose ratio will be calculated and compared. The calculation of the
      alpha-cell function will be performed with the AUC of glucagon and the AUC glucagon/glucose
      ratio. GIP, GLP-1 and GLP-2 will be determined using the AUC. The AUC's will be calculated by
      the trapezoidal method.
