      with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium in patients with advanced solid tumors.
      II. Determine the toxicities associated with this combination regimen in this patient
      population. III. Evaluate the clinical response to this combination regimen in these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of docetaxel and fluorouracil (5-FU). Patients
      receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1, cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2, and leucovorin
      calcium IV immediately followed by 5-FU IV on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in
      the absence of disease progression. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of
      docetaxel and 5-FU until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined
      as the dose preceding that at which more than 1 of 3 or 1 of 5 patients experience dose
      limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years.
