      patients. We attempt to apply such an orthosis on stroke patients to aid in regaining
      movement from severe paralytic arm by helping the patients to support their wrist and finger
      in a functional position for grasping. The patient is then encouraged to produce voluntary
      movement from the severe paralytic arm to transport an object (ball) from place to place
      either in sitting or standing position.

      Since intensive arm usage is associated with neuro reorganisation, we propose designing a
      program with the neuro hand to encourage usage of the paralysed hand and help overcome the
      barriers of poor motivation and lack of arm usage through self practice program.
