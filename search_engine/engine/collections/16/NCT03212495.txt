      ketamine and alfa2- adrenergic agonists for prevention and treatment of pain after knee
      surgeries.

      Dexmedetomidine is a potent and highly selective alfa2-adrenoreceptor agonist. It has
      sedative-hypnotic, anxiolytic, analgesic, anesthetic and sympatholytic effects.
      Intra-articular dexmedetomidine was used in several studies to enhance postoperative
      analgesia after knee arthroscopy with an increased time to first analgesic request and a
      decreased need for postoperative analgesia Neostigmine is an anticholinesterase and also has
      antinociceptive effects when administered intrathecally or peripherally.
