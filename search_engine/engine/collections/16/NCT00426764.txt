    
      This is a Phase II, non-randomized, open-label, single-arm trial. This study is designed on
      the basis of complete response (CR) or unconfirmed CR [CR(u)] as the measure of efficacy,
      based on the best overall response of each patient. The sample size of 65 patients evaluable
      for efficacy would yield lower 95% confidence limits on the rate of CR + CR(u) that would
      range from 2.2% to 7.7%, if the observed rate of CR + CR(u) ranges from 8% to 15%. The study
      was amended to include an Extension Phase, during which patients at non-US sites who are
      benefitting from treatment can continue to receive romidepsin. The Extension Study Phase is
      active in EU countries where currently no Marketing Authorisation exists for romidepsin.
      Patients may remain on study until progressive disease occurs or they withdraw their consent
      and only serious adverse events and study drug administration data will continue to be
      collected and reported for these patients.
