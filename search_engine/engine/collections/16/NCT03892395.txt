      widespread, with an estimated 1 in 2 women and 1 in 5 men over the age of 50 years expected
      to have an osteoporotic fracture. The associated health care costs are considerable and
      growing as the population of older adults increases. Furthermore, osteoporotic fractures are
      associated with loss of independence and risk of further fractures and health problems for
      the individual. Given these negative impacts, new approaches to help maintain better bone
      health in older age are urgently needed.

      Vitamin D and calcium have well established protective roles, however, other evidence links
      certain B vitamins with bone health. This study will investigate the effect of B-vitamin
      supplementation over a two year period at two centres (UCD and University of Ulster)
