      criteria were Lidocaine allergy or pre-planned general anesthesia.

      Patients were randomized into 6 groups: (1) nerve block with 5 ml 1% lidocaine for each
      neurovascular bundle + perianal topical application of 10 ml 5% lidocaine cream; (2) as in
      (1) plus application of 10 ml 5% lidocaine cream evenly on rectal walls. For each approach
      exposure times of 5, 10 and 20 minutes were allowed, all together 6 groups plus a control
      group of patients who received periprostatic nerve block only. A 0-10 Visual analogue scale
      (VAS) was filled by the patients at 5 time points: immediately after probe insertion, during
      probe manipulation and prostate assessment, immediately following neurovascular bundle nerve
      blockage, after prostate biopsies and a global pain estimation of the procedure.
