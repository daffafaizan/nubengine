      that require surgical irrigation and debridement. The aim of this project is to perform a
      prospective, randomized study evaluating the VAC negative pressure device as a treatment for
      draining hematomas. We will also analyze the cost of treating a hematoma with a VAC compared
      with currently employed treatments. Additionally, we will document the incidence of infection
      of the hematoma with and without use of the VAC device.

      Patients who have a draining hematoma five days following surgery and who give informed
      consent to enter the study will be randomized into two groups. Group A will be patients
      treated with a pressure dressing and observation, which is the most common current method of
      treatment. Group B will be patients treated with a VAC negative pressure device. Patients
      will be carefully monitored for continued drainage by evaluating the wounds and dressings
      clinically. Patients in either group that are still draining at ten days following surgery
      will be taken to the operating room for irrigation and debridement. Patients in either group
      who develop infection will be immediately treated with irrigation and debridement.
