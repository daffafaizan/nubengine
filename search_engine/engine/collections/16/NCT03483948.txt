    
      There are two stages in this study: a dose-escalation stage (stage 1) and a dose-expansion
      stage (stage 2).

      Dose-escalation stage (stage 1):

      The conventional 3+3 design (3 patients per dose cohort, with the potential to add additional
      3 patients to the same cohort to further evaluate toxicity) will be applied for dose
      escalation and maximum tolerated dosage determination. Approximately 12 to 18 dose limited
      toxicities evaluable patients will be enrolled. A dose of HMPL-523 up to 800mg will be taken
      orally once daily continuously through a 28-day Cycle of study treatment. Azacitidine will be
      administered subcutaneously, beginning on Day 1 through Day 7 of each Cycle.

      Dose-expansion stage (stage 2):

      This phase is to further evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary efficacy of
      HMPL-523 in combination with Azacitidine in approximately 28 previously untreated elderly
      patients with AML. Patients will receive HMPL-523 in combination with Azacitidine in a 28-day
      cycle continuously until disease progression/relapse, death, or intolerable toxicity,
      whichever comes first.
