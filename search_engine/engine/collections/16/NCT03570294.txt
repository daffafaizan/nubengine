    
      Atosiban (1-(3-mercaptopropanoic
      acid)-2-(O-ethyl-D-tyrosine)-4-L-threonine-8-L-ornithine-oxytocin) is licensed for clinical
      use in women suffering from threatened premature birth and is widely used in clinical
      practice in Europe because of its low side effect profile. The impact of Atosiban on
      pregnancy outcomes in women has been investigated in recent years and the research has shown
      its ability to reduce intracytoplasmic calcium release and downregulate prostaglandin
      synthesis as oxytocin receptor antagonist. While a role of Atosiban in the modulation of
      myometrial contractility is well-described, its effect on many other functions is not so well
      known.

      The serum and plasma samples take for the measurement of total oxidant status (TOS), total
      antioxidant status (TAS), level of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), and carbonyl and thiol groups will
      be stored at -70Â°C in aliquots for subsequent biochemical analysis and processed within two
      months.
