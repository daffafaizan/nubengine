      I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of
      intratumoral (IT)-Hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein (hu14.18-IL2) in subjects with advanced melanoma
      (Phase IA)

      II. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of IT-hu14.18-IL2 when given alone (Phase IA)

      III. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of
      IT-hu14.18-IL2 after receiving palliative radiation therapy (RT) in subjects with advanced
      melanoma (Phase IB)

      IV. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of palliative RT with
      IT-hu14.18-IL2 (Phase IB)

      V. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of
      IT-hu14.18-IL2 after receiving palliative RT and in combination with nivolumab in subjects
      with advanced melanoma (Phase IC)

      VI. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of palliative RT, nivolumab and
      IT-hu14.18-IL2 (Phase IC)

      VII. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) of
      IT-hu14.18-IL2 after receiving palliative RT and in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab
      in subjects with advanced melanoma (Phase ID)

      VIII. Evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of palliative RT, nivolumab,
      ipilimumab and IT-hu14.18-IL2 (Phase ID)

      IX. Evaluate local and systemic objective tumor responses to treatment with IT-hu14.18-IL2 in
      combination with palliative RT, nivolumab, and ipilimumab (Phase ID)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), clinical benefit (CB,
      defined as complete response (CR) + partial response (PR) + stable disease (SD)) and duration
      of response to hu14.18-IL2 in combination with RT, nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      II. Evaluate pathologic (tissue) evidence of immune response at the injection site and
      untreated sites.

      III. Evaluate PFS, CB and duration of response to hu14.18-IL2 in combination with palliative
      RT, nivolumab and ipilimumab based on resistance to prior treatment with anti-CTLA-4 and/or
      anti PD1/PD-L1 antibody.

      IV. Evaluate serial serum samples to determine the pharmacokinetics of hu14.18-IL2
      administered intratumorally.

      V. Evaluate each subject's tumor cells for expression of GD2 and PD-L1, and determine if
      either antitumor activity or selected treatment-associated biologic effects are more likely
      for tumors that are GD2+ then GD2- and PD-L1+ than PD-L1-.

      VI. Evaluate whether PD-L1 expression is induced or augmented from baseline following
      initiation of treatment (by comparing serial biopsies).

      VII. Evaluate the immunologic activation induced in vivo by IT-hu14.18-IL2, addressed by in
      vitro cellular, serologic and flow cytometry immune assays.

      VIII. Evaluate for histological evidence of antitumor activity based on the presence of
      necrotic tumor cells, inflammatory infiltrate, cellular phenotype of infiltrate, and presence
      of hu14.18-IL2 within the tumor at selected post-treatment timepoints.

      IX. Evaluate circulating tumor cells, exosomes, endogenous antibodies, and/or
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) as exploratory biomarkers associated with clinical response to
      IT-hu14.18-IL2 in combination with RT, nivolumab and ipilimumab.

      X. Evaluate serial peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples to monitor the induction
      of T cell responses to melanoma-associated antigens.

      XI. Evaluate objective tumor responses, both locally and systemically (by immune-related
      response criteria), in Phases IA, IB and IC of this trial (involving IT-hu14.18-IL2 alone and
      in combinations with palliative RT, and with palliative RT and nivolumab, respectively).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein.

      PHASE IA: Participants receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein intratumorally (IT) once daily (QD)
      on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 21 days for cycles 1-4. Participants who are eligible
      may continue to receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein maintenance therapy QD on days 1-3
      beginning with cycle 5. Maintenance cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. A total of 9-18 participants will be
      enrolled in 3 escalating dose levels to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD)/Maximum
      Administered Dose (MAD) of hu14.18-IL2 in Phase IA.

      PHASE IB: Participants undergo palliative RT on days -8 to -4 of cycle 1 only. Participants
      also receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein IT as in phase IA. Treatment with hu14.18-IL2 repeats
      every 21 days for cycles 1-4. Participants who are eligible may continue to receive
      hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein maintenance therapy QD on days 1-3 beginning with cycle 5.
      Maintenance cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. The MTD/MAD of IT-hu14.18-IL2 following palliative RT
      will be determined starting 1 dose level below the Phase IA determined MTD/MAD of
      IT-hu14.18-IL2 up to the Phase IA determined MTD/MAD.

      PHASE IC: Participants undergo palliative RT on days -8 to -4 of cycle 1 only. Nivolumab (3
      mg/kg) is given every 2 weeks for up to 1 year with the initial dose given between day -7 and
      day -1 of cycle 1. Participants also receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein IT as in phase IA.
      Treatment with hu14.18-IL2 repeats every 21 days for cycles 1-4. Participants who are
      eligible may continue to receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein maintenance therapy QD on days
      1-3 beginning with cycle 5. Maintenance cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The MTD/MAD of IT-hu14.18-IL2
      following palliative RT in combination with nivolumab will be determined starting 1 dose
      level below the Phase IB determined MTD/MAD of IT-hu14.18-IL2 up to the Phase IB determined
      MTD/MAD.

      PHASE ID: Participants undergo palliative RT on days -8 to -4 of cycle 1 only. Nivolumab (1
      mg/kg) in combination with ipilimumab (3 mg/kg) is given every 3 weeks for 4 cycles with the
      initial dose given between day -7 and day -1 of cycle 1. Following 4 cycles, no additional
      ipilimumab will be administered. Following cycle 4, maintenance nivolumab (3 mg/kg) can be
      given for up to one year. Participants also receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein IT as in phase
      IA. Treatment with hu14.18-IL2 repeats every 21 days for cycles 1-4. Participants who are
      eligible may continue to receive hu14.18-IL2 fusion protein maintenance therapy QD on days
      1-3 beginning with cycle 5. Maintenance cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 13 cycles in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The MTD/MAD of IT-hu14.18-IL2
      following palliative RT in combination with nivolumab and ipilimumab will be determined
      starting 1 dose level below the Phase IC determined MTD/MAD of IT-hu14.18-IL2 up to the Phase
      IC determined MTD/MAD. A total of 28 participants will be enrolled at the Phase ID MTD/MAD of
      IT-hu14.18-IL2.
