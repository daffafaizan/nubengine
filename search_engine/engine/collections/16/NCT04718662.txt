      infant using primarily either her own milk or donor milk. Half of study infants will receive
      2'-FL in their milk and half will receive the same quantity of placebo (dextrose) added to
      their milk. The first day the infant receives the test product (2'-FL or placebo) will be
      designated as study day 1 (SDAY1). Infants will be followed until study dat 66 (SDAY66) or
      hospital discharge, whichever comes first. The primary outcomes will be weight, length, and
      head circumference growth from the start of the trial to its completion. The secondary
      outcome will be time to achieving full enteral feeding (in days). Exploratory outcomes will
      be neurobehavioral test scores obtained from a standardized Newborn Intensive Care Unit
      (NICU) Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) examination at 34 to 35 weeks corrected
      gestational age (GA); fecal calprotectin; and fecal microbiome.
