      often used by occupational therapists as a way of developing fine motor control and visual
      motor integration in children. While there is anecdotal evidence to support this
      intervention, preliminary results in healthy children showed no differences in graphical
      quality while drawing on vertical or horizontal surfaces. This however was not investigated
      in children with graphomotor impairments.

      The goal of this study is to determine whether movements produced on a vertical surface
      differ in their performance level and muscle activation patterns compared to movements
      produced on a horizontal surface.

      The investigators predict that the level of performance on the vertical surface will exceed
      the level of performance on the horizontal surface. Additionally, the investigators
      hypothesize that the proximal muscles will be more activated and fatigued (in longer tasks)
      while drawing on the vertical surface, while the distal muscle will be more activated and
      fatigued while drawing on the horizontal surface.
