      that > 2 million individuals were living with LLA in North America with an annual estimated
      150,000 incident cases. Over 50% of these procedures are considered major, with 28% of
      individuals having a transtibial (TT) or below knee amputation and 26% having a transfemoral
      (TF) or above knee amputation. The WiiNWalk is designed to evaluate whether this intervention
      does improve the walking capacity of older adults through a series of balancing and other
      physical activities using the Wii balance board.

      An improved walking capacity (ie: being able to walk a longer distance) may effect balance,
      strength, and fitness components that are critical to improve prosthetic walking. The ability
      to walk a longer distance may effect a person's lifestyle as it allows the individual to move
      around his/her environment independently which in turn impacts ones choice of daily and
      social activities and participation, and therefore providing them with more mobility, freedom
      and choice.

      This study focuses on older adults because, according to Canadian Institute of Health
      Information data, 50-74 year old were 17 times more likely to have a LLA and individuals aged
      â‰¥ 75 were 36 times more likely to have a LLA.The primary reason for this exponential
      age-related increased incidence is the late stage effects of chronic diseases such as
      diabetes and vascular disease that are common in older adults.

      If as anticipated, the WiiFit proves to increase walking capacity, it will provide a low cost
      method for those with LLA to have an accessible system that, due to the weight-shifting,
      balance and aerobic training nature of the Wii games, will serve as a therapeutic agent for
      rehabilitation.
