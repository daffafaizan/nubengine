      platelet concentrate protocol, named Leucocyte and platelet-rich Fibrin (L-PRF), has been
      developed in France. Research has shown positive results using L-PRF during implant
      placement, as improving soft tissue healing and bone formation, leading to higher esthetic
      level and greater implant stability. The aim of this study is to evaluate if the use of PRF
      associated to implant placement in esthetic area presents superior aesthetic result and soft
      tissue thickness increase when compared to implant placement without graft. Forty-two
      patients requiring single implant placement in the esthetic area of the maxilla will be
      randomly divided into test group (implant + L-PRF) and control group (implant without graft).
      Surgical procedures will be performed by a single operator. The rates of soft tissue
      thickness, esthetic and comfort will be evaluated at baseline and 3 months after the
      procedure.
