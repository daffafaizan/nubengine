      patients with carcinoma of the prostate who are considered at high risk of relapse and
      receive long-term adjuvant zoladex (ZDX) vs. no adjuvant treatment following neoadjuvant
      ZDX/flutamide and radiotherapy. II. Compare sexual function in patients treated with these
      two regimens.

      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Neoadjuvant Antiandrogen Therapy and Releasing Factor
      Agonist Therapy plus Radiotherapy. Flutamide, FLUT, NSC-147834; and Zoladex, ZDX, NSC-606864;
      plus external-beam irradiation using megavoltage equipment with energies of at least 4 MV (at
      least 6 MV preferred). Arm II: Neoadjuvant Antiandrogen Therapy and Releasing Factor Agonist
      Therapy plus Radiotherapy followed by Adjuvant Releasing Factor Agonist Therapy. FLUT; and
      ZDX; plus external-beam irradiation using equipment as in Arm I; followed by ZDX.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 1,508 patients will be accrued over 2 years.
