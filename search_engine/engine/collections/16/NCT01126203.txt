      have a similar long-term response rates when either ALT or SLT is performed. Some authors
      have considered that there is a risk of IOP elevation in the immediate post laser period with
      ALT or SLT as a complication to be related to denser angle pigmentation (20,48). (46) No
      long-term analysis comparing response rates of both laser treatments in these types of
      patients has been done.

      Primary objective is to determine which laser therapy has more IOP lowering effect as primary
      or adjunctive treatment in eyes diagnosed with ocular hypertension and glaucoma associated to
      PXF. Response rates will be compared between groups at long-term.

      Secondary objective is to determine the relationship between the type of laser therapy
      performed and angle pigmentation, number of applications, and amount of energy used with age,
      number and type of medication used post laser and phakic status.
