    
      This Phase II multi-country trial was conducted as a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial in 650 HIV-positive adults with no evidence of active TB disease.
      Subjects were stratified at the time of randomization by whether or not they were receiving
      anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and then randomized in a ratio of 1:1 to receive either
      MVA85A/AERAS-485 at 1 x 10^8 plaque forming units (pfu) or placebo (Candin). Randomization of
      each group was capped so that at least 50% of the subjects randomized were receiving ART at
      randomization. Subjects were to receive an intradermal injection of MVA85A/AERAS-485 or
      placebo on Study Day 0, followed 6-9 months later by a booster injection of MVA85A/AERAS-485
      or placebo. The minimum follow-up period for each subject was 6 months after their last
      vaccination, during which subjects were followed for safety, clinical signs and symptoms of
      TB, and immunogenicity. All subjects were to continue to be followed every 3 months until the
      last subject enrolled had been followed for 6 months after their last vaccination.
