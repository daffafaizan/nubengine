    
      To compare between Biphasic Intermittent Positive Airway Pressure (BIPAP) ventilation and
      Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV) mode in patients with multiple fracture ribs as
      regard:

        -  Resting Energy Expenditure

        -  Oxygenation

        -  Stability of Physiological Status as cardiovascular activity

        -  cardiac output

        -  arterial blood gas measurement including [ blood PH, arterial oxygen tension, arterial
           carbon dioxide tension, bicarbonate level and base deficit]

        -  lung and chest compliance

        -  Length of intensive care unit stay.

        -  The ICU mortality rate.

        -  The development of major complications as nosocomial infection (hospital acquired
           pneumonia and ventilator associated pneumonia), major atelectasis and pneumothorax.
