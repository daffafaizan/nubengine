    
      Observational study involving the release of genome-wide expression data allowing
      participating institutions to pair these data with clinical treatment and outcome data for
      patients in whom Decipher testing was performed. Through these collaborations, the GRID
      database population will be used to characterize the genomics of cancer and discover new gene
      expression signatures that may be useful for expanding the current understanding of the
      biology of the disease.
