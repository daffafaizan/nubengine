      The conventional treatment includes medication, physical therapy, bracing and steroid
      injection. Anterior talofibular ligament is the most injured ligament in ankle sprain.
      Although the response of acute ligament sprain is usually quickly, treatment of chronic
      ligament sprain is difficult. Chronic pain and ankle instability is the most common symptom
      in chronic ankle sprain. Dextrose prolotherapies been used for treating soft tissue injury
      such as osteoarthritis, tendinopathy and ligament sprain. However, there is not randomized
      control trial for hypertonic dextrose injection to chronic ankle sprain.

      Methods: Investigators will include 40 ankle sprain patients who have ankle pain or
      instability sensation more than 3 months. Ultrasonography will be done for confirm ligament
      injury. Participants will be randomized into two groups. Dextrose injection group will accept
      dextrose 15% injection to tendon and enthesis. Otherwise, investigators will do subcutaneous
      sham injection to control group. Investigators will measure pain threshold and peak pressure
      by algometer, the degree of ankle instability by ultrasound, the proprioception by single leg
      standing, and foot and ankle questionnaire. The examination will be done before injection,
      immediately after injection, 1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks after injection.To our hypothesis,
      investigators suggest dextrose prolotherapy injection could decrease pain and improved
      proprioception.
