      QuantiFERON-TB gold in tube (QFT) and two-step (0, 4weeks) TST for outbreak investigation. We
      perform QFT at 0, 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after initial investigation for soldiers with negative
      QFT results, and soldiers with positive QFT and normal LDCT took isoniazid and rifampin for 3
      months as treatment of latent TB.
