      immediately after surgery before any significant weight loss. In addition, a growing number
      of patients have been recognized with life-threatening hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia several
      years following their surgery. While the mechanisms by which RYGB improves glucose metabolism
      or alters islet cell function in patients after RYGB are not understood, recent studies
      suggest that increased secretion of GI hormones, primarily glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1),
      as well as alteration in neural activity may contribute to enhanced insulin secretion in
      general, and to a greater extent in patients with hypoglycemia. The proposed research is
      designed to address the role of RYGB on insulin secretion by evaluating the contribution of
      stimulatory factors (neural and GI hormone) on islet cell function and the islet cell
      responsiveness to the physiologic stimulatory factors, in RYGB patients with and without
      hypoglycemia and non-operated controls
