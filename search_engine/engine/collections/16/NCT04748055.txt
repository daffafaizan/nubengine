      risk for future exacerbation from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC)
      Children's Allergy and Asthma Center in Raleigh, NC. Participants will complete 13 study
      visits: an initial in-person visit (the study team will make every attempt to coordinate this
      visit with a scheduled clinic visit) and 12 monthly virtual follow up visits. Participants
      will be asked to use an at home spirometer once daily in the evening and will also complete
      an electronic asthma survey each night. Participants will undergo collection of nasal
      epithelial lining fluid (NELF) at the baseline visit. During the 12 months of study,
      participants will self-collect NELF samples if certain prespecified criteria for asthma
      exacerbation are met. Samples will be analyzed for IL-1Î², interleukin receptor antagonist
      (IL-1RA) and other mediators associated with acute asthma exacerbation. Virtual follow up
      visits using a video platform will occur monthly for 12 months. Participants will self-report
      healthcare utilization and prescription for systemic corticosteroids. Spirometry and symptom
      survey data will be matched to subject-reported asthma exacerbations. The study design is
      adapted to minimize in-person visits, using web-based platforms for virtual visits and
      self-collection of samples to prioritize safety during the severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic.
