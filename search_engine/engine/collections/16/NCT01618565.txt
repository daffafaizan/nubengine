      (group 2) training session teaching a standardized SD algorithm scheme on a pelvic training
      model. Probands are tested with a 22 item Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills
      (OSATS) scoring system after training and 72 hours thereafter. OSATS scores are the primary
      outcome. Performance time (PT), self assessment (SA), confidence (CON), and global rating
      scale (GRS) are the secondary outcomes. Statistics will beperformed using Mann-Whitney
      U-test, chi-square test, and multivariable logistic regression analysis.
