      embolism remains a commonly under diagnosed and lethal entity. In the United States
      approximately 150,000 patients per year are diagnosed with acute pulmonary embolisms. Many
      additional deaths occur each year in the United States as a result of undiagnosed massive
      pulmonary embolisms. Taking these patients into account, it is thought that up to 600,000
      patients develop a pulmonary embolism annually in this country. In patients with acute
      pulmonary embolism, the most common cause of early death is right ventricular failure.

      In addition to anticoagulation therapy, several reperfusion therapies are being used to
      reverse right ventricular failure: systemic thrombolysis, surgical embolectomy, and catheter
      based therapy. Given the drawbacks of systemic thrombolytic therapy or surgical embolectomy,
      percutaneous catheter treatment is a reasonable alternative for patients with
      contraindications to systemic thrombolytic therapy or surgery. Current international
      consensus guidelines support the use of catheter interventions for selected pulmonary
      embolism patients at increased risk of adverse clinical outcomes.

      The AngioJet Ultra PE Thrombectomy catheter introduces a pressurized high velocity saline
      stream through a catheter tip so that the clot within a blood vessel is trapped, broken into
      small pieces and aspirated from the body.
