      compare 1) an extended quality care smoking cessation treatment delivered over a one-year
      period (EQC) to 2) quality care smoking cessation treatment delivered over an 8 week period
      (QC) to determine if EQC improves prolonged smoking abstinence.

      Research Design/Methodology 500 smokers who are interested in quitting will be enrolled and
      randomly assigned to the EQC or QC groups. Both groups will initially receive a
      state-of-the-science smoking cessation intervention including behavioral and pharmacological
      components, delivered by a combination of in-person and telephone care. EQC participants who
      fail to quit, reduce but do not quit, or relapse will receive intensive treatment over the
      ensuing 12 months that encourages repeat quit attempts and smoking reduction if they are not
      to quit. We propose reduction as an intermediate goal in LC because this may increase the
      likelihood of cessation, increase self-efficacy and keep smokers and clinicians engaged.
      Reduction treatment will include behavioral treatment and nicotine replacement. QC
      participants will only receive occasional prompts to quit. The primary endpoint will be 6M of
      abstinence measured 18M after enrollment. Secondary endpoints will include point prevalent
      abstinence, smoking reduction, self-efficacy and satisfaction. We will also collect
      qualitative data from successful abstainers and reducers about decision making processes and
      intervention experiences.

      Clinical Significance This project will address the potential role of smoking reduction in
      the treatment menu for smokers interested in quitting. This project examines mechanisms,
      methods and a "real world" application for reducing toxin exposure.
