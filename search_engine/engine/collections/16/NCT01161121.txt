      included. Following diagnostic angiography in the catheterization lab, the patient will have
      a guide catheter placed in the artery to be assessed followed by placing a pressure guidewire
      down the coronary vessel and past the lesion of interest. FFR will be measured in the
      traditional manner, with intravenous adenosine infusing at 140 mcg/kg/min until maximal
      steady state hyperemia is reached. At this point, the FFR will be recorded as Pd (distal
      pressure from the pressure wire in the coronary artery) divided by Pa (proximal pressure from
      the guide catheter). The adenosine infusion will then be stopped and the patient's
      hemodynamics allowed to return to baseline. Once baseline state is again achieved, an
      intravenous bolus of regadenson (0.4 mg) will be given and FFR will be remeasured as the
      lowest steady state Pd/Pa. Patients will be enrolled at two sites, The University of Florida
      - where FFR will be measured alone, and Saint Louis University, where coronary flow will be
      measured simultaneously to evaluate the effect of regadenoson on coronary flow velocity as
      compared to adenosine. The primary endpoint of the study will be to compare the FFR achieved
      with adeonsine to that obtained with regadenoson.
