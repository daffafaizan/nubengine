      family Brassicaceae (including broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, Chinese
      cabbage and turnips). Many previous studies have documented that consumption of these
      vegetables is associated with a reduced risk of cancer (lung, breast, colon, rectum, and
      prostate).(Juge et al. 2007) The mechanism of action of these beneficial effects is believed
      to be due to the ability of SF to up-regulate genes that improve cellular response to
      oxidative stress, inflammation, DNA-damaging electrophiles, and radiation.(Singh et al. 2014)
      In a recent small, randomized controlled trial in children with autism, SF was shown to have
      beneficial effects on aberrant and social behavior.(Singh et al. 2014) The mechanism of
      action of this beneficial effect has not been established in children with ASD. Our primary
      goal is to examine changes in urinary metabolites in children with autism who receive SF to
      determine if changes in behavior are associated with changes in urinary metabolites.
