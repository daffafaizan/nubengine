      general internists. Currently in Canada, gastroenterologists and general surgeons perform 97%
      of the colonoscopies, but excessive wait times highlight a shortage of colonoscopists in
      Canada. This shortage will invariably worsen as our population ages and more Canadians become
      screened for colorectal cancer.

      One method of improving this relative shortage of colonoscopists is through training primary
      care physicians in GI medicine and endoscopy. In order these physicians to be a legitimate
      option in the provision of colonoscopies; however, it must be shown that, as a group, they
      are able to meet benchmarks in colonoscopy competency.

      This multi-centre observational study will be the first study to prospectively analyze
      colonoscopic examinations performed by primary care physicians at a provincial level. Using
      primarily cecal intubation rates and adenoma detection rates, along with other quality
      parameters, this study will compare the results of Alberta primary care physicians to
      standard benchmarks in colonoscopy competency.

      Data will be collected using case report forms completed at the time of the colonoscopy,
      reviewing the patients' colonoscopy pathology results and a post procedure telephone survey
      to examine patient satisfaction rates.

      If this study demonstrates that quality benchmarks are indeed met, then future training of
      primary care physicians in gastrointestinal medicine and endoscopy would be encouraged to
      help address current and future colonoscopist shortages.
