      removal of large polyps can now be safely and effectively removed with wide field EMR.
      Residual polyp tissue is found at follow up colonoscopy in approximately 15% of cases however
      and remains a focus of attempts to improve EMR efficacy. All patients undergoing surveillance
      colonoscopy after EMR at Westmead Hospital Endoscopy unit will have steps of assessment and
      therapy of the scar recorded. Data will be entered into the large prospective audit database
      and also analysed separately. Data will be stored in coded format. The individual steps and
      the outcome of the scar interrogation and therapy will also be assessed and analysed. It is
      expected that these results will help guide the optimal approach to assessment and confirm
      the efficacy of therapy of recurrence further aiding the endoscopic approach to large colonic
      polyps.
