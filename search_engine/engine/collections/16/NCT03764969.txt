      habitual behavior, its neural basis and how it can be differentially modified in
      treatment-seeking smokers, using two training interventions. The first intervention is
      cognitive remediation treatment (CRT), also known as cognitive enhancement therapy, focusing
      on improving inhibitory control and executive functions. The second intervention, a
      computer-based habit-modifying training focusing on implicit drug seeking ("implicit
      computer-based habit-modifying training", ICHT) uses a conditioning approach through implicit
      priming and contextual modulation. Indicators of the imbalance will be examined with respect
      to reward devaluation, cue reactivity and a pavlovian instrumental transfer (PIT) paradigm.
      The investigators hypothesize that both interventions change the balance between
      goal-directed and habitual behavior but by different mechanisms. Whereas CRT should directly
      increase cognitive control, in contrast, ICHT should affect the early processing and the
      emotional valence of smoking and smoking cues.
