      birth but only 2% to 16% of them develop severe hyperbilirubinemia (total serum bilirubin >
      25mg/dl) ,which is an emergency because it may cause neonatal bilirubin encephalopathy
      (kernicterus), which can result in death or irreversible brain damage in survivor.

      Exchange transfusion is the standard method of therapy for immediate treatment of severe
      hyperbilirubinemia and prevention of kernicterus. Although the frequency of neonatal exchange
      transfusion has declined markedly in the past two decades, this procedure is still performed
      in many countries, especially in those with a high incidence of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.

      Exchange transfusion is effective and considered to be safe procedure ; however, it is not
      without risks. Complications have been reported and mortality rates vary from 0.5 to 3.3%.
      therefore,the current recommendation for performing exchange transfusion are based on balance
      between the risks of encephalopathy and complications related to the procedure .

      Most of these complications are transient, such as severe thrombocytopenia, apnea,
      hypocalcemia , bradycardia, and hyperkalemia and recovery is expected along with appropriate
      care and follow up. But serious complications and even death can occurs due to cardiovascular
      collapse during exchange , necrotizing enterocolitis, bacterial sepsis, and pulmonary
      hemorrhage that can be avoided by careful cardio-pulmonary and oxygen saturation monitoring.
