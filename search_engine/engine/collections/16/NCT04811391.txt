    
      This protocol describes a prospective one-year cohort study of hospital-based health workers
      in Albania to evaluate the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine in preventing
      laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID -19 disease.

      The investigators will measure the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against
      laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection in both symptomatic and asymptomatic hospital
      health workers.

      SARS-CoV-2 infection will be diagnosed using symptom questionnaires and PCR testing.
      Additionally, serology testing will be obtained over the course of one year, to identify
      asymptomatic infections.
