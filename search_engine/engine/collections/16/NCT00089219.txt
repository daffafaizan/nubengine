        -  Determine the immune response in patients with stage IIIB, IIIC, or IV melanoma treated
           with vaccine comprising multiple synthetic melanoma peptides, Montanide ISA-51, and
           sargramostim (GM-CSF).

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive vaccine comprising low-dose multiple synthetic melanoma
           peptides, Montanide ISA-51, and sargramostim (GM-CSF) on days 1, 8, 15, 29, 36, and 43.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive vaccine comprising medium-dose multiple synthetic melanoma
           peptides, Montanide ISA-51, and GM-CSF as in arm I.

        -  Arm III: Patients receive vaccine comprising high-dose multiple synthetic melanoma
           peptides, Montanide ISA-51, and GM-CSF as in arm I.

      On day 22, the lymph node draining the vaccination site is removed to determine whether the
      immune system is responding to the vaccine.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 38 patients will be accrued for this study.
