      I. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of palifermin on thymic function in patients at
      risk of chronic graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).

      II. To evaluate the tolerability of palifermin in patients at risk of chronic GVHD.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on whether they wish to receive
      palifermin or not.

      GROUP 1: Patients receive palifermin intravenously (IV) on days 1-3 in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP 2: Patients do not receive palifermin.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up on days 7, 14, 21, and 28.
