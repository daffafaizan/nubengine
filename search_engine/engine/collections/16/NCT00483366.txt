      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine hydrochloride and capecitabine when
           combined with imatinib mesylate in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Explore the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine and capecitabine.

      Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once daily on days 1-5 and 8-12, gemcitabine
      hydrochloride IV on days 3 and 10, and oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of progressive disease or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine hydrochloride and
      capecitabine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the
      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Existing paraffin-embedded tissue blocks from patients diagnosed with melanoma or renal cell
      carcinoma will be assessed for c-kit mutations by polymerase chain reaction and direct
      sequencing of both juxtamembrane domains (exons 9 and 11) and tyrosine kinase domain (exon 13
      and 17). (Begins 12-11-2008)
