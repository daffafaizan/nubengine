      human's body. Patients with sickle cell disease have low levels of the amino acid arginine
      and these low levels may be related to pain episodes. Increasing levels of arginine in the
      blood may lower pain and/or lower the amount of pain medication (like morphine) that is
      needed to treated them. It may also decrease the amount of time spent in the hospital.
