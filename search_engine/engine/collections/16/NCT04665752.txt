      The objective of this study is to understand the rate and extent of ocular involvement in
      COVID-19 patients and whether SARS-COV-2 can be detected in ocular fluids or tissue in
      convalescent phase.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective: To investigate if COVID survivors show signs of anterior or posterior
      segment inflammation or other retinochoroidal changes after recovery.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To investigate if SARS-Cov-2 can be detected in the ocular fluids or tissues of survivors
      among patients who undergo medically indicated ocular surgery or diagnostic procedures.

      Exploratory Objective: To investigate whether the use of chloroquine/Hydroxychloroquine for
      treatment of COVID-19 is associated with ocular changes.

      Endpoints:

      Primary Endpoint: Percentage of patients with Ocular exam abnormalities such as
      conjunctival/corneal, anterior segment, choroidal, retinal lesions and subclinical findings
      on OCT, FA and ICG

      Secondary Endpoints:

      Correlation of ocular findings with COVID severity (by history)

      Proportion of patients with +SARS-COV-2 PCR in ocular fluid/tissues among COVID-19 survivors
      and correlation to clinical characteristics and IgG levels

      Study Population:

      Up to 150 COVID-19 survivors will be recruited.

      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:

      This protocol will enroll participants at the NIH CC. De-identified samples may be received
      from the New York Medical Center.

      Study Duration:

      2 years

      Participant Duration:

      The participants will be asked to come to the NIH CC for one visit. A select subgroup of up
      to 75 participants with positive findings may be asked to return within 12 months from their
      initial visit.
