      treatment for older patients with AML. The primary goals of this study are to test whether
      patients treated with an HMA (either decitabine or azacitidine) in combination with 33A will
      have better anti-tumor activity and/or survive longer than patients treated with an HMA in
      combination with placebo.

      Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment
      groups: 1) 33A plus HMA (Experimental Arm); or 2) placebo plus HMA (Comparator Arm). In
      addition to evaluating survival and remission rates, the minimal residual disease
      (MRD)-negative remission rate, duration of remission, event free- and leukemia-free survival,
      and safety and tolerability will be compared between arms.
