      leukodystrophy. It is hosted by the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD); an
      independent non-profit patient advocacy organization dedicated to individuals with rare
      diseases and the organizations who serve them.

      The study collects information from participants (or their authorized respondents, heretofore
      referred to collectively as "participants") who are affected by metachromatic leukodystrophy.

      Data are collected at pre-baseline, baseline, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months through online surveys,
      telephone Interviews, web-based virtual assessments with a clinical study coordinator, and a
      (optional - only for U.S. residents) mobile application. Data entered into this study
      includes name, date of birth, diagnosis, treatments, medical history, family history, quality
      of life, disease progression, treatment - past and proposed, general medical information,
      genetic test results and mutations, blood level results, upload of medical records.
