      a program that supports the management of epilepsy by people with epilepsy. The program is
      based on proven techniques of motivational interviewing and stages of change. Before offering
      WebEase to the general public, we tested the program among volunteers with epilepsy. We
      recruited individuals with epilepsy who were willing to use the program.

      The program was developed by a team of researchers and physicians who treat patients with
      epilepsy. The program offers information on three major topics: 1) medication taking, 2)
      stress and 3) sleep management as it relates to epilepsy. It includes quizzes, fact sheets,
      and links to other authoritative websites on epilepsy.

      Before beginning the study, each participant completed a brief survey about medications,
      stress, and sleep. Then participants worked through the WebEase program. WebEase consists of
      three modules: medication, stress, and sleep. Each module lasts 2 weeks, and includes an
      interactive session geared specifically to each person's needs. During the study, each
      participant kept a diary of medications, stress, sleep, and seizures, which allowed them to
      see changes over time. After completing the WebEase program, participants completed two more
      brief surveys about six weeks apart. About half of the participants were asked to complete
      two surveys about 6 weeks apart before beginning the WebEase program. These individuals
      completed one survey after the end of the program.
