      drawn at time 0, 15, 30, 45, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min.

        1. Serum levels of glucose, insulin, and C-peptide were analyzed by biochemical
           autoanalyzer. The area under the curve (AUC) changes in blood glucose were computed by
           the trapezoidal method.

        2. Glycemic index(GI): the area under the glucose response curve after consumption of a
           test food divided by the area under the curve after consumption of a control food
           containing the same amount of carbohydrate and calculated using 50 g glucose as the
           reference.
