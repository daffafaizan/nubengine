      amount/severity of itching, bacteria levels in the affected areas of skin, and amount of
      water loss in the affected areas. The eczema severity will be scored using the EASI (upper
      limb subscale); itch will be assessed with a Visual Analog Scale for itch; the skin will be
      swabbed for bacterial cultures and results are quantified based on microbiology lab standards
      to be mild, moderate or heavy growth of the bacteria identified; and transepidermal water
      loss (TEWL) will be measured using a tewameter/capacitive moisture sensor.
