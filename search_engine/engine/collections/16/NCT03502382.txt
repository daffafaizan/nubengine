      treatment. LLD over 2cm is usually noticed by the individual affected leading to self
      compensation by walking on the ball of the foot (toe down) or by tilting the pelvis and
      curving the spine.Untreated LLD can lead to lower back pain and long leg arthritis of the hip
      LLD and its effects on patient function have been discussed in depth in the literature with
      respect to hip arthroplasty but there are few studies that have examined the effect on
      function of limb length discrepancy following TKA.

      Improved surgical techniques and rehabilitation protocols have resulted in excellent knee
      function and range of motion following TKA.

      The investigators are aiming from the study to improve functional outcome in patients with
      knee osteoarthritis undergoing TKA.
