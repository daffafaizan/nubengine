      seen in areas where hepatitis is endemic, such as Asia, but other risk factors include
      alcoholic cirrhosis.

      Surgical resection and/or transplantation remain the only curative options. However, more
      than 80% of patients present with unresectable disease. For these patients with unresectable
      tumors, a variety of treatment options are available, including transarterial
      chemoembolization (TACE), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), radioactive microspheres, microwave
      coagulation, laser-induced thermotherapy, and percutaneous alcohol injection, all of which
      have similar survival rates. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for unresectable HCC is a
      relatively new treatment option made available because of significant improvements in
      diagnostic imaging and radiation delivery techniques. Although follow-up is limited, results
      show encouraging local control rates. Some investigators have combined TACE with fractionated
      conventional radiotherapy as a means of intensifying local therapy, with evidence of
      efficacy.

      TACE remains the dominant mode of local therapy for unresectable HCC. However, recurrence
      rates are high. Because SBRT is rapidly becoming an accepted local therapy for hepatic
      lesions, its role in treating HCC needs to be further defined. Moreover, once patients have
      recurred after initial TACE, it is unclear if additional TACE will be as effective or if
      another mode of local therapy such as SBRT would be preferable.

      We propose to conduct a multicenter randomized study comparing TACE vs. SBRT using CyberKnife
      for locally recurrent HCC. Locally recurrent HCC will include lesions that persist, progress
      or recur minimum 3 months after initial TACE.
