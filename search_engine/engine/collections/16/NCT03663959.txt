      carrier and 36 women who had laparoscopic pectocolpopexies were re-examined 7 to 43 months
      after surgery. All of the women had undergone surgery for stage 2 or greater uterovaginal or
      vaginal vault prolapse according to the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system.

      All of the patients received telephone calls and were invited for a gynecological
      re-examination. All but one patient in the vaginal surgery group came in for a gynecological
      control. We conducted a phone interview with the one patient not agreeing to come to the
      control, and we learned that she had a relapse 6 months after the operation. She underwent
      another prolapse surgery at a different hospital. She described her postsurgical complaints,
      and we noted that she was unsatisfied with the surgery. In the postoperative re-evaluation
      between 15 June and 30 December 2018, all of the women were examined in the lithotomy
      position for apical, anterior, and posterior compartment descensus. Stage 2 or greater apical
      descensus or a cystocele or rectocele according to the POP-Q system were accepted as
      postoperative relapses. All of the patients answered the Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Urinary
      Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12) and Prolapse Quality of Life (P-QOL)
      questionnaire. All of the women were asked about de novo urge urinary incontinence and de
      novo stress urinary incontinence. In addition, each patient's satisfaction with the surgery
      was asked and recorded.
