      diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Sleep is recognized a risk factor for many of the
      conditions comprising MetS (e.g. high blood sugars, obesity). Interestingly, fat metabolism
      during your sleep is important for regulating several key components of health, like risk of
      obesity and glucose tolerance. While exercise is recognized as a health enhancing behavior to
      reduce the risk of many chronic diseases, the effect of exercise on sleep quality and
      nocturnal fat metabolism is largely unknown. This study plans to learn more about how the
      time of day that you perform exercise influences sleep quality and fat metabolism overnight
      in adults with metabolic syndrome. In this study, exercise will be performed in the early
      evening and the investigators will measure your sleep quality and fat metabolism overnight in
      our metabolic room. Findings from this study will identify how exercise influences novel
      contributors to metabolic syndrome (sleep quality and nocturnal metabolism) and shed light on
      some potential mechanisms to explain the variability in exercise responses.
