      yet they have all have failed when given after ischemic stroke in humans. A novel approach to
      ischemic neuroprotection is needed. Many patients who undergo cardiac, vascular, and
      neurosurgical procedures develop ischemic central nervous system (CNS) complications. These
      high risk surgeries present a unique opportunity to administer neuroprotectant medication
      prior to the injury, greatly increasing the likelihood that it will have a positive impact on
      outcomes. Patients undergoing descending thoracic aortic (DTA) and thoracoabdominal aortic
      (TAA) surgery have a particularly high rate of both brain and spine ischemia. In addition,
      these surgeries require placement of a lumbar cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) drain, allowing
      access to CSF in order to monitor markers of injury and penetration of medication into the
      CNS. We performed a pilot dose finding trial of prophylactic darbepoetin alfa, a long-acting
      erythropoiesis medication with putative neuroprotectant properties, in patients undergoing
      DTA and TAA surgery. This dose finding trial was stopped early after 9 patients were enrolled
      at the request of the FDA after an unrelated trial of erythropoietin in acute stroke
      performed in Germany was negative and showed possible harm in those patients who received
      intravenous tissue plasminogen activaor (tPA). We then enrolled 9 additional patients who did
      not receive any intervention in order to compare them to the patients who received
      darbepoetin.
