      abdominal sacrocolpopexy. The composite graft is composed of a dual layer of biological and
      syntheric material. Biological grafts have the advantage of significantly reducing erosion
      rates, but the longevity of biologic graft is uncertain. On the other hand, synthetic grafts
      have the advantage in that they are durable, but have higher erosion rates through the vagina
      and require re-operation in a small percentage of patients. This study will look at whether
      or not the use of a composite greaft carries the advantages of both types of materials and
      leads to decreased rates of erosion while maintaining longevity. The cost effectiveness of
      this new type of graft will also be reviewed since the disavantage of utilizing both the
      synthetic and biologic graft is that it will increase the cost.
