      University Faculty of Medicine, Brain and Nerve Surgery will be included. In this study,
      patient data will be collected in the form of file scanning. Intra-operative; hemodynamic
      data of patients; heart rate, blood pressure values, anesthetic and other drugs applied,
      surgery and anesthesia durations will be written from the anesthesia document after the
      operation is over. In the study, the application preferred by the anesthesiologist for the
      patient will not be intervened. The patients will be divided into three groups; wound
      infiltration technique was applied, ultrasound-guided bilateral erector spina plan block
      technique was applied and both techniques were applied together. After the operation; pain
      values will be calculated by VAS at the 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 12th and 24th hours of the
      patients. The patient's length of stay, satisfaction (excellent, good, moderate, poor) and
      methods used for analgesia will be recorded. With the results collected in our study, it will
      be determined which procedure is superior in pain management for spine surgery.
