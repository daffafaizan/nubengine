      carcinoma and affects approximately 1.25 million Americans. Six medications have been
      licensed for use in chronic hepatitis B in the United States, but their relative benefit and
      long-term efficacy remain unclear. In previous studies, we have shown that maintained
      suppression of hepatitis b virus DNA (HBV DNA) can be achieved with nucleoside analogues and
      that suppression is associated with marked improvements in disease. In this randomized study,
      we propose to evaluate long-term therapy with tenofovir alone or in combination with
      emtricitabine (FTC). Forty treatment-naive patients with chronic hepatitis B will be enrolled
      in the primary study. After medical evaluation and liver biopsy, patients will be stratified
      by hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) status and randomized to receive either tenofovir alone or
      in combination with FTC. Treatment will be continued long-term (at least four years) and
      patients will be carefully monitored for side effects, serum aminotransferase and HBV DNA
      levels. Patients will undergo repeat liver biopsy and assessment of antiviral resistance at 1
      and 4 years. The primary endpoint of therapy will be the maintained suppression of HBV DNA to
      below 10(2) copies/ml (lower limit of detection of current assays). The study will assess the
      relative efficacy and safety of combination versus mono-therapy. A separate group of 60
      previously treated patients will also be enrolled and randomized to mono- or
      combination-therapy to assess the safety profile of these agents. The primary analysis will
      be conducted on the entire study cohort.
