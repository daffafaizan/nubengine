    
      An observational, retrospective, case-controlled study to determine the status of IBD during
      development of COVID-19 symptoms/positive COVID-19. The aim is to describe the adaptations in
      therapies for active IBD during SARS COV 2 in patients with active IBD and positive or
      negative COVID-19 symptoms. It will evaluate IBD outcomes following development of COVID-19
      symptoms / positive COVID-19 and determine any predictors of outcomes in IBD patients with
      COVID-19 symptoms / positive COVID-19 as well as determine the impact on IBD outcomes
      resulting from adaptations to treatments during COVID-19
