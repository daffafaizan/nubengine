      Arms: (1) Maintenance therapy with AZA combined with LEN（AZA+LEN）: AZA 50mg/m² per day for
      days 1-5 and LEN 10mg per day orally for days 6-26 , every 28 days for up to 12 cycles or
      progression; (2) Maintenance therapy with AZA only: AZA 50mg/m² per day for days 1-5, every
      28 days for up to 12 cycles or progression; (3) Observation or with supporting therapy. MRD
