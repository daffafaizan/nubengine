      recovery within three months, a sizeable group continues to report frequent and severe
      symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, forgetfulness, and
      irritability, in what is labeled persistent post-concussion syndrome (PCS). Persistent PCS is
      associated with vocational, recreational, and social disability. Early education and
      reassurance (treatment as usual) is effective in general, but appears insufficient for this
      subgroup.

      Recent research has identified risk factors for persistent PCS, including inaccurate illness
      beliefs, maladaptive coping behaviour, and emotional distress. The present study will
      evaluate the additive efficacy of a cognitive-behavioural therapy protocol designed to modify
      these risk factors, over and above treatment as usual.

      Participants with MTBI will be recruited within six weeks of injury. Those identified as
      being at-risk for persistent PCS based on evidence-based criteria will receive treatment as
      usual and then be randomly assigned to receive either no further intervention or
      cognitive-behavioural therapy. We hypothesize that the group receiving cognitive-behavioural
      therapy will have fewer PCS symptoms and be less disabled at follow-up. We also hypothesize
      that compensation-seeking status will mitigate this improvement and that illness beliefs,
      coping behaviour, and emotional distress will mediate this improvement. A blinded rater will
      conduct the baseline and outcome assessments.
