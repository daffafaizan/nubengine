      are undergoing HCD at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) will be observed for
      functional outcomes following the procedure.

      HCD is considered an excellent surgical option when considering the multiple issues among
      this population, which include young age, the natural progression of osteonecrosis to femoral
      head collapse, the limited life expectancy of the prosthetic technology currently available
      for total hip arthroplasty (THA), and patient quality of life. This study will seek to
      describe functional outcomes and quality of gait following HCD in a pediatric population with
      osteonecrosis. The results of this study will provide valuable information as to the
      functional limitations within this population pre- and post-operatively.

      For each research participant the observations on all outcome measures of interest will be
      collected at 5 time points: pre-operatively (baseline measure), and post-operatively at 6
      weeks, 12 weeks, 6 months and 1 year. These time points will allow for comparison between
      pre- and post-operative outcomes to determine if outcomes are improved following surgery, and
      if these outcomes continue to improve over time. This study will also provide a foundation
      for the future development of treatment programs designed to target identified limitations
      specific to this population.
