      major morbidity. Postoperative morbidity adversely impacts healthcare utilization, healthcare
      costs, rates of discharge to home, quality of life, rates of receipt of postoperative
      anti-neoplastic therapy, disease-free survival, and overall survival. The investigators
      hypothesize that perioperative risk stratification and risk-based, protocol-driven management
      (compared to standard perioperative management) will lead to a reduction in 30-day
      post-operative mortality or major morbidity in patients undergoing major cancer surgery. This
      is based on our theory that preoperative/postoperative use of newly developed, perioperative
      risk-prediction tools will help identify patients at increased risk of postoperative death or
      serious complications that might benefit from risk-based, protocol-driven perioperative
      management, including escalating levels of care, escalating levels of monitoring, and
      escalating levels of hospitalist co-management. The set of assessments and interventions in
      the proposed study are conceptually similar to other "bundled" interventions which have
      recently been recently tested and demonstrated to reduce perioperative mortality and
      morbidity.
