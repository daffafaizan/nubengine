      physical conditions, elderly patients usually associated with medical complications, so
      generally just receive radiotherapy alone. Recently, some retrospective studies have shown
      that the impact of chemotherapy did not cause an increase in the complication rate among
      elderly patients as compared to younger patients with cervical cancer, and may improve the
      survival when concurrent with radiotherapy. Cisplatin and paclitaxel are two effective drug
      in treating cervical cancer, but whether they are safe enough for elderly when concurrent
      with radiotherapy, there are no clearly reports. In this study ,we replace the conventional
      dose chemotherapy with weekly cisplatin or lipsome paclitaxel , to compare the efficiency and
      safety of weekly cisplatin / liposome paclitaxel concurrent chemoradiotherapy and
      radiotherapy alone in the treatment of cervical cancer in elderly patients.
