      retrospectively. The functional output, the level of spasticity, and the level of motor
      development at admission and discharge will be determined using the Functional Independence
      Measure instrument, the Modified Ashworth Scale, and the Brunnstrom test, respectively. Based
      on the length of hospital stay, patients will be divided into two groups: hospital stays â‰¤ 3
      months (Group 1) and > 3 months (Group 2). Clinical features and functional output will be
      compared between the groups.
