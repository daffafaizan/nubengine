    
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, local reactions (reactogenicity),
      capacity to form antibodies against the coronavirus (immunogenicity) and long-term
      persistence of those antibodies following two doses of a Health Canada approved RNA-based
      COVID-19 vaccine in patients with rheumatic diseases.

      Two doses from the Moderna vaccine will be administered intramuscularly. The time between
      dose 1 and dose 2 of the vaccine will be 28 days.

      This research study will recruit 220 participants (165 patients and 55 healthy controls), men
      and women, aged 18 years or older.
