      core muscle exercise intervention for persons with painful patellofemoral osteoarthritis
      (PFOA), a common condition for middle-aged and older adults. Currently there is limited
      evidence regarding effective conservative interventions for PFOA, a chronic condition that is
      painful and limits function and quality of life. Exercise is recommended as a first-line
      treatment for knee osteoarthritis, but the optimal type of exercise for PFOA is unknown. This
      intervention is based upon similar programs shown to improve pain and function in younger
      persons with patellofemoral pain, a condition that may lead to PFOA. Feasibility outcomes
      include adherence to the treatment program, recruitment, retention, and the impact of the
      intervention on participants' pain and function at 6-weeks and 6 months after finishing the
      program. The investigators will also compare PFOA participants to a matched pain-free
      volunteer control group to explore the differences in their biomechanics, muscle strength,
      pain report, and function at baseline. Data from this feasibility study will be used to
      design a future randomized controlled trial investigating the efficacy of conservative
      exercise interventions for PFOA. The investigators' overarching goal is to develop a
      conservative exercise intervention that improves the symptoms, function, and quality of life
      of persons with PFOA.
