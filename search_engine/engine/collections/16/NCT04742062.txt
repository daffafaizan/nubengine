    
      This Phase I clinical trial is divided in two parts: the first part (part A) is a single dose
      escalation study and the second (part B) is a multiple dose study. Both are performed in
      healthy volunteers.

        -  First part: a single dose, i.v. administration (slow infusion), dose escalation with a
           maximum of 7 single dose levels, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (saline
           solution), in healthy subjects.

        -  Second part: a multiple dose, i.v. administration (slow infusion), randomized,
           double-blind, placebo-controlled (saline solution), in healthy subjects.

      The main objectives of this study are:

        1. To evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of ApTOLL in healthy
           volunteers, after single dose administration in fasting conditions, following an
           ascending dosing scheme.

        2. To evaluate the tolerability and pharmacokinetic characteristics of ApTOLL in healthy
           volunteers, after multiple dose administration in fasting conditions.
