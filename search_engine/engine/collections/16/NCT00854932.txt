    
      Detailed description according our pilot study (see reference). This trial is designed to
      exclude a difference in rate of re-infection or death greater than 2%. Assuming a 2%
      reinfection/death rate in each group, 770 patients are required for a power of 80% at
      alpha=0.05. To allow for some unevaluable cases 800 per group will be included. Based on the
      data of the pilot study (see reference), with a number of 770 per group a difference between
      mean antibiotic therapy durations of 10 hours can be detected at two-sided alpha of 0.05 with
      a power of 95%.
