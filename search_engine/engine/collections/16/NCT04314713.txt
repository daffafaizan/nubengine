    
      This is a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled, in-clinic, Phase 1, single-dose,
      IM, sequential dose-escalation study in healthy adults aged 18-55. Healthy volunteers will be
      assigned to 1 of 5 cohorts of Scopolamine HBT dosage groups: 0.005, 0.007, 0.011, 0.014, or
      0.021 mg/kg, or will receive the placebo administered by IM injection to the anterior thigh.
      In each cohort, 6 to 9 subjects will receive active drug and 2 to 3 subjects will receive
      placebo. Each cohort will have at least 3 male and 3 female subjects enrolled among the first
      8 subjects in the dosing group to ensure that at least 1 male subject and 1 female subject in
      each dosing group receive active drug. If nonextreme dose-limiting toxicities are observed in
      any of the cohorts, 4 additional subjects, 3 active and 1 placebo, may be added to each
      cohort.
