      volunteers. Sixteen volunteers will be chosen over a range of ages but specifically include
      similar numbers of early adulthood (18-44), middle age (45-65), and elderly (>65). Sixteen
      volunteers from each age group divided evenly by gender will be selected. Therefore, a total
      of 48 subjects will be tested, with an even number of male and female performing each of the
      activities listed above.

      Inclusion Critera Volunteers will be recruited through website, personnel, and community
      contacts. They will be recruited based on age and gender.

      Exclusion Criteria Patients will be excluded if they have a history of an inflammatory
      condition such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus. They will be excluded if they have
      symptomatic osteoarthritis of their hands. Additional exclusion criteria will include known
      neurologic conditions, or prior injury that may be contributing to weakness or atrophy.
