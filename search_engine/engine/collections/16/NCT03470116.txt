      patients receiving muscle relaxants .

      Two devices are currently used for this purpose with various indications: the French Society
      of Anesthesia and Resuscitation (SFAR) recommends a direct laryngoscopy with MacIntosh blade
      in first intention for patients with less than 2 criteria of difficult intubation (ID). The
      SFAR recommends first-line video laryngoscopy in patients with two or more criteria of
      difficult intubation. Video laryngoscopy improves glottic vision, difficult intubation score,
      and intubation success rate at the first attempt, compared to the direct laryngoscopy with a
      Macintosh blade.

      Currently, it is estimated that 15% of direct laryngoscopies with a MacIntosh blade result in
      failure of orotracheal intubation (IOT) on first attempt, whereas tracheal intubation with a
      video laryngoscopy is a better solution to secure the airway.

      Our hypothesis in this study is that the MacGrath MAC videolaryngoscope allows to intubate at
      the first laryngoscopy 91% of patients with less than 2 difficult intubation criteria,
      against the expected 85% with the MacIntosh blade.
