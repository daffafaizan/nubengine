      cancer. For locally advanced stage II-III resectable rectal cancer, either preoperative
      short-course radiotherapy of 25 Gy in 5 consecutive days or long-course chemo-radiotherapy
      followed by radical Total Meso-rectal Excision is recommended.(1) The Swedish Rectal Cancer
      Trial has demonstrated the lower rate of early toxicity of short course radiotherapy when
      compared to chemo-radiation. Short-course irradiation reduced the risk of local recurrence
      with evidence of overall survival improvement.(2) Short-course regimen is less expensive and
      more convenient, especially in centers with long waiting lists.(3) Two meta-analyses showed
      that short course is as effective as long course chemo-radiation in the management of locally
      advanced rectal cancer in the terms of sphincter preservation rates, down-staging, R0
      resection, local control, and grade 3-4 toxicity(4, 5). Despite reduction in local-regional
      recurrence risk with neo-adjuvant short course radiotherapy, distant disease recurrence
      remains a substantial risk for patients with locally advanced disease. In a controlled
      randomized trial, a short course radiotherapy followed by consolidation chemotherapy prior to
      surgery yielded superior overall survival outcomes compared to chemo-radiotherapy, without
      significant differences in disease-free survival, nor local or distant disease control
      rates(6). The phase III RAPIDO and STELLAR clinical trials are also evaluating short course
      radiotherapy and consolidation chemotherapy(7, 8). The Stockholm III trial was a 3-arm trial
      that compared short-course RT with the standard 1-week delay to surgery, short-course RT with
      a 4- to 6-week delay to surgery, and long-course chemoradiation with a 4- to 6-week delay to
      surgery. The results show similar outcomes between the groups, but delaying the surgery after
      short-course RT decreased the rates of high-grade toxicity and allowed for an expedited
      treatment program. (9) (10)
