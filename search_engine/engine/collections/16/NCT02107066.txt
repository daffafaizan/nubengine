      survivors to increase disease-free survival from cancer and other chronic diseases, and to
      improve quality of life. Studies of a strong benefit of physical activity on improving QOL
      following other types of cancer treatment, e.g., breast cancer, are well documented in the
      literature; yet very few studies of physical activity and QOL after a diagnosis of ovarian
      cancer have been published. Therefore, clinical trials of exercise on common physical and
      psychological consequences of ovarian cancer and its treatments are warranted.

      The primary aims of our study are to examine, in 230 women who have completed treatment for
      Stage I-IV ovarian cancer, the impact of a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise intervention
      vs. attention control on:

        -  Quality of Life

        -  Body Composition (weight, BMI, total and % body fat, waist and hip circumference)

        -  Hormones possibly associated with physical activity and ovarian cancer prognosis
           (insulin, IGF-I, IGF-II, IGF binding protein-3, CRP, leptin, estrone, estradiol, free
           estradiol, and sex-hormone binding globulin, osteopontin, MIF, prolactin, and CA-125)

        -  Cardiorespiratory Fitness - an objective measure of functional capacity and adherence to
           exercise.

      Hypotheses: Women randomized to exercise will experience improvements in quality of life,
      body composition, hormone levels, and cardiorespiratory fitness compared to women randomized
      to usual care.

      Our trial could suggest a unique and important role for exercise in ovarian cancer care given
      that physical and functional aspects of QOL are often the most compromised in ovarian cancer
      patients.
