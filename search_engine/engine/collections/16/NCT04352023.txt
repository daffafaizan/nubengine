      to recover and to live a normal life. There is a method of administering painless injections
      to relieve postoperative pain. Currently, IV-PCA is mostly used. However, this method has a
      disadvantage in that the dosage of the opioid-based analgesic is increased, and thus side
      effects may be concerned. By administering analgesics through an epidural route approached
      through the thoracic vertebrae rather than intravenous injection, effective post-operative
      pain control and less side effects can be expected in lesser amounts. This study
      prospectively compared the pain control effects of IV-PCA and PCEA in patients undergoing
      resection of hepatobiliary tumors at the National Cancer Center, revealing that PCEA is more
      effective in alleviating pain after surgery. It has a purpose. In addition, the investigators
      will investigate and compare clinical outcomes (first fart, dietary progression,
      postoperative complications, etc.) of the two patient groups and investigate the side effects
      of PCEA and complications related to the procedure.
