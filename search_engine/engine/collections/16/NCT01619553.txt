      persist for several years, expand for an extensive period of time and are sometimes called
      benign tumors. Keloids often have a lumpy surface and are often tender, itchy or inflamed
      around the growing border.

      Keloids in most keloid patients do not run in the family. In the inheritable form of keloids
      it is possible that there is one major gene mutation that puts family members at risk for
      developing keloids. There may be other variations in the DNA (DNA makes up the chromosomes)
      that determine whether keloids become large and aggressive or stay small and without many
      symptoms.

      For this study we will:

        -  Send out study participation kits and consent by phone

        -  Collect a saliva sample from eligible individuals

        -  Obtain information regarding the keloids

        -  Document keloids with photos

        -  If keloid patients undergo keloid surgery we ask to obtain some scar tissue that would
           otherwise be discarded

        -  Isolate DNA from the saliva sample

        -  Perform genetic analyses of the DNA with the most up-to-date methods available to
           identify genetic variations

        -  Study in the laboratory why the genetic variations cause keloids
