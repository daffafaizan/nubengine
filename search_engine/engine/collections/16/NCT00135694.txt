    
      This is a prospective multicenter, open-label, randomized trial in which individuals with
      liver failure due to hepatitis C or to nonimmune nonviral causes undergo liver
      transplantation and receive immunosuppression with a calcineurin inhibitor and
      corticosteroids. Corticosteroids are tapered in the 3 months after transplantation and the
      calcineurin inhibitor is continued. Participants are regularly assessed for evidence of
      allograft rejection. One year after transplantation, participants eligible for withdrawal are
      randomly assigned in a 4 to 1 ratio to immunosuppression withdrawal or to maintenance.
      Participants assigned to withdrawal undergo a scheduled taper over approximately 1 year.
