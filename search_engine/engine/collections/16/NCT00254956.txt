    
      This is a multi-center, multinational, active-controlled, double-blind, randomized (1:1)
      parallel group study of the effects of inhaled ciclesonide HFA-MDI 640 mcg/day and
      beclomethasone HFA-MDI 640 mcg/day on lens opacification in adult subjects with moderate to
      severe persistent asthma. The study consists of a 1-14 day screening phase during which
      subject eligibility will be determined, followed by a 12-month double-blind treatment phase.
      Lens opacification will be evaluated by slit lamp examination performed after pupillary
      dilation to at least 6.0 mm before randomization and after 4 months, 8 months, and 12 months
      of treatment using the LOCS III system for grading lens opacities. Best-corrected visual
      acuity and intraocular pressure will be measured at each eye examination visit. An
      Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) will be constituted to monitor safety throughout
      the double-blind treatment phase.
