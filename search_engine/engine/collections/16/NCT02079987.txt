      patients' study eligibility. Older, chronically ill ED patients who are eligible and agree to
      participate in the study will be randomly assigned to a healthcare coach and Care Transition
      Intervention or usual, post-ED care.

      At the time of enrollment, all subjects will be asked to provide informed consent for study
      investigators to request Medicare Claims to determine how many ED visits, hospital admissions
      and doctor office visits the subject had at least 30 days after the index ED visit. All
      research participants will be asked basic personal information such as age, race, sex,
      employment and marital status. All subjects will be asked to complete a baseline survey about
      their quality of life.

      If the subject is assigned to the Care Transition Intervention, the healthcare coach will
      visit the subject at home within 3 days of the ED visit. The coach will talk with the subject
      about following up with a regular, personal doctor and symptoms that indicate a worsening
      health condition. The coach will help the subject understand their medicines and help the
      subject make a personal health record (PHR). The coach will tell the subject about the Area
      Agency on Aging. If the subject receives usual care, they but will be given the usual
      discharge instructions from the ED nurse and doctor. If the subject receives the Care
      Transition Intervention, the coach will also call the subject at least 3 times after the ED
      visit and review the same items listed above.

      All enrolled subjects will be asked to complete a phone survey within 31-60 days of the ED
      visit. This survey will again ask subjects about their quality of life.
