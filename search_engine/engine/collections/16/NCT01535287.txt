      undergo general anesthesia. It has been described as a mental disturbance during the recovery
      from general anesthesia and can consist of hallucinations, delusions and confusion in the
      child. To the parent or caregivers this may be seen as moaning, restlessness, involuntary
      physical activity & thrashing about in bed. Emergence agitation (EA) can result in the child
      losing their intravenous therapy (IV) access & bodily injury. Some agitated children may
      retain vivid memories about their negative experience waking up from anesthesia. This can
      result in seeing new behaviors by the child such as anxiety, nighttime crying and temper
      tantrums. Dexmedetomidine given as an injection into the muscle of children is considered
      investigational, which means it hasn't been approved by the U.S. FDA for treatment of this
      problem in children.

      Immediately following surgery measurements of eye contact, purposeful actions, aware of
      surroundings, restless and crying are observed and recorded using the Pediatric Anesthesia
      Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale in PACU.

      Follow-up is made approximately 3 days after surgery by phone call or/and email with
      parent(s) to see if child has experienced any of the following: sleep disturbances, anxiety,
      eating disturbances, postoperative muscle pain or swelling at the injection site.
