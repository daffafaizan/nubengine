      new motorized PowerSpiral device during Post-market Clinical Follow-up. It is assumed that
      the new device and its safety profile is non-inferior to preceding generations of balloon
      assisted enteroscopes.

      As clinical performance and efficacy is equally important for the user this study also
      collects efficacy and handling data of the new device.
