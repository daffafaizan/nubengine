      with basal cell carcinomas (BCCs) and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs). Biomarkers taken from
      non-sun-exposed skin and UV-exposed skin before and after treatment will be compared.

      The ultimate goal of this study will be to generate new knowledge of the photoprotective
      effect of grape powder on UV exposure. The results may be employed as the basis for a larger
      clinical trial to evaluate the potential of grapes to prevent non-melanoma skin cancers
      (NMSCs) and sun damage.
