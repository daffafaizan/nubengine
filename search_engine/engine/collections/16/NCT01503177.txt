      Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for the intrapleural administration of a modified vaccine strain
      measles virus (MV) genetically engineered to produce human thyroidal sodium iodine symporter
      (NIS) (MV-NIS [oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter])in
      patients with MPM.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      Safety and toxicity of the repeated (up to 6 cycles) intrapleural administration of MV-NIS in
      patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Time course of viral infection, dissemination and elimination by non-invasive measurements
      of NIS gene expression using radioactive iodine and single-photon emission computed
      tomography (SPECT)/ computed tomography (CT) imaging with.

      II. Viremia, viral replication, and viral shedding following intrapleural administration.

      III. Changes in humoral and cellular anti-MV immunity following the intrapleural
      administration of MV-NIS.

      IV. Antitumor efficacy of this approach by serial measurements of radioiodine uptake by
      SPECT/CT, radiographic response, and time to disease progression.

      V. Changes in both local and systemic innate and adaptive anti-tumor immunity following the
      intrapleural administration of MV-NIS.

      VI. Effect of MV-NIS administration on the eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4F translation
      complex in mesothelioma cells.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive the oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter
      (MV-NIS) intrapleurally. In the absence of unacceptable side effects or disease progression
      treatment can be repeated every 28 days for up to 6 courses.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 to 6 months for up to 5
      years.
