      examining XB2001 (anti-IL-1‚ç∫ True Human antibody) in combination with ONIVYDE + 5-FU/LV
      (+folinic acid) in advanced pancreatic cancer

      Sponsor: XBiotech USA, Inc.

      Study Chair: Shubham Pant, M.D.

      Sample Size: Approximately 69 patients will be enrolled in the USA (at least 9 patients in
      the open label phase 1 portion and 60 patients in the randomized phase 2 portion)

      Approximate Duration:

      This trial will include 2 phases. The first portion will be a Phase I, open label, dose
      escalation study evaluating the safety, tolerability and establishing the Maximum Tolerated
      Dose (MTD) of XB2001 in at least nine patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma who
      are receiving ONIVYDE + Leucovorin l + d racemic + 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy treatment. The
      duration for each patient in the Phase I portion will be 14 days (1 treatment cycle) in which
      they will be given one intravenous dose of XB2001 prior to receiving ONIVYDE + Leucovorin l +
      d racemic + 5-Fluorouracil chemotherapy treatment and assessed for Dose Limited Toxicities
      (DLT). The Phase II portion will be implemented following the completion of the Phase I
      portion and declaration of the MTD. The duration of subject participation in the randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II portion of the trial is approximately 28 weeks:
      including a screening period of up to 30 days, and 24-week treatment period. All study
      subjects can continue treatment with XB2001 in an open label extension, for as long as they
      are judged to be benefitting clinically and have had no unacceptable toxicities.
