    
      Patients will receive anti-seizure prophylaxis beginning on day -7. Pre-transplant
      conditioning will include Fludarabine and dose-escalated Busulfan on days -6, -5, -4, and -3.
      Daily treatment doses will be adjusted to achieve target AUCs (area under the plasma
      concentration time curve). Day 0 is the day of hematopoietic progenitor cell reinfusion.

      Supportive care will be based on institutional guidelines. In an effort to prevent
      hepatotoxicity, ursodiol will be given to patients. During chemotherapy patients will not
      receive concurrent metronidazole, itraconazole, or be given acetaminophen.

      Blood samples will be collected at specific times after Dose 1 and Dose 4 and dose
      modification will be determined or based on the desired AUC levels. Doses 3 and/or 4 will be
      adjusted to achieve an average daily Busulfan AUC over the 4 treatment days.

      Dose escalation will proceed through 3 dose levels to determine the maximally tolerated level
      or AUC to evaluate the potential therapeutic benefit of higher doses of busulfan.

      Graft assessment, processing, and characterization will be done as per institutional
      guidelines. Donor-recipient chimerism (two genetically distinct types of blood cells) will be
      characterized by samples obtained pre-transplant and on days 30+/- 7, 90+/-7 and 360+/-30
      post-transplant.
