      21 enrolled subjects at one site in the United states of America (USA).

      The target subjects were male or female, 18 years and older, undergoing elective primary hip
      or knee arthroplasty with a possibility to participate in a follow-up visit 7 days after
      surgery. The primary purpose was to investigate if there was any skin damage under the
      dressing from operation day to last visit. Performance of the dressing as well as comfort,
      conformability, acceptability and pain at dressing removal was also followed-up until post-op
      day 7.
