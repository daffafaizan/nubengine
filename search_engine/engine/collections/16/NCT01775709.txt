      medical tool device call biocompatible Pressure Equalizing tube which can stop air passage
      and pressure equalization instantly, and can prevents water into the middle ear cavity.
      evaluate and compare the efficacy of a biocompatible Pressure Equalizing tube that enables
      air passage and pressure equalization almost instantly, while prevents the entrance of
      fluids, specially water, into the middle ear cavity.

      The biocompatible Pressure Equalizing tube can reduce the rate of postoperative otorrhea,air
      passage between outside and middle ear cavity,prevents formation of retraction pockets in TM
      and swimming with lower risk of otorrhea.
