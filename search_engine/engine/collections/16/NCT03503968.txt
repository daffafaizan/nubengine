    
      Phase I:

      The Phase I dose escalation part will establish the MTD/RP2D in subjects with high risk
      myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms, a total of 3 disease entities.

      Phase I subjects will be enrolled into the following cohorts and treated with a single
      intravenous (i.v.) infusion of IMP:

        -  Cohort 1: target dose of 1 x 105 T cells/kg ± 20%

        -  Cohort 2: target dose of 1 x 106 T cells/kg ± 20%

        -  Cohort 3: target dose of 5 x 106 T cells/kg ± 20%

        -  Optional cohort 4: up to 1 x 107 T cells/kg + 20%

      Phase II:

      The Phase II part consists of two arms, each representing one disease entity. Within each
      arm, representing a disease entity, subjects will be enrolled in 2 different treatment groups
      to receive either:

        1. IMP in the treatment group (up to 20 subjects who are positive for human leukocyte
           antigen (HLA)-A*02:01); Or

        2. therapy as per Investigator's discretion in the concurrent control (up to 20 subjects
           who are negative for HLA-A*02:01).
