      The phase I portion of the study is a dose escalation to confirm the safety of the
      combination and to determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and the Recommended Phase II
      Dose (RP2D) for ribociclib with Tamoxifen.

      Phase I will be conducted in all participants with Hormone Receptor Positive (HR+)/Human
      Epidermal growth factor Receptor 2 Negative (HER2-) locally advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer with any prior endocrine therapy and up to three prior cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens
      administered in the metastatic or locally advanced setting.

      Phase Ib Dose Expansion:

      Phase I trials are increasingly including dose-expansion cohorts (Ib) after the
      maximum-tolerated dose has been reached to better characterize the toxicity profile and
      identify early signs of efficacy within this specific disease population. The investigators'
      goal is to assess the anti-tumor activity Ribociclib + Tamoxifen and to further evaluate
      their safety in adult patients with HR+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.
      Patients in the phase 1b expansion will have the same exclusion and inclusion criteria except
      that they will only be allowed to have up to two lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the
      metastatic setting.
