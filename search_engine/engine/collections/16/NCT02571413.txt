      moderate to severe intermittent or persistent AR who had never used INCS. The patients were
      randomly divided into 2 groups; 1) Teaching how to use INCS by oral presentation and 2) by
      animated cartoon-aided teaching. Successful achievements were recorded when the patients were
      able to use INCS (all five-point checklists) correctly. If they were unable to use the INCS
      correctly after the first teaching, the same instruction would be repeated and the second
      assessment would be performed.
