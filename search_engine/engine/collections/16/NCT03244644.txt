    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3
      study of a microbiota suspension of intestinal microbes. The primary assessments for this
      study are (i) efficacy of RBX2660 as compared to a Placebo in preventing recurrent episodes
      of CDI and (ii) safety via assessment of adverse events. Follow-up office visits occur at
      weeks 1-, 4- and 8 after completing the blinded study treatment. Telephone assessments for
      adverse events occur during weeks 2, 3 and 6 after the study enema and at months 3 and 6.
      Patients who have had at least one recurrence after a primary episode and have completed at
      least one round of standard-of-care oral antibiotic therapy or have had at least two episodes
      of severe CDI resulting in hospitalization within the last year may be eligible for the
      study. Study Subjects who are deemed failures following the blinded treatment per the
      pre-specified treatment failure definition may elect to receive an unblinded RBX2660 enema.
