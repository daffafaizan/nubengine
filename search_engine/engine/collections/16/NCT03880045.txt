      women in the reproductive age group. The major problem with myomectomy is excessive bleeding
      from the increased uterine blood supply. This can be life-threatening, resulting in blood
      transfusions, febrile morbidity, and potentially in loss of reproductive potential from a
      hysterectomy. Knowledge of the effectiveness of the interventions used to reduce blood loss
      during myomectomy is essential to enable evidence-based clinical decisions. Topical
      application of tranexamic acid(TA) provides a high drug concentration at the site of the
      wound and a low systemic concentration. Studies from cardiac and orthopedic surgery have
      shown an equal or superior effect of topical compared with intravenous TA on both bleeding
      and transfusion requirement. Topical treatment is cost-effective, and adverse effects or drug
      interactions have not been reported
