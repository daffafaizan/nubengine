    
      Ad.hIFN-Î± (SCH 721015, adenoviral-mediated interferon alpha) is a replication-defective
      recombinant adenoviral vector containing the human interferon-alpha (hIFN-alpha) gene. This
      Phase I study is designed to evaluate the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of two
      doses of Ad.hIFN-alpha injected into the pleural (intrapleural, IP) and given 4 days apart in
      subjects with pleural mesothelioma.

      Subjects who meet eligibility will have a pleural catheter placed 2 weeks prior to the first
      dose. Subjects are then admitted to the research center on Days 1 and 4 for dosing and
      overnight observation. Subjects are then followed-up as outpatients for a total of 6 months.
      Radiographic evaluations are repeated on Day 64 and at 6 months. The pleural catheter is
      removed once it is not necessary.
