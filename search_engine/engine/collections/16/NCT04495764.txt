    
      This is a multi-center, prospective registry study of subjects undergoing hemodialysis for
      treatment of end-stage renal disease in a DaVita center.

      The objective of this study is to understand whether and to what degree anti-SARS-CoV-2
      antibodies mitigate the risk of subsequent SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID disease within the
      ESKD population.

      Following informed consent, participants will undergo baseline serologic characterization for
      anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG. The study is planned to align with the present wave of COVID-19.
      Enrollment will continue until the total sample size of 2500 is reached or until the study
      sponsor determines. Should there be a subsequent wave of COVID- 19, participants will be
      actively surveiled for evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and for COVID-19 disease. The
      relationship between baseline serologic status and subsequent infection/disease will be
      determined.

      This study will have 2 distinct phases.

      Phase 1 (baseline characterization) start will be triggered by the sponsor and may start at
      different times at the active sites. Participants will be consented and enrolled and blood
      will be collected for anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

      Phase 2: Start will be triggered by the sponsor in the fall of 2020 and each geographic study
      location may be triggered to start at separate times. Study participants will be followed
      prospectively for incidence and severity of COVID-19. Study visits will commence upon sponsor
      trigger and will occur once monthly for 4 months.
