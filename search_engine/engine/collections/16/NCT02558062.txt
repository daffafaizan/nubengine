      and patients with lung infection to assess the imaging parameters of BAC ONE over human
      autofluorescence and to assess if bacteria can be detected in vivo in situ within the distal
      lung.

      The primary endpoint is to visualise the delivery of a microdose of BAC ONE and assess
      imaging parameters in:

        -  3 mechanically ventilated patients to provide a control population (cohort 1)

        -  6 bronchiectasis patients with predominant colonisation with gram-negative bacteria
           (cohort 2)

        -  6 bronchiectasis patients with predominant colonisation with gram-positive bacteria
           (cohort 3)

        -  3 patients with suspected pneumonia and pulmonary infiltrates in ICU (cohort 4)

      For all cohorts, eligibility will be verified by a clinical trial physician after written
      informed consent has been obtained. For all cohorts, a bronchoscopy with lavage will be
      performed to harvest broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF). Fibre-based endomicroscopy (FE)
      will be performed on up to three areas and up to 80μg (± 25%) in total of BAC ONE will be
      instilled in up to 3 sites.

      Participants will be asked to provide additional blood and urine samples with the intention
      of examining for systemic uptake of the BAC ONE probe. Routine blood investigations will be
      performed 4-6 hours following the administration of BAC ONE. All participants will either be
      contacted by a member of the research team via telephone or ward visit 24 hours (± 4 hours)
      after BAC ONE dosing to ensure no AEs/SAEs were experienced. The participant's involvement in
      the study is concluded when the 24 hour assessment has been successfully completed and all
      AEs/SAEs have been resolved.
