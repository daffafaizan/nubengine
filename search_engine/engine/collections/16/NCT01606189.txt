      during a one to two week baseline period, then entered a three period, double blind,
      randomised crossover of GW-1000-02, GW-2000-02 and placebo. Each period lasted two weeks,
      with no washout between periods. There were six possible treatment sequences. The primary
      analysis was based on Box Scale-11 pain severity scores recorded throughout the study in
      patient daily diary booklets. Blood samples were taken from patient-volunteers at the
      beginning of each period, for measurement of plasma cannabinoid concentration.
