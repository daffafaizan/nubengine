      Phase II/III trial. It will be conducted globally. The study will evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of SCTA01 compared to placebo both given with BSC in participants with severe
      COVID-19. The subjects will be randomized by 1:1 ratio to SCTA01 and placebo group. The
      primary objective of the study is to evaluate participant survival from randomization to Day
      29 between study group and control group. At the end of the Phase II part of the study, an
      interim analysis will be performed for safety run-in and futility stopping.
