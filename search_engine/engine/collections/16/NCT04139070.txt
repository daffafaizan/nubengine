      of electrochemotherapy as a palliative treatment for advanced (non-curable) gastric cancer.
      The study involves recruitment of 8 patients with histologically verified and non-curable
      gastric cancer (including Siewert Type II and II). Patients will be recruited from Department
      of Surgery, Odense University Hospital and from Zealand University Hospital after their case
      has been reviewed by the multidisciplinary team (MDT). Electrochemotherapy will take place at
      Department of Surgery, Zealand University Hospital. After the treatment patients will be
      referred to Odense University Hospital for follow-up. Electrochemotherapy will be performed
      as an additive treatment to standard oncological care. Patients are treated once and will be
      followed with endoscopy, biopsies, scans, blood samples and questionnaires after 4-6 weeks
      and 8-12 weeks with a minimum interval of 4 weeks.
