      In many surgical procedures where the risk of infection is relatively low and the
      postoperative infection can be treated properly, the role of antibiotics is not clear.

      Despite the lack of evidence from prospective randomized controlled trials of evaluation, the
      use of antibiotics in plastic surgery is widespread in order to offer the highest safety
      standards patients.

      The breast reduction is defined as "clean surgery" with a lower infection rate to 3.4%. Thus,
      the antibiotic is not recommended. However, studies have shown a real rate of infection
      associated with procedures ranging from 4-36%.

      Thus, this trial was designed to verify the role of antibiotics in reduction mammaplasty.
