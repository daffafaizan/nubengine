      the efficiency of the implementation in the Spanish Health System of a telematic system
      applied to metabolic control optimization for type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM1) patients.

        -  Protocol:

           1) Pre-intervention. After the patient is informed and accepts the protocol they make 2
           visits for planning individual treatment. 2) Random Assignment in 2 Groups: A)
           Intervention (telecare system). B) Control. The intervention group patients will be
           trained in the telecare system machine. Both groups will make the same number of 6
           visits over 6 months: Intervention Group (5 telematics and 1 hospital), Control group (6
           hospital). Results will be assessed at 3 and 6 months and reassessed at 12 months.

        -  Patients The objective of the present study is to demonstrate that telematic control of
           diabetes mellitus is not inferior to the face to face visit control system, while
           showing an added value an important reduction in costs. Cost information from three
           studies have been used for the calculation of the sample 2,3,20 in diabetes mellitus 1
           (DM1) patients, some followed in a telematic form (210 ± 184€) and other in the form of
           face to face visits (376 ± 278€). Relating to this, 72 patients per group are needed to
           obtain a statistical power of 99% and an alpha level of 0.05 (two-sided). 80 patients
           per group will be needed to be randomised taking into account a 10% loss percentage.
