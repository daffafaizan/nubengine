      therapy for psychiatric symptoms. ECT application is repeated 8-12 times according to the
      treatment of the patient. This treatment is done in 2 or 3 days intervals. The most adverse
      effects of ECT are headache, memory disorders, myalgia, nausea and vomiting, cardiovascular
      problems. The most common seen adverse effect is headache with approximately 60% incidence.
      The main drugs used for the treatment of headache related to ECT are NSAIs and paracetamol.
      The aim of the current study is to compare the effect of paracetamol and dexketoprofen
      trometamol on headache treatment after ECT.
