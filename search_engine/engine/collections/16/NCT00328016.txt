      trained in either computer-guided breathing exercises or meditative relaxation to breathing.
      The computer-guided breathing exercise involves listening to tones of ascending and
      descending pitch to which breathing is entrained to low frequencies over a 15 minute
      interval. The meditative relaxation involves passive attention to natural breathing for the
      same duration. Participants will perform these breathing exercises daily at home for four
      weeks. Before and after the intervention, respiratory, cardiovascular, and urinary endogenous
      digitalis-like factors will be systematically recorded to determine the extent to which
      chronic neuroendocrine changes underlie the reductions in blood pressure.
