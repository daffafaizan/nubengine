      eczema; ultraviolet A1 is sometimes used but is not a widely available treatment. We do not
      know the most important chromophores in treating atopic eczema; in which phototherapy is
      thought to work by improving epidermal barrier function, having beneficial effects on skin
      microbiome and local immunosuppression.

      It seems plausible that there are several chromophores (the molecules that absorb the
      ultraviolet photons to set in chain the effects we are aiming for) and that 'targetting'
      several chromophores at once with different wavebands should help. For severe eczema that has
      not responded adequately to narrowband UVB or ultraviolet A1 alone the combination is
      sometimes used in the few centres where UVA1 is available.

      This study is to test if the combination is moderately to greatly more effective than
      narrowband ultraviolet B monotherapy amongst patients referred for any form of first-line
      phototherapy for atopic eczema.
