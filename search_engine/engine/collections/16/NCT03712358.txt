      IIIB, IIIC, and IV recurrent melanoma patients as determined by DLTs by cohort, as well as in
      those retreated with PVSRIPO, when PVSRIPO is injected intralesionally into 1 to 3 or more
      cutaneous or subcutaneous lesions. As planned, up to 18 patients may be treated with PVSRIPO.

      Biopsy material will be obtained from tumor tissue prior to and following virus
      administration, which may be subjected to routine histology along with molecular genetic
      testing and evaluation of pathological response. Whole blood for immunologic analyses will
      also be collected throughout the study period.

      Routine study visits will occur through Day 126. Thereafter, visits will occur every 2-3
      months for up to 2 years for subjects who do not progress. For patients with progressive
      disease, chart review only will occur every 3 months starting at the time of progression.

      Patients who previously participated in Cohorts 0 through 3, who in the opinion of the
      investigator, may benefit from continued PVSRIPO administration, may be eligible to receive
      additional injections.
