      Family-Based Treatment for Adolescents (CA CIFFTA) to directly address key targets related to
      self-harm behavior (e.g., depression, emotion dysregulation, LGBT, culture-related stressors,
      and trauma-related stressors); (b) refines the technological aspects of CA CIFFTA for
      web-based delivery; and (c) tests the preliminary efficacy of the new intervention and its
      delivery system in a randomized trial of 100 Hispanic adolescents and their parents. The
      investigators seek to reduce risk for repeated self-harm by showing treatment effects on
      depression, emotion regulation, substance use, and family functioning. Participants are
      randomly assigned to CA CIFFTA or Treatment-As-Usual and treatment covers a four month
      period.
