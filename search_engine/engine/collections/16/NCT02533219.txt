      remains difficult to treat because of the requirement for extensive amounts of glucose and
      the lack of effective long-term medical therapy. Correct diagnosis, localization, and limited
      excision of the focal lesion will result in a complete cure of the patient. In contrast,
      medically unresponsive diffuse disease requires a near total pancreatectomy, greatly
      increasing the risk of future diabetes mellitus. Fortunately, [18F]-DOPA PET has been shown
      to be a useful noninvasive imaging method for distinguishing between focal and diffuse forms
      of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia. In this study, the investigators seek to validate the
      effectiveness of using PET/MR and PET/CT with F-DOPA to accurately and reliably detect and
      localize disease.
