      due to late abortions, premature deliveries and painless dilatation. These 3 situations are
      usually due to cervical incompetence though can be caused by infection and other factors.

      The cerclage is usually placed from 12-24 weeks of gestation depending on the indication and
      medical follow up during pregnancy. There are 2 methods for cerclage performance-McDonald and
      Shirodkar that have the same efficacy.

      After recruiting the participant, Trans vaginal sonography will be used to examine cervical
      length and funneling. In addition vaginal examination will be performed to evaluate the
      cervix. After placing the cerclage, the participant will be invited every 4 weeks for a
      follow up evaluation session in order to examine the cervix and cerclage position. Each
      follow up will include a vaginal examination and trans vaginal sonography. The trans vaginal
      sonography will examine total cervical length, funneling, and the cerclage's distance from
      the inner and outer os' of the cervix.
