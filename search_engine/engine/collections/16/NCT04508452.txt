    
      It is an investigator-initiated, single institution, prospective, single-arm clinical study
      to evaluate the efficacy and safety of reintroduction of modified XELOXIRI combined with
      bevacizumab as first-line therapy in patients with unresectable mCRC. Eligible patients will
      receive 12 cycles of mXELOXIRI with bevacizumab and then MDT will be initiated to determine
      whether to perform a surgery or receive the maintenance therapy until disease progression
      (PD). At the time of PD, patients will re-introduce XELOXIRI plus bev at the same doses and
      schedule previously tolerated, for a maximum of 12 cycles.
