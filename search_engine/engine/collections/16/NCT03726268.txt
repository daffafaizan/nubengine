      outpatient surgery with long-duration opioids (methadone), compared with conventional
      short-duration opioids, achieves better analgesia, with similar or diminished side effects,
      may reduce development of chronic postsurgical pain, improves recovery, and importantly,
      decreases postoperative opioid consumption and could hence diminish take-home opioid
      prescribing and shrink the population reservoir of unused opioids available for diversion and
      misuse. Two cohorts will be studied, but analyzed separately. 1) Short-stay, anticipated
      next-day discharge surgery (compare short-duration vs long-duration opioid), 2) Same-day
      discharge surgery (compare short-duration vs long-duration opioid).
