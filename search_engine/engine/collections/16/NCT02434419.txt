    
      A prospective randomized clinical trial of patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve
      gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) during 2014 was performed.

      Patients were randomly assigned using a random-number table into 3 groups: those patients
      undergoing percutaneous electrostimulation (PENS) of the pectoral muscle combined with
      specific training (Group 1), those patients doing the specific training alone (Group 2) and
      those patients without any specific treatment (Group 3).

      The assigned treatment began 15 days after surgery and was maintained during 12 weeks.
