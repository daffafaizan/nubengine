      a day. Group 2 - physical activity twice a day and group 3 - control.

      The physical activity program is based on the Moyer-Mileur et al protocol (1). Briefly, this
      protocol involves extension and flexion range-of-motion exercise against passive resistance
      of both the upper and lower extremities. Both extension and flexion were performed five times
      at the wrist, elbow, shoulder, ankle, knee, and hip joints (about 10 minutes for each
      session). Infant in group 1 have the physical activity intervention once a day, 5 days a
      week. Infant in group 2 will have the same physical activity intervention twice a day, five
      times a week. Infant in group 3, the control group will have a similar time (10 minutes) of
      daily interactive periods of holding and stroking without range-of-motion activity.

      The physical activity will be done by the same person (the NICU physiotherapist) Growth
      parameters, and bone strength, will be measured at enrollment and every 2 weeks till
      discharge.

      Bone strength assessment will be determined by quantitative ultrasound measurement of bone
      speed of sound (SOS) at the middle left tibial shaft (Sunlight Omnisense Premier). All
      measurements will be performed by the same person, who will be blinded to the group
      assignment.

      Cytokines study In a sub-group of patients who will have arterial line at enrollment blood
      sample ( 0.6 CC) will be drawn before and immediately following activity for assessment of
      proinflammatory (IL-6) and anti-inflammatory ( IL1-ra) cytokines. Samples will be kept at
      -20ยบ C and will be analyzed after completion of the study.
