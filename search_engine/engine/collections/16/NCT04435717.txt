    
      National, unicenter, randomized, open-label, controlled phase II clinical trial with a drug
      marketed and administered under conditions of use other than those approved.

      The study is designed to evaluate the effect of adding Tocilizumab to standard or standard of
      care for patients infected with COVID-19 and diagnosed with mild-moderate pneumonia.

      78 patients are expected to be included in the study in a single center in Spain. The study
      includes a selection and randomization period, and a 28-day follow-up period (or until death,
      or premature withdrawal, whichever is earlier). Once the patients complete the study, they
      will continue with their usual follow-up.
