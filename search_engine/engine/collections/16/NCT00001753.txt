      human skeletal muscle. Tests will be conducted at rest and during concentric dorsiflexion
      exercise of the Tibialis anterior (TA) muscle using an existing custom-designed dynamometer
      in conjunction with mild local heating and cooling. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS),
      performed in a 4-tesla whole-body NMR system, will be used to non-invasively measure muscle
      temperature and energy-state. Specifically these tests will assess the extent to which
      temperature changes occur during aerobic exercise and how small temperature changes affect
      mitochondrial function in-vivo.
