        -  Determine the safety, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CCI-779 in
           patients with advanced solid tumors (part I) who are not receiving anticonvulsant
           therapy.

        -  Determine the safety, tolerability, and MTD in patients with recurrent gliomas or brain
           metastases (part II) who are receiving anticonvulsant therapy.

        -  Determine the preliminary pharmacokinetic profile and antitumor activity of CCI-779 in
           these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

        -  Part I: Patients receive CCI-779 IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5, followed by a 9 day
           rest period. Treatment courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      The maximum tolerated dose for part I is defined as the dose level at which 33% of patients
      experience dose limiting toxicity.

        -  Part II: Patients receive the same treatment schedule as part I. Three patients with CNS
           tumors are entered at the dose of CCI-779 determined to be the MTD in Part I. At least 3
           patients are entered at each dose level in part II.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for part I for this study within
      8 months, and 12 patients will be accrued for part II within 7 months.
