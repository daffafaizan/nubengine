    
      To determine the timing and distribution of sensation recovery of breast after mastectomy and
      breast reconstruction, both with autologous and implant-based reconstruction. Also, to
      determine the role of innervated free tissue transfer in breast reconstruction.

      Specific Aims

        1. Determine the timing and degree of return of breast in women who underwent mastectomy
           with autologous tissue or with implant based reconstruction.

        2. Determine sensation following neurotized free flap reconstruction

        3. Determine whether neurotization has an impact on quality of life measures post
           operatively

      Study Design Patients will be enrolled prospectively in this data collection study in which
      they will receive the standard of care for breast cancer resection and oncologically safe and
      accepted means of breast reconstruction with tissue expander and/or prosthetic implants.
      Patients will receive additional, non-invasive sensory testing, performed at standard follow
      up intervals in clinic by their reconstructive team. All patients participating in the study
      will be consented for enrollment at the pre-operative visit by either the surgeon or
      physician assistant. As this is a prospective study, all women fitting inclusion criteria
      over a 6-month minimal, but projected goal 12-month period will be included.
