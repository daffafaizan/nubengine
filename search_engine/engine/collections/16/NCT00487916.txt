    
      AMA1-C1 with Montanide ISA 720, is a blood stage malaria vaccine candidate. The objectives of
      this phase 1 trial are to study the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of this
      vaccine and to assess the level, kinetics, and the in vitro biological activity of the
      antibody response it induces. The study is an open label, dose escalation, phase 1 clinical
      trial in healthy adult volunteers. Volunteers will be screened and 28 participants will be
      enrolled into 3 dose cohorts. Cohort 1 will receive 5 micrograms of AMA1-C1/ISA 720 at each
      injection, Cohort 2 will receive 20 micrograms, and Cohort 3 will receive 80 micrograms.
      Cohorts 1 and 2 will receive 2 injections, 3 months apart. Cohort 3 will receive only 1
      vaccination. Safety outcome measures are local and systemic (including laboratory) adverse
      events. Immune responses to vaccination will be measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay
      (ELISA) and parasite growth inhibition assay (GIA), and will be compared among dose groups.
