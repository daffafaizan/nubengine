      chemotherapeutic regimen Doxorubicin when combined with Avastin®. Soft tissue sarcomas are
      highly vascular tumors and are therefore ideally suited to trials combining angiogenic
      inhibitors with chemotherapy. Several studies have revealed correlations between prognosis
      and surrogates for angiogenesis, including microvessel density, and circulating VEGF and
      basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of Avastin® in combination with Doxorubicin for the treatment of advanced
      soft-tissue sarcomas.
