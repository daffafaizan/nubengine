    
      Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis is a recessively inherited in born of bile acid synthesis due
      to a mutation in sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27A1). Patients with this disease suffer from
      xanthomas located in the brain and tendon, accelerated atherosclerosis progression neurologic
      disease and cataracts. Plasma cholesterol levels are normal but cholestanol and C-27 bile
      alcohol that precursor of bile acid synthesis accumulate and are believe are responsible for
      the atherosclerosis, xanthomas and neurologic disease. Analysis of the bile reveal a severe
      sufficiency of the primary bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid that can not be produce because of
      the inherited defect. However, replacement of chenodeoxycholic acid in the enterohepatic pool
      inhibit abnormal bile acid synthesis and reduces the elevated level of cholestanol and C-27
      bile alcohol this therapy halt the neurologic disease and prevents symptomatic
      atherosclerosis developing.
