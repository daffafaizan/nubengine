        -  Determine the optimal (in terms of antibody response) and safe dose range of
           glycosylated MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccine with adjuvant GPI-0100 in patients with
           biochemically relapsed prostate cancer.

        -  Assess post-immunization changes in prostate-specific antigen levels and other objective
           parameters of disease in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of GPI-0100.

      Patients receive glycosylated MUC-2-Globo H-KLH conjugate vaccine with adjuvant GPI-0100
      subcutaneously weekly on weeks 0-2, 6, 14, and 26 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression.

      Cohorts of 5 patients receive escalating doses of GPI-0100 until the optimal dose, based on
      antibody response, is reached.

      Patients are followed every 3 months.
