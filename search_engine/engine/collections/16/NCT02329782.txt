      the primary outcomes of dose-taking HIV antiretroviral (ART) adherence and undetectable HIV
      viral load in a multi-site randomized controlled trial. The ARP is based on the Information
      Motivation Behavioral skills (IMB) model of behavior change and includes (1) brief pill
      taking practice trials for enhancing pre-treatment adherence counseling and providing a
      behavioral criterion for determining adherence readiness and the start of treatment, and (2)
      a performance driven dose regulation mechanism to tailor the amount of counseling (from
      pre-treatment through the full course of treatment) to the individual needs of the patient
      and conserve limited resources. Participants will be randomized to receive either the ARP
      (adherence counseling sessions) or usual care. Primary assessments will be administered at
      screening and every 6 months after ART initiation over a 24-month follow-up, making it one of
      the few studies to examine intervention effects longer than one year. Secondary outcomes
      include dose-timing adherence and CD4 count. If effective, the ARP will provide clinicians
      with an intervention that (1) informs providers and patients when the patient is ready to
      adhere well and start treatment, (2) enhances adherence readiness from the outset of
      treatment through the full course of therapy, and (3) tailors the amount of adherence support
      based on individual patient need and performance, thus more efficiently using clinic
      resources, fostering better acceptance from providers and patients, and increasing the
      likelihood of successful program adoption and dissemination. This emphasis on efficient use
      of resources will be complemented by a cost-effectiveness analysis to further inform policy
      decisions regarding the transportability of the intervention and its potential for more wide
      scale use and sustainability if effective.
