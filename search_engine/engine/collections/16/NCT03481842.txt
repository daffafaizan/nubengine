      and deeper stroma, including the secretory glands. Each layer is characterized by the
      presence of a large number of blood vessels, through which a sufficient amount of blood is
      delivered. A large number of these vessels and arteries go to the surface layers due to
      myometrium and form a capillary network in the stroma.

      In the vaginal suppositories, the investigators applied minimally therapeutic doses of
      inhibitors of neoangiogenesis, as well as other components that caused the pathological
      growth of the endometrium.

      Anti-angiogenic therapy - inhibition of proliferative processes in the vascular wall of
      capillaries and small vessels in the endometrium, is the determining factor of the
      therapeutic effect of endometriosis when treated with vaginal suppositories.

      The composition of the suppository:

        -  Axitinib, Afatinib, Linifanib (ABT-869) in a minimally sufficient therapeutic doses

        -  Auxiliary substances that ensure a uniform release of active components from
           suppositories, taking into account the dependence of this process on the chemical nature
           of the basis, surfactant, dissolution medium.

      (the composition and amount of excipients are maximally optimal for bioavailability of drugs
      from suppositories, taking into account the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and synergy of
      active drugs) This therapy has a slight teratogenic effect, which should be taken into
      account when planning pregnancy.
