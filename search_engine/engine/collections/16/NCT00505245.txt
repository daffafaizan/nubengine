      I. To examine how the MD Anderson Inventory (MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [MDASI]) or other
      MD Anderson-developed patient reported outcome (PRO) instrument performs in various sample
      populations including community dwelling adults and patients who have different cancer types,
      who have undergone various treatments, and who have different and/or more severe symptoms.

      II. To evaluate the MDASI or other MD Anderson-developed PRO instrument as an estimate of
      functional status and quality of life.

      III. To assess the impact of symptom severity on standard function and health-related quality
      of life measures, including both quantitative and qualitative measures (patient interviews).

      IV. To assess the pattern and severity of symptoms over multiple time points in order to
      assay the system's responsiveness to changes due to therapy or disease.

      V. To explore the utility of an interactive voice response (IVR) system in enhancing the
      clinical care of outpatients.

      VI. To explore the effect of information from an IVR symptom assessment system on the pattern
      of care and development of interdisciplinary protocols.

      VII. To explore the feasibility of developing symptom management pathways for patients based
      on these symptom and quality of life data.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants complete questionnaires and quality of life assessments, and may also complete
      interviews over 45 minutes periodically.
