      anesthetics inside a fascia plane using a needle.

      Actually no evidence supports the use of a needle upon one other. Investigators would like to
      compare "Ultraplex 360®" (Braun) needle with " STIMUPLEX D SH, 30°"(Braun) while performing a
      Trasversus Abdominis Plane Block on BluePhantom simulator.

      Ultraplex 360® (Braun) has an innovative surface pattern and clear coating that could result
      in better ultrasound visualization and tip identification.
