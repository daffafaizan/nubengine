      the treatment of patients with metastatic HER2-positive breast cancer. Patients will be
      randomized 1:1 to T-DM1 with or without palbociclib.

      Hypotheses: Combination of T-DM1 with palbociclib improves progression free survival compared
      to single agent T-DM1

      Primary objective: Compare progression free survival of the combination arm (T-DM1 with
      palbociclib) to single agent T-DM1

      Secondary objectives i) Compare response rates between both treatment arms ii) Compare
      overall survival between both treatment arms

      Correlative objectives i) Investigate predictive biomarkers of response in blood and archived
      tumor tissue ii) Investigate mechanisms of resistance for palbociclib in blood and tumor
      tissue
