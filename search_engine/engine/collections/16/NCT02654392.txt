    
      Double-blind placebo controlled study with two groups: a PUFA supplemented group (over 5
      weeks) and a placebo (corn syrup) group. Participants are matched for initial exercise
      performance and assigned to each of the two groups systematically so the initial group means
      are similar. This is done by ranking all individuals from highest to lowest and assigning the
      participant with the highest score randomly to the treatment group and the other to the
      placebo group. Then, for the next two individuals in ranking, the highest of the two is
      assigned to the placebo group and the other to the treatment group. This procedure is
      repeated for all participant pairs. Of course, this is done separately for men and women
      because on average the men have greater exercise performance scores.

      Dosage is 3.8 capsules/70kg body mass (rounded to the nearest capsule; 1 capsule contains
      369mg PUFA from Flax, Evening Primrose, Pumpkin, Sunflower, and Coconut oil; <4 Calories) or
      isoenergetic placebo capsules (containing corn syrup) plus 2 capsules 20 minutes prior to
      exercise workouts. Eighteen recreationally active student volunteers (18-35 years old) will
      be recruited to complete 4 exercise tests: a cycle time trial (~15 minutes), a cycle maximal
      power test (30 second Wingate test), a maximal aerobic power test (running treadmill test)
      plus a strength/endurance test (number of bench presses with 60 kg load) pre- and post 5
      weeks of daily supplementation. There will an accommodation day pre-study where each
      participant is familiarized with the tests to be used. Each exercise test will be completed
      on a separate day with at least 48 hours between each test day due to the fatiguing nature of
      the testing.
