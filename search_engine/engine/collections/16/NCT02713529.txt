      the selected starting dose of AMG 820 in combination with pembrolizumab. Phase 2 of the study
      will further evaluate safety and tolerability and additionally test whether AMG 820 can
      enhance the anti-tumor activity observed historically with pembrolizumab alone and/or
      overcome lack of response to pembrolizumab monotherapy in subjects with select solid tumors.
