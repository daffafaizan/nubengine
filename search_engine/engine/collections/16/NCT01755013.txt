      the association of this malignant condition with high morbidity and mortality is well
      recognized. It originates from the epithelium of bile ducts or ductules. Two types have been
      described: the peripheral type occurring in the parenchyma of the liver and the central type
      occurring within or related to the major bile ducts. Surgery can offer a curative chance, but
      only a minority of patients are candidates for this therapy at initial presentation since
      most patients are found with an unresectable tumor.

      In unresectable cases, the median survival is 6 months. Since morbidity and mortality from
      CCA occurs because of biliary obstruction, successful palliation of that complication is the
      main goal in these patients. Surgical biliary bypass can be offered in order to prolong life
      and relieve symptoms. This intervention is unfortunately complicated by 30-day postoperative
      mortality rate between 7 and 24%. Moreover, the quality of life following surgery is only
      improved in a minority because of the time needed to recover from surgery.

      Endoscopic biliary stenting during endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
      offers relief from obstructive jaundice without the high morbidity and mortality associated
      with surgery. In addition, a study by Luman et al even showed significant improvement in
      emotional, cognitive and global health scores following stenting. But this relief is
      unfortunately temporary since stents tend to become obstructed.

      Local therapies including iridium brachytherapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) may prevent or
      postpone these problems.
