      particular problem in the U.S. Veteran population. Furthermore, U.S. Veterans who live in
      rural areas may be at even greater risk for suicide than their urban counterparts. These
      risks may be concentrated during times of transition in their treatment such as after
      emergency room discharge. Multiple interventions have been developed to target suicide risk
      during periods of transition but there is limited evidence regarding their efficacy in
      preventing suicide. Furthermore, a key contributor to suicide risk may include limited or no
      engagement in care. Therefore, developing interventions to support engagement in treatment
      may be effective ways to help mitigate suicide risk and promote participation in care. This
      clinical trial studies an intervention that is designed to help support treatment engagement
      during periods of high risk in Veterans who live in rural areas. The trial will recruit
      Veterans from various treatment settings such as the emergency room and the residential drug
      treatment programs and follow them for a period of three months. The trial evaluates not only
      the effect of the intervention on suicidal behavior but also measures of engagement.
