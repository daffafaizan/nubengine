    
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic relapsing inflammatory bowel disease affecting
      approximately 90 000 patients in France, mostly at young age, and altering their quality of
      life.

      Conventional Immunosuppressive treatment (ie azathioprine, anti-TNF (tumor necrosis factor ),
      vedolizumab) used in UC are expensive and associated with potentially severe complications
      such as infections and cancers.

      UC pathogenesis remains poorly understood but involves an inappropriate immune response
      toward an unbalanced gut microbiota (called dysbiosis) in predisposed hosts.

      Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is now recommended in guidelines for treating
      recurrent Clostridium difficile infection. Although the pathogenesis involved in UC is
      different, FMT is a potential therapeutic strategy as transferring a healthy microbiota in an
      UC patient could restore the appropriate host-microbiota crosstalk.

      As the gut microbiota is dramatically altered by intestinal inflammation, transferring a
      massive amount of microbial organisms in an inflamed gut with epithelial barrier disruption
      might be a suboptimal strategy and could even have detrimental effects by allowing bacterial
      translocation.

      Thus, it's possible that performing FMT in UC patients who achieved remission after
      conventional treatment might be associated with better clinical outcome than in patients with
      active disease.
