    
      This is a randomized, controlled, single-blind, single-center, Phase 1 study in twenty normal
      healthy volunteers. Each subject will have a single 15 minute exposure to each of three
      topical Capsaicin Dermal Liquids and the control. Each application site, located on the
      distal and proximal anterior medial thigh areas, will be 5.0 Ã— 5.0 cm in size. The volume
      applied will be 15 mcL per cm2 and hence the total volume applied will be 375 mcL.

      At baseline and prior to skin punch biopsy at Day 7, QST of the four application sites for
      warming and cooling detection thresholds, and assessment of mechanical (sharp pain) sensation
      and tactile thresholds, will be performed and evaluated. This will be repeated at each of the
      four application sites on Day 7 and the Termination Visit.
