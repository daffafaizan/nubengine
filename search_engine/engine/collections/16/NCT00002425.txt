      chosen by the investigator and patient. (This study provides only SQV.) Patients may not
      choose another protease inhibitor (PI) as part of their combination therapy; furthermore,
      patients taking PIs other than SQV must undergo a 5-day washout period before study-drug
      administration. Patients are monitored for adverse events and changes in routine laboratory
      tests, plasma viral load, and CD4+ T cell levels. Outcomes are analyzed by stratifying
      patients according to CD4+ T cell levels and prior history with protease inhibitors.
