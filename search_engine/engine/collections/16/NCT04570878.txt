    
      This prospective randomized controlled trial aims to examine the effect of subcostal
      transverse abdominis plane block on the postoperative pain and opioid consumption in patients
      (12yâ‰¤ age) who will undergo epigastric cardiac pacemaker operation.

      Patients will be allocated to either the SC TAP(subcostal transverse abdominis plane block)
      group or the control group (no block). Bilateral subcostal transverse abdominis plane block
      will be performed using 0.25% ropivacaine (0.5mL/kg for each side, MAX 20mL for each side)
      under ultrasound-guidance at the end of surgery.

      The pain score at 10 min after PACU admin, 1, 6, 24 hours after the surgery, the total opioid
      consumption at 12, and 24 hours after the surgery, the total dose of additional rescue
      analgesia (intravenous ketololac, acetaminophen, or fentanil) at 12 and 24 hour after the
      surgery will be recorded.
