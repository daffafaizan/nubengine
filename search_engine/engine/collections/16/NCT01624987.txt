      countries. Former child soldiers and ex-combatants often suffer from mental health problems
      and show enhanced levels of aggression. The present study focuses on the reduction of
      appetitive aggression and the improvement of mental health in former child soldiers and
      ex-combatants in DR Congo.

      The project consists of four steps:

        1. Training of selected DDRRR personnel(first generation)in FORNET (a variant of Narrative
           Exposure Therapy to treat trauma-related disorders and to reduce appetitive
           aggression)by experts from the University of Konstanz.

        2. Treatment phase 1: Intervention will be carried out by therapists of the first
           generation. The trained therapists of the first generation will be supervised from the
           experts of the University of Konstanz.

        3. Training of a second generation of DDRRR personnel in FORNET by the therapists of the
           first generation.

        4. Treatment phase 2: Intervention will be carried out by therapists of the second
           generation. The trained therapists of the second generation will be supervised from the
           therapists of the first generation.

      The study is conceived as a randomized controlled study. In phase 1 and in phase 2, study
      participants will be randomized allocated to the intervention group (FORNET) and the control
      group (no intervention). The treatment effect will be measured by pre-post and 6-months
      follow-up evaluations.
