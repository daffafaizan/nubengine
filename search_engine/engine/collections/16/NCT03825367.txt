      patients with hematologic malignancies. Patients will receive the first dose of nivolumab on
      day 1 along with AZA. After "chemotherapy priming", a second dose of nivolumab will be given
      at day 15 which will enhance the effect of nivolumab on the regenerating CD4+ and CD8+ memory
      T cells.

      To establish a recommended Phase II dose (RP2D)of nivolumab in combination with 5-azacytidine
      in children with relapsed or refractory AML. To assess the clinical activity of Nivolumab in
      combination with 5-azacytidine in AML patients with M2/M3 disease at study entry.
