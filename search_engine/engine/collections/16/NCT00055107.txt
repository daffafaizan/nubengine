    
      C. parvum is a significant opportunistic infection in much of the developing world, where
      children may not have access to highly active antiretroviral therapy. There is currently no
      established therapy for chronic cryptosporidiosis in HIV infected children. The FDA has
      approved NTZ for the treatment of cryptosporidiosis diarrhea; however, there are no data on
      the safety and effectiveness of NTZ in HIV infected children. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety of different doses of NTZ in HIV infected children with chronic diarrhea
      caused by C. parvum.

      In Step 1, participants will receive one of four different doses of NTZ. Participants will
      take NTZ twice a day for 56 days in either a liquid or pill form. All participants will be
      closely monitored for drug toxicity. There will be seven study visits; they will occur at
      study entry, Weeks 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8, and Day 70. Study visits will include a physical exam
      and blood, urine, and stool collection. Pharmacokinetic (PK) sampling will be performed
      during four of the study visits. PK sampling requires the participants to take their morning
      NTZ doses while in the clinic; participants will undergo additional blood collection either
      before or after taking NTZ. At the end of the 56-day study period, participants who are
      experiencing a positive clinical benefit from NTZ and who have had no harmful side effects
      may choose to continue taking NTZ for an additional 24 weeks and enter Step 2. Participants
      who do not continue taking NTZ after Day 56 will be followed for 2 additional weeks.
