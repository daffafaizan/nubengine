      research on sugar consumption is still a weak point among health indicators and there are no
      population studies to investigate the sugar intake in Brazilian population. Available data
      have shown reduction in the consumption of refined sugar (-37% between 1996 and 2003) but
      significant increase in consumption of soft drinks (400%), which constitute the main vehicle
      for consumption of added sugar. Moreover, studies have shown the adverse effects of excessive
      consumption of added sugar in dental caries and health, as excess energy intake hence in
      weight gain. Although several factors are associated with weight gain in adolescents, adults
      and elders, and several strategies have been released by both Brazil and International
      Agencies, as the Global Strategy, increased weight gain, particularly in adolescents, has
      been observed in several countries with large increase in Brazil, justifying specific
      projects to evaluate which messages, strategies and proposals for intervention would be
      effective.
