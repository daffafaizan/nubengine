      anaesthesia affects GCX less than general anaesthesia.

      The aim of the study: Comparison of two anaesthesia techniques with respect to GCX.

      Type of the study: Observational. Subjects: Adult patients ASA 2-3 undergoing elective total
      knee replacement surgery under general or regional anaesthesia. Sample size calculation
      (based on expected difference in PRB, alpha error I = 0,05 and study power = 0,99) = 52
      patients. Investigators plan to enroll of 60 consecutive patients to reach 30 patients with
      each type of anaesthesia. Intervention: none. Data to be recorded and analysed: Demographics,
      ASA, physiologic functions (during surgery and 24 hours after surgery), fluids given,
      sublingual microcirculation by SDF imaging will be recorded at time points: before
      anaesthesia, 24 hours after anaesthesia, clinical outcome indicators, microcirculatory data
      and Perfused Boundary Region.
