      stop smoking when pharmacotherapy is extended beyond the standard duration of treatment. We
      hypothesized that maintenance treatment with prolonged bupropion use and/or "as needed" use
      of nicotine gum will reduce relapse to smoking. Participants were recruited through
      advertisements on radio, television, newspapers, the Internet, and various community outlets.
      Respondents were pre-screened by telephone using a standard interview. The first participant
      entered the OLT phase in February 2001; the final NTFU visit took place in October 2005.

      The study was multi-phased consisting of: 1) eight-week open-label treatment (OLT) with
      bupropion and nicotine patch; 2) randomized double-blind assignment of OLT successes to 16
      weeks of placebo-controlled maintenance treatment (MT); and 3) 24 weeks of non-treatment
      follow-up (NTFU). Participants received $25 compensation for completing the NTFU visits at
      Weeks 36 and 48. The Institutional Review Board of the New York State Psychiatric Institute
      approved the study. The study was performed at the Columbia University Medical Center Smoking
      Cessation Clinic in New York City.
