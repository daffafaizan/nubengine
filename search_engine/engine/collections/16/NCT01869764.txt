      I. To determine if omega-3 dietary supplementation (omega-3 fatty acid) results in higher
      polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) levels in surgical specimens of normal and malignant
      breast tissue in women who took omega 3 tablets in comparison to those who took placebo.

      II. To determine if omega-3 dietary supplementation results in higher PUFA levels in plasma
      and red blood cells in women who took omega 3 tablets in comparison to those who took
      placebo.

      III. To determine if omega-3 dietary supplementation affects the metabolites of omega-3 and
      omega-6 PUFA in surgical specimens of malignant and normal breast tissue in comparison to
      controls.

      IV. To determine if women who take omega-3 dietary supplementation have less proliferation
      and greater apoptosis in malignant breast tissue in comparison to women who take placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive omega-3 fatty acid orally (PO) daily for 7-14 days.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO daily for 7-14 days.
