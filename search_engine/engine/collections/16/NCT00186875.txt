    
      In this study, subjects will be divided into high-risk and standard-risk subgroups according
      to the length of their first remission, the type of early cancer cell (T or B-cell) and the
      site or sites of disease relapse. The remission induction phase (the beginning phase of
      therapy) will consist of three blocks of therapy. Block A features daily IV low-dose
      etoposide in combination with cytarabine given by continuous IV, weekly vincristine, and
      daily dexamethasone. In block B, a combination of weekly PEG-asparaginase, vincristine, and
      daily dexamethasone will be given. Block C will be a combination of high-dose methotrexate,
      high-dose cytarabine, and teniposide.

      There will be two phases of consolidation (treatment phase after induction therapy).
      Additional therapy will be given between the two consolidation phases. Continuation will
      consist of eight weekly cycles of chemotherapy. Periodic intrathecal therapy (medicine given
      into the spinal fluid) will be given throughout the treatment. Participants who do not
      achieve remission (absence of leukemia) after consolidation will be offered enrollment on St.
      Jude NKEHM protocol (NK cell transplant). Hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) is
      planned for participants with high risk disease. HSCT will be done according to current
      institutional practice. The duration of chemotherapy will be one year for patients with
      extramedullary (outside the bone marrow) relapse and two years for all others.

      Exploratory objectives include:

        -  To determine the prevalence of MRD in children undergoing treatment for relapsed ALL and
           to compare the results to those obtained in children with newly diagnosed ALL.

        -  To compare the level of MRD in bone marrow and peripheral blood concomitantly in
           children undergoing treatment for relapsed ALL.

        -  To characterize the gene expression profile of leukemia cells at the time of diagnosis
           and relapse to improve our understanding of mechanisms of relapse and of the development
           of drug resistance.

        -  To study whether pre-existing or emerging development of serum antibodies to
           asparaginase is related to hypersensitivity reaction to asparaginase in patient with
           relapsed ALL.

      Detailed Description of Treatment Plan:

      All patients will receive the same remission induction. All high-risk patients will be
      offered HSCT which will be performed after a suitable donor is identified and preferably
      after MRD becomes negative. If they do not have a donor or they refuse HSCT, they will
      continue to receive chemotherapy. Standard-risk patients continue chemotherapy if MRD is
      negative after induction, but will be offered HSCT if MRD is >0.01% after Block C of
      Induction. Those who do not achieve morphological CR after induction will be treated
      according to the contingency plan.

      Plan for Stem Cell Transplant

      Patients who have positive MRD (high-risk or standard-risk) at the end of induction or all
      high-risk patients regardless of MRD are eligible for HSCT

        -  All high-risk patients are eligible for HSCT. HSCT will be performed as soon as MRD
           becomes negative after induction. If MRD becomes negative (<0.01%) and a donor has not
           been found, the patient will continue chemotherapy phases (Consolidation I, Interim
           Continuation, etc) until a suitable donor is found.

        -  Those who have persistent positive MRD (>0.01%) after Block C are also eligible for HSCT

      All standard-risk patients will continue chemotherapy if MRD is negative (<0.01%) after
      induction.

        -  If MRD is positive (>0.01%) after Block C of induction, they become eligible for HSCT.

        -  Standard-risk patients who have no response or progressive disease after Block A and who
           have positive MRD (>0.01%) after Block B will be candidates for HSCT. They will be
           re-evaluated after Block C. If MRD after Block C is positive, follow the plan above. If
           MRD is negative after Block C, the management will be discussed with Transplant Service

      Contingency Plan

      Patients who do not achieve morphological CR (M1 marrow) after Induction

      If CR (M1 marrow) is not achieved after Induction, patients will proceed to Consolidation I.
      If they do not achieve CR after Consolidation I, they will be offered enrollment on the St.
      Jude NKHEM protocol or offered alternative therapy. If they do not achieve CR after NKHEM,
      they will come off treatment.

      Patients who achieve CR but have positive MRD (>0.01%) after Block C of induction: Become
      eligible for HSCT. Up to two more courses of chemotherapy (course 1 and 2) will be given to
      attempt reducing MRD. They will receive HSCT as soon as MRD becomes negative (MRD may be
      repeated every 2-4 weeks as indicated).

      Standard-risk patients who have positive MRD (>0.01%) after Block B will proceed to Block C.
      Patients in this category will become candidates for HSCT, but if MRD becomes negative after
      Block C, the management will be discussed with Transplant Service. Chemotherapy may be
      administered to reduce MRD prior to HSCT. Patients will be transplanted as soon as the MRD
      becomes negative.

      Patients (high-risk or standard-risk) who achieved CR, but have positive MRD (>0.01%) after
      Block C of Induction will become eligible for HSCT. Up to two more courses of chemotherapy
      (course 1 and 2) will be given to attempt reducing MRD. They will receive HSCT as soon as MRD
      becomes negative. If MRD remains positive after course 2, then, they will proceed to HSCT
      after discussion with Transplant Service.

      Course 1

      Give chemotherapy according to the plan for Consolidation I. Start it immediately regardless
      of CBC. BMA will be performed when WBC >1000/microL, ANC >300/microL and platelets
      >50,000/microL. If MRD is negative, they will receive HSCT.

      Course 2

      This course will be given if MRD is positive after Course 1. Patients will be offered
      enrollment on St. Jude NKHEM protocol.

      If they are still MRD positive after Course 2, patients may receive Interim Continuation,
      Consolidation II, and then Continuation until MRD becomes negative or while awaiting HSCT.
