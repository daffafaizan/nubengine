      primates using electrophysiological techniques and in humans using functional neuroimaging.
      Their role is thought to be dual: i) they show sustained activity with the expectation of a
      future reward and ii) a phasic response after reward. Animal data indicate that these
      neurons, located in the midbrain areas A8-10, behave as a single functional unit when
      activated. They have rich projections to both the prefrontal and motor cortices where they
      synapse on interneurons and cortical pyramidal cells, producing primarily inhibition. Though
      their function is not fully understood, these projections clearly play an important role in
      motivation and learning. We have recently developed a pair of paradigms to detect a reward
      related signal in the primary motor cortex, where transcranial magnetic stimulation can be
      used to measure brief events. So far, we have tested healthy volunteers; we now intend to
      study Parkinson disease (PD) patients in order to help clarify the role of dopamine in effect
      of reward. The Parkinson patients will be tested both on and off levodopa/carbidopa and
      dopamine agonist medications. Our hypothesis is that the dopamine reward related signal will
      alter level of evocable inhibition in primary motor cortex. Using a behavioral paradigm that
      deliver intermittent reward, we aim to demonstrate, in treated and untreated PD patients a
      difference in the amount of cortical inhibition, i) when reward is expected compared to when
      reward is not expected and ii) after rewarded compared to unrewarded trials. We also aim to
      demonstrate a difference between their response and that of healthy controls.
