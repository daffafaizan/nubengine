      effectiveness, validity, noninferiority and important advantages in various neurological,
      cognitive diseases and musculoskeletal disorders; meaning an opportunity to define new social
      and intervention policies.

      Subjects are randomly assigned to 1) Telerehabilitation Group 2) Traditional Therapy Group.
      After randomization, patients in both groups received an initial evaluation. Data will be
      collected by a blinded evaluator.

      The Telerehabilitation group receives a standardized and customized exercises to perform,
      through a web application that allows the Physiotherapist generate videos, images and
      parameters of each exercise program and send them via email for each patient.

      Telerehabilitation program describes the exercises to be performed, the number of repetitions
      depending on the level of training and criteria for progression.

      Patients are initially supervised by a physiotherapist who will conduct three training
      sessions through individual videoconference, to ensure proper execution of exercises and
      encourage patient adherence. Patients are instructed to perform self-workout video exercises
      following Telerehabilitation program as well as a supporting document we call
      Telerehabilitation Manual Patient.

      of rehabilitation in Spain, personalized therapy consisting of 1 to 1 with a physical
      therapist and exercise programs at home.
