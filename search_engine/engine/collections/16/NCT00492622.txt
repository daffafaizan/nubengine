      profile and greater overall drug absorption in gastroparesis. This will result in shorter
      time to maximal drug concentration, greater maximal concentration, and greater total area
      under the curve of the concentration vs. time plot.

      Primary Objective: To compare the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole between immediate-release
      suspension and delayed-release capsules in patients with heartburn associated with
      gastroparesis.

      Study design: randomized, open-labeled, crossover treatment for 7 days with 10-14 days
      washout. Pharmacokinetic studies will be performed after 7 days on study drug.
