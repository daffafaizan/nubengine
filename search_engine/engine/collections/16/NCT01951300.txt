      radiopharmaceutical is intravenously injected as a bolus and whole-body distribution kinetics
      are studied by dynamic whole-body positron emission tomography/computed tomography. During
      imaging, serial venous blood samples are drawn, plasma is separated and radioactivity is
      measured by gamma counter. Immediately after imaging session, urine is voided and
      radioactivity is measured by gamma counting. As a final point, radiation dosimetry due to
      single Gallium-68 citrate injection is determined.
