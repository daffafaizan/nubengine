      species utilize the final pathway of hypothalamic secretion of gonadotropin releasing hormone
      (GnRH) to initiate and maintain the reproductive axis. Thus, GnRH is required for
      reproductive competence in the human. The classic studies from the 1970s clearly demonstrate
      that pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus is a prerequisite for physiologic
      gonadotrope function. Absence, decreased frequency or decreased amplitude of pulsatile GnRH
      release results in the clinical syndrome of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). The
      phenotypic expression of GnRH deficiency in the human demonstrates considerable
      heterogeneity. Defining the physiology of GnRH is critical to understanding the clinical
      heterogeneity of isolated GnRH deficiency and its comparison to other conditions resulting in
      hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). The overall goal of this protocol is to investigate the
      neuroendocrine control of reproduction and specifically the physiology and pathophysiology of
      GnRH secretion and action in the human male.

      Subjects will be selected from a group of adult men (18-65 years)based on the demonstration
      of a low testosterone level (<100 ng/dL) in association with low or inappropriately normal
      gonadotropin levels. All patients will undergo an initial assessment that includes an
      overnight 12-hour frequent blood sampling study to determine their degree of endogenous GnRH
      secretion. Following the overnight evaluation, subjects will have daily outpatient visits for
      7 consecutive days when they will receive a GnRH bolus followed by 2hrs of blood sampling.
