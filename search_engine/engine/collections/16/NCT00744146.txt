    
      Protexia is a pegylated form of recombinant human butyrylcholinesterase (PEG-rBChE).
      Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) is a naturally-occurring enzyme found in minute quantities in
      the blood. PharmAthene produces PEG-rBChE from the milk of transgenic goats. The enzyme is
      purified from the goat milk, formulated and pegylated to create Protexia.

      This is a dose escalation study of five dose levels of Protexia. Safety data through 14 days
      post-dosing will be evaluated by an independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) prior to
      escalating to a higher dose. The safety and tolerability of Protexia will be assessed using
      the DMID Adult Toxicity Table, May 2001 (Appendix D).

      If a dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is identified in any dosing group, dosing will be suspended
      until the AE(s) is/are assessed. The SMC will determine if the study can continue or if the
      previous dose will be declared the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). It is possible that an
      additional dosing group at a dose midway between the previous dosing group and the dose level
      that exceeded the MTD may be enrolled after consultation and agreement of the SMC.
