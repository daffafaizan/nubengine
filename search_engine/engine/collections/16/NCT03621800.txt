      menthol popsicle and usual care in elderly patients in the immediate postoperative period.
      This is a randomized clinical trial, to be performed in a public tertiary hospital. The
      sample size calculation will be performed after the pilot test is conducted. Two groups will
      be formed through randomization. The tested intervention consists of the menthol popsicle
      (experimental group). Thirst intensity (primary outcome) will be measured by means of the
      Visual Numerical Scale and the discomfort of thirst (secondary outcome) through the
      Perioperative Thirst Discomfort Scale, in two moments: at the end of the first assesment of
      the patient and 20 minutes after the intervention. With the results of this study the intend
      is to offer to the scientific society subsidies on thirst presented by the elderly patients,
      generating evidence for the improvement of clinical practice. In addition to contributing to
      the preparation of health professionals in the assertive care of the elderly population, it
      is estimated to deepen the knowledge about appropriate and innovative interventions to manage
      the postoperative thirst of the elderly, considered to be this, a representative and growing
      part of the world population.
