      early cerebrovascular involvement. Eligible patients are age above 18 years old (<=55 years
      old) with early cerebrovascular involvement and have provided inform consent. Patients who
      have been diagnosed Fabry disease are not eligible.

      The present study will use samples of early cerebrovascular involvement patients which have
      been enrolled in two previous IRB approved projects [103-3254C (origin 98-3889A3), 100-4008C
      (origin 97-0470B)], participants of both studies have consented that participants' samples
      could be further investigated if needed.

      Since, the investigators cannot ensure whether the condition of enzyme activity of frozen
      plasma sample were decayed after long-term storage and the investigators don't have available
      normal range of enzyme activity of historical plasma sample, the investigators will perform
      specific genotyping of Fabry disease for these patients according to the specific mutation
      variants which have been identified in Taiwan population previously.

      Patients will be recalled to assess Fabry related symptoms if genetic testing has mutation
      finding and family screening will be performed if applicable. Further inform consent will be
      obtained as well.
