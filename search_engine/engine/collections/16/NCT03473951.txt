      twenty-thousand individuals undergo an annual health exam in the investigators' hospital. The
      routine exam includes measurements of body height, body weight, blood pressure, visual and
      acoustic acuity, physical examinations, basic blood tests, urine analyses, chest radiography,
      and electrocardiography. The blood tests were performed after individuals fasted for at least
      eight hours. Individuals with any abnormal results underwent a clinical examination at an
      outpatient department for safety issues, ensuring the accuracy of the data. All data were
      registered prospectively. The investigators retrospectively collected data from the annual
      exam.
