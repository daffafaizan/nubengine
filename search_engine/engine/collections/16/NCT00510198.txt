    
      PRECEDE-HF was a prospective, multi-center, randomized, investigational device exemption
      (IDE) clinical study. The purpose of this study was to collect data required to determine
      whether the use of Cardiac Compass including OptiVol Fluid Status Monitoring with standard
      clinical assessment ("Access Arm") will result in a longer time to first heart failure
      hospitalization or death compared to standard clinical assessment alone ("Control Arm") and
      to support the approval of the following device features:

        -  OptiVol Alert (audible and home monitor alerts) for use in Medtronic devices

        -  SentryCheckâ„¢ Monitor

        -  OptiVol Alert Suspend (OptiVol enhancement)

        -  OptiVol Reference Impedance Adjustment (OptiVol enhancement)
