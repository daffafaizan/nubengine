    
      This study is a randomized double blind clinical trial being funded by NIMH. Investigators
      will need to enroll 40 cases with AGA IgG positivity in order to present a powered and
      convincing result about the efficacy of gluten withdrawal in the subpopulation of persons
      with schizophrenia with elevated AGA IgG levels. Investigators will recruit a minimum 50 to
      ensure they are well powered without question, and to account for dropouts. Investigators
      will use a battery of measures of peripheral and central inflammation as well as gut
      permeability at baseline and endpoint to confirm the relationship of these outcomes to
      changes in AGA IgG and symptom changes in the clinical trial. Investigators will test
      negative symptoms as a primary outcome but will test changes in other symptom domains such as
      positive symptoms. After the completion of the 5 week confirmatory study, investigators will
      discharge participants and follow them for 8 weeks in their own environment to test the
      maintenance of the effect following the stringent GFD, and provide education on gluten free
      shopping, cooking and eating.
