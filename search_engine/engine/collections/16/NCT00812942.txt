      that to FOBT was performed. Sixty-four general practitioners (GPs), overall including in
      their lists 9,889 average-risk subjects aged 55-64 years, were randomized between TC and FOBT
      screening programs. Eligible subjects were mailed a personal invitation letter co-signed by
      their GP and the coordinator of the area-reference GI centre. Attendance rate and detection
      rate for advanced neoplasia (colorectal cancer, adenoma >10 mm or with villous histology or
      high-grade dysplasia) for each arm of the study were assessed.
