    
      A total of 56 subjects with Barrett's Esophagus, EoE and healthy volunteers will be asked to
      swallow the OFDI capsule while being unsedated. The capsule is attached to a tether that
      allows the capsule operator to navigate the capsule as it progresses down the esophagus using
      natural propulsion called peristalsis as well as to bring it back up to pulled out of the
      mouth when the procedure is done.

      As the capsule progresses down the esophagus, multiple, two dimensional, microscopic cross-
      sectional images of the esophagus are acquired.
