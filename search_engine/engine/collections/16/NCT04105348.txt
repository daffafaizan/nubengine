    
      Inflammatory bowel disease; (Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis), is chronic relapsing
      inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract due to complex interactions among genetic,
      environmental, gut microbiome, and immunologic factors.

      Inflammatory bowel disease treatment inhibits the abnormal inflammatory response to heal
      intestinal tissue, relieve the abdominal pain, the diarrhea and the fresh bleeding per
      rectum, also decreases the frequency of flare-ups and maintains remission.

      Amino-salicylates and antibiotics are step I drugs act on the intestinal lining and on
      presented inflammatory masses.

      Corticosteroids are step II drugs on failure of step I drugs for adequate control of the
      Inflammatory bowel disease and rapid relief of symptoms and inflammation.

      The immune modifying agents as azathioprine and 6 mercaptopurine are step III drugs on
      failure of the steroids.

      Biologic agents are anti Tumor necrotic factor agents (infliximab and adalimumab) and non
      anti Tumor necrotic factor agents (vedolizumab, ustekinumab and natalizumab).

      Inflammatory bowel disease may have endocrinal and metabolic associations in the form of;
      lipid abnormalities and insulin resistance. Also, insulin resistance and hyperglycemia may be
      due to steroid use as steroid upgrades (hepatic gluconeogenesis, inhibition of glucose uptake
      in adipose tissue, and impairment of insulin action).

      There is no epidemiological evidence that Inflammatory bowel disease is a definite risk
      factor for diabetes. In this study, the association of diabetes in patients with Inflammatory
      bowel disease will be determined.
