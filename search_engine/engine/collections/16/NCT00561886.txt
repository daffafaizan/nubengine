    
      N=40 patients with moderate to severe COPD (30 < FEV1 < 70 % pred.), no further significant
      lung disease; current smokers or ex-smokers; no exacerbation in the last 2 month.

      Baseline visit Physical examination Dsypnea score (Borg-Scale, TDI) Lung function
      (Bodyplethysmography, CO-diffusion capacity)

      Before each study day the following medication will be withheld:

      Short-acting bronchodilators > 6 hours Long-acting b2-adrenoceptor agonist > 24 hours
      Tiotropium > 24 hours

      Study day 1 Bodyplethysmography including FEV1, PEF, FIV1 and PIF and assessment of PIF using
      an inspiratory Peak Flow Meter in randomized order.

      Dysnpea Scores 30 minute break Assessment of change in dyspnea (visual analogue scale)
      Bodyplethysmography including FEV1, PEF, FIV1 and PIF. Assessment of PIF using an inspiratory
      Peak Flow Meter in randomized order Administration of 12 Âµg formoterol 30 minute break
      Assessment of change in dyspnea (visual analogue scale) Bodyplethysmography including FEV1,
      PEF, FIV1 and PIF. Assessment of PIF using an inspiratory Peak Flow Meter in randomized
      order.

      Study day 2 Three to 14 days following study day 1. Schedule like day 1 with change in the
      order of lung function testing depending on randomization.
