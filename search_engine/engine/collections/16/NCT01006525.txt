      benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics (BzRA). Studies show that at therapeutic doses,
      used over the short-term, the abuse liability of BzRAs is relatively low and their efficacy
      outweighs their minimal risks. However, an increasing number of patients use BzRAs nightly
      for longer periods of time than is currently indicated (i.e. 4 weeks) and, minimal data on
      the long-term abuse liability and efficacy of these drugs exist.

      This project, using both prospective and retrospective methods, will address questions about
      the long-term abuse liability and efficacy of the BzRAs. The questions being raised are: What
      are the abuse liability and efficacy of hypnotics currently being used chronically and what
      is the prospective abuse liability and efficacy of hypnotics used chronically? Zolpidem is
      the chosen standard for this project as it is the most frequently prescribed BzRA and also
      arguably the BzRA with the best short-term efficacy and safety profile. The focus of the
      first question is clinical; it is about the long-term abuse liability and efficacy of BzRAs,
      specifically zolpidem, as it is currently being prescribed and about the type of patients who
      receive this drug. The second question addresses the issue of whether a standard BzRA can be
      prescribed efficaciously and safely for the long-term to patients with primary insomnia.
