      placebo-controlled trial to assess the effects of 92 days of CBD 400 mg (for the first 2 days
      starting on Day 2 of the study) or 800 mg (subjects who report side effects with the 800mg
      dose will be administered the CBD 400 mg dose for the remainder of the trial) or placebo on
      cocaine craving and cocaine use among 110 cocaine-dependent individuals. Phase I of the trial
      will assess the effects of CBD or placebo administration on cocaine craving in the context of
      a 10-day inpatient medical detoxification period. Phase II of the trial will be a 12-week
      post-detoxification outpatient follow-up period.
