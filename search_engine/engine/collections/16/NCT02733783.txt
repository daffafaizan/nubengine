      objective and subjective parameters in order to assess trigeminal nerve function at the level
      of the nasal mucosa before and after septorhinoplasty (as a model of controlled nasal
      fractures). The subjective parameters involve a visual analogue scale (VAS) score for each
      individual nasal symptom (nasal obstruction, facial pain/pressure, headache, rhinorrhea,
      sneezing, pruritus, post nasal drip, and loss of smell). An objective assessment includes
      measurement of PNIF (Peak Nasal Inspiratory Flow), the presence of neuropeptides in nasal
      secretions, (by introducing merocels and removing them 5 minutes later), short cold dry air
      (CDA) provocation and capsaicin provocation with subsequent measurements of PNIF and VAS
      scores and neuropeptides.
