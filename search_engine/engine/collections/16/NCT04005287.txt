    
      This is a randomized outpatient, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-site study of the
      safety, tolerability, and exploratory efficacy of topically administered WST-057 (4%
      pirenzepine free base monohydrate) for 24 weeks in subjects with T2DM with peripheral
      neuropathy. Subjects will attend visits at screening (day -45 to -28); day 1 (baseline);
      weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24; and follow-up (week 26). Approximately 60 subjects with T2DM
      with peripheral neuropathy will be randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups in a 1:1:4:4 ratio:
      placebo control 2 mL (n = 6 subjects), placebo control 4 mL (n = 6 subjects); low dose (2 mL)
      WST-057 (73 mg pirenzepine free base monohydrate) (n = 24 subjects); and high dose (4 mL)
      WST-057 (146 mg pirenzepine free base monohydrate) (n = 24 subjects), with the assumption
      that a total of 50 subjects will complete the study.

      This study is designed with 4 periods: screening, baseline/day 1, outpatient treatment, and
      safety follow-up.
