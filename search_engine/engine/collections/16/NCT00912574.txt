    
      Regimen: Each injection will be administered to patients with clinical stage I or II
      melanoma, who have had complete excision of a primary melanoma, but prior to wide excision
      with or without sentinel node biopsy as definitive surgical therapy.

      In Stage 1: Patients will be injected with a 1 ml emulsion containing GM-CSF in saline plus
      Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant, in skin adjacent to a melanoma biopsy scar.

      In Stage 2: Patients will be randomized to receive an injection of one of the following in
      skin adjacent to the melanoma biopsy scar:

        1. 1 ml saline

        2. GM-CSF in 1 ml saline

        3. an emulsion of Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant and saline

        4. an emulsion of GM-CSF in saline plus ml Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant. All vaccines will be
           administered intradermally. After the injection, each patient will undergo wide excision
           of the melanoma site, with or without sentinel node biopsy, as clinically indicated.
