    
      This study is a retrospective, multi-center data collection study to support extending the
      maximum recommended maintenance flushing intervals in subjects who have Bard totally
      implanted ports with distally-valved catheters.

      This study is intended to provide clinical evidence in support of extending the maximum
      recommended maintenance flushing interval to a time point of potentially >28 days for Bard
      ports with distally-valved catheters.

      Reduction in the number of maintenance flushes could help alleviate the inconvenience, reduce
      the time and expense, and minimize the invasive nature of the maintenance flushing procedure
      for patients and medical institutions. Subjects will be eligible for analysis of the primary
      endpoint after the first successful maintenance flush of the port until (a) the first adverse
      event or (b) abandonment of the port.

      A financial analysis will be performed on an institutional basis to determine the approximate
      mean cost of flushing. These costs will be extrapolated into an approximate per-patient cost
      for the different flushing period durations. No financial information will be collected from
      subject medical records. All required information will be extrapolated from site staff.
