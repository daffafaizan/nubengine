      cardiac and circulatory function. Evidence suggests that GH/IGF-1 exert a beneficial effect
      on cardiac load, cardiac growth and remodeling, despite their hypertrophying action. Several
      studies in the last years have demonstrated worse cardiovascular outcomes in adult patients
      with GH deficiency and/or low levels of IGF-1.

      A wide range of alterations in the GH/IGF-1 axis have been described to date in patients with
      chronic heart failure (CHF): reductions in GH levels, reductions in IGF-1 and a pattern of
      peripheral resistance to GH, in particular in patients with severe heart failure and cardiac
      cachexia. Our study hypothesis is that an actual status of GH deficiency coexists with CHF in
      a large percent of patients, and that it may represent a predictor of worse functional status
      and possibly of a worse prognosis. Aim of this study is to explore the latter hypothesis,
      comparing the clinical and functional evolution of patients with CHF and GHD with that of a
      general CHF population.
