      oxygenation, leading to a delay in weaning from MV. Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase
      inhibitor that is able to correct MA and to stimulate respiratory drive. There is a paucity
      of studies on the outcome of patients with MA under MV treated with acetazolamide.

      The primary objective of our study is to analyze whether the treatment of MA with
      acetazolamide in intubated patients with COPD or with OHS reduces the length of MV, reduces
      the length of ICU stay or ICU mortality. Complications associated with acetazolamide
      treatment will be also analyzed.

      Phase III double-blinded trial, with COPD or OHS patients under MV who have pH > 7,35 and
      bicarbonate > 28 mEq/L. Patients will be randomized to receive 500 mg of acetazolamide or
      placebo. According to arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) values treatment administration will
      be evaluated daily until extubation.
