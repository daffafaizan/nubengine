      Center for Urological Health. During or prior to an office visit, a potential subject and
      possibly his/her spouse will speak with the physician or research staff to assess interest in
      discussing the study. All eligible participants will be enrolled into an 8-week
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) course. Because the course content focuses on
      training in mindfulness meditation (and not cancer-specific issues), the researchers will
      allow for mixed cancer classes. Prior to the first class, all participants will complete
      baseline standardized patient reported outcomes (PROs) of health related quality of life, and
      undergo blood collection via finger prick. Following participation in the 8-week course,
      participants will complete their 8-week PRO and bio-marker assessments in a similar manner,
      and will be randomized to either 4 months of: 1) weekly mindfulness-specific text or email
      messages related to course teachings, 2) weekly general/informational texts or emails about
      healthy living and lifestyle, or 3) no texts or emails. PRO and bio-marker assessments will
      also be administered at 6 months, and PRO measures will be collected at 12 months.
