      participant information sheet only, on participants' understanding of the protocol, as well
      as on drop-out, adherence and clinical outcome in older adults at risk of cognitive decline.
      In addition to the main LO-MAPT study procedures, in two centers, half of the subjects will
      receive an audiovisual aid in addition to the standard information sheet.

      The primary objective of LO MAPT is to demonstrate the efficacy of a 18-month intervention
      with a supplementation of omega-3 (DHA+EPA) on cognitive decline as measured by a composite
      score of neuropsychological assessments in older adults with low DHA/EPA status (RBC DHA/EPA
      index â‰¤ 4.83%) and subjective memory complaints or family history of Alzheimer's disease.

      Subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of the following 2 groups: (i)
      DHA+EPA supplement or (ii) placebo. A computer-generated randomisation procedure will be used
      with stratification by centre. A centralised Interactive Voice Response System will be used
      to identify which group to allocate and which lot number to administer. A document describing
      the randomization procedure will be kept confidentially by the Methodology and Data
      Management Centre. All participants and study staff will be blinded to DHA+EPA
      supplement/placebo assignment: all participants will receive soft capsules of exactly the
      same appearance and taste.
