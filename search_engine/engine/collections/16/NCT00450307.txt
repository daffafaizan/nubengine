        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of monoclonal antibody 3F8 when administered with
           sargramostim (GM-CSF) in young patients with high-risk, refractory or relapsed
           neuroblastoma.

        -  Assess anti-neuroblastoma effects of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study of monoclonal antibody 3F8.

      Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously once daily on days -5 to 11 and
      monoclonal antibody 3F8 IV over 30 minutes on days 0-4 and 7-11. Treatment repeats every 4-6
      weeks for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody 3F8 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years.
