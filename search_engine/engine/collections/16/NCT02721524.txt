    
      Functional Tricuspid regurgitation (FTR) occurs due to annular dilatation in association with
      left sided valve disease and is more commonly seen than primary pathology in patients with
      Rheumatic mitral valve disease. FTR occurs due to increased right ventricle after load that
      leads to either dilatation or geometric deformation of Tricuspid annulus. If left untreated,
      FTR may worsen and increase morbidity and mortality.
