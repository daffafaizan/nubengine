      of one of two augmentation strategies, including engagement in anti-phobic actions and fading
      of safety behaviors. Because utilization of safety behaviors is functionally precluded by
      anti-phobic action, the present study design will both replicate and extend prior research by
      addressing whether anti-phobic actions enhance exposure therapy beyond the mere fading of
      safety behaviors. A total of 100 individuals between the ages of 18 and 65 meeting DSM-IV
      criteria for acrophobia (fear of heights) will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions
      including (1) standard exposure therapy, (2) exposure therapy with safety behavior fading,
      (3) exposure therapy with safety behavior fading and anti-phobic actions, and (4) a wait-list
      control condition. All participants will complete an online prescreen and face-to-face
      screening assessment to determine eligibility and pre-treatment symptom severity.
      Participants will also complete assessments at post-treatment and 1-month follow-up
      assessments. Subjective fear during two behavioral approach tests (in the treatment and
      generalization context, respectively) conducted at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and 1-month
      follow-up assessments will serve as the primary measure of treatment outcome. Additionally, a
      battery of self-report questionnaires will be completed at pre-treatment, during treatment,
      at post-treatment, and at a 1-month follow-up assessment.
