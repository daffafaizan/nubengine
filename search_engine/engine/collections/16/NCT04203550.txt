      comparing single burr-hole evacuation of chronic subdural hematoma (CSDH) with intraoperative
      irrigation (IR) and evacuation of CSDH without irrigation (N-IR). In both groups, a passive
      subdural drain is used for 48 hours as a standard of treatment. The study will be conducted
      in all five neurosurgical departments in Finland. To determine whether operation without
      irrigation results in non-inferior outcome to operation with irrigation, we will randomize
      426 patients into two groups and follow them up for 6 months using recurrence rates as the
      primary outcome. Secondary outcomes in our study include mortality, neurological outcome and
      complications.
