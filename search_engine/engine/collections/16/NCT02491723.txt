      airway inflammation and dilation of bronchial wall driven by various causes. Patients with
      bronchiectasis suffer from excessive sputum production, recurrent exacerbations, and
      progressive airway destruction. It was reported that 30%-40% patients were infected with
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Major therapy for bronchiectasis is focused on breaking the "vicious
      cycle" of mucus stasis, infection, inflammation, and airway destruction. Currently a number
      of clinical trials have showed that macrolide effectively used in the treatment of non-CF
      bronchiectasis. Evidence has indicated that 14- and 15-membered ring macrolides possess
      immunomodulation and anti-inflammatory functions beyond their antimicrobial properties.
      However, the underlying mechanisms that account for the anti-inflammatory actions of
      macrolides have not yet to be elucidated, and the activities do not appear to be controlled
      by a single mechanism.Interleukin-18 (IL-18), along with interleukin-1b (IL-1b), is produced
      by inflammasomes when activated by a number of pathogen, environmental or host-derived danger
      signals. Inflammasomes are innate immune regulatory protein complexes which seem to play a
      key role in the host immune response of patients with Bronchiectasis. The aim of this study
      was to determine IL-18 levels in serum of patients with Bronchiectasis and to investigate
      whether macrolide could attenuate its levels.
