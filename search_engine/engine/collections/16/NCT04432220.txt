      Hospital) in Korea. Inclusion criteria is atrial fibrillation patients with moderate or high
      stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc>=1 male, and >=2 female) who had undergone catheter ablation of
      atrial fibrillation, and has maintained sinus rhythm for more than 1 year. Anticoagulation
      (Apixaban group) will take apixaban (5 mg bid or 2.5 mg bid according to dose guideline) for
      2 years, and nonanticoagulation group will not take any oral anticoagulants for the same
      period. If the patients have the recurrence of AF, they will take anticoagulation according
      to standard treatment, and will be censored. We will analyze and compare the efficacy and
      safety of non-vitamin K anticoagulants (apixaban) and no oral anticoagulation in these
      patients.
