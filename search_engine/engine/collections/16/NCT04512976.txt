      severe burn injuries covering 20% or more of their body surface area, with upwards to 11,000
      individuals experiencing such an injury per year. These burn injuries can severely compromise
      body temperature regulation, owing to permanent impairments in the primary thermoeffectors
      necessary to dissipate heat, namely profoundly blunted skin blood flow and sweating responses
      in the injured skin. The investigators propose that this heat intolerance deters burn
      survivors from participating in physical activity, including activities of daily living,
      necessary to avoid the adverse cardiovascular and metabolic sequela of a sedentary lifestyle.
      Consistent with hypothesis, years after the injury burn survivors have a very low aerobic
      capacity; greater all-cause mortality rates; greater hospitalization days for circulatory
      diseases; and suffer from greater incidences of ischemic heart disease, heart failure,
      diabetes, and cerebrovascular disease (including stroke) relative to matched non-burned
      cohorts. The primary goal of this project is to identify modalities to attenuate excessive
      elevations in skin and core body temperatures during physical activity in well-healed burn
      survivors. The implementation of such modalities will eliminate heat intolerance as a barrier
      to participation in activities that are necessary to improve/maintain cardiovascular health
      in this vulnerable population. This project will investigate whether increased skin wetness,
      with and without accompanying fan use, will restore otherwise impaired evaporative cooling of
      well-healed burn survivors, with the extent of that improvement predicated on the
      environmental conditions and the percentage of body surface area burned.
