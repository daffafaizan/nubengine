      airway maneuvers in anesthesiology in children.

      Significant variations and discrepancies in the reported tracheobronchial angles are found in
      literature.

      Various imaging modalities ranging from chest x-ray to helical computed tomography (CT) have
      been used for measuring the tracheobronchial angles in children and the results are varied
      with some studies reporting equal angles [2016] while others reporting right bronchial angle
      to be smaller than left bronchial angle [Kubota].

      The visualization of the air column in tracheobronchial tree in a three-dimensional (3D)
      CT-based image is clear with the air column simulating the actual internal shape of the
      airway. The highest quality medical-grade (3D) images are obtained using CT data [Uchida M].
      Computed tomography (CT) is considered the current gold standard for airway measurements as
      the air-tissue interface is better delineated by CT imaging [Reinhardt].

      We hypothesize that RBA and LBA are unequal as children like adults are prone to right
      mainstem intubation We have measured the right and left bronchial angle using the three
      dimensional CT based images of the air column in the tracheobronchial tree.
