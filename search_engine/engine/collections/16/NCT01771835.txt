      main risk factor of diabetic retinopathy induced damage to retinal capillaries. These in turn
      lead to hypoxia in the tissue and promote the release of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth
      factor) , which in turn increases the vascular pathology. Simultaneously, there is an
      increased expression of endothelin (ET-1). Endothelin increases vascular tone and regulates
      the micro-and macro-vascular remodeling.

      In ocular blood flow perfusion pressure plays an important role. While in healthy eyes a
      spontaneous retinal venous pulsation is frequently observed, this is significantly less
      frequent in diseased eyes. An increased venous pressure lowers the ocular perfusion pressure,
      and increases the transmural pressure. A measurement of the retinal venous pressure and the
      hormone ET-1 in the blood will give us a better knowledge of the circulatory changes and
      their relationship to diabetes.
