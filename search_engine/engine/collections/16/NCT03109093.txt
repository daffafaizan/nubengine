      per protocol discontinuation and as premature treatment discontinuation In case of
      hematological or extramedullary relapse, the study treatment will be permanently
      discontinued.

      There will be a safety follow-up visit at 30 days after end of the last infusion. There will
      be efficacy follow-up until 18 months after treatment start. In patients scheduled for SCT
      the 30-day safety-visit may be performed at the latest time point possible before initiation
      of subsequent treatment.
