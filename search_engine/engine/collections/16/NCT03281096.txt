      colorectal cancer. It is well-known that colorectal adenomas are the precursor of colorectal
      cancer and that removing them will prevent colorectal cancer. Because most colorectal cancers
      arise from benign adenomas, adenomas have been used as surrogate end points in prevention
      trials. Berberine hydrochloride, which is an alkaloid extracted from Rhizoma coptidis, has
      been traditionally used in Chinese medicine to treat gastrointestinal infections, due to its
      antimicrobial properties. Previous clinical research and animal studies have demonstrated the
      anti-tumor action of Berberine hydrochloride. Persons with a history of colorectal cancer
      might constitute a group at higher risk for adenomas and thus be particularly suitable for a
      study of the chemopreventive effects of Berberine hydrochloride. Here, a randomized,
      double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was designed to determine whether the daily use of 300
      mg of berberine hydrochloride could decreases the occurrence of new colorectal adenomas among
      patients with a history of colorectal cancer.
