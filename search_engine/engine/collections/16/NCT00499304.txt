      loop in body plethysmography shows expiratory flow limitation in COPD patients. But body
      plethysmography requires that the patient quietly sits in a closed box and is not able to
      follow changes breath by breath. The goal of this study is to validate the Forced oscillation
      technique (FOT) for measuring expiratory flow limitation in COPD patients.30 COPD patients
      with an open loop in body plethysmography are compared to 30 COPD patients with a closed
      loop. The methods used in this study are the maximal overlap discrete short time Fourier
      transform (MODFT) combined with a total least squares analysis. It is hypothesized that the
      obtained FOT parameters are able to distinguish the patients with expiratory flow limitation
      in body plethysmography from the patients without expiratory flow limitation in body
      plethysmography.Secondary study questions are: 1) to what extend are the FOT parameters
      distorted by breathing artifacts and measurement noise. 2)What changes can be detected by FOT
      in expiratory flow limitation after administration of salbutamol.
