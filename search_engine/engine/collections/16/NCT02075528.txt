      6-week trial. Eligible patients will receive 9mg paliperidone ER first. Then, the dosage of
      paliperidone could be adjusted two weeks later according to clinical judgement. They will be
      followed and receive assessment of pharmacokinetics, metabolic parameters ( lipid profiles,
      glucose, insulin, adiponectin, leptin, and prolactin, etc.), and the treatment response.
