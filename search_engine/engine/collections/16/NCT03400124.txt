      cataract surgery is one of the most frequently performed types of surgery. The majority of
      patients suffer from bilateral cataract and while cataract surgery of one eye is effective in
      restoring functional vision, second-eye surgery leads to further improvement in
      health-related quality of life.

      Currently, most patients undergo cataract surgery in both eyes on separate days as
      recommended in national guidelines, referred to as delayed sequential bilateral cataract
      surgery (DSBCS). An alternative procedure involves cataract surgery of both eyes on the same
      day, but as separate procedures, known as immediately sequential bilateral cataract surgery
      (ISBCS).

      Potential benefits of ISBCS include less time between surgeries, a faster total recovery
      period and lower costs. Potential risks, however, are complications of cataract surgery in
      general, most importantly the risk of endophthalmitis and refractive surprise. In ISBCS, both
      eyes are at risk at the same time, while in DSBCS both eyes are exposed to these risks
      consecutively.

      Since there is no consensus yet about the role of ISBCS in current regular practice, further
      investigation of functional and surgical outcomes and cost-effectiveness of ISBCS compared to
      DSBCS is required. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness and
      costs of ISBCS compared to DSBCS, in order to determine whether ISBCS is an effective and
      cost-effective alternative to DSBCS.
