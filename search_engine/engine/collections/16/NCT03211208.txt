      circulating liver specific and mechanistic biomarkers that report early acute liver injury.
      Such biomarkers are needed as current early biomarkers of liver injury lack sensitivity and
      specificity. The panel of biomarkers either have enhanced liver specificity or provide
      mechanistic insights. Currently, antituberculosis drug-induced liver injury (ATDILI) is the
      most frequent side-effect of anti-tuberculosis therapy and this hinders the effective
      treatment of TB, as it means that treatment regimens are not completed. At present, the risk
      of ATDILI means that monitoring of liver function is required, with levels of ALT measured
      monthly. If levels of ALT rise to 2-5x the upper limit of normal levels (ULN) and the patient
      is unwell the frequency of monitoring is increased to biweekly monitoring. Antibiotic therapy
      is only changed if levels of ALT remain greater than 3xULN, the patient continues to display
      symptoms and there is a positive causality assessment that the anti-tuberculosis drugs are
      causing ATDILI. This project will recruit patients taking antituberculosis drugs and
      determine the diagnostic and prognostic value of the biomarker panel, in relation to liver
      injury as a result of anti-tuberculosis therapy.
