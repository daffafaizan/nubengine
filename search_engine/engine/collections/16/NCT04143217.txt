    
      This is a multicenter, open-label extension study aimed to assess long-term safety and
      efficacy of SPN-812 when administered alone or in conjunction with an Food and Drug
      Administration-approved Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) medication in the
      treatment of ADHD in adult subjects who have participated in a previous blinded study of
      SPN-812 (812P306). All adult subjects who completed the blinded study of SPN-812 will have
      the option to participate in this study in which all subjects receive SPN-812 at an optimized
      dose. Subjects will initiate SPN-812 dosing at 200 mg/day once daily (QD) for 1 week, then
      titrate to 400 mg/day at start of Week 2. It is recommended that subjects remain on 400
      mg/day during Week 3. At or after Visit 3 (Week 4), per the Investigator's discretion and
      based on Investigator assessment of the subject's clinical response and tolerability, the
      dose of SPN-812 can be titrated up or tapered down in increments of 50 mg/day, 100 mg/day,
      150 mg/day, or 200 mg/day per week to a target dose within the ranges between 200 and 600
      mg/day. Additionally, after 3 months of dosing (after Visit 4), at the discretion of the
      Investigator and based on the subject's clinical response, the optimized dose of SPN-812 may
      be supplemented with an adjunctive FDA-approved stimulant treatment. The total study duration
      per subject from Visit 1 to the EOS (Visit 9) will be ~52 weeks or until SPN-812 becomes
      commercially available.
