    
      This study is a Phase I/II, randomized, blinded, placebo-controlled, parallel group design.
      Participants harboring a large vessel occlusion acute ischemic stroke who are selected for
      endovascular revascularization will be given a 48 h infusion of either 0.5 mL/kg/h RNS60 (up
      to a maximum of 60 mL/h), 1 mL/kg/h RNS60 (up to a maximum of 120 mL/h), or 1 mL/kg/h (up to
      a maximum of 120 mL/h) placebo (normal saline) starting within 30 minutes of consent after
      confirmation of candidacy for endovascular thrombectomy and prior to arterial closure.
      Outcomes of the main trial will be evaluated throughout a 90 day observation period.
