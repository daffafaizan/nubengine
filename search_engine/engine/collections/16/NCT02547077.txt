      repair of linear cutaneous surgery wounds improves scar cosmesis compared to wound closure
      with 5-0 fast absorbing gut. The investigators will use a split wound model, where half of
      the wound is treated with 2-octylcyanoacrylate and the other half is repaired with 5-0 fast
      absorbing gut. Three-months post-surgery, the scar will be measured via the physician
      observer scar assessment scale, a validated scar instrument. The scar width, and adverse
      events will also be recorded.
