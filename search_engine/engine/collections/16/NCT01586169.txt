      regions of Africa and Asia. Elimination programs exist for the two diseases, and their
      treatment by different groups of health workers is both costly and inefficient.

      Thus, a study evaluating the safety and feasibility of an integrated mass treatment of
      trachoma and lymphatic filariasis with azithromycin associated with albendazole and
      ivermectin was instituted in 4 villages of the region of Sikasso in Mali (West Africa) co
      endemic for lymphatic filariasis and trachoma.

      It was an open label randomized clusters type on the assessment of the safety of the triple
      co administration of azithromycin, ivermectin and albendazole (experimental regimen) as
      compared to the administration of the co administration of albendazole plus ivermectin
      followed by the that of azithromycin a week later (current standard recommended regimen)
      within subjects of 5 to 65 years old, willing and able to swallow the study drugs.

      Clinical evaluation of adverse events in all study participants was done on day 0, day 8, and
      day 15 after the treatment.
