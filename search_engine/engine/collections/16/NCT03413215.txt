      and an alarming one million by 2050 with the continuing rise in obesity prevalence. The
      current system currently has no formal stratification of patients for channelling of
      structured resources to patients that require more intensive treatment and follow-up (those
      at higher risk of progressing to having complications from diabetes due to poor glycemic
      control, or those who have signs of early complications).

      We will therefore be researching effective health system delivery strategies to improve
      achievement of treatment targets (eg. HbA1c, blood pressure, LDL) and reduce vascular
      complications of diabetes mellitus (retinopathy, proteinuria, end stage renal disease,
      ischemic heart disease). These include:

        -  Stratification and channelling purposefully structured resources to patients with poorly
           controlled diabetes mellitus defined as having an HbA1c >9% on 2 or more occasions, and
           patients with diabetic complications (estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR
           30-60ml/min or proteinuria >0.5g/day or urine microalbumin:creatinine ratio >300mg/g)

        -  Training of all doctors/DNEs/dietitians involved in the counselling of patients in the
           field of motivational interviewing

        -  Providing easy accessibility to resources to allow patients to self-monitor their
           capillary blood glucose and blood pressure in between clinic visits - loaning of blood
           pressure units and glucometers for short (1-2 week) periods regularly

        -  Providing frequent telephone counselling by DNEs and Renal Pharmacists with regards to
           titration of medications, in particular ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin-receptor blockers
           to reach treatment targets

        -  Utilisation of social media and smart phone/tablet applications for relevant patients to
           improve and increase patient-healthcare professional interaction with regards to
           diabetes, provide daily bite-sized education via tablet/smart phone media/social media
           and improve compliance to exercise targets
