      patients with ARDS on pathophysiological parameters.

      This therapeutic study aims to test patient's position using dedicated beds (Total Lift Bed™,
      VitalGo Systems Inc., Arjo AB). The study consists of comparing pulmonary pathophysiological
      parameters for different positions (from the strict dorsal decubitus to the vertical, with
      30° and 60° steps) in patients with early ARDS of focal and non-focal morphologies, under
      invasive mechanical ventilation.

      The primary outcome is the difference between the transpulmonary driving pressure (ΔPtp)
      measured at the end of each verticalization step (30th minute) and the basal value measured
      at the beginning of the protocol, in strict dorsal decubitus (0°).

      The minimum number of subjects to enroll in this study is 30 patients with early ARDS,
      including 15 with focal lung morphology and 15 with non-focal lung morphology. Intermediate
      analyses are planned every 5 patients in order to reevaluate the needed number of patients.

      The use of a dedicated bed (Total Lift Bed™, VitalGo Systems, Inc., Arjo AB) allows the
      verticalization of patients under sedation and mechanical ventilation up to 90°. The
      procedure foresees the gradual verticalization of the patients of 0°, 30°, 60° and 90° by
      steps of 30 minutes. At the end of each position step (0°, 30°, 60° and 90°), measurement of
      end-expiratory lung impedance (EELI) and chest electrical impedance tomography (EIT)
      parameters, measurement of esophageal pressures, collection of ventilatory parameters on the
      ventilator, collection of Swan-Ganz catheter hemodynamic data, measurement of lung shunt by
      mixed venous and arterial blood gas analyses and measurement of end-expiratory lung volume
      (EELV) by the N2 washin-washout method.
