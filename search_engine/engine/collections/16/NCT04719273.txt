      incidence that continues to increase each year. More than 60,000 women were diagnosed with
      endometrial cancer in 2018 and this disease contributes to more than 10,000 deaths annually.
      Unopposed estrogen production and obesity are the most common risk factors for the
      development of endometrial cancer; both late stage disease and histologic subtype portends to
      a poor prognosis with a five-year survival of only 20%. In the second line setting, cytotoxic
      chemotherapy has a 13% response rate and hormonal therapy with anastrozole has a response
      rate of 9%. For a minority of patients with MSI-high endometrial cancer (about 30% of
      patients), pembrolizumab is a therapeutic option and results in an overall response rate of
      39% in 149 patients across 15 tumor types with 78% of responses lasting greater than 6 months
      and has led to FDA approval of this single agent in tissue agnostic cases. Megesterol acetate
      is approved in the second line setting with response rates as high as 24% in conjunction with
      tamoxifen, but is not commonly used due to poor tolerance and high risk of thrombosis. The
      majority of patients with recurrent endometrial cancer have limited therapeutic options and
      the development of second line therapies that result in improved response is an unmet
      clinical need. Using targeted hormonal treatment may present potential opportunities for
      improved treatment outcomes for these women.
