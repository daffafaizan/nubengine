      the cerebrovascular hemodynamic consequences of cervical spine positions, including
      manipulation, in vivo under clinically relevant circumstances using two advanced MRI
      technology on the vertebral and posterior cerebral and cerebellar blood flow dynamics
      affecting brain perfusion. According to the knowledge of the investigators, a study utilizing
      MRI to examine blood flow and perfusion, turbulence and evidence of micro-trauma within these
      blood vessels has yet to be conducted.
