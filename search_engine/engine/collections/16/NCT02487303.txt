      after scheduled, elective Cesarean delivery. It is designed as a randomized, open label,
      controlled trial. All patients will receive a standardized spinal anesthetic for operative
      anesthesia and will be randomized into one of three groups: (group 1) 1 gram IV acetaminophen
      every 8 hours for three by a computer generated list.
