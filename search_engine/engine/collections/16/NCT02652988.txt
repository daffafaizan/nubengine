    
      Will be included women aged between 18 and 65 years, chronic pain fibromyalgia according to
      the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology, pain unresponsive to analgesics such as
      paracetamol, acetylsalicylic acid, ibuprofen, Carisoprodol, Zanaflex (Tizanidine) and
      Codeine. And give informed consent to participate after initial evaluation. Primary outcome
      is to evaluate the effect of treatment with home-base tDCS in patients with fibromyalgia.
      Secondary outcomes are: compare the effect of active home-based tDCS and sham in cortical
      neurophysiological processes and subcortical to stimulation with TMS and standardized noxious
      stimuli with and without concomitant conditioned Pain Modulation (CPM) in pain threshold
      outcomes to the test mechanical pressure, heat-algesic stimulus, cortical excitability
      parameters [evoked rest motor (MEP) MEP enough to evoke amplitude of 1 mV peak to peak,
      silent period (SP), motor threshold (MT), variation in blood volume and oxygenation cortical
      motor area [oxy-hemoglobin concentrations (Hbo) / deoxy-hemoglobin (HBr)] optically
      functional neuroimaging (NIRS) and variation in the frequency of alpha and beta waves of
      motor area stimulated by tDCS assessed by electroencephalogram (EEG). In surrogate outcome,
      the investigators will compare the effect of active home-sham tDCS the tDCS in pain levels
      and functional capacity, catastrophic thinking, bookmark levels of neurotrophic activity
      (BDNF) and astrocytic (S100 beta).
