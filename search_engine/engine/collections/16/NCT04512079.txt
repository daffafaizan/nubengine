      effectiveness trial with objectives: 1. To determine the effectiveness of enoxaparin and
      apixaban in patients hospitalized (but not yet intubated) with confirmed COVID-19 and 2. To
      determine the safety of enoxaparin and apixaban in patients hospitalized (but not yet
      intubated) with confirmed COVID-19. Observational analyses have suggested potential benefit
      for in-hospital use of anticoagulation. Yet, due to a lack of rigorous evidence for optimal
      anticoagulation regimens, practice patterns among hospitalized patients with COVID-19 vary
      significantly. Specifically, the choice of anticoagulant, dosing, and duration of treatment
      are not well understood. A preliminary analysis of approximately 2700 patients admitted to
      the Mount Sinai Health System (MSHS) in New York, demonstrated an association between
      in-hospital administration of therapeutic Anticoagulation (AC) and improved survival compared
      to no or prophylactic dose AC. A subsequent analysis under review of a larger 4400 patient
      cohort with longer follow up demonstrated similar associations with reduction in the risk of
      mortality and risk of intubation. Further analyses suggest more pronounced benefit with
      therapeutic as opposed to prophylactic doses. Bleeding rates were generally low overall, but
      higher among patients on therapeutic anticoagulation. Finally, though exploratory in nature,
      a potential signal for benefit was observed for patients on novel oral anticoagulant therapy
      (primarily apixaban) at therapeutic doses compared to low molecular weight heparin.
      Ultimately, randomized controlled trials are needed to elucidate the optimal anticoagulation
      regimen to improve outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19.
