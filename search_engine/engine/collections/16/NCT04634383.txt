      eliciting visual percepts in response to electrical stimulation in persons with blindness.
      The electrical stimulation is provided by wireless floating microelectrode arrays (WFMAs)
      that are part of the ICVP system. The WFMAs are implanted in the visual cortex. Five
      participants will take part in the study and each participant will have multiple WFMA devices
      implanted in their visual cortex on one side of the brain. After recovery from surgery,
      participants will begin a series of tests to assess the ability of electrical stimulation to
      induce visual percepts and how these percepts may provide some measure of artificial vision.
      Weekly participant testing will occur over a period of one to three years.
