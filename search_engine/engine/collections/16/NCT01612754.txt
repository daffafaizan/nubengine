      of peak events with different tresholds.

      Three phases were conducted: 1. Reference group/phase I 2. Control group/phase II The full
      data set was recorded by a research clerk present in theatre however all staff were left
      unaware of the study purpose 3. Intervention group/phase III. The intervention consisted of a
      panel of work rules including mainly communication regulations (only conversations concerning
      the current case were allowed, no in and out during surgery, mobile phone ban etc.. Measures
      were backed by intervention conferences, posters and pictograms. .

      A wear off-effect was sought after . Biometrically, we analyzed the surgeon's pre- to
      postoperative rise in cortisol and the proportion of the surgeon's electrodermal potentials
      of >15ÂµS indicating severe stress. Intra-team communication, a decrease in disturbing
      conversations and sudden noise peaks were investigated and correlated with the individual
      noise sensitivity determined by the noise Q questionnaire.
