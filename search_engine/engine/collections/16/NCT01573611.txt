      the geriatric patient population. Numerous studies have been carried out to study the
      benefits of grapes associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present
      proposal, the investigators aim to determine 1) whether cognitive and regional cerebral
      metabolic changes associated with grape powder use can be identified, 2) if the presence and
      magnitude of therapeutic responses to grape in patients having mild cognitive decline can be
      predicted by particular patterns of regional brain metabolism, and 3) for any changes
      identified, the magnitude of those changes that correlate with the magnitude of the changes
      noted in the neuropsychologic parameters will be examined, which might be useful as an
      objective biomarker for therapeutic effect. A total of 12 patients suffering from documented
      decline of cognitive function (in the absence of overt dementia) will be studied. In this
      placebo-controlled, double-blinded study, the 12 recruited subjects who have met the
      screening criteria will be randomized to receive 72 g of grape powder per day or placebo. The
      subjects will undergo a baseline brain PET study with the radiotracer [F - 18]
      fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG). In addition, neuropsychological assessments will be performed at
      baseline and six months after initiation of therapy. Follow-up PET scans will also be
      obtained at six months to assess the changes in metabolism occurring with each therapy
      regimen.
