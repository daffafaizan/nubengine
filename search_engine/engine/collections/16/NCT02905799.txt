      France. OA physiopathology is driven in part by local joint inflammation responsible for pain
      and joint destruction. Experimental studies have shown that resveratrol, a molecule
      antagonist to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor, has anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective
      properties in vitro and in vivo. The investigators hypothesize that oral resveratrol, in a
      new formulation improving its bioavailability, could reduce knee pain at 3 months as compared
      with placebo in people with knee OA.
