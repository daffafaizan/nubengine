      health. ME pressure is a measure of the number of contained gas moles and processes that add
      or remove gas moles from the relatively fixed volume ME cavity change its pressure. Three
      routes for ME gas exchange have been identified; 1) passive, gradient-dependent species
      exchange with the local blood via diffusion across the ME mucosa; 2) passive,
      gradient-dependent species exchange with the ambient environment via diffusion across the
      tympanic membrane, and 3) bolus exchange of mixed gases between the nasopharynx and ME during
      transient openings of the Eustachian tube. Total ME pressure and the trajectory of ME
      pressure under specified conditions depend on the relative rates of species gas exchanges
      across these pathways. The ME airspace can be subdivided into two compartments, the anterior
      tympanum and the posterior mastoid air cell system (MACS). Theory suggests that the
      transmucosal gas exchange rate for the ME (transMEM) may be different for the tympanum and
      the MACS and this possibility has important implications with respect to the role of the MACS
      in ME pressure regulation and protection from ME disease. This study measures the rate of
      inert gas exchange across the mucosa of the two ME compartments in adults. These data will be
      fitted to a model of gas exchange parameterized based on the relative surface areas and
      volumes of the two compartments, and the hypothesis that volume gas exchange across the MACS
      mucosa is less than that for the tympanum will be tested. The results will be used to reject
      or confirm one mechanism by which large MACS volume protects from otitis media under certain
      conditions.
