      in this population group an increase in the number of HIV cases of approximately 44%. The
      knowledge, interest and willingness to use PrEP is high among MSM at higher risk of HIV
      acquisition. BCN Checkpoint was accountable for the detection of one third of all new HIV
      cases in MSM and TGW in Catalonia.

      Research hypothesis is that offering a risk reduction program, including the provision of
      health monitoring, in a community setting for informal PrEP users is justified and feasible,
      and will afford these users the possibility of using it safely. It is expected that the use
      of informal PrEP, along with HIV and other STIs screening, STI treatment, and immediate HIV
      referral to care and treatment will contribute significantly to a reduction of HIV incidence.

      This study aims to contribute to increase the body of evidence on the incidence and of
      context specific HIV management and inform policy makers on potential preventive strategies
      against the epidemic.

      AIMS

      The primary aim of the study is:

      To describe the incidence of HIV and other STIs during the study period.

      The specific aims of the study are:

      To provide harm reduction through clinical follow-up for informal PrEP users. To describe the
      conditions of informal use and acquisition of PrEP. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety
      of informal PrEP. To describe the demographic, clinical, risk factors for HIV and other STIs
      of informal PrEP users.
