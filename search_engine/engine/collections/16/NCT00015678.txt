      excitability in healthy human volunteers. Flumazenil acts as a potent benzodiazepine
      (BZP)-specific antagonist by competing at the central synaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
      receptor site. However, the relationship between GABA and flumazenil without BZPs is not well
      known. We plan to determine if intravenous (IV) administration in therapeutic dosage alters
      cortical excitability as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). The long-term
      plan is to identify a pharmacological method to reduce cortical inhibition that might be
      useful in stroke rehabilitation.
