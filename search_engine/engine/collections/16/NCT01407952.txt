    
      Your part in this study will last up to 24 months and will involve 6 visits (1 baseline visit
      before your surgery, the surgical procedure and 4 follow-up visits). These visits will occur
      at the same time as the visits you would receive as standard of care after your surgery.

      If you are in this study, you will be placed in one of two study groups by chance using a
      process similar to the flip of a coin. This process is called randomization. Neither you nor
      the study staff will select the group you will be in. One group, the control group, will have
      their aneurysm treated by the bare platinum coils during their endovascular procedure. The
      other group, the study group will receive coils from the HydroCoil Embolization System. Both
      groups will receive the same standard of care and follow-up, but during the surgery different
      types of coils will be used.
