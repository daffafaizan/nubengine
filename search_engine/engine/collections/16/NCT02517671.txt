      training performance in healthy volunteers. Prior published and anecdotal evidence suggests
      that EECP should improve athletic performance. Data from this study will be used to generate
      sample size and power calculations for feasibility of future EECP studies. The results of
      this study could provide evidence that can help active duty and Department of Defense
      beneficiaries optimize physical conditioning, endurance and overall health. It could help
      active duty members maximize their physical training potential enabling them to better
      prepare for missions down range. Additionally, physiologic cardiopulmonary improvements may
      have the potential to decrease the conditioning time required for injured, post-operative and
      post-partum active duty members to return to duty.
