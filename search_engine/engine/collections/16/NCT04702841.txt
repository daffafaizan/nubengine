      - 5% of all T cells in our body, they are a natural killer.

      CD7 is recognized as a sensitive marker of T-ALL, and its expression level on T-ALL cells is
      opposite to CD3: compared with normal T cells, the expression level of CD7 on T-ALL cells is
      significantly increased (P < 0.001), while the expression level of CD3 on T-ALL cells is
      significantly decreased (P < 0.001). At the same time, CD7 expression is absent in about 10%
      of normal T cells, and these CD7 negative T cells have the ability of normal T cells to
      express cytokines. Therefore, CD7 has become a potential target for the treatment of T-ALL
      because of its specificity and safety.
