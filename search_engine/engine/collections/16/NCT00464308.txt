      typical Gastro-oesophageal Reflux Disease (GORD) patients that present for treatment, and for
      whom a Proton Pump Inhibitor (PPI) would normally be prescribed. The study will be conducted
      over a 4-week period on the basis that current GP standard practice is to treat the GORD
      patient for a period of 4-weeks prior to reassessment and further follow-up if required. This
      study is conducted in patients with GORD - associated heartburn (with or without
      regurgitation) at multiple GP centers, treatment is assigned based on chance (randomized),
      similar to the toss of a coin and neither doctor or patient knows which treatment they will
      receive (double-blinded). Following screening to determine eligibility, patients will be
      randomized to receive oral treatment with either, 20 mg rabeprazole, 20 mg esomeprazole or 40
      mg esomeprazole once daily for 4 weeks. This 4-week study encompasses 2 protocol-mandated
      visits (baseline on day 0 and final visit on day 28). It is hypothesized that rabeprazole 20
      mg will be no less effective than (non-inferior) esomeprazole 40 mg for the degree of GORD
      symptom resolution. Patients will take one tablet (rabeprazole 20 mg or placebo) and one
      capsule (esomeprazole 20 mg, esomeprazole 40 mg or placebo) each day for 28 days. The study
      medication will be taken once daily in the morning before breakfast, except the first dose,
      which will be taken during Visit 1.
