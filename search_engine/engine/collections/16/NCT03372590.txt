        1. To determine the proportion of infants (<32 weeks gestation and/or <1500g) who have
           abnormal GMs findings using the GMA tool.

        2. To determine the feasibility of NICU based rehabilitation program in 20 infants
           determined to be at high risk for CP using the GMA tool. The intervention bundle will
           consist of a maternal-driven gestational age (GA)-appropriate intervention bundle that
           will include evidence-based interventions including vocal soothing, comforting touch,
           scent exchange, kangaroo care, and infant massage. Patients will be compared to
           contemporary and GA-matched controls receiving standard of care with a 1:2 assignment.

        3. To evaluate the short-term impact of a maternal-driven intervention bundle on the
           mother-infant dyad. Maternal stress will be measured using the Parental Stress Scale for
           NICU patients (PSS: NICU) prior to the intervention and prior to the infant's NICU
           discharge. Further, stress will be assessed by measuring maternal and infant salivary
           cortisol pre-and post-kangaroo care on 3 separate occasions (post enrollment in the
           study, mid-hospital stay, and prior to discharge). Measures of maternal anxiety and
           depression will be evaluated prior to the intervention and prior to NICU discharge using
           the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) instrument.

      The investigators hypothesize that the intervention will lead to positive and measurable
      outcomes for the mother-infant dyad.
