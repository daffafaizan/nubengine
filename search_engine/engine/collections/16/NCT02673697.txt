    
      PERSIST-AVR is designed to collect data on sutureless valve (Perceval sutureless aortic heart
      valve), a new type of biological aortic valve, comparing data with standard biological aortic
      valve, considered the gold standard for aortic valve replacement. This prospective,
      randomized international multicenter study is planned to demonstrate, as primary endpoint,
      the non inferiority of Major Adverse Cardiac and Cerebrovascular (MACCE) events at one year
      while showing superiority in resource consumptions at hospital discharge in patients treated
      with Perceval valve when compared to standard aortic valve replacement. The study is planned
      to cover the lack of prospective, randomized comparison data between sutureless valve and
      standard aortic biological sutured valve. To achieve the primary endpoint, 1234 patients will
      be recruited in 60 worldwide investigational sites. The be part of the trial, investigational
      sites should have demonstrated experience with the implantation of the Perceval and able to
      implement the requirements of the study protocol.. All subjects with severe symptomatic
      aortic stenosis or steno-insufficiency who are candidates for surgical replacement of their
      native aortic valve according to established guidelines in current medical practice and as
      specified in the Perceval valve Instruction for Use (IFU) are the intended population for
      inclusion in this randomized trial. The patients will be followed for 5 years after the
      implant, the total duration of study including the enrollment time will be 7 years
