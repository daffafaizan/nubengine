      disease progression, but are not able to revert the damage mechanism and trigger cartilage
      healing.

      Growth factors included in PRP could stimulate cartilage repair, normalize synovial fluid
      viscoelasticity, induce a correction in tissue damage, improve articular function, control
      pain and ameliorate quality of life.

      Primary aim of this trial was to assess, among patients with grade II/III osteoarthrosis of
      the knee, efficacy (as determined by improvement at MRI 6 months after the first injection)
      of three intraarticular injections of platelet lysate when compared to hyaluronic acid.
      Additional objectives were to compare the treatment groups in terms of a number of functional
      scales (WOMAC, Lysholm, Tegner Knee, Scale, AKS, Lequesne, VAS) and of number of adverse
      events.
