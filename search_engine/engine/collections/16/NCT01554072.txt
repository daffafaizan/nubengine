      risks and benefits of the study volunteers to patients with COPD. Subsequently, based on an
      evaluation form, will collect data on the past history and current disease and performed a
      general physical examination. Then the patients will respond to two questionnaires. The first
      will research the Medical Council (MRC) 13, which is a dyspnea scale to categorize in terms
      of disability, patients with COPD. The second questionnaire will be the Airway Questionnaire
      20 (AQ20) 14 specific for obstructive pulmonary disease, which is validated for the local
      language and highly reliable for the evaluation of patients with COPD, containing 20
      questions related to respiratory health to evaluate the quality of life. Subsequently, the
      same day, the patients carry out the following tests: spirometry, respiratory muscle
      strength, respiratory muscle endurance, assessment of training load of the upper and shuttle
      test and bioimpedance
