    
      Eligible patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to UGN-102 ± TURBT or TURBT alone.
      Randomization will be stratified by the presence of a previous LG NMIBC episode within 1 year
      of the current diagnosis (yes or no). Starting at Day 1, patients randomized to the UGN-102 ±
      TURBT group will receive 6 once-weekly intravesical instillations of UGN-102 and patients
      randomized to the TURBT alone group will undergo TURBT.

      Patients in both treatment groups will return to the clinic at approximately 3 months after
      the initiation of treatment (7 weeks ± 1 week after the last weekly instillation for the
      UGN-102 ± TURBT group and 12 weeks ± 1 week after TURBT for the TURBT alone group) to
      determine response to treatment. Patients determined to have a complete response (CR) will
      receive no further treatment and will enter the follow-up period of the study. Patients
      determined to have a non-complete response (NCR) will undergo TURBT of any remaining lesions
      and will then enter the follow-up period of the study.

      During the follow-up period, patients will return to the clinic every 3 months to determine
      durability of response. Patients will remain on study until completion of all follow-up
      visits (approximately 24 months after the initiation of treatment) or until recurrence or
      death is documented, whichever occurs first. Patients determined to have a protocol-defined
      recurrence at any follow-up or unscheduled visit will be considered to have completed the
      study and released to the care of their treating physician.

      The study is event-driven and patients may be followed beyond 24 months or additional
      patients may be enrolled to achieve the target number of events required for the study.
