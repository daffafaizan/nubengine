      provides surgeons with preoperative information on the vascular anatomy and facilitates
      surgical planning for flap harvesting. The advantages of CTA are that it is noninvasive,
      rapid, and easy to read by the surgeon. Moreover, it provides information to help the surgeon
      decide which site to explore in the operation and reduces the rate of injuring or missing an
      optimal perforator.

      This technique can help reduce the size of the incision needed for perforator exploration,
      which helps reduce the patient's postoperative discomfort. The operation time can be reduced
      by choosing suitable perforators in the preoperative stage, which can also help reduce the
      cost of hospitalization. NIR-assisted angiography gives live localization of the flap's
      dominant perforator perfusion zones while quantifying the relative tissue perfusion for
      immediate skin paddle design.
