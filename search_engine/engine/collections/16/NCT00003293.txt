      relapse treated with intravenous leflunomide (SU101) administered as a loading dose with
      weekly maintenance therapy versus oral, single-agent procarbazine administered daily for 28
      days every 56 days. II. Compare the median time to progression for these regimens in these
      patients. III. Assess the objective response of these patients. IV. Assess the safety of
      SU101 given on this schedule. V. Describe the health-related quality of life of these
      patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to performance status (Karnofsky 60-80% vs 90-100%), age (less than 50 vs 50 and
      over), and time from initial diagnosis to recurrence (6 months or greater vs less than 6
      months). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive
      leflunomide (SU101) IV over 6 hours daily on days 1-4, again 4-8 days later, and weekly
      thereafter for a total of 4 loading dose infusions and six maintenance infusions in course 1.
      Patients receive 7 weekly maintenance infusions of SU101 in courses thereafter. Treatment
      repeats every 8 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive procarbazine orally once or twice daily for 4
      weeks. Treatment is repeated every 8 weeks. All patients complete a health-related
      quality-of-life questionnaire every 8 weeks and at study withdrawal. Treatment courses
      continue up to a maximum of 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease
      progression. Patients are followed every 2 months, beginning 30 days after study completion.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 380 patients will be accrued for this study.
