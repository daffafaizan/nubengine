      with age-related skeletal muscle dysfunction. Age-related changes in muscle may be
      characterized by sarcopenia (i.e., loss of muscle mass) and/or myosteatosis (i.e., excessive
      intramuscular adipose tissue). These changes may result in physical impairments that may be
      exacerbated by the lack of a formal screening and diagnosis process for older adults in
      standard healthcare settings. Myosteatosis may compound the effects of sarcopenia and play a
      significant role the age-related functional decline and higher incidence of type 2 diabetes
      observed in African Americans in comparison to other ethnic/racial groups. The initial phase
      of the study will involve the assessment of older African Americans (n = 70) to characterize
      muscle size and quality in comparison to a younger reference group (n = 70). Participants
      randomly selected from the older subject pool will be assigned to either the Eccentric
      Exercise Group or the Concentric Exercise Group for 12 weeks of a supervised strengthening
      exercise regimen.
