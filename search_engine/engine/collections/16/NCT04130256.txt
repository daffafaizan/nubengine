      remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), at the Massachusetts General Hospital MS Clinics in a
      pilot study of Pillsy electronic pill bottles. People with RRMS who are taking (1)
      fingolimod, (2) dimethyl fumarate, (3) terifluonomide, (4) diroximel fumarate, or (5)
      siponimod will be eligible. Patients must possess any type of smartphone capable of
      downloading the Pillsy application to be eligible. Per the Pillsy manufacturer, the Pillsy
      application is available on iPhones connected to the Apple App Store and smartphones running
      the Android operating system that are connected to the Google Play Store. Participants will
      be asked to use the Pillsy bottle for 90 days each. Participants will be randomized 1:1 to
      two conditions: 1) active reminders and 2) passive adherence tracking. Patients in the active
      reminders group will receive daily alerts through the Pillsy bottle, the Pillsy app, and
      their phone to remind them to take their pill. Patients in the passive adherence tracking
      group will not receive reminders and will instead have usual adherence monitored by the
      electronic pill bottle.
