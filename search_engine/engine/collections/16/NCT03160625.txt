      design. Patients with existing pacemakers who have been diagnosed with HFpEF and meet study
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be included in the study.

      The study is expected to be conducted at up to 5 centers in the United States and up to 300
      patients will be consented to enroll up to 100 qualifying patients . Up to 60 patients
      meeting chronotropic incompetence (CI) criterion will be enrolled. The study will be
      conducted in subjects who have previously (â‰¥ 30 days) been implanted with Medtronic, dual
      chamber pacemaker (IPG) device with rate adaptive pacing (RAP) feature. Additionally, up to
      40 patients who do not meet CI criterion will be enrolled to collect ambulatory activity and
      heart rate data using AVIVO/SEEQ patch. These patients will be followed for only 1 week. It
      is estimated that subject enrollment will take approximately 12 to 18 months, with a study
      follow-up of 18 weeks.
