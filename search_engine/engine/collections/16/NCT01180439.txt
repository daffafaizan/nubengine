      asynchrony: delayed cycling, and insufficient expiratory time may induce progressive dynamic
      hyperinflation, and increase intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi); too high
      levels of pressure support may also contribute to dynamic hyperinflation. Increase in PEEPi
      is associated with two respiratory events: unrewarded inspiratory efforts, and
      auto-triggering.

      Our hypotheses are: 1/that these events occur frequently in COPD under NIV and that they are
      not detected by medical history or usual monitoring tools (SpO2; PtcCO2); 2/ that they can be
      easily detected by polysomnography; 3/ that simple adjustments of ventilator parameters
      aiming to reduce dynamic hyperinflation and unrewarded inspiratory efforts may improve
      efficacy of ventilation, quality of sleep and comfort of treatment.

      The present study compares the results of two consecutive sleep studies: 1.PSG under NIV in
      severe stable COPD under "usual ventilator settings" with 2.PSG under NIV after adapting
      ventilator settings to results of initial PSG.
