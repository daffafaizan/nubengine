      refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received 1 to 3 prior therapies.

      Participants receive the treatment determined by randomization for a maximum of 4 years or
      until confirmed disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or death
      (whichever occurs first). No crossover between the treatment arms is allowed.

      This was an open-label study. However, the assessment of response and disease progression for
      the primary analysis was determined by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) in a blinded
      manner. Sensitivity analyses of response and disease progression were determined centrally by
      the sponsor using a validated computer algorithm (Onyx Response Computational Assessment
      [ORCA]) in a blinded manner.

      Following progression or discontinuation of study drug(s), participants have 2 follow-up
      visits (30 days [+ 3] and 8 weeks [± 7 days] after last dose of all study drug[s]) and then
      remain in long-term follow-up (LTFU) where data on survival status and subsequent antimyeloma
      therapy is gathered every 12 weeks ± 2 weeks.
