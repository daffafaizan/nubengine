        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of alpha-fetoprotein peptide-pulsed autologous
           dendritic cells in HLA-A*0201-positive patients with hepatocellular carcinoma.

        -  Determine the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the immunological effects of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the progression-free survival and clinical responses in patients treated with
           this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive alpha-fetoprotein peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells intradermally on
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for a total of 3 doses in the absence of unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-12 patients receive escalating doses of vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 or 2 of 12
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.

      Patients are followed at weeks 1, 4, and 12 and then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-18 patients will be accrued for this study.
