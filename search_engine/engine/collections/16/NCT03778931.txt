    
      This is an international, multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled,
      event-driven, Phase 3 clinical study comparing the efficacy and safety of elacestrant to the
      SoC options of fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor (AI) in postmenopausal women and in men
      with advanced or metastatic ER+/HER2- breast cancer, either in subjects with tumors that
      harbor mutations in the ligand binding domain (LBD) of the estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) gene
      (ESR1-mut subjects) or in all subjects regardless of ESR1 status (ESR1-mut and ESR1 wild type
      [ESR1-WT]) and whose disease has relapsed or progressed on at least one and no more than two
      prior lines of endocrine therapy (with documented progression), which must have included
      prior CDK4/6 inhibitor therapy in combination with fulvestrant or an aromatase inhibitor (AI)
      and for whom hormonal monotherapy with one of the SoC drugs (fulvestrant, anastrozole,
      letrozole, exemestane) is an appropriate treatment option.
