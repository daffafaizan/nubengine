      global threats of the 21st century. The key driver of resistance is antibiotic overuse; long
      antibiotic courses select for resistance among the trillions of bacteria hosted by the human
      body. There is as yet no evidence from randomized studies on its optimal duration of
      antibiotic therapy. Traditionally, guidelines have somewhat arbitrarily recommended long
      courses of two weeks, even though patients with no structural complications may recover after
      only five days of therapy. Evidence is mounting that longer courses leave patients with
      multi-resistant organisms. Indeed, given rising concerns over resistance, many physicians
      have reduced antibiotic durations for GNB to 7 days with no apparent untoward consequences.

      This point-of-care, multicenter randomized controlled non-inferiority trial will randomize
      500 patients with GNB on day 5 of appropriate antibiotic therapy to either (1) a total of 7
      days of antibiotic therapy, (2) a total of 14 days of antibiotic therapy, or (3) an
      individualized duration of antibiotic therapy (guided by the patient's clinical course &
      C-reactive protein levels). The primary outcome is the incidence of clinical failure at day
      30. Patients will be followed through day 90; secondary outcomes will include the incidence
      of clinical failure on days 60 and 90, the total number of antibiotic days, the incidence of
      antibiotic-related adverse events (including Clostridium difficile infection), the emergence
      of bacterial resistance, length of hospital stay. Cost-effectiveness/health-economic analyses
      will also be performed.
