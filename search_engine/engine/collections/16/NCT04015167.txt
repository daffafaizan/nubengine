    
      The objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety and
      efficacy/performance of the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing System. Efficacy/performance of the
      procedure will be measured by an equal or higher (non-inferior) SF-36 Physical Component
      Summary (PCS) score result of the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing System compared to the T2 Tibia
      benchmark literature at 12 months.

      In addition, demonstration of bone consolidation in correct alignment will be measured by
      Investigator assessment by 12 months. Safety of the T2 Alpha Tibia Nailing System will be
      demonstrated through reporting of device related intra-operative and post-operative Adverse
      Events/incidents by 12 months.
