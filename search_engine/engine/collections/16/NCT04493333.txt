      out a simple 5-question sexual functioning survey. If any concern about sexual functioning is
      noted, the subject will also be asked to fill out a more extensive Sexual functioning tool,
      to help determine which domain of sexual functioning is the most bothersome.

      Subjects who complete the initial screening will be randomly assigned to the Intrarosa® or
      Replens™ arm by a 1:1 ratio. Subjects randomized to the Intrarosa® arm will use 6.5 mg daily
      for 12 weeks (±1 week). Subjects randomized to the Replens™ arm will use a vaginal applicator
      two times per week for 12 weeks.

      At baseline and at 12 weeks, subjects will undergo a physical exam including clinical breast
      and gynecological exam. During gynecologic exams, the vaginal Potential of Hydrogen (pH) will
      be determined and a swab of vaginal epithelium sent for determination of the Vaginal
      Maturation Index (VMI) and Maturation Value (MV). These will be used as objective physiologic
      markers to determine the improvement in vaginal atrophy. The cytologist's reading specimens
      will be blinded.

      Additionally, all study subjects will be asked to fill out questionnaires at baseline and
      again in 12 weeks.
