      treatment with levothyroxine by their attending physician in order to achieve an euthyroid
      status. Free T4 level is expected to be displayed within normal range (10-16 mg/dl) after the
      first few months of levothyroxine administration, and TSH level is expected to be less than
      5mU / ml after 3-4 months. Participants will be re-examined in 6 months after the initiation
      of substitution pharmacotherapy with levothyroxine. Similarly, a control group consisted by
      healthy children and adolescents matched for age and gender will be re-examined after a 6-
      month interval from the initial measurements.

      From all participants detailed medical history will be recorded and following parameters will
      be measured and calculated: Age and pubertal stage according Tanner, height, body weight,
      Body Mass Index (BMI),waist circumference, hip circumference, Mid Arm Circumference (MAC),
      skinfolds measurement (using a Harpenden skinfold caliper), in order to estimate the
      percentage (%) body fat. Measurement of RMR, with a portable device applying indirect
      calorimetry (Fitmate Cosmed, Italy) The blood samples will be collected and centrifuged
      immediately after the RMR measurement. Following parameters will be tested in serum: FGF-21
      (measured by ELISA method), TSH, F-T3, F-T4, TPOAb, TgAb, Fasting Glucose, Insulin, TChol,
      TG, HDL, LDL, AST, ALT, Î³GT (applying automatic chemical analyzers and analogues reagents
      that already exist at the Hospital).

      Additionally, a 3-day food dairy (two weekdays and one weekend day) will be completed by the
      participants and/or their caregivers just a week before the measurement of the RMR and the
      blood sampling.
