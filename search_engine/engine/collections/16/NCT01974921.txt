      Clinical trials have demonstrated clinical benefits regarding quality of life and
      exacerbations. Animal models suggested the reduction of bronchial smooth muscle as the
      principal responsible for the clinical benefits observed in asthma patients treated in the
      clinical trials, although there is little information about its mechanism of action, and
      limited to a very small number of case reports. Given that the mechanism of action of
      bronchial thermoplasty is still not well understood, we proposed a biological study in asthma
      patients treated with bronchial thermoplasty with the purpose to analyze changes in
      inflammatory markers and histological samples, as well as its correlation with clinical
      outcomes in real practice.
