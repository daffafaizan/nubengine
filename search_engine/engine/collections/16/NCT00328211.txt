      lumenal events that play key roles in absorption remain poorly understood. The aims of the
      present study are fourfold: 1) To determine whether previously observed effects on
      cholesterol absorption during bile acid feeding are related to changes in pool size and
      intestinal transit or meal stimulated gall bladder emptying or plasma cholecystokinin levels.
      2) To determine the effect of dietary sphingomyelin on cholesterol absorption, micellar
      solubilization and synthesis in normal adults and to assess the effects of intralumenal
      cholesterol solubilization, absorption and synthesis in adults with heterozygous mdr 3
      deficiency (a defect leading to low biliary phospholipid content). 3) To determine the
      mechanism of action of a non-ionic detergent, Pluronic F-68, by evaluating its effect on
      cholesterol solubilization and distribution between micelles and vesicles, on cholesterol
      absorption and synthesis. 4) To evaluate the intralumenal solubilization and distribution
      within micelles and vesicles of biliary compared to dietary cholesterol in humans and assess
      the impact of ezetimibe treatment on absorption of endogenous or exogenous cholesterol by
      assessing absorption of human contents in the biliary diverted, rat lymph fistula model. For
      each of these aims, subjects will be studied while consuming well-controlled diets as
      outpatients with a combination of human and animal techniques. Techniques employed for human
      studies will include state-of-the art techniques utilizing stable isotopes and isotope ratio
      mass spectrometry, gas chromatography. Translational studies in animals will be used
      including novel techniques to measure fat absorption as well as the use of the lymph fistula
      rat model for assessment of lipid absorption and hamsters for assessment of bile acid and
      sterol synthesis. Integration of animal/human techniques will provide tools to characterize
      the role of modifications of the intralumenal environment on cholesterol solubilization and
      human cholesterol absorption and synthesis.
