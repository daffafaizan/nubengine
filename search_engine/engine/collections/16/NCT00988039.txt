      NNRTI-based regimen is to combine a boosted protease inhibitor (bPI) with two (new) NRTIs.
      However, patients failing first-line therapy in roll-out programmes often have extensive NRTI
      resistance mutations that may compromise the efficacy of the NRTI drugs used in second-line
      therapy and it is likely that the virological potency of the second-line regimen is mostly
      due to the bPI. It is possible that the contribution of the NRTI drugs to efficacy may be
      outweighed by additional toxicity and cost. It is also possible that replacing the NRTI drugs
      with a new class of drug (integrase inhibitors) will improve outcome from second-line
      therapy, although if the boosted protease inhibitor alone is providing close to optimal
      response, incremental gains from adding a new class may be small.

      The principal aims are to determine whether, in patients failing a first-line NRTI and
      NNRTI-containing regimen:

        -  The use of bPI plus raltegravir (an integrase inhibitor) is superior to standard of care
           (bPI plus 2 new NRTIs) in achieving good HIV disease control at 96 weeks after
           randomisation

        -  The use of bPI monotherapy, preceded by a 12-week induction period in combination with
           raltegravir, is non-inferior to standard of care in achieving good HIV disease control
           at 96 weeks after randomisation
