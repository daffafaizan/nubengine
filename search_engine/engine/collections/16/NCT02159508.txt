           malnutrition at the end of treatment (50% to 20%), with a significance value of 5% (p <
           0.05), 90% power. The second calculation was for a sample size of 88 patients for 30%
           reduction in prevalence of malnutrition at the end of treatment (50% to 20%) with the
           significance value 5% (p<0.05), 85% power and effect size 70%. Based on these numbers,
           our aim is to recruit 100 patients, with the assumption that 12% patients would be lost
           to follow up.

        -  Randomization will be performed by the minimization procedure with the Minim ProgramÂ®
           (http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/guide/randsery.htm). The allocation will be done
           according to the following criteria: 1) Stage I-II vs. Stage III-IV; 2) age <65 vs. >=65
           year; 3) Body Mass Index <20 vs. >=20 kg/m2 and 4) tumour location (oral
           cavity-oropharynx-tonsils vs. hypopharynx-larynx vs. nasopharynx).

        -  Adverse events of chemoradiotherapy will be classified according to the National Cancer
           Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events-3.0 (CTCAE v3.0)

        -  Nutritional status will be assessed by patient-generated subjective global assessment,
           nutritional risk screening-2002, upper-arm anthropometry (MAC, triceps skinfold
           thickness, MAMA), Bio-impedance, hand grip strength and weight loss.

        -  Survival: overall survival, disease-specific survival and disease-free survival are
           calculated.
