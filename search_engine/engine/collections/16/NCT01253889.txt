      examination, at the discretion of the medical team. Randomization to soother and water
      (Control) with and without facilitated tucking or to soother and 25% glucose (Intervention)
      with or without facilitated tucking will be determined by generating randomly permuted
      sequential blocks of four and six allocation numbers.
