    
      This is a dose-escalation and expansion study of ASP1951. The study consists of 3 periods for
      monotherapy and combination therapy: screening, treatment and follow up, followed by an
      optional Re-treatment period for participants that qualify.

      The monotherapy escalation cohorts will evaluate escalating dose levels of ASP1951 in
      participants with locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumor malignancies
      including but not limited to squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), colorectal
      cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) and cervical cancer.

      The combination escalation cohorts will evaluate escalating dose levels of ASP1951 in
      combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab.

      For dose expansion, the tumor-specific cohorts will include participants with squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (all PD-L1
      status), NSCLC PDL1 high, and cervical cancer, as well as participants with any tumor types
      that respond to study drug treatment during dose escalation.

      Participants may reinitiate study drug treatment in the optional Re-treatment period after
      confirmation that the participant meets all the re-treatment eligibility criteria.

      After discontinuation of study drug, all participants will complete an end-of-treatment
      visit, along with 30-day and 90 day safety follow-up visits from the last dose of study drug.
