    
      This is a prospective, randomized, subject and clinician/observer blind, placebo-controlled
      parallel-group clinical trial of rTMS involving people who experience chronic tinnitus.
      Eligible subjects are randomly assigned to receive either active rTMS treatment or placebo
      treatment to either the left or right side of the head. Subjects receive 2000 pulses of 1 Hz
      rTMS therapy daily on 10 consecutive work days. Outcomes are measured prior to the start of
      treatment and after the last therapeutic session. Follow-up evaluations are conducted 1, 2,
      4, 13 and 26 weeks after the last treatment session. This design allows us to determine if
      rTMS reduces the severity and loudness of tinnitus, the long-term duration of relief, and
      whether the target for coil placement (left/right side of head) affects active rTMS efficacy.
