      standard of care local anesthesia based on evaluation in total hip arthroplasty This is a
      retrospective cohort study of consecutive patients undergoing THA at 3 hospitals within a
      U.S. healthcare system from January 2013 to July 2016. The control group received the
      standard of care undergoing THA (plain bupivacaine or ropivacaine), while the LB group
      received a mixture containing this drug as the alternative to the standard care. The outcome
      variables include hospital length of stay, readmissions, total hospital costs, patient pain
      scores, discharge disposition, morphine equivalent opioid consumption, and postoperative
      patient ambulation. Generalized linear models were employed to examine aforementioned
      outcomes controlling for age, gender, race, BMI, alcohol use, tobacco use, and surgeons..
