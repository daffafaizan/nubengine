      mass, and increased risk of some fractures. Very few studies have compared the effects of the
      RYGB and the SG on changes skeletal health and findings have been inconsistent. Furthermore,
      few studies have investigated the short- or long-term consequences of bariatric surgery on
      bone mineral density in pre- and post-menopausal women. To what extent and how bariatric
      surgery impacts the skeleton largely remains undetermined. Because estrogen is protective
      against osteoporosis and fractures, the majority of fractures occur in postmenopausal women.
      It is important that women have higher rates of obesity (38.3%) compared to men (34.3%) and
      that â‰¥67% of bariatric patients are women. Therefore, women may be at a significantly
      increased risk of developing osteoporosis. These data may help establish clinical guidelines
      to assess, maintain, and promote skeletal health in the preoperative and postoperative care
      of bariatric patients; and it may help to determine the appropriate bariatric procedure for
      women at risk of osteoporosis and fractures.
