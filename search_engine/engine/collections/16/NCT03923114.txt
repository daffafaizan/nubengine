      mechanisms of T2D becomes increasingly important. The glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor
      agonists (GLP-1RA), such as exendin, can be used as potent antidiabetic drugs for treatment
      of T2D. Not all patients with T2D respond to treatment with GLP-1RA and some even respond
      with contradictory effects, but the underlying mechanism for this observation remains
      unclear. Interestingly, uptake of an exendin-based radiotracer was observed in the pituitary
      gland in diabetes patients. In this study, the effect of GLP-1RA on the HPA axis will be
      further studied for an improved understanding of the mechanisms and contradictory treatment
      responses.

      Patient data will be obtained and will consist of metabolic characterization (laboratory
      parameters and oral glucose tolerance test), an ACTH assay and determination of cortisol
      excretion. In addition, Ga-68-NODAGA-exendin-4 PET/CT imaging will be performed in 10
      patients with treatment response (decrease in HbA1c or weight loss) and 10 patients without
      response after GLP-1RA therapy. In 5 patients with high radiotracer uptake, an additional
      brain MRI scan will be performed for improved anatomical referencing.
