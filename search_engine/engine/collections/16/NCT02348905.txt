      most commonly affects the lung3, it may affect any organ. Although corticosteroids are
      recognized as the drug of choice for sarcoidosis, ACTH is the only drug that is FDA-approved
      for this disorder. However, there is limited data on the efficacy of ACTH for this condition.

      Presently, corticosteroids as considered the drug of choice for the treatment of cutaneous
      sarcoidosis. However, ACTHER GEL not only has obvious anti-inflammatory effects by resulting
      in corticosteroid production, but it may also activate melanocortin receptors. The
      melanocortin system has powerful anti-inflammatory properties that may be beneficial in the
      treatment of cutaneous sarcoidosis.
