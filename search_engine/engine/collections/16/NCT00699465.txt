           primary intracerebral hemorrhage is generally believed to be at least as high as among
           patients with ischemic stroke.

        -  The currently available guidelines state that while low doses of subcutaneous heparin or
           low-molecular-weight heparin may reduce VTE, it is possible that their effect is
           counterbalanced by an increase in hemorrhagic complications.

        -  It is still unclear when (if ever) low-molecular-weight-heparin should be safely
           initiated in ICH patients.
