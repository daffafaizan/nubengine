      IgE-dependent allergic diseases. Sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) is the method which allows
      to give allergens via alternative oral route in patients home. Due to the possibility of
      avoiding injection this therapy allows to have better relationship with patient, and reduce
      the costs of therapy thanks to reducing the numbers of visits in out-patient clinic.However
      efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy are still important issues, especially in
      children.

      The purpose of trial is to compare the efficacy and safety of sublingual seasonal and annual
      immunotherapy in children with allergic rhinitis allergic to grass pollens.
