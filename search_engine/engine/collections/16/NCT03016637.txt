      Endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) is highly accurate regarding the detection of pancreatic
      cancer, and EUS guided fine-needle aspiration biopsy (EUS-FNA) may be used to verify the
      diagnosis in patients with non-resectable or metastatic disease. However, EUS-FNA is only
      diagnostic in approximately 70% of the cases, and the reported number of "atypical",
      "suspicious" and "insufficient" biopsies varies.

      SharkCore (TM) is a new type of EUS fine needle that allows the extraction of macroscopic
      tissue fractions ("trucut biopsies") instead of single cells or cluster of cells. Preliminary
      data suggest that EUS guided trucut biopsies from the pancreatic lesions are technically
      feasible without increasing the number of complications.

      This prospective study evaluates the clinical outcome and potential complications following
      EUS guided biopsy of pancreatic lesions suspected of cancer using a 25 Gauge or 22 Gauge
      SharkCore needle.
