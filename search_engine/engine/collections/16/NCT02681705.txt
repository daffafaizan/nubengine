      conformal radiotherapy to the tumor bed 5 days a week for 2 weeks. Beginning 1 week after the
      initiation of radiotherapy, Temozolomide is applied to these patients as a chemotherapy drug
      with a dosage of 75mg/m2, daily. The chemotherapy and radiation are combined as temozolomide
      is taken 1 hour prior to every fraction of radiotherapy.

      chemoradiotherapy, patients receive eight 4-week cycles of temozolomide (dosage: the 1st
      cycle, 150mg/m2, daily × 5 days, 4 weeks a cycle; the 2-8th cycle, 200mg/m2, daily × 5 days,
