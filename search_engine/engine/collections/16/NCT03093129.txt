      significant health care burden with an incidence of one million new cases per year. In
      Vietnam, Colorectal cancer is the third most common cause of cancer deaths in men and fourth
      in women. Artesunate is a safe and effective antimalarial with evidence of anticancer
      properties across a range of cancer cell lines. Results from a pilot feasibility study in
      colorectal cancer patients in the UK showed that artesunate was safe and well tolerated.
      These findings provided the basis for a Phase II clinical trial investigating the effects of
      neoadjuvant artesunate on progression free survival and overall survival in Stage II/III
      Colorectal Cancer in Vietnamese Patients.

      Artesunate given orally as a dose of 200 mg once a day for 14 days to patients with
      histologically confirmed Stage II/III colorectal cancer (CRC) awaiting surgical treatment
      with curative intent.
