      levels, eosinophilia, dermatitis, and recurrent skin and lung infections. The autosomal
      dominant form of HIES, Job's syndrome, is also characterized by skeletal abnormalities and
      lung cysts, and is caused primarily by a mutation in the STAT3 gene. The most common allergic
      or atopic symptoms seen in HIES include a characteristic rash and bronchial
      hyper-responsiveness. The rash tends to respond to systemic antimicrobials, topical
      antiseptics, mad steroids. It is unclear what the role, if any, IgE plays in the pathogenesis
      of these allergic (and perhaps non-allergic) phenotypes.

      Omalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody specific for the FcepsilonRI portion of IgE
      that does not cross-link IgE. It has been used for amelioration of severe asthma and food
      allergies, and is being studied in a number of other allergic diseases. This study aims to
      determine whether administration of omalizumab is safe in patients with HIES, effective in
      inducing FcepsilonRI downregulation, and in reducing some of the cutaneous and/or respiratory
      symptoms associated with HIES. It also aims to determine whether the present maximum
      indicated dose has any effect on patients with HIES who have greater than indicated IgE
      levels. Finally, it aims to assess the safety and pharmacodynamic profile of increased doses
      of omalizumab likely to be required in most patients with HIES.
