      known whether it improves insulin action in persons who are not leptin deficient. The purpose
      of the present study was to determine whether leptin therapy has weight loss-independent
      effects on insulin action in obese subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A
      randomized, placebo controlled trial was conducted in obese subjects with newly-diagnosed
      T2DM. Subjects were randomized to treatment with placebo (saline), low-dose (30 mg/d), or
      high-dose (80 mg/d) recombinant methionyl human (r-met hu) leptin for 14 days. Multi-organ
      insulin sensitivity before and after treatment was evaluated by using the
      hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp procedure in conjunction with stable isotopically labelled
      tracer infusions to measure glucose, glycerol and fatty acid kinetics.
