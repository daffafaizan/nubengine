    
      All patients hospitalized in the post-emergency unit of Rennes University Hospital during the
      study period will be screened for malnutrition.

      Data concerning newly diagnosed malnourished patients will be recorded and those patients
      will be contacted 3 months after their hospital discharge.

      A qualitative study will be conducted among malnourished patients and their families : a
      sample of patients and their caregivers will be interviewed to better understand their
      perception of malnutrition and what they need to better take care of malnutrition.
