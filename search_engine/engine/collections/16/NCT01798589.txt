    
      We propose an open, prospective, single-site study to evaluate the bioequivalence of
      ethylenediamine dihydrochloride in methylcellulose (MC)and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP)
      formulations. Bioequivalence will be determined in minimum of 15 adult subjects, with a
      clinical history of contact dermatitis and a positive patch test (current or previous) to
      ethylenediamine ("sensitives").
