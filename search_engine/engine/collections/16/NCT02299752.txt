      foremost prevented . The risk of acquiring a virus from one percutaneous needle stick is 0.3%
      to 0.4% for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), 6% to 30% for hepatitis B (HBV), and 2.7% to
      10% for hepatitis C (HCV). The prevention of blood-borne infections is particularly important
      during cases when emergency medical attention is needed. Emergency Response Personnel that
      work in this profession have taken medical rescue courses to prepare for situations of sudden
      health threats, hence the majority of procedures is associated with direct contact with body
      fluids of the patient.
