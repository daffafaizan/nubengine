      failure in extubation. The investigators hypothesized that the use of a titrated PEEP level
      prior to and after extubation might improve successful extubation rates and avoid
      re-intubation.

      In this study, patients will be awake and ventilated in the pressure support ventilation
      (PSV) mode. The investigators will apply different PEEP levels to measure WOB, transpulmonary
      pressure and characterize the response of the respiratory system to increasing or decreasing
      PEEP. The "Titrated-PEEP" will be identified as the PEEP level associated with the lowest
      value of respiratory system elastance and an end expiratory transpulmonary pressure of 2
      cmH2O. Then the participants will have two spontaneous breathing trials; one at PEEP 0-5
      cmH2O, and the other at the "Titrated-PEEP" level, with PSV=0 and FiO2 unchanged. After
      extubation, the participants will first receive CPAP set at "Titrated-PEEP", then spontaneous
      breathing. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT), respiratory system mechanics and gas
      exchange will be recorded during the study.

      The investigators believe that the real-time determination of "Titrated-PEEP" can guide the
      treatment of mechanical ventilation and give us a better understanding of the physiology and
      pathophysiology of morbidly obese patients. As a result, this study will improve patient
      safety; reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation, complications and healthcare costs.
