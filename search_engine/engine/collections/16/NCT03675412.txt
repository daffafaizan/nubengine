      and macular blood flow in the back of the eye.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the acute changes in peripapillary and
      macular blood flow before and after an intake of oral caffeine (200 milligram tablet) in
      glaucoma patients and healthy subjects by using optical coherence tomography angiography
      (OCTA) scans. This novel imaging tool creates three-dimensional angiograms to assesses signal
      changes caused by flowing blood cells in a non-invasive angiogram scan. Blood flow is shown
      as vessel density measured in percentage.
