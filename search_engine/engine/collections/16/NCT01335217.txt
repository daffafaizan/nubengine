    
      A total of 20 subjects with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) co-occurring with Post Traumatic
      Stress Disorder (PTSD), ages 18 to 75 years, will be consented and join this project at UCLA.

      The project will use TNS in under open-label conditions, using the same stimulation
      parameters as have been used in prior studies in MDD by itself and in treatment-refractory
      epilepsy. Subjects will be seen every two weeks during the 8 week study. At the end of the 8
      weeks, the TNS systems will be returned and the adjunctive treatment will end. The co-primary
      endpoints are the changes in depression severity and in PTSD severity from enrollment to the
      week 8 visit.
