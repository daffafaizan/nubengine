      I. To determine whether oxybutynin chloride (oxybutynin) can diminish hot-flash activity in
      women with a history of breast cancer or in women who have a concern about taking estrogen
      for fear of breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform a dose-response evaluation of two oxybutynin doses. II. To determine the
      toxicity of oxybutynin in the study population. III. To assess the impact of hot-flash
      activity on overall quality of life and to examine whether oxybutynin can diminish this
      impact on quality of life.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 4 groups.

      GROUP I (LOW-DOSE OXUBUTYNIN CHLORIDE): Patients receive lower dose oxybutynin chloride
      orally (PO) twice a day (BID) on days 8-49 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II (LOW-DOSE PLACEBO): Patients receive lower dose placebo PO BID on days 8-49 in the
      absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP III (HIGH-DOSE OXUBUTYNIN CHLORIDE): Patients receive lower dose oxybutynin chloride PO
      BID on days 8-14 and higher dose oxybutynin chloride on days 15-49 in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP IV (HIGH-DOSE PLACEBO): Patients receive lower dose placebo PO BID on days 8-14 and
      higher dose placebo on days 15-49 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
