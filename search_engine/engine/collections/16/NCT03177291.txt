    
      This study will be conducted in two phases: 1) a Phase I dose escalation study with a
      Standard 3+3 design to determine the recommended Phase II dose and 2) a Phase Ib expansion
      study to evaluate early signs of efficacy and obtain more toxicity data. The Phase I trial
      will be a single center, dose-escalation study of pirfenidone combined with standard
      chemotherapy in the treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC, followed by a Phase Ib trial to
      determine early clinical efficacy [objective tumor response rate (ORR)] and toxicity data.
