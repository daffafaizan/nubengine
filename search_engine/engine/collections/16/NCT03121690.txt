    
      The following parameters will be recorded:

        -  Demographic data: including age, sex, smoking history.

        -  Clinical data: Glasgow coma scales, Co-morbidities are determined by reviewing the
           patients' clinical histories, chest examination.

        -  Vital signs: including body temperature, respiratory rate, heart rate, and arterial
           blood pressure.

        -  Oxygenation data: including arterial blood gases in fixed days (at the start, 3rd day
           and 7th day of steroid administration), ratio of partial oxygen tension in arterial
           blood to fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2 ratio).

        -  Laboratory data include complete blood picture focusing on leukocytic count and
           platelets, kidney and liver function tests, serum electrolytes, Erythrocyte
           sedimentation rate, C reactive protein, sputum culture and cortisol level before steroid
           administration.

        -  Radiology data include chest X-ray and chest ultrasonography at the day of diagnosis and
           at 7th day of steroid administration. Chest CT will be done if possible.

      Procedures: Systemic steroids will be administered early with a dosages equivalent to
      prednisone 40 mg/day for 7 days which is considered as a "stress dose" of systemic
      corticosteroids for pneumonia. The patients will also receive the appropriate initial
      intravenous antibiotic medication and the standard care as recommended in RICU policy.
      Cortisol level will be measured before steroid administration.
