      warts, excluding the face, with each wart lesion not exceeding 10 x 10mm. Macrophotography of
      all study warts will be captured along with a blinded site Investigator to characterize wart
      healing, wart clearance and wart reduction. All subjects will be followed at 7, 30, 60, and
      90-days following the last CellFX or Cryosurgical Procedure. All wart lesions are eligible
      for up to a total of 3 treatments over the course of the study. Adverse events will be
      documented.
