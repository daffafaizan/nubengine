      role in shoulder biomechanics, joint stability and proprioception. Age-related changes due to
      chronic stress and cellular impairment may contribute to thickening and stiffening of the
      coracoacromial ligament to rupture the rotator cuff and development of shoulder pathologies
      such as impingement syndrome. In this study, it was aimed to determine the relationship
      between pathologic findings and coracoacromial ligament thickness in magnetic resonance
      imaging in shoulder pain patients. Secondary purpose is whether the thickness of the
      coracoacromial ligament is indicative of shoulder pathologies.
