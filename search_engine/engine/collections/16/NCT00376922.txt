        -  Determine the feasibility of using music as an intervention to reduce anxiety and
           perceived pain in adult patients who are undergoing bone marrow biopsy for hematologic
           cancers or other diseases.

        -  Compare differences in state anxiety and perceived pain level between patients treated
           with or without music intervention.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, feasibility study. Patients are stratified according to the
      practitioner performing the procedure. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I (music intervention): Patients complete baseline questionnaires that measure
           anxiety and anticipated pain prior to bone marrow biopsy (BMB). Patients also provide
           demographic and clinical information, including pre-procedure medications and previous
           BMB experience. Patients then choose from music compact discs with various types of
           relaxing music (e.g., classical, country, soft rock, and R&B) and listen to the music
           through headphones during the bone marrow biopsy for approximately 30 minutes. After the
           biopsy, patients complete questionnaires that measure their response to the music, in
           terms of anxiety and perceived pain experienced during the procedure, and their overall
           level of satisfaction.

        -  Arm II (usual care [control]): Patients complete pre-procedure questionnaires, as in arm
           I, and undergo BMB without music intervention. Post-procedure questionnaires assess
           patient response to BMB in the absence of music and their level of satisfaction with the
           procedure.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study.
