      Primary

        -  To establish psychometric properties for the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy
           Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Inhibitor (FACT-EGFRI 18) module (based on criterion
           validity, known group's validity, internal consistency reliability, and responsiveness
           to change) as a patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure of EGFRI-induced skin-related
           toxicity.

      Secondary

        -  To document minimally important differences over time for the FACT-EGFRI 18 by comparing
           mean changes in this PRO measure to the patient's direct assessment of change using two
           anchor items (change in skin condition severity and impact).

        -  To examine the association between toxicity profiles (severity and time to onset), and
           treatment profiles (e.g., delays and discontinuation) and the FACT-EGFRI 18 scores.

        -  To assess degree of concordance between FACT-EGFRI 18 ratings and study site physician
           CTCAE Version 4.0 EGFRI-Induced Dermatologic Toxicity Grading Assessment ratings.

        -  To evaluate feasibility outcomes.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients complete the S1013 Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy Epidermal Growth Factor
      Receptor Inhibitor (FACT-EGFRI 18) at baseline and prior to beginning therapy and clinical
      assessment. Patients also complete FACT-EGFRI 18 and the Changes in Skin Symptoms on days 1*,
      8**, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 71, 99, and 127. Patients who do not develop any grade of
      papulopustular rash within 42 days are removed from study.

      Investigators performing the patients' clinical assessment complete the EGFRI-Induced
      Dermatologic Toxicity Grading Assessment on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 71, 99, and 127,
      and the Treatment Form assessment on days 22, 43, 71, 99, and 127. Nurses or clinical trial
      administrators (CRA) also complete the S1013 Cover Sheet for Patient Complete Questionnaires
      accompanying the FACT-EGFRI 18 patients' questionnaires at each schedule assessment.

      NOTE: *Patients start EGFRI therapy.

      NOTE: **Change in Skin Symptoms questionnaire starts on Day 8.
