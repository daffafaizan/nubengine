      tools are designed to reflect the perspective of healthcare providers, not perspective of
      patients. In addition to clinical results, it is necessary to evaluate the quality of life of
      patients when measuring the effect of medical treatments. Thus, evaluation criteria which can
      be useful as patient-reported outcome indices, have received increasing attention in recent
      years. Health-related quality of life provides a patient-reported assessment. Japanese
      Orthopaedic Association Hip Disease Evaluation Questionnaire (JOAHDEQ) evaluates quality of
      life related to hip disorders. It is also a guide in determining the expectations of
      individuals in the treatment process. It consists of 3 subscales (pain, movement and mental)
      and 20 items. Hip condition and pain are evaluated with a 100 mm scale. 20 items are scaled
      likert with values between 0 and 4. "0" means "strongly agree", "1" means "agree", "2" means
      "uncertain", "3" means "disagree" and "4" means "strongly disagree". The study is planned
      with 105 individuals with hip disease. After questioning the sociodemographic characteristics
      of the individuals, the patients will be asked to fill in JOAHDEQ, Oxford Hip Score,
      International Hip Outcome Tool-12, Short Form-36, and Visual Analog Scale Test-retest will be
      re-applied to those of the same individuals who can be reached after 1 week. The results will
      be analyzed using the SPSS version 22.0 computer package program.
