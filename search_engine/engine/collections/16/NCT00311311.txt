      effect sent to all participating sites on November 18. All sites were asked to have patients
      returned to the sites and have all end of study procedures performed by Dec 31, 2011.

      The decision to terminate this study was made following the conduct of an interim analysis
      which demonstrated that the study did not reach its primary endpoint. The termination of this
      study was not driven by any safety concerns and had no impact on subject safety and
      well-being.
