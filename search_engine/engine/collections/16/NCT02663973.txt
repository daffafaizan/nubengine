    
      The principal goal of this study is to describe the epidemiology of breast cancer in the
      Brazilian population. Other specific goals are:

        -  To evaluate the demographic and socio-demographic profile, comorbidities and
           reproductive risks, anthropometric profile and family history.

        -  Characterize the breast tumors immunophenotype through anatomopathological data, such
           as: tumor grade, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, HER2, Ki67.

        -  Describe the screening tests, main symptoms and cancer stage in the moment of the
           diagnosis.

        -  Describe the initial cancer treatment and locally advanced such as surgery,
           radiotherapy, chemotherapy and endocrine therapy.

        -  Describe palliative treatment for recurrent or metastatic breast cancer: chemotherapy,
           radiotherapy, biphosphonate, and others.

        -  Evaluate the clinical outcomes such as: local or diffuse relapse, period of time until
           progression to metastatic cancer, global lifespan and specific breast cancer lifespan.

        -  Evaluate clinical complications of the metastatic disease, such as: brain metastasis,
           spinal cord compression, skeletal related events.

        -  Analyze the demographical and socio-economical characteristics, clinical-pathological
           characteristics of the tumor, treatment, clinical outcomes, type of institution
           (private/public), and other factors that may impact clinical outcome.
