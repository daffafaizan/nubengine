    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, and parallel study. The study is
      comprised of three main phases: a single-blind placebo run-in qualifying phase lasting about
      14 days, a double-blind treatment phase of 12 weeks, and a 2-week follow-up phase.
      Approximately 18 patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive placebo or 1,000
      mg of extended-release Ranolazine twice-daily for 12 weeks to reach 14 evaluable patients at
      the end of the study.

      Patients with chronic angina pectoris will be screened for eligibility after providing
      informed consent. Patients present with the symptoms of stable angina after withdrawn from
      other antianginal agents and given the required background therapy for at least 5 days will
      be qualified for entering this study and performing 1st ETT qualifying test.
