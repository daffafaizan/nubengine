      address community mobilization and demand creation on one hand and assess the synergistic
      immune enhancement potential of combining Inject able Polio Vaccine (IPV) and Oral Polio
      Vaccine (OPV) in at-risk children. This project will be implemented in high risk union
      councils of Karachi, district Kashmore in Sindh and Bajaur Agency in Federally administered
      Tribal areas (FATA)

      This will be a three cell cluster randomized trial to achieve the objectives of the study.
      The first cell of the study will receive all the routine activities being carried out by the
      polio program, the second cell will receive an expanded intervention with community support
      groups, enhanced communication package, education and counseling and involvement of private
      sector. While the third cell will receive all of the interventions of second cell with a
      combined OPV IPV approach during the polio immunization campaign through child health camps.

      We have calculated a total sample size of 120 clusters, 40 clusters per group for each study
      area i-e 120 for Karachi, 120 for Kashmore and 120 for Bajaur. Polio program in Pakistan has
      well established and demarcated vaccination areas assigned to a vaccination team, each
      vaccination area usually covers about 200 children therefore the area of vaccination team
      will be considered as one cluster in the proposed study.

      The implementation of the project will be followed by impact assessment activities that will
      include post vaccination coverage surveys and Immunity assessment activities and
      Environmental sample collection. A total sample size of 5310 children has been calculated for
      the immunity studies for seroprevalance and 5130 for stool virus shedding
