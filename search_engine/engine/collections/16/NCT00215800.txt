      parallel groups study conducted at up to fifteen (15) centers to compare the safety and
      efficacy of Ampligen速 IV versus placebo IV in 230-240 patients with CFS/ME. Patients will be
      randomized and stratified to receive either Ampligen速 intravenously or placebo (normal
      saline) intravenously. Fifty percent (50%) of the patients will be treated with Ampligen速 IV
      and 50% of the patients will be treated with placebo IV.

      Patients will be studied until 64 weeks (STAGES I plus II) have passed or until: 1) removed
      because of toxicity, 2) they withdraw voluntarily, 3) a change in the patient's medical
      condition makes continued participation unsafe, 4) the patient becomes non-compliant with the
      requirements of the protocol or 4) the Sponsor terminates the study.

      Official Title: A multi-center, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of the
      safety and efficacy of poly I:poly C12U (Ampligen速) 400 mg IV twice weekly versus placebo in
      patients with severely debilitating chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis
      (ME)
