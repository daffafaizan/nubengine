      taken from the patient. Additionally, two nasal swab samples will be taken using the Spartan
      COVID-19 swabs with an adjusted tip. All samples will be analyzed using the Spartan COVID-19
      System.

      The lab-based predicate test will be taken at the same time, with results reported back to
      Spartan to be compared with results obtained from the Spartan COVID-19 System.
