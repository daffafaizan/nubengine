    
      The primary aim of this study is to compare the instantaneous and total consumption of
      sevoflurane using 2 different concentrations and different minute / fresh gas flow to fill
      the system in the initial phase of anesthesia. Its secondary purpose is to compare the depth
      of anesthesia and hemodynamic parameters between the two groups.

      A total of 70 patients between the ages of 18-65 will be included in the study.in 2.5 %
      sevoflurane grup After reaching 1.2 MAC level with 4 lt / min fresh gas flow and 2.5%
      sevoflurane concentration in the initial stage in 35 patients, anesthesia maintenance will be
      continued with 0.5 lt / min fresh gas flow and 2 -4% sevoflurane concentration with the
      target of 1 MAC. in sevoflurane 8 % group for 35 patients, after reaching 1.2 (MAC) level
      with 1 lt / min fresh gas flow and 8% sevoflurane concentration in the initial phase,
      maintenance of anesthesia will be continued with 0.5 lt / min fresh gas flow and 2 -4%
      sevoflurane concentration with the target of 1 MAC. . The depth of anesthesia for both groups
      will be measured by the Bispectral Index (BIS). BIS values between 40 and 60 are appropriate
      values for general anesthesia, for this value 1 MAC sevoflurane inhalation anesthesia and
      remifentanil infusion (0.1-0.3mcg / kg / min) will be used.
