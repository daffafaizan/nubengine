      examine the possible mechanisms of leptin action by studying the effects of leptin
      administration on food intake, insulin resistance, insulin secretory response, hepatic and
      intramuscular triglyceride stores in a large sample of patients with lipodystrophy.

      Hypothesis: Leptin replacement in patients with generalized and partial lipodystrophy and
      hypoleptinemia will be safe and efficacious in improving the metabolic abnormalities
      associated with insulin resistance.
