      profound fatigue of unknown cause, which is permanent and limits the person's functional
      capacity, producing various degrees of disability. It seems that inadequate or impaired
      energy provision through cellular metabolism may contribute to the pathogenic initiation and
      maintenance of CFS.

      A variety of dietary interventions have been used in the management of CFS, yet no
      therapeutic modality demonstrated overall positive results in terms of effectiveness.
      Previous studies have evaluated the effects of essential fatty acids, vitamins, minerals
      and/or enzymes, with findings that do not support the use of a broad-spectrum nutritional
      supplement in treating CFS-related symptoms. Considering the fact that patients with CFS have
      lower levels of high-energy compounds (e.g. phosphocreatine, adenosine triphosphate),
      effective dietary treatment of CFS should be focused on providing compounds that facilitates
      cellular bioenergetics. Besides other candidate agents, creatine (Cr) could be of particular
      interest since it occurs naturally in the human body.

      Placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind, cross-over clinical trial examining the
      effectiveness of Cr for the treatment of CFS will be organized according to the Consolidated
      Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.
