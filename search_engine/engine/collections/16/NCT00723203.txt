      Primary

        -  To determine the antitumor activity of panobinostat, in terms of objective response
           rate, time to progression, and survival, in patients with relapsed or refractory acute
           lymphoblastic leukemia or acute myeloid leukemia.

        -  To assess the toxicity of panobinostat in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  To perform correlative laboratory studies to assess changes in various proteins that may
           be altered by histone deacetylase inhibition therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral panobinostat once on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment repeats every
      28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients undergo peripheral blood and bone marrow sample collection at baseline and on day 28
      of course 1 for correlative laboratory studies. Samples are analyzed by RT-PCR for
      reactivation of FANCG, FOXO3A, GADD45A, GADD45B, GADD45G, H2AX, and TP73.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 4 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 74 patients (37 with acute myeloid leukemia and 37 with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia) will be accrued for this study.
