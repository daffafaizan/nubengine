    
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-masked, comparative study in patients who present
      at the Robert Cizik Eye Clinic with horizontal forehead rhytides requiring treatment with
      botulinum toxin Type A (Botox Â®; Allergan, Irvine, CA, USA).

      The objective of this study is to determine whether there is a difference in clinical effect
      (weakness/paralysis of the frontalis muscle), duration of effect, level of discomfort and
      patient satisfaction in patients receiving topical anesthesia (2.5% lidocaine/2.5 %
      prilocaine cream, Impax Laboratories, LLC) on one side of the forehead and petrolatum
      ointment on the other prior to BTX-A administration for the treatment of forehead rhytides.

        -  Primary outcome variable is change of eyebrow excursion on each side of the forehead
           from baseline to each follow-up visit.

        -  Secondary outcome variables

             -  Duration of effect, defined as the elapsed time from injection to the end of
                botulinum, such that return of baseline frontalis function, i.e. within 2 mm of
                baseline value

             -  Perception of pain immediately after injection at each side

             -  Patient satisfaction for each side

             -  Patient's perception of difference in efficacy
