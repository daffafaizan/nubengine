      filled with sterile water through the catheter. As the bladder is filled, the participant is
      asked to rate their urinary urgency using the Urgeometer. The Urgeometer lever marks a
      continuous scale from 0 'no urge at all' to 100 'maximum urge which you can tolerate'. The
      testing is stopped once the bladder is filled. To minimize the chance of infection,
      participants receive one dose of oral antibiotics prior to the bladder testing.

      Following completion of the bladder test, participants will take 10mg solifenacin succinate
      (VesicareR) daily for 30 days. Afterward, participants repeat the bladder test. The change in
      participants' maximal tolerated cystometric capacity (MCC) will be measured in milliliters
      and used to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug.
