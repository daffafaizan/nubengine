      the patient was randomized and this included the following:

        -  a screening period up to 4 weeks,

        -  a treatment period expected to be between 48 and 152 weeks,

        -  4-week post rapid elimination follow-up period.

      Patients were to continue on treatment until a fixed common end date which was approximately
      48 weeks after randomization of the last patient.

      For those patients who completed the treatment period, a long term extension study of
      approximately 1 year (including teriflunomide alone) was initially planned to be proposed.
