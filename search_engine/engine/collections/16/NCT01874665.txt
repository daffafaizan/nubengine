      safety of ponatinib in participants with metastatic and/or unresectable GIST after failure of
      prior TKI therapy. Participants whose tumors have an activating mutation in exon 11 of
      cellular KIT (KIT) will be enrolled into Cohort A. Participants whose tumors have other
      activating mutations will be enrolled into in Cohort B.

      The primary objective is to assess clinical benefit in participants with KIT exon 11-mutant
      GIST (Cohort A) defined as clinical benefit rate (CBR), which is the composite of complete
      response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable disease (SD) lasting greater than or equal to
      (>=) 16 weeks per modified response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST 1.1) as a
      measure of disease control. The secondary objective is to assess clinical benefit in
      participants with GIST that lacks an activating KIT exon 11 mutation (Cohort B) and in the
      total participant population. The efficacy assessments are tumor response using RECIST
      Version 1.1, modified for GIST and assessment of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS). The safety assessments include routine physical and laboratory evaluations,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), echocardiograms (ECHOs), and adverse event (AE) monitoring. Other
      assessments include optional 18F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET);
      optional pre- and post-treatment tumor biopsy for pharmacodynamic studies; and
      pharmacokinetics (PK). It is estimated that accrual will be complete within 1 year; the total
      estimated duration of the study is 3 years.
