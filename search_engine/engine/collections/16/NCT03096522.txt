    
      Patients with anal fistula who will undergo anal fistulotomy will be randomized into one of
      two groups; the first group will receive topical phenytoin therapy postoperatively and the
      second group will not receive such topical treatment.

      Healing of the wound after fistulotomy will be observed every week and the duration till
      complete healing will be recorded. The two groups will be compared regarding the mean
      duration till complete healing and postoperative complications.
