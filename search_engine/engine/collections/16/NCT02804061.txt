      medically pre-screened using the PARmed-X for Pregnancy (2015) in early pregnancy (<18
      weeks), stratified by pre-pregnancy BMI status (normal weight [18.5-24.9 kg/m2]; overweight
      [25.0-29.9 kg/m2], obese [=>30.0 kg/m2]) and randomized into one of 3 groups: Group A) NELIP
      (full intervention); Group B) Nutrition intervention given at study entry followed
      sequentially by the exercise intervention starting immediately after 24 week mid-way visit
      (N+E); or Group C) Exercise intervention started at study entry followed sequentially by the
      nutrition intervention starting immediately after 24 week mid-way visit (E+N). Infant sex,
      body weight, length, complications will be recorded at birth and the last known maternal body
      weight. Neonatal morphometrics will be assessed with diaper only (6 skinfold sites from
      umbilical, suprailiac, biceps, triceps, subscapular, and anterior thigh; circumferences from
      the head, chest, abdomen, hips, thigh, leg, arm, and arm, forearm, thigh and leg length
      measured to the nearest mm) and will be measured within 6-18 hours of delivery by a member of
      the research team visiting the woman either at hospital or home. Each maternal-infant pair
      will be asked to return to the lab at 2, 6 and 12 months post-delivery for follow-up and
      assessment of chronic disease risk.
