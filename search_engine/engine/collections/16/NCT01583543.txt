      recurrent and/or metastatic Ewing's sarcoma following failure of conventional chemotherapy.

      Secondary Objectives To evaluate the progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety
      of olaparib in this patient population (ie Number of Participants With Adverse Events). As an
      exploratory objective, the investigators will evaluate (in subjects who agree to an optional
      biopsy) differences in pre- and post-treatment tumor DNA alterations and differences in
      levels of protein and RNA expression related to PARP inhibition.

      Study Design Potential subjects who discuss and sign the informed consent form will undergo
      screening studies. Eligible patients will administer olaparib and obtain restaging imaging
      studies after 6 and 12 weeks on study, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. Participants will
      remain on study drug until disease progression, onset of unacceptable toxicities, or subject
      withdraws consent.
