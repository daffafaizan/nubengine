    
      Patients with malignant pleural effusions undergo VATS-procedure. In the intraoperative
      finding of a partially entrapped lung, patients are randomized in 2 groups.

      Arm 1: Insufflation of talc and insertion of a (standard) drainage which will be removed 4-7
      days after surgery.

      Arm 2: Insufflation of talc and insertion of a (standard) drainage which will be removed 4-7
      days after surgery. Additionally, a subcutaneous tunneled catheter will be inserted and will
      remain in situ

      Follow up period is 3 Months

      Primary objective is the comparison of quality of life between the 2 arms.

      Secondary objective is the reliability of the subcutaneous tunnelled catheter in practice as
      well as function and dysfunction of the drainage system. Clinical parameters (respiratory
      function measured as FEV1 and vital capacity, recurrent pleural effusion, infection, need for
      relief of effusion or pleuracentesis) are observed.
