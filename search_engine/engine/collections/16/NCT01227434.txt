    
      A total of 30 patients with recurrent Glioblastoma or Gliosarcoma will be treated with PD
      0332991 at a dose of 125 mg daily for 21 consecutive days followed by a 7 day break off
      therapy (cycle length is 28 days). Of these 30 patients, 15 will receive drug for 7 days
      prior to an indicated, intended surgical resection for progression, and will then resume drug
      at the same dose after recovery from surgery. Treatment will be repeated every 28 days, and
      in the absence of disease progression patients may receive treatment for 12 cycles. At that
      time patients will be given the option to continue on study past 12 cycles, up to a maximum
      of 24 cycles.

      Following registration, available blocks or slides from a previous surgery must be submitted
      for diagnosis review (confirmation of Glioblastoma multiforme or Gliosarcoma) and Rb status
      determination. Only patients with Rb positive tumors can be treated, and Rb tumor status must
      be known prior to any treatment. Additional tissue from previous surgeries will also be
      obtained to evaluate molecular abnormalities in the tumor. These studies will be done
      retrospectively and are not required to be performed prior to registration.

      Monitoring will include a clinical and neurological exam before the beginning of each cycle
      (every 4 weeks). Complete blood counts with differential will be examined on days 1 and 15 of
      each cycle. Liver and renal function will be performed every 4 weeks. Toxicity and dose
      modifications will be based on the NCI CTCAE Version 4. Disease status will be assessed
      clinically each cycle (every 4 weeks) and radiographically after each second cycle (every 8
      weeks).
