      metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer who have not receive prior chemotherapy for their
      advanced disease. II. Characterize pharmacokinetic parameters of irinotecan and its
      metabolite SN-38 and their relationship to response and toxic effect. III. Characterize tumor
      samples for topoisomerase I activity, proliferative fraction (ki67 expression), and p53
      expression and determine whether clinical response is related to these tumor characteristics
      in patient population. IV. Determine the in vitro inhibition of topoisomerase I activity by
      irinotecan, SN-38, and other camptothecin analogs and evaluate whether the degree of in vitro
      sensitivity to irinotecan and/or SN-38 is associated with clinical response in these
      patients. VII. Determine the frequency of somatic mutations following irinotecan and
      correlate this with pharmacologic parameters.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV at a starting dose weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2
      weeks of rest. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Tumor status is reassessed every 12 weeks during study. Patients attaining a
      complete response may receive additional courses of treatment. Patients are followed until
      death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 54 patients will be accrued into this study at a rate of 25
      patients per year.
