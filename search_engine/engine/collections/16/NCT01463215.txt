    
      This is an Open-Label, Dose Escalation with 2 Dose Levels, Proof-of-Concept Clinical Trial of
      Ambroxol for the Treatment of Patients with Type I Gaucher Disease.

      This study is a randomized clinical trial involving 20 evaluable patients affected with Type
      1 Gaucher disease who are responsive to Ambroxol in vitro. There are 2 treatment groups,
      involving 2 dose levels of Ambroxol (187.5 and 225 mg/day), given once daily PO for 2 months
      in both groups. The 187.5-mg/day dose level will be tested first. If there are no significant
      adverse events, defined as >Grade 3 toxicity according to the latest version of the National
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC), the 225-mg/day dose level will be
      tested.
