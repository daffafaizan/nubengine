      Screening Phase will be conducted on an outpatient basis within 30 days, but no less than 3
      days, prior to the start of the Baseline Phase. The Baseline Phase will consist of clinical
      research unit (CRU) admission and final qualification assessments. The Treatment Phase will
      be comprised of dosing on Day 1, post-treatment safety and pharmacodynamic assessments, and
      blood and urine collection. Subjects may be discharged approximately 24 hours after study
      drug administration on Day 2, provided the Modified Aldrete Score and all designated
      discharge criteria are clinically acceptable to the Investigator. The Follow-Up Phase will
      occur on Study Day 5 (Â± 1 day).
