      on patients undergoing either laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or laparoscopic Gastric
      Bypass (Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y-Gastric Bypass (LRYGB) and Omega-Loop-Gastric-Bypass (LOLGB)),

      applied to all patients by two different evaluators. Data collection included the following:
      gender, age, body mass index, waist circumference, waist to hip ratio, comorbidities, early -
      postoperative complications, readmission rates and 30 - day mortality. Follow-up was
      performed in all patients up to 1 month after surgery.
