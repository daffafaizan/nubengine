      safety. Patient safety check-list are used worldwide as a way to improve communication and
      teamwork in the operating room in order to decrease perioperative morbidity and mortality.
      Previous studies have shown that communication failure in the OR may be associated with
      adverse events. The improvement of safety culture (including communication and team work) may
      be obtained by simulation based training.

      The primary objective of this before-after study is to assess the efficacy of a
      simulation-based curriculum involving OR medical and non medical personnel in order to
      improve communication in the OR.

      In brief, in a first period, an audit to assess communication efficacy and teamwork will be
      realized during 125 surgical procedures. Communication failures and consequences will be
      recorded using a standardized form filled by trained personnel. In a second phase, all the OR
      personnel (surgeon, anesthesiologist, nurses) will be invited to participate to a special
      training on communication and teamwork. This curriculum will include formal presentations and
      also simulation-based training. Scenarios are built to improve the ability to communicate in
      specific situations (fire in the OR, haemorrhage, wrong side, anaphylaxis).

      In a third phase, an audit on communication and teamwork, similar to the first phase will be
      realized. The primary endpoint is the frequency of surgical interventions having at least one
      communication failure with a consequence. The investigators expect a significant decrease in
      the rate of communication failures between phase 1 and 3. A fourth phase will consist in a
      last audit two years after phase 1 to evaluate long-term effect of this curriculum.
