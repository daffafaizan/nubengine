      one year (at 2 weeks, 2, 6 and 12 months) clinically and also by filling in the questionnaire
      to assess the presence of certain symptoms. Also the control group of their friends or
      relatives without a history of Lyme borreliosis will be included. The presence of their
      (unspecific) symptoms will also be recorded by the questionnaire at the time of enrollment
      and at 6 and 12 months.
