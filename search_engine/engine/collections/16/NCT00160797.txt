      minimally invasive surgical procedures. The MIS™ Minimally Invasive Solutions™ Total Knee
      Arthroplasty System has been cleared for use by the Food and Drug Administration.

      You are invited to participate in this data collection study, comparing the MIS system to
      standard knee replacement systems. The decision about which system and operation will be best
      for you has already been made by you and your orthopaedic surgeon.

      The information will be used to compare minimally invasive surgery and the standard surgery
      procedures. The results of this study will provide information that will add to the knowledge
      base of knee replacement surgery.
