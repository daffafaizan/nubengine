      receive state-of-the-art antidepressant medications and one of two insomnia therapies. The
      specific therapy for insomnia will be determined by chance (like a flip of a coin), with an
      equal chance to receive either cognitive-behavioral therapy for insomnia or desensitization
      psychotherapy for insomnia. The study physician will select an initial antidepressant
      medication from a list of three possible medications . If that medication is not helpful,
      another medication may be tried after 8 weeks or in the event of severe side effects.
