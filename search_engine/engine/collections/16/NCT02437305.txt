      with one that has been modified to target people of color. Both pamphlets will include the
      ABCDEs of melanoma, risk factors, prevention and treatment. In addition, the targeted
      pamphlet will incorporate the recommendations made by people of color in previous studies.
      The pamphlets will be randomized to subjects at a study visit along with a health literacy
      test and a questionnaire aimed at determining subjects' baseline melanoma knowledge and
      current melanoma prevention practices. 2 months post-intervention, a follow-up phone call
      will be made to assess subject knowledge retention and behavior change.
