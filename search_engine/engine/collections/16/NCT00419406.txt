      inflammatory skin lesions, with patients usually having an individual or family history of
      atopic diseases in their background (e.g., allergic asthma and rhinitis). Defective skin
      barrier, immunological dysfunctions (type I and IV allergy), genetic disorders, and
      psychological factors contribute to the pathogenesis of AD. However, among these factors,
      CD4+ Th cells are reported to play a particularly crucial role in the pathogenesis of AD.
      Phototherapy is among the first-line approaches in the management of AD. In this context, a
      variety of studies have shown a beneficial effect of natural or artificial UV radiation in
      atopic dermatitis (AD). Different broadband UV spectra (BB-UVA, BB-UVB, BB-UVA/BB-UVB) and
      combined treatment modalities such as balneophototherapy and PUVA have previously been proven
      to be effective in AD. However the past ten years have seen the introduction of new
      phototherapeutic regimens for AD, including UVA1 and NB-UVB.UVA1 seems to be more effective
      than the above mentioned broadband spectra, in particular in acute severe AD. The aim of the
      present study is the comparison of UVA1 and NB-UVB phototherapy in the treatment of AD.
      Additionally, the course of several cytokines, human beta-defensins, and SMAD-proteins will
      be evaluated during the course of treatment.
