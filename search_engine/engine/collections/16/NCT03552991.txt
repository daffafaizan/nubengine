      with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Gut microbiota has a role in regulating host energy
      metabolism and systemic inflammation by several pathways such as short-chain fatty acid
      production, fasting-induced adipose factor expression, endocannabinoid system, and gut
      epithelial permeability. As dietary components can influence the composition of the
      microbiota, we hypothesized that fiber supplements could modify gut microbiota and
      consequently affect glycemic control and inflammatory condition in patients with T2DM.

      The primary outcome was to assess the effect of fiber on glucose control (by comparing
      fasting glucose and glycoalbumin), insulin secretion and sensitivity. Secondary outcomes were
      the changes abundance of microbiota, incretins, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS).
