      transthoracic defibrillation shock waveforms at comparable energies result in improved
      patient outcome following out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to ventricular fibrillation.
      Eligible subjects include all adults with nontraumatic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest due to
      ventricular fibrillation. Subjects in cardiac arrest will be randomly allocated to receive
      one of two types of defibrillation shocks (monophasic or biphasic waveform) during their
      resuscitation, which will in addition include all other standard treatments. The primary
      endpoint is admission alive to hospital. Secondary endpoints include rhythm after
      defibrillation shock, return of spontaneous circulation, and hospital discharge rates.
