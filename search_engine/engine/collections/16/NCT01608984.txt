    
      Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) protocol before CABG (study arm A) or OPCAB (study arm
      B) consists of 3 cycles of 5 minutes left upper arm ischemia by inflation of a blood pressure
      cuff to 200 mmHg and 5 minutes of reperfusion after induction of anesthesia before coronary
      artery bypass surgery. For myocardial molecular analyses, left ventricular biopsies are taken
      before induction of cardioplegic cardiac arrest (A) or first coronary incision (B), and 5 to
      10 minutes after aortic unclamping during reperfusion of the myocardium (A) or 5 to 10
      minutes after the completion of the last anastomosis (B). Blood samples are taken prior to
      RIPC and during the first three postoperative days.
