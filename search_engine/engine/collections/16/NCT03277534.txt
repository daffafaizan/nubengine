      hand function training twice a week, and the ES group received 40-minute ES on the median
      nerve of the affected side before each training session. The control group received sham ES -
      electrodes were placed on the same location but no electric current was applied. EEG, EMG and
      Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) were collected before, at the 4th week, at the end of 8th week,
      and 4 weeks after the end of intervention.
