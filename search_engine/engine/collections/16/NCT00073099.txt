      used as an endpoint in clinical studies. The identification and development of standardized
      objective outcome measures for the evaluation of therapeutic intervention of ocular surface
      disease is an area previously identified as critical to the future of well-designed clinical
      trials in this area. The Report of the NEI / Industry Workshop on Clinical Trials in Dry Eyes
      identified, the standardization of clinical tests used to diagnose dry eye states and assess
      treatment effects, as an area of critical interest. The purpose of this protocol is to
      determine the suitability of slit lamp biomicroscopic digital photography of ocular surface
      vital dye staining by comparing it to the current standard procedure, clinical assessment.
      Digital image-based assessment would have many advantages over current procedures and would
      apply the appropriate rigor to the evaluation of the anterior segment that has been shown to
      be an extremely effective method for the evaluation of the extent of posterior segment
      diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration. Such valid,
      reproducible, reliable photographic documentation of retinal abnormalities and disease
      progression has been successfully employed as a primary outcome measure in many large
      clinical trials. In this protocol, we will compare grading of digital images of ocular
      surface staining to clinical assessment, facilitating the use of ocular surface vital dye
      staining as a valid outcome measure in clinical trials.
