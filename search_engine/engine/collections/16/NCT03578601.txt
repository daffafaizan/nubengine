      anesthesiologist. Thyroid gland enlargement (goiter) or tissue fibrosis (neoplasms) could
      alter the physiologic anatomy of upper airways and trachea, resulting in compression or
      dislocation.

      There are few scientific data about airway management and thyroid pathology and the incidence
      of difficult tracheal intubation in this specific kind of patient is largely variable from 0%
      to 12.9%. These data have been collected from little statistical samples (from 50 to 326
      patients), the results aren't always unanimous and a study evaluating simultaneously all the
      risk factors for difficult intubation does not exist.

      We want to evaluate the incidence and identify predictive parameters of difficult intubation
      in patients undergoing thyroid surgery.

      During pre-anesthetic assessment the following data will be collected:

      Inter-incisor gap (cm) Mallampati test (1;2;3;4) Thyromental distance (cm) Prognathism (yes;
      no) Neck motility (<80°;80-90°;>90°) Total body weight (kg) History of difficult tracheal
      intubation (yes; no) Tracheal deviation at chest X-Ray (yes; no) Neck circumference (cm)
      Mediastinal goiter (yes; no) Histologic features (benign; carcinoma)

      During the post-anesthesia it will be noted down the following:

      Cormack scale (1; 2a; 2b; 3; 4) Number of necessary attempts to intubate (1;2;3;…) Time from
      induction to intubation (min) Necessity to use advanced airway management devices (Frova;
      Glidescope; Ambu-scope; fiber-optic; other)
