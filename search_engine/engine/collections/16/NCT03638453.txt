      child's cancer therapy, many families experience financial stress during their child's
      treatment. Financial stress may include difficulty paying the rent or mortgage, keeping the
      electricity or heat on, or putting food on the table. One of the investigators' research
      goals is to find ways to decrease the financial impact of treatment on each family, and make
      sure that financial stress does not impact a child's experience during treatment.

      The investigators have developed a new supportive care intervention called PediCARE (which
      stands for Pediatric Cancer Resource Equity) which provides support for groceries (using an
      online grocery delivery service called Instacart) and transportation to and from the hospital
      (using rides through services such as Uber and Lyft). The investigators have evaluated the
      PediCARE support program in a small group of parents and used feedback from these parents to
      improve PediCARE. The investigators are now ready to do a feasibility study to find out
      whether the investigators can reliably deliver the PediCARE intervention to families.

      This type of study is called a feasibility study. The goal of this research study is to learn
      whether the investigators can successfully give the PediCARE support program to families-in
      other words, whether most families are interested in participating in a randomized study
      about the PediCARE support program and whether they use the PediCARE support program during
      the study. The investigators will also begin to understand whether the PediCARE support
      program reduces financial stress for families during therapy. Long-term, the investigators
      plan to test the PediCARE support program in a larger group of randomized families to answer
      the question of whether PediCARE reduces financial stress for families and improves outcomes
      during cancer treatment
