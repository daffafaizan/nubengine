      strategy for overcoming this phenomenon is sequential nephron blockade with loop plus
      thiazide-type diuretics. Metolazone is an oral thiazide-type diuretic commonly used for this
      purpose. Due to its delayed absorption, some clinicians suggest that metolazone be given
      30-60 minutes prior to the loop diuretic. However, the efficacy and safety of such a strategy
      has not been investigated despite its added complexity. The purpose of this study is to
      investigate whether pre-dosing with metolazone confers a difference in efficacy and safety
      compared to administering it at the same time as furosemide.
