      helps to improve patient outcomes. A randomized control trial of wound care clients in
      Ontario CCACs will show the effects of the intervention (integrated care) versus "usual care"
      clients. The researchers will also examine the financial system costs associated with
      providing "integrated care" to clients versus "usual care".

      The researchers expect to answer the research question of whether there is difference in
      patient outcomes between "integrated care" versus "usual care clients." The researchers also
      would like to formulate a response for whether there will be financial system cost difference
      between "integrated care" and "usual care" clients.

      The goal of this evaluation is to help decision-makers in the Ministry of Health and Long
      Term Care (MOHLTC), in the Community Care Access Centres (CCACs) and among provider
      organizations to improve the quality of care and patient outcomes for wound care clients, by
      evaluating innovations in the delivery of care.
