    
      The purpose of this study is to determine the basis for symptomatic and disease modifying
      benefits of exercise in Parkinson's disease (PD).

      Although the benefits of exercise in PD have been purported for several decades, only
      recently have there been controlled reports of symptomatic benefits in Parkinson's disease in
      terms of bradykinesia, postural balance and quality of life. There have been unsubstantiated
      suggestions that exercise may improve cognition and mood in PD.

      The mechanisms underlying such benefits are poorly understood. Exercise may induce dopamine
      release, thereby contributing to improved motor function in the dorsal striatum, and to
      enhanced mood and reduced apathy in the ventral striatum.

      We will test the hypotheses that exercise results in altered synaptic plasticity in the form
      of altered connectivity in response to aerobic exercise and reward-induced dopamine release.
      We will assess networks of functional connectivity using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging and measure dopamine release with positron emission tomography (PET).
