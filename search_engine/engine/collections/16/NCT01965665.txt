      foot and/or ankle fusions, fracture repair, or osteotomy will be enrolled to receive weekly
      Medihoney pin site care until frame removal. Standard size dressings and application
      technique will be used at each pin site with prefabricated materials. No procedures, tests or
      interventions will be performed exclusively for research purposes or more frequently than the
      standard of care. Upon completion of the study, pin sites sepsis rates will be compared to
      published reports for standard pin site care.
