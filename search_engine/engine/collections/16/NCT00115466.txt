    
      Comparative, multicentre, randomised clinical trial, designed with two parallel groups that
      will follow a treatment either with an autologous implant of ASCs (Adipose Derived Stem
      Cells) and fibrin glue (tissue adhesive material) or with fibrin glue alone for the
      NON-SURGICAL treatment of complex perianal fistula. The closure/healing of the fistula will
      be evaluated periodically, and it will be considered completely closed if there is no
      suppuration from the external orifice and re-epithelialisation can be observed at 8 weeks
      after the administration of the randomised therapy.
