    
      The Magnetic Resonance CholangioPancreatography will have been performed in all patients
      using different Magnetic Resonance Imaging systems (Gyroscan Intera, Philips Medical Systems,
      Best in the Netherlands, Magnetom Avanto, Siemens Medical Solutions, and Signa Hdxt, General
      Electric Medical Systems) with a free-breathing three-dimensional high-spatial-resolution
      Fast Spin Echo sequence and/or a breath-hold two-dimensional single-shot sequence. Magnetic
      Resonance CholangioPancreatography may also include a Fast Spin Echo weighted T2-weighted
      sequence with fat-spectral saturation, a T1-weighted breath-suppressed gradient echo pulse
      sequence and a chemical shift sequence in phase and opposite phase, in the axial plane, and a
      weighted three-dimensional T1 saturated fat sequence after intravenous administration of
      gadolinium chelate. Images will be analyzed in consensus by two abdominal radiologists on a
      Picture Archiving and Communication System station and compared with the pathological
      results.
