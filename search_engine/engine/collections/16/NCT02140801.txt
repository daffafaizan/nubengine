      Angiographic follow-up and OCT imaging with motorized pull-back at 20-36 mm/s are planned in
      all patients 12 months after implantation of the study stents. OCT endpoints are: (1)
      Subclinical intra-stent thrombus, defined as a mass protruding to the lumen with significant
      attenuation, and respectively (2) endothelial coverage, expressed as % of struts without
      coverage and % of stent length containing non-covered struts. The study is powered for OCT
      endpoints, which are likely to reach significance at the level P < 0.05 even at a follow-up
      drop-out rate up to 10%.
