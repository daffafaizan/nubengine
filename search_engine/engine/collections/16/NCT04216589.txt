    
      This study will evaluate the effects of semaglutide on intra-hepatic triglyceride (IHTG)
      content in people living with HIV (PLWH), central adiposity, insulin resistance or
      pre-diabetes, and hepatic steatosis.

      All participants will receive semaglutide subcutaneously once weekly for 24 weeks, followed
      by 24 weeks of observation off of the study drug. IHTG will be quantified by magnetic
      resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) evaluations at two time points
      during the study.

      Participants will attend several study visits through Week 48. Participants will complete
      food diaries, adherence and strength assessments, and report on hypoglycemia, vision changes,
      physical activity, diet, quality of life, and acceptability of study drug. Blood will be
      collected at all visits and stool samples at two visits.

      Participants must remain on their non-study-provided antiretroviral therapy (ART) throughout
      the study.
