    
      Patients with heart failure (HF) frequently have a post-capillary pulmonary hypertension
      (HTPcap) which has two forms: passive and reactive.

      The prognosis, prevalence and pathophysiological mechanisms of cell and tissue involved in
      the onset and reversibility of these two forms of HTPcap remain poorly understood.

      The latest recommendations of the European Society of Cardiology and the European Respiratory
      Society identify two forms of HTPcap in the IC as a function of the extent of trans-pulmonary
      gradient (GTP) measured during right heart catheterization (GTP = mPAP-Pcap): passive (GTP Â£
      12mmHg) and reactive (GTP> 12mmHg).

      In the latter form, the increase in pulmonary pressure would be disproportionate to the
      increase in left ventricular pressures.

      This study will permit to identify hemodynamic prognostic markers of the the IC, and
      clinical, biological and hemodynamic determinants of the HTPcap in the IC.

      This will help to identify a population that could benefit from specific treatment to
      referred pulmonary artery.
