      research in the field of adolescent bariatric surgery, through the cooperative development of
      common clinical protocols and a bariatric surgery database that will collect information from
      participating clinical centers performing bariatric surgery on teenagers.

      Teen-LABS will help pool the necessary clinical expertise and administrative resources to
      facilitate the conduct of multiple clinical studies in a timely, efficient manner. Also, the
      use of standardized definitions, shared clinical protocols and data collection instruments
      will enhance investigators' ability to provide meaningful evidence-based recommendations for
      patient evaluation, selection and follow-up care.

      In addition to investigating surgical outcomes, another broader goal of Teen-LABS is to
      better understand the etiology, pathophysiology, and behavioral aspects of severe obesity in
      youth and how this condition affects human beings over time.

      In the 3rd five year cycle of funding for this project, several additional long-term research
      aims have been added, all in general alignment with the original aims of the project to
      assess efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery performed in adolescent years.
