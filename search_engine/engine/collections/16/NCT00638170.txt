      Recurrences and the risk of renal damage are indications for long term antimicrobial
      prophylaxis, but emerging antimicrobial resistance underlines the need for alternatives. The
      bacteria causing urinary tract infection arise from the stools. Dietary changes can alter the
      balance of faecal bacteria. Vaccinium berries and products containing lactobacilli have been
      shown to act against the coliform bacteria that cause most urinary tract infections. In our
      previous study cranberry juice was effective in preventing symptomatic recurrences of urinary
      tract infections in women. The objective of our study is to determine whether recurrences of
      urinary tract infection in children can be prevented with cranberry juice.
