      Primary

        -  To quantify HIV-1 persistence in prospectively collected samples from patients on
           suppressive antiretroviral therapy undergoing chemotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood samples are collected before, during, and after treatment for lymphoma for HIV-1 RNA
      levels using standard and single copy assays and HIV-1 DNA quantification (peripheral blood
      mononuclear cells).

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 2 years.
