    
      The study is a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-escalation study of the
      safety and tolerability of single doses of S-equol up to 320 mg in healthy male and female
      adult subjects. Approximately 8 qualified volunteers will be selected at each dose level and
      randomly assigned to receive S-equol or placebo, in the fasted state. For the 20 mg dose
      group, subjects will complete two treatment periods, one in the fasted state, and one in the
      fed state.

      A safety review of study results for each dose group will occur when Day 8 follow-up visit
      safety data are available, and prior to enrollment/dosing of the next subsequent dose group.
      Given favorable safety review of a dose group's experience, the subsequent dose group will be
      enrolled/dosed at least 10 days after the previous group's dosing.

      Pharmacokinetic evaluations consist of determination of plasma and urine concentrations of
      free and total conjugated S-equol at various time points. Safety evaluations include physical
      examination,vital signs, ECG, serum chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis, 12-lead telemetry,
      and assessment of clinical signs and symptoms.
