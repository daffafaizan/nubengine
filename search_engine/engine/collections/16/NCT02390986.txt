    
      This is an extension study of LON002 in patients with cancer, who have completed other London
      Pharma sponsored LON002 studies (parent study). It provides the opportunity for patients to
      continue receiving treatment for as long as the patient continues to derive a clinical
      benefit.

      Long term safety and efficacy will be evaluated.
