      Clostridium difficile infection that has been developed as an alternative to fecal
      transplantation. This treatment is not a drug or biologic, but is comprised of live microbes
      that normally reside in the human gut of a healthy individual.The product is a defined
      microbial community derived from healthy donor stool, referred to as Microbial Ecosystem
      Therapeutic-2 (MET-2).

      In this open label, single center, multiple dose pilot study of 19 patients will be
      recruited. Patients will be given an initial daily loading dose of MET-2 over 2 days followed
      by a maintenance dose of MET-2 over 8 days. Patients experiencing treatment failure after the
      first dose may be offered a second, higher loading dose of MET-2. Patients failing the second
      loading dose of MET-2 may be offered a higher dose of MET-2 via colonoscopy.

      The primary objective is clinical resolution of diarrhea with no CDI relapse at 30 days
      following the last dose of MET-2, i.e., absence of recurrence of diarrheal symptoms with
      laboratory-confirmed evidence of C. difficile 30 days after last dose of treatment.

      The secondary objectives are: i) Safety and tolerability, including adverse events of grade 2
      or above; ii) Overall well-being including number of bowel movements and energy level, etc.
      as based on standardized IBS questionnaire; iii) Presence of MET-2 bacteria in stool at 30
      days, based on DNA sequencing; and, iv) Mortality, at end of follow up period - mortality
      attributable to CDI will also be determined, by performing a detailed clinical chart review
      on any patient who expires during the follow up period.
