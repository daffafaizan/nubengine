      cell lines. Another study observed a sequential elevation of VEGF in low-grade dysplasia,
      high-grade dysplasia and early stage liver cancer. Clinical analyses have discovered the high
      expression of VEGF is correlated with tumor progression, vascular invasion, distal metastasis
      and poor prognosis. However, few studies have been conducted to investigate the VEGF
      signaling in ECC cells and its possible mechanism in regulating ECC growth.Therefore,we try
      to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal in ECC growth,proliferation and apoptosis.
