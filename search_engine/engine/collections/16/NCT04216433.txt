      are largely from single-centre studies, with study populations of a few hundred to a thousand
      patients, comparing outcomes for open and endovascular repair and collecting patient
      characteristic data largely for risk adjustment. Data on endovascular vs open AAA repair from
      the population-based registry will provide important information regarding the current use of
      these two treatment strategies, as well as allowing comparison of long-term outcomes for each
      according to different patient characteristics.

      The proposed registry has the potential to provide means for internal quality assessment for
      the participating institutions. The de-identified registry will be made available to
      researchers at their request. This registry, focusing on AAA in the Dallas-Fort Worth
      metroplex, will provide data with the potential to improve treatments for more than 800,000
      patients in the US.
