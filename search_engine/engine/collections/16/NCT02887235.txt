    
      The current standard of care at the cancer center is for all patients receiving cytotoxic
      therapy to undergo a nutritional consultation and evaluation with a registered oncology
      dietitian. The goal of this consultation is to prevent nutritional deficiencies, promote
      optimal nutritional intake, hydration, and weight maintenance, as well as maintain lean body
      mass.

      All patients on this study will receive standard of care nutritional services including
      nutrition consult, evaluation, and as needed follow-ups. However, patients randomized to arm
      2 will receive home delivered, medically tailored meals in addition to the standard
      nutritional care.
