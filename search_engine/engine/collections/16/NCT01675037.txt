      of obstructive hydrocephalus in children and adults. Perforation of the third ventricle floor
      which is part of the hypothalamic-pituitary neuronal network is the key of this surgical
      procedure. Single patients with endocrine or electrolyte abnormalities after ETV have been
      reported in children or adults. So far there are no prospective data available about the
      endocrine effects after ETV.

      Materials and methods 40 patients (10 children, 30 adults) with obstructive hydrocephalus and
      inclusion criteria will undergo ETV in our neurosurgical department. Complete
      hypothalamic-pituitary hormonal evaluation will be done, in children and adults, before the
      procedure and at 3 and 12 month after ETV. At 3 month, a brain MRI, with
      hypothalamic-pituitary specifics sequences, will be performed and compared to the
      preoperative one. Follow up will be at 3 and 12 month after ETV.

      Interventions: ETV is performed under general anesthesia with a rigid endoscope. Perforation
      is made just behind the clivus, halfway between the infundibulum and the mammillary bodies in
      the midline using a monopolar electrode, followed by dilatation with an inflated balloon
      catheter. In our department, this procedure is performed only by 2 senior surgeons.

      Number of subjects: 40 patients: 10 children, 30 adults. Statistical analysis: stratified
      analysis.
