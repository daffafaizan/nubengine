    
      The most recent treatments against CMV disease have been ganciclovir and foscarnet. Until
      recently, both drugs required intravenous administration. An oral form of ganciclovir, if
      shown to be effective therapy against CMV, would be a more suitable method of administration
      for prophylaxis.

      Patients are randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive either oral ganciclovir or placebo for a
      minimum of 12 months. PER AMENDMENT 9/19/94: Patients who have not reached a study endpoint
      may choose to continue blinded prophylaxis or discontinue blinded prophylaxis and begin
      open-label ganciclovir. PER AMENDMENT 5/2/95: After the common closing date (6/3/95) patients
      who have not met a CMV end point or experienced a serious toxicity that required permanent
      discontinuation of active oral ganciclovir will be eligible to receive open-label oral
      ganciclovir through an open-label extension phase of study 023 until 8/31/95.
