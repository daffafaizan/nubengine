      myeloma. Eligible subjects will undergo steady-state apheresis to obtain large numbers of
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) for CART-BCMA manufacturing. Cryopreserved
      historical apheresis products collected from the patient prior to study entry are usable for
      CART-BCMA manufacturing if collected at an appropriately certified apheresis center and the
      product meets adequate mononuclear cell yields. If a historical apheresis product is not
      available, an apheresis procedure will be scheduled for cell procurement after study entry.
      The T cells will be purified from the PBMC, transduced with TCRÎ¶/4-1BB lentiviral vector,
      expanded in vitro and then frozen for future administration. The number of subjects who have
      inadequate T cell collections, expansion or manufacturing compared to the number of subjects
      who have CAR T cells successfully manufactured will be recorded; feasibility of product
      manufacturing is not expected to be problematic in this patient population.
