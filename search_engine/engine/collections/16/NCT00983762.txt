      have undergone one of three types of knee arthroplasty for the treatment of knee
      osteoarthritis. A variety of functional performance tests will be assessed and compared using
      a group of evaluations including: functional activity performance tests and questionnaires;
      leg strength; knee range of motion; and forces at the knee during a series of activities
      (walking, bending, stepping etc.) via a motion analysis system. The study will compare the
      three surgical subject groups and one group of healthy, non-surgical subjects for a total of
      100 subjects.
