      but not dependent subjects will receive four ascending doses of buprenorphine, 4, 8, 16, and
      24 mg, respectively, with an at least a 14 day washout interval between treatments. The four
      treatments are sublingual administration of:

        1. two 2-mg buprenorphine sublingual tablets,

        2. one 8-mg buprenorphine sublingual tablet,

        3. two 8-mg buprenorphine sublingual tablets; and

        4. three 8-mg buprenorphine sublingual tablets.

      The dose proportionality in plasma profiles of buprenorphine and dose response of the
      buprenorphine sublingual tablets are evaluated at buprenorphine dose range of 4 to 24 mg.
