      participants in the weight maintenance control group (see Data Analysis and Statistical
      Considerations). We will recruit and enroll obese (BMI ≥29 - ≤40) men and women, age 18 to
      45, with no previous history of lower extremity injury, no evidence of symptoms OA, no knee
      misalignment (neutral alignment between 178° and 182°), or other injury that would prevent
      them from performing the walking task required by this study. All inclusion criteria specific
      to knee injury, OA, and alignment will be verified by MRI scan. All participants in this
      study will be informed of the risks involved. Upon expressing interest in study
      participation, participants will be asked questions to determine whether they are free of
      lower extremity injury and their height and weight will also be recorded to determine their
      BMI. Potential participants will be pre-screened by phone using a phone script with a list of
      questions. Once it is determined they meet all study inclusion criteria, they will be invited
      to attend a consent meeting.
