    
      Patients admitted to the LTACH with at least one stage 3 or 4 PI will be evaluated for
      possible inclusion/exclusion criteria. Patients will be approached by the investigator, or
      their designee to acquire patient informed consent. If provided, patients will be randomized
      to their designated support surface, the bed will be ordered and patients will begin the
      study with a baseline study visit (week 0) that will include:

        -  Date and time of study bed placement

        -  A brief medical history, that includes current diagnoses, assessment of co-morbidities,
           an assessment of neurologic status, nutritional status, level of mobility, history of
           current PI's, documentation of treatments that have been applied to PI(s) prior to study
           entry

        -  Braden PU risk assessment (overall and subscores)

        -  Assessment of pain associated with the PI using a pain numeric rating scale (NRS), where
           patients rate their current pain intensity from 0 ("no pain") to 10 ("worst possible
           pain") [21]

        -  Blood for CBC, Albumin, Pre-Albumin, CRP will be collected.

        -  PI assessments: all PI's located on the lower truncal region of the patient's body will
           be assessed both subjectively by the treating clinicians for clinical signs of
           infection, as well as by a 3D wound assessment tool.

        -  Overall health status assessment

      Subsequent weekly study visits will continue for a maximum of 12 weeks. The interim study
      visit documentation will include:

        -  Overall health status assessment of health (whether the patient's health is improving,
           maintaining, or worsening)

        -  Skin assessment to document any new PI's that may have developed,

        -  Braden PU risk assessment (overall and subscores)

        -  3D Wound assessments of all lower truncal PI's,

        -  Clinical Assessment of signs and symptoms of wound infection

        -  Confirmation of support surface type,

        -  Documentation of adverse device effects, device-related complaints (within 24 hours of
           effect/complaint).

      Clinical Resource Utilization Data: documentation of the following data will aim to achieve
      estimated clinical resources associated with caring for PIs:

        -  Documentation of dressing supplies,

        -  Debridement method, duration and frequency

        -  Type of antibiotics dosage, frequency, and duration

        -  Other pharmacologic agents used for wounds with dosage, frequency, and duration

        -  Assessment of pain

        -  Rental bed cost estimates

        -  Documentation of professional healthcare visits and/or types of healthcare services in
           the preceding week.

        -  Documentation of acute care hospitalizations

        -  An estimate of LTACH staff time devoted to wound care per day for that study week.

      At study discharge, which may occur at the time of study PI healing, LTACH discharge, or upon
      stepdown from the randomized study surface) or for other reasons, a final study visit will be
      completed that includes:

        -  Date and time of study bed removal

        -  Overall health status assessment,

        -  Skin assessment to document any new PI's that may have developed,

        -  Braden PU risk assessment (includes subscores),

        -  3D wound assessments of all truncal PI's,

        -  Clinical assessment of signs and symptoms of wound infection

        -  Confirmation of bed support surface type

        -  Documentation of adverse device effects, device related complaints (within 24 hours of
           effect/complaint).

        -  Clinical Resource Utilization Data:

             -  documentation of dressing supplies,

             -  debridement method, duration and frequency

             -  type of antibiotics, dosage, frequency, and duration

             -  other pharmacologic agents used for wounds with dosage, frequency, and duration,

             -  rental bed cost estimates

             -  documentation of professional healthcare visits and/or types of healthcare services
                in the preceding week.

             -  documentation of acute care hospitalizations

             -  an estimate of LTACH staff time devoted to wound care per day for that study week.

        -  Assessment of pain

        -  A patient bed satisfaction assessment will be completed if the patient is able to
           communicate

        -  Blood for CBC, Albumin, Pre-Albumin, CRP will be collected
