      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma on one protocol, with the addition of asparaginase during the
      induction and consolidation phases for diffuse lymphoblastic lymphoma and T-cell, large
      noncleaved cell diffuse lymphoma. II. Assess whether intensification of cyclophosphamide
      during induction therapy will achieve a complete response rate of 95% in 1 to 1.5 months for
      all histologies. III. Assess whether achieving remission induction in 1 month, administering
      cytarabine/methotrexate by continuous infusion during consolidation therapy, and increasing
      the number of intrathecal methotrexate injections throughout protocol therapy decreases
      central nervous system relapse in these patients. IV. Assess whether a 5-year recurrence-free
      survival of 85% is achievable for all histologies on this protocol. V. Assess whether
      duration of maintenance chemotherapy may be stratified by stage and histology of disease to
      avoid unnecessarily prolonged chemotherapy.

      Part IV: DNR/DM.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 25 patients/stratum are expected to be accrued over 3 years. This study
      will be reviewed for early closure if more than 1 patient has PD.
