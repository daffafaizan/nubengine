    
      Bulimia nervosa (BN), is a serious psychiatric disorder that has high rates of comorbidity
      and often results in role impairment for the suffer. Thus far, although psychosocial and
      behavioral risk factors and correlates of BN have been extensively researched, relatively few
      studies have focused on brain-based determinants of BN. Identification of neural mechanisms
      associated with self-regulatory control that may be integral in the development, maintenance,
      and prevention of this debilitating condition would better inform treatment development and
      eating disorder prevention efforts.

      Participation in this study consists of a 3-3.5 hours study visit as well a a one year follow
      up visit. The first portion of initial study visit is part of the screening process, in which
      individuals will complete several questionnaires and be interviewed by the study researcher
      in order to confirm eligibility. If a participant is eligible after the screening portion,
      they move onto the rest of the initial visit. During the initial visit, participants will
      complete a button pressing go/no-go task as well as a sipping go/no-go task, all while
      wearing a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIR) device.

      At a one year follow up appointment, individuals will again complete a variety of self-report
      questionnaires and be interviewed by the study researcher, thus completing the same measures
      used as screening tools in the initial visit.
