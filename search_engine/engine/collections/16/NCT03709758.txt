    
      This research study is a Phase I clinical trial, which tests the safety of an investigational
      drug and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for
      further studies. "Investigational" means that the drug is being studied.

      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved venetoclax for this specific
      disease but it has been approved for other uses.

      In this research study, the investigators are combining the use of venetoclax (the
      investigational drug being studied) with chemotherapy drugs daunorubicin and cytarabine. The
      investigators are looking to determine the highest dose of venetoclax that can be given
      safely in combination with these chemotherapy drugs.

      Depending on when the participant join the study, the participant may participate in part 1
      (induction with venetoclax escalation), part 2 (consolidation with venetoclax escalation), or
      part 3 (an expansion cohort utilizing the maximum tolerated doses identified in parts 1 and
      2). The study doctor will tell the participant which part of the study they will join.
