    
      Anorexia nervosa is a severe psychiatric disorder, with high level of mortality and
      hospitalization is often necessary for the treatment of severe and/or chronic cases.

      Anorexic patients often experience a serious disturbance in body and their own shape
      perception. Body image work should be enhanced in the treatment of anorexia nervosa.

      The aim of the study is to test a new body image therapy using the anamorphic Micro software.

      Ten sessions of assessment of the patient's own shape and of correction of distorted
      perceptions of body size with Anamorphic Micro software will be compared to ten sessions of
      body image therapy as usual.

      French 100 anorexia women hospitalized in a specialized Eating Disorder Unit will participate
      to the study, randomized in 2 arms :

        -  Body image therapy with Anamorphic Micro software

        -  Body image therapy as usual
