      Individuals with classic asthma experience paroxysmal symptoms including cough, wheeze,
      shortness of breath and chest tightness. Cough variant asthma (CVA) is asthma in which
      chronic cough (cough lasting eight weeks or more) is the sole or predominant symptom of
      asthma. The pathophysiologic mechanisms which differentiate asthma, CVA, and eosinophilic
      bronchitis without asthma are not fully understood. We have recently identified individuals
      with chronic cough who cough during methacholine but have normal airway sensitivity (ie. do
      not have asthma or CVA) and may or may not have eosinophilic bronchitis. The purpose of this
      research is to examine the pathophysiologic differences between three causes of chronic
      cough: asthma, cough variant asthma and methacholine-induced cough with normal airway
      sensitivity. The responses in healthy normal subjects are crucial to understand the clinical
      relevance of methacholine-induced cough with normal airway sensitivity.
