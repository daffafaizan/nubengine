      daily subcutaneous injection without laboratory monitoring was as effective and as safe as
      continuous intravenous heparin given in-hospital. Innohep (tinzaparin) has been shown to be
      safe and effective for both the initial and long-term treatment of DVT. The Home LITE study
      compares long-term Innohep treatment to treatment with a combination of initial
      low-molecular-weight heparin followed by standard long-term warfarin therapy.
