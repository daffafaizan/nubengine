      I. Determine the objective response rate of patients with metastatic or locally recurrent
      colorectal cancer treated with rebeccamycin analogue.

      II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the
      effect of this regimen on progression-free and overall survival in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV once on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for
      a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter.
