      tumors that lack activating EGFR mutations and ALK fusions, are eligible for enrollment.
      Patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive treatment with durvalumab +
      tremelimumab combination therapy + SoC chemotherapy, durvalumab monotherapy + SoC
      chemotherapy, or SoC chemotherapy alone. Tumor evaluation scans will be performed until
      objective disease progression as efficacy assessment. All patients will be followed for
      survival until the end of the study. An independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) composed
      of independent experts will be convened to confirm the safety and tolerability of the
      proposed dose and schedule.
