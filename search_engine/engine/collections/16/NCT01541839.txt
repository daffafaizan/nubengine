      The surgery is done to relieve nasal obstruction, which is often caused by a bend in the
      tissues in the middle of the nose. The current technique for completing a septoplasty
      involves elevating subperichondrial flaps bilaterally and resecting the deviated portion of
      cartilage and/or bone. The technique to prevent a septal hematoma by removing the potential
      dead space after cartilage resection has evolved over time. Traditionally, the nose was
      packed with petroleum gauze, but using sutures to coapt the mucosa back together has become
      the preferred method of choice.

      Placing sutures to reapproximate the mucosa is very effective, but can be challenging,
      particularly in a narrow nose. The amount of time required varies from 4 to 20 minutes for
      this part of the surgery, and is potentially associated with its own set of complications.
      The needle or suture can break, and the lateral nasal wall can be traumatized, leading to
      formation of scar bands to the septum.

      Recently, a septal stapler has been developed that uses bioabsorbable staples. The staples
      are made of polylactide-co-glycolide (PLG), the same copolymer found in Vicryl sutures. It
      can provide a more uniform closure, is able to reach the posterior septum and could lead to a
      significant time savings in the operating room. The stapler has been demonstrated to be safe
      and effective, and required less than a minute to apply in most studied cases. The amount of
      time saved in the operating room has not yet been studied.
