      had been informed about the protocol. This is a 8-week, double-blinded, placebo-controlled,
      randomized intervention trial to investigate the effects of Mg and Zn supplementation on
      antioxidant status and bone hormonal parameters. Participants were randomly assigned to one
      of three treatment groups: Placebo group (PbG: 25 women); Magnesium Group - 500 mg/day of Mg
      (MgG: 27 women); Zinc Group - 50 mg/day of Zn (ZnG: 26 women).
