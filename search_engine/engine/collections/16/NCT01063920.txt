    
      This is a double-blind, double-dummy, active-comparator study of LT-NS001 versus Naprosyn®
      for 12 weeks in patients aged 45-80 with osteoarthritis of the knee who are candidates for
      ongoing NSAID therapy. The percentage of patients with a gastric ulcer by endoscopy (EGD) at
      week 12 will be compared. EGD is performed at screening and months 1, 2, and 3. Secondary
      objectives include assessment of pain in the affected knee by WOMAC questionnaire to
      demonstrate non-inferior pain control using LT-NS001 as compared to Naprosyn®. Information
      about gastrointestinal pain and tolerability will be collected.

      The length of the study is up to 19 weeks with a 2-3 week screening period, a 12 week
      treatment period and a 4 week post treatment monitoring period.
