      in two arms(groups A and B). Patients of group A will be treated with unique surgery
      (correction of POP plus preventive continence procedure), whereas in patients of group B POP
      will be surgically corrected and, in case of stress or mixed postoperative incontinence, a
      further intervention for urinary stress incontinence will be tailored.

      All patients eligible will undergo baseline assessment consisting of anthropometric,
      clinical, hormonal, ultrasonographic and urodynamic evaluations. During the study, the
      clinical outcomes, and the adverse experience will be evaluated in each patient.

      Data will be analyzed using the intention-to-treat principle and a P value of 0.05 or less
      will be considered significant.
