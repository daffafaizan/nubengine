    
      This is an open-label, phase I dose-escalation study of Nintedanib combined with
      standard-dose Bevacizumab for advanced solid tumors in which Bevacizumab has an indication.
      The primary endpoints will be safety and tolerability of the drug combination and a
      determination of recommended Phase II dose for Nintedanib in combination with standard dose
      Bevacizumab.

      The first three patients will be treated with Nintedanib daily plus Bevacizumab on day one of
      each three week cycle. If there are no dose limiting toxicities, then three additional
      patients will be treated with the same drugs with Nintedanib at a slightly higher level.
      Finally, a third cohort of three patients will be dosed at an even higher level. Once the
      maximum tolerated dose of Nintedanib is reached, then an additional six patients will be
      treated at that dose in combination with Bevacizumab until disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicities.
