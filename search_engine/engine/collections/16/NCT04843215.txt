      survival, we designed this trial. Patients who received curative gastrectomy were divided
      into two groups based on whether they underwent omentectomy. The purpose of this study is to
      prove the non-inferiority of omentum preservation compared with omentectomy in patients with
      T3-T4a gastric cancer.
