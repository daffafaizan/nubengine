      without treatment - it can persist for decades. Given its prevalence, severity, and
      chronicity, effective treatment methods are strongly needed. However, traditional
      psychological and pharmacological treatments have had statistically significant, but
      clinically limited effects (Taylor, 1996).

      Based on an empirical analysis of the cognitive processes in social phobia, Clark and Wells
      (1995) have developed a new cognitive model. Cognitive therapy (CT) derived from this model
      has been found to be superior to a combination of fluoxetine and self-exposure (Clark et al.,
      2003).

      Social phobic symptoms may be viewed as a result of more general interpersonal difficulties
      and interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) can be a reasonable alternative for social phobia
      (Lipsitz & Markowitz, 1996). A clinical case series indicates that social phobic patients
      improve during interpersonal psychotherapy for social phobia (IPT-SP; Lipsitz et al., 1999.
