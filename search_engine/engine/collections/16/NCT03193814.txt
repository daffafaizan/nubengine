      is a potent oral inhibitor of the intracellular domain and emerging as original
      antiangiogenic opportunities. We assessed the efficacy and safety of apatinib in combination
      with second-line FOLFOX or FOLFIRI for metastatic colorectal cancer in patients with disease
      progression during or after first-line therapy.
