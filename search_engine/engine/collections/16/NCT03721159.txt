      of generalized chronic periodontitis subjects with and without coronary heart disease and
      compared them with the healthy subject.A total of 90 subjects were selected for the study and
      assigned to 3 groups based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Group I comprised of 30
      subjects with Generalized chronic periodontitis diagnosed with coronary heart disease.Group
      II comprised of 30 subjects with Generalized chronic periodontitis without coronary heart
      disease and Group III comprised of 30 systemically healthy volunteers with no chronic
      periodontitis or coronary heart disease. Demographic variables such as age, weight,height,BMI
      and income and clinical parameters such as plaque index, bleeding on probing, probing pocket
      depth and clinical attachement levels were recorded. Subgingival plaque samples were
      collected from all the 3 groups. The collected samples were subject to further molecular
      analysis for micro-RNA expression and quantification using RT-PCR.
