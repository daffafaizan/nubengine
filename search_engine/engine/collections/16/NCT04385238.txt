    
      Millions of women will give birth during the pandemic of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). The consequences
      of COVID-19 for pregnant women and their offspring are unknown. This lack of information
      leads to anxiety among pregnant women, women who are considering getting pregnant, and their
      families. It is therefore important to assess the wellbeing and mental health of women during
      the COVID-19 pandemic.

      The international nature of the online survey will allow the evaluation of how living during
      the COVID-19 pandemic affects pregnant and recently pregnant women at a global level,
      including the evaluation of potential cultural and geographic differences.
