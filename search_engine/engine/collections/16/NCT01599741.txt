      cannot be achieved at the same time. However, image processing algorithms can help an x-ray
      system to acquire images with lower dose without influencing image quality or achieving
      higher image quality with equal dose. The primary aim of this study is to verify if the
      diagnostic image quality is equal or better when using a significant reduction in X-ray dose
      for endovascular digital subtraction angiography in combination with a novel imaging
      technology compared to using normal dose with conventional image technology.
