      additional behavioral testing consisting of several social cognition computer tasks, clinical
      assessments, physiological measurements, and questionnaires. The study will be conducted with
      the same study arms and study interventions as in the proposed parent study. For this
      supplementary study, the inclusion criteria has broadened to include patients with bipolar
      disorder with psychotic features and brief psychotic disorder.
