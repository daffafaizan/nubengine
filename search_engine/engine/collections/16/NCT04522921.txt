      multi-component-overnight camps (Julem√¶rkehjem) in Denmark. The multi-component-overnight
      camps are intensive weight loss camps to which Danish schoolchildren, from 7-14 years of age,
      are referred to for 10-weeks intervention focusing on healthy lifestyle, healthy eating, new
      habits and increased physical activity.

      The primary outcome is anthropometry (BMI-SDS, fat mass, fat-free mass). Secondary outcomes
      are blood-tests measuring metabolic, inflammatory and liver markers and questionnaires
      investigating Quality of Life, Eating Behavior, Eating Habits and Disturbed Eating.

      The children will be measured at baseline, 10-weeks and 52-weeks follow-up. Furthermore,
      participants will be invited to follow-up investigation 3 years, 5 years, 7 years and 10
      years, respectively, after the intervention.
