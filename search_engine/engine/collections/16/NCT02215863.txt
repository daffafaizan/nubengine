      Hospital, Korea University Ansan Hospital, Hallym University Gangnam Sacred Hospital and
      Catholic University Medical College, St. Vincent's Hospital.

      The primary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of Fluad after concomitant
      administration of Fluad and PCV13 in adults aged 60 years or more. This study is designed to
      demonstrate non-inferiority of sero-conversion rate after Fluad vaccination: Fluad-PCV13
      co-administration group versus Fluad alone group

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the immunogenicity of PCV13 after concomitant
      administration in adults aged 60 years or more. This study is designed to demonstrate
      non-inferiority of PCV13 when co-administered with Fluad compared with PCV13 alone.

      This study is also designed to evaluate the safety of concomitant PCV13-Fluad administration
      in adults aged 60 years or more. All the participants will be followed for the duration of an
      expected average of 4 weeks after vaccination.
