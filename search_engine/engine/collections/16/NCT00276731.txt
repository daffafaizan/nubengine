        -  Compare the local control and event-free and overall survival of young patients with
           stage IIB and III neuroblastoma treated with neoadjuvant combination chemotherapy
           followed by surgery with vs without radiotherapy.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of these regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, randomized study.

        -  Induction combination chemotherapy: Patients receive vincristine IV and cyclophosphamide
           IV on day 1. Patients also receive cisplatin IV continuously over 24 hours on day 1 and
           etoposide IV over 4 hours on day 2 during courses 1, 3, and 5 and carboplatin IV over 1
           hour and etoposide IV over 4 hours on day 1 during courses 2 and 4. Treatment repeats
           every 21 days for 5 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity. Patients then proceed to surgery unless complete resection was done during
           initial staging and complete response was maintained.

        -  Surgery: Patients undergo biopsy or surgical resection of the tumor 2-3 weeks after
           completion of induction combination chemotherapy.

        -  Post-surgical treatment: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

             -  Arm I: Patients receive two additional courses of combination chemotherapy
                comprising vincristine, cisplatin, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide in course 6 and
                vincristine, carboplatin, etoposide, and cyclophosphamide in course 7.

             -  Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy 2-4 weeks after surgery. Beginning 3 weeks
                after completion of radiotherapy, patients receive chemotherapy as in arm I After
                completion of study treatment, patients are evaluated periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study.
