    
      This is an open-label, prospective, multicentre, phase IIa study, evaluating a new
      therapeutic agent in the management of patients suffering from inoperable or non resectable
      biliary carcinoma. The patients will receive the dose of WST11 according to order of
      inclusion. The first 3 patients will receive 2.5 mg/kg. In the absence of toxicity, the
      following 9 patients will receive the dose of 5 mg/kg.

      The patient is to receive anesthesia. WST11-mediated therapy will consist of the combination
      of single IV administration of WST11 at doses of 2.5mg/kg or 5mg/kg, using 753nm laser light
      at a fixed power of (150mW/cm) and light energy (200 J/cm) delivered through a diffusing
      fiber. The fiber is introduced in a transparent standard ERCP catheter and positioned under
      radioscopy in front of the lesion.
