    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind study of 21 subjects. Participants in this study
      will be healthy, non-obese (BMI <30) subjects over 25 with two localized, symmetrical, and
      contralateral areas of fat deposition on the abdomen or flanks and on the buttocks or thighs
      that have proven resistant to diet and exercise. Each participant will be randomized to one
      of three groups and will receive 4 series of injections two weeks apart. Multiple injections
      will be placed in the subdermal fat layer from 1-1.5 cm apart depending on the size of the
      treatment area.

      Group A will serve as a control and will receive only injections of saline as a placebo.
      Group B will receive saline injections on one side of the body and receive study drug
      injections on the contralateral side. Group C will receive only study drug injections. The
      study sites will include a symmetric, contralateral area of localized fat deposit on both the
      upper and lower torso. Clinical evaluations will be performed at each visit. Hematologic and
      ultrasonographic evaluations will be performed at baseline, at the 3rd treatment (Week 4),
      and at 6 month follow-up. Histologic evaluations will be performed on select individuals at
      baseline and at the 3rd treatment (Week 4) visit.
