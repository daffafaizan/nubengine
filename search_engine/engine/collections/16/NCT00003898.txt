      and duration of mucositis in children undergoing stem cell transplantation. II. Determine the
      safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine serum glutamine levels achieved
      during this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to inclusion of total body irradiation in the conditioning regimen (yes vs no).
      Patients receive either oral glutamine or oral placebo (glycine) twice a day beginning on the
      day of admission for the stem cell transplant and continuing for 28 days or until hospital
      discharge, whichever is first.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients (60 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      2 years.
