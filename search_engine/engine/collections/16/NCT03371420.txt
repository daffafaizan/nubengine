      (microdose) study. Up to 10 evaluable subjects who have active disease will be enrolled to
      evaluate the PK, metabolism, biodistribution, and radiation dosimetry of 124I-PU-AD.

      Following a 28-day screening period, eligible subjects will return to the clinic on Day 1. A
      single dose of 124I-PU-AD will be administered by intravenous (IV) injection to subjects.

      After 124I-PU-AD tracer injection, PET scans will be performed at 4 time points. At each
      time-point, an axial body image is acquired on a state-of-the-art PET-CT scanner. A low-dose
      CT will be obtained immediately-prior to PET imaging, at each time-point. Serial blood
      samples will also be obtained at multiple time points.

      Subjects will be evaluated to ensure that there are no clinically significant ongoing AEs
      prior to discharge.
