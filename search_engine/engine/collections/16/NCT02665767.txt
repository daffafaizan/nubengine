    
      A randomized cross-over study was conducted using a telesonography system that can transmit
      the ultrasound images displayed on the ultrasound monitor(ultrasound sequence video) and
      images showing the practitioner's operations(background video) to a smartphone without any
      interruption in motion over a Long Term Evolution (LTE) network. Thirty novice practitioners
      were randomly assigned to two groups. The subjects in group A (n=15) performed
      ultrasonography for the identification of the appendix under mentoring by an onsite expert,
      whereas those in group B (n=15) performed the same procedure under mentoring by an offsite
      expert.

      Each subject performed the procedure on three simulated patients. After a four-week interval,
      they performed the procedure again under the other type of mentoring. A total of 90
      ultrasound examinations were performed in each scenario. The primary outcomes were the
      success rate for identifying the appendix and the time required to identify the appendix.
