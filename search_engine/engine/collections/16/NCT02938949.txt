      intensity statin therapy in patients who have previously been treated with high intensity
      statins with poor response, who present with a type I (spontaneous) acute NSTEMI. Patients
      will be dosed with drug or placebo once during the first day of their hospital admission.
      Blood samples will be collected at baseline, 3 days and 14 days after randomization for
      biomarker testing. Particular attention will be paid to additional LDL lowering effects, as
      well as the effects on PCSK9 levels and inflammatory biomarkers. Safety and tolerability will
      be monitored with complete blood count + differential and complete metabolic panels at each
      study visit.
