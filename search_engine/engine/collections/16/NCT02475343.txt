      has been regarded as a classical method to evaluate intraocular pressure (IOP). In present
      study, we aims to measure the corneal biomechanical properties with schiotz tonometer and
      elucidate the clinical significance of this novel measurement. The corneal biomechanical
      property was calculated with subtracting the value displayed under loaded weight 5.5g from
      that under loaded weight 7.5g. We named the corneal biomechanical properties obtained with
      schiotz tonometer as Mulee factor, and the formulation is Mulee factor=value under loaded
      weight 7.5g (Value 7.5G)-value under loaded weight 5.5g (Value 5.5G).
