    
      The trial is being conducted at multiple study centers throughout the United States. The
      trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Participants must meet specific
      eligibility criteria. Study personnel will determine your eligibility in a telephone
      interview and through routine medical tests (physical exam, blood tests, imaging scans) done
      at a study center.

      If you qualify for and decide to participate in the trial, you will have three product
      administrations over the course of one month.
