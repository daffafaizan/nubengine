      0.6mg/m2/d and 0.8mg/m2/d, with an improved dose escalation design. The initial dose is
      0.6mg/m2, once a day for 5 consecutive days, every 28 days for a course of treatment.
      Subjects are assigned to the corresponding dose group according to the order of enrolling.
      DLT is observed within 28 days of the first dose of Gimatecan. In the absence of DLT as
      prescribed by the protocol, the next dose group is started until the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) is observed.
