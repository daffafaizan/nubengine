      decrease the elevation of ALT and AST coursed by carbon tetrachloride, D-galactosamine and
      Thioacetamide. It could also significantly reduce the injury on the liver coursed by
      D-galacosamine and immunologic factors. Magnesium Isoglycyrrhizinate with strong
      anti-inflammatory effect could protect the liver cell and improve the liver function.
