    
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the aura6000
      System for the treatment of moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in individuals
      who have failed or do not tolerate positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy or have failed or
      are intolerant of or refuse indicated alternative OSA treatments (such as oral appliances,
      positional devices and conventional sleep surgeries). PAP failure is defined as an inability
      to eliminate OSA (AHI > 20 despite PAP usage) and PAP intolerance is defined as: 1) inability
      to use PAP (greater than 5 nights per week of usage; usage defined as greater than 4 hours of
      use per night); or 2) unwillingness to use PAP (for example, a patient returns the PAP system
      after attempting to use it). The results of this study are anticipated to provide reasonable
      assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the aura6000 System when used as intended and to
      support the application for FDA Premarket Approval of the system.
