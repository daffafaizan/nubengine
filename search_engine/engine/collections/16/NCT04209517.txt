      negative perioperative impact, including impaired memory of important instructions and high
      incidence of post-operative acute and chronic pain. Self-administered questionnaires linked
      to scales to assess anxiety in the preoperative setting are usual practice. Yet, they are
      time consuming and rely on patient willingness to comply with instructions, which is not
      always reliable. The effects of acute anxiety on behaviour are poorly explored in the
      preoperative context. Quantifying and characterizing behavioural patterns in anxious patients
      using an applied ethological approach may provide useful information for reliable, accurate
      and objective assessment before surgery.
