      decision making for common medical tests and treatments. The purpose of the study is to
      compare the effectiveness of different approaches to shared decision making (SDM) skills
      training. Participants will be randomly assigned to either receive two decision aids or a
      webinar to review. Participants will also be randomly assigned to receive feedback on
      standardized patient interaction rating their shared decision making skills and highlighting
      opportunities for improvement or not. Clinician participants will be assigned to one of four
      intervention groups using a 2x2 factorial design:

      Group 1: Decision aid viewing with feedback Group 2: Decision aid viewing and no feedback
      Group 3: webinar with feedback Group 4: webinar and no feedback

      The pilot study will provide evidence on the comparative effectiveness and feasibility on
      training formats to determine if:

        -  Clinicians improved in SDM communication skills

        -  Clinicians have an increased confidence to use SDM with their patients

        -  The training is acceptable to clinicians
