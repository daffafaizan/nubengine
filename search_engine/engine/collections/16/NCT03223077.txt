      pathogens predispose patients to post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome (PI-IBS) and other
      functional GI disorders1. Campylobacter is one of the top five organisms responsible for
      food-borne illnesses causing approximately 0.8 million cases annually2. Isolated C. jejuni
      infection has been associated with a PI-IBS risk of 9% to 13%3. Epidemiological studies have
      identified female gender, age <60 years, smoking, enteritis severity, and pre-enteritis
      psychological stress as risk-factors for development of PI-IBS4. In a single study, variants
      in host genes TLR9, IL6, and CDH1 were identified as independent risk factors for development
      of PI-IBS after controlling for previously identified clinical risk factors5. In another
      study, host cytokines were looked at in relation to development of reactive arthritis and IBS
      following Campylobacter enteritis. The risk of acquiring clinical gastroenteritis with
      Campylobacter jejuni/coli was related to the INFG (+ 874A>T) of intron 1. Polymorphisms in
      IL-18 and INFG were linked to the risk of post-infectious reactive arthritis, but not to
      PI-IBS6. However, this study was limited by assessment of only serum cytokine profile and not
      mucosal. A recent study has shown that fecal microbiota of patients with PI-IBS differs from
      that of healthy controls and resembles that of patients with IBS with diarrhea (IBS-D)7. The
      microbiota is altered during acute enteritis, but it is unclear if there are any signatures
      in acute microbiota alterations that can help predict development of PI-IBS following
      Campylobacter enteritis. Our overall goal with this study is to identify non-invasive and
      invasive host factors that can help predict the development of PI-IBS following Campylobacter
      enteritis.
