    
      The aim of this clinical study is to investigate the efficacy of a 15-days treatment with the
      herbal medicinal product BNO 1016 for therapy of acute rhinosinusitis in adult patients. Due
      to the considerable morbidity and the diminished quality of life experienced by people
      afflicted with acute rhinosinusitis an important aim of the treatment is to reduce the
      severity of rhinosinusitis symptoms and the duration of the disease. By grading the severity
      of the disease on the basis of the 5 main rhinosinusitis symptoms the investigator will
      assess the efficacy of the treatment.
