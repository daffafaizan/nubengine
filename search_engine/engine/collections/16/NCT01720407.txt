    
      The primary endpoint of the study is to demonstrate that neoadjuvant treatment of LM by
      imiquimod prior to surgery can reduce the frequency of intralesional excisions as from the
      first surgical procedure, with a healthy tissue margin of 5mm. Furthermore, the improvement
      in patient quality of life could also be significant.

      The number of patients to be included in the study is 268.

      For each patient, the study will involve several stages (S), as follows:

      S0 (Selection): information and obtaining of the patient's informed consent. Performance of
      biopsy for histological confirmation of LM

      S1 (S0 + ~ 2 weeks): patient inclusion following anatomopathological confirmation of LM.
      Patient randomisation in one or other study arm: imiquimod versus placebo and initiation of
      topical treatment.

      S2 (S1 + 4 weeks): Discontinuation of imiquimod/placebo application. Scheduling of the
      surgical procedure 4 weeks later.

      S3 (S2 + 4 weeks): Surgery.

      S4: After the last surgical procedure, simple clinical follow up will be ensured every 6
      months for a period of 3 years, in order to study the recurrence rate.
