    
      Registry procedures:

        -  HIGH-RESOLUTION PANCREATIC PROTOCOL COMPUTED TOMOGRAPHY (CT) SCAN EXAMINATION: performed
           on at least 16-section multi-detector row (MD) CT and reviewed using multi-planar
           reconstructions, with images obtained following the oral administration of water and
           pancreatic protocol intravenous iopamidol, with images acquired in the pancreatic and
           portal venous phases of contrast enhancement, reconstructed as thin slice (at 1 mm -
           pancreatic phase or 2 mm - portal venous phase increments).

        -  EUS EXAMINATION: performed within 2 weeks of the MDCT, aiming visualization of the
           pancreas, main surrounding vascular structures, celiac and mediastinal lymph nodes,
           liver and left adrenal gland, with EUS-FNA performed at the discretion of the
           investigator/examiner to confirm/exclude metastases and for the confirmation of
           malignancy in the primary tumor. Patients confirmed by EUS as having distant metastases
           are to be deferred from the planned surgical intervention.

        -  SURGICAL INTERVENTION: aiming to provide curative intent (R0) resection.

        -  HISTOPATHOLOGICAL POSTOPERATIVE STAGING: with evaluation of loco-regional invasiveness
           and degree of complete surgical resection (R0/R1).

        -  FOLLOW-UP OF PATIENTS: with phone-calls on an every 6 month basis, for up to 2 years,
           retaining the following data: survival (or not), date of decease and its direct cause
           (if applicable), the presence of tumor recurrence (or not).
