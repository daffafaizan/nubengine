    
      The study objectives include the determination of the antitumor effect of SU011248 in
      patients with urothelial transitional cell carcinoma and to also determine the toxicities and
      tolerability of SU011248 in patients with urothelial transitional cell carcinoma who have
      failed or are intolerant to cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

      The primary endpoint of the study is to compare progression free survival at 4 months in
      patients who received SU011248 plus BSC versus patients who received placebo plus BSC

      The secondary endpoint is to compare the objective response rate and duration of response in
      patients who received SU011248 plus BSC versus patients who received placebo plus BSC, to
      describe the QOL and safety profile of SU011248 when compared to placebo and to describe the
      overall survival in patients who received SU011248 plus BSC versus patients who received
      placebo plus BSC
