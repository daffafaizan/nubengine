      cirrhosis-linked complications (e.g. ascites, variceal bleeding, hepatocellular carcinoma,
      etc.). The invasive HVPG-technique is the standard-of-care Investigation for Evaluation of
      Portal Hypertension. Administration of Beta-Blocker-therapy results in dropping of the
      elevated Portal vein pressure values so Overall-survival rate and incidence of
      liver-cirrhosis-linked complications can be ameliorated. Ultrasound-based Investigation of
      liver and Spleen-stiffness and of portal-vein-flow-volume, respectively, are the non-invasive
      methods for Evaluation of Portal Hypertension. But the cut-off values for detection of
      significant Portal Hypertension by the ultrasound investigation strongly vary depending on
      the study performed. This study evaluates the changes in ARFI-assisted elastography
      measurements of liver and spleen and in portal vein flow values, respectively, compared with
      the recorded Delta in invasive hepatic vein pressure gradient (HVPG)-values for patients with
      portal hypertension and new administered beta-blocker-therapy. The aim of this study is to
      evaluate value drop in liver- and Spleen-stiffness and portal-vein-flow required in
      corelation to a significant drop in HVPG-pressure after new-administered beta-blocker
      therapy.
