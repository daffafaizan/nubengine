      Primary

        -  Characterize, morphologically and molecularly, squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx,
           pharynx, or oral cavity in patients without high-risk factors, such as alcohol
           consumption, smoking, or occupation.

      Secondary

        -  Study the impact parameters of morphology, molecular characteristics, and genomics on
           disease-free survival and overall survival of these patients.

        -  Study the impact parameters of morphological, molecular, and genomic control in the
           tumor.

        -  Assess, in advanced tumors, the risk of heterogeneity of morphological, molecular, and
           genomic control in the tumor.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood, tumor tissue, and healthy tissue samples are collected before treatment begins.

      Patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years (additional biopsies may be collected).
