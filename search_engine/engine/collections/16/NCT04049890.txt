    
      FAI was developed in two different forms:

        1. for parents with one children suffering from a chronic disease or ill children who has
           siblings younger than 3 years old - FAI-O (only child);

        2. for parents with at least two children, the brother/sister of the ill child has 3 years
           or more- FAS-S (siblings) The two forms are identical, with the exception that FAI-S has
           an additional dimension with respect to FAI-O, that specifically regards the involvement
           of siblings in the illness path of the sick brother/sister.

      Development of FAI followed several steps:

        -  definition of initial instrument dimensions

        -  item wording for each dimension

        -  definition of scoring

        -  focus group with parents of patients suffering from a chronic disease to evaluate item
           content and linguistic clarity

      Validation of FAI for each form (FAI-O and FAI-S):

      Validation consists in several steps, identical for the two versions but in different in
      timing, depending on the number of admnistration.

        -  first phase: the FAI is administered to parents of patients with different chronic
           disease (each form needs to reach the total of 300 administrations).

        -  second phase: statistical analysis aimed to obtain the final version of each FAI form
           (define actual dimensions and most adequate items)

        -  third phase: administration to a new sample of parents of children suffering from a
           chronic disease (each form needs to reach the total of 150 administrations).

        -  fourth phase: statistical analysis aimed to confirm the adequacy of the instrument
