      fibular taping. The effects of fibular taping on ankle dorsiflexion ROM and muscle activation
      in individuals with CAI are unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the acute
      effects of fibular taping on muscle activation of the fibularis longus (peroneus) and soleus
      muscles, ankle dorsiflexion range of motion (ROM) and dynamic balance. The investigators
      hypothesize that fibular taping will have similar effectiveness as mobilization interventions
      which have been shown to improve muscle activation, ankle dorsiflexion ROM,and dynamic
      balance. Outcomes will be measured immediately before and after intervention. A crossover
      design will be used and participants will complete two visits at least 48 hours apart, but
      not more than 1 week apart. After participants complete both arms of the study their
      participation will be complete (average time to completion for each subject is 1 week).
