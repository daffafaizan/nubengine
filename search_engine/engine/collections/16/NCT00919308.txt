      defined levels of clinical competence. Currently, inexperienced physicians are trained to
      perform invasive procedures such as central venous catheter (CVC) insertion according to the
      bedside, apprenticeship model, gaining expertise on real patients in neither a rigorous nor
      standardized manner. Simulators may ease trainees' transition to actual patients and avoid
      adverse events. This project aims to investigate the efficacy of a structured simulation
      training protocol in ultrasound guided CVC insertion for resident physicians. The specific
      aims are to compare: (1) the failure rate of CVC insertion, and (2) the number of attempts at
      venous cannulation, rates of technical errors and complications of CVC insertion, and time to
      CVC insertion on actual patients between residents who completed a structured, hands-on
      simulation training protocol (intervention group) and those who are trained according to the
      traditional, bedside apprenticeship model (control group). We hypothesize that the
      intervention group will obtain superior skills at CVC insertion on actual patients as
      compared to the control group as measured by: (1) a reduced failure rate at CVC insertion,
      (2) a) a reduced number of attempts at venous cannulation b) a decreased rate of technical
      errors and complications and c) a decreased time to insertion based on an independent rater's
      evaluation using a procedure checklist.
