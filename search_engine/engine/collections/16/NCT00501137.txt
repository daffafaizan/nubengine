    
      Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a cause of cervical cancer. Immunogenicity, safety
      and efficacy in the prevention of persistent infection from HPV 16 and 18 has been proven
      using a 3-dose regimen in adolescent and adult females using the Quadrivalent Human
      Papillomavirus (Q-HPV) vaccine. The intensity of the immune response is inversely
      proportional to age. Immunogenicity in adolescents 9-15 years of age is 1.7 - 2 times greater
      than in 16-26 year old vaccine recipients. Paediatric dosing studies are necessary and
      prudent given limited provincial funding for new biologics acquisition and programme service
      delivery. A reduction from an adult 3-dose HPV vaccine regimen to a pediatric 2-dose regimen
      will result in increased compliance to the full vaccine series and in significant savings to
      the health care system both in the cost of biologics and of program delivery and
      administration.
