    
      Approximately equal numbers of subjects will be enrolled in each of the 2 groups (with normal
      gastric emptying, and with delayed gastric emptying (gastroparesis)) to complete at least 10
      subjects per group.

      The subjects will first have their gastric emptying rates investigated by scintigraphy using
      the Solid Test Meal containing 500 uCi 99mTc sulfur colloid at Visit 1. Second, the subjects
      will have their gastric emptying rates investigated by scintigraphy and 13C-uracil GEBT
      simultaneously using the Semi solid Test Meal containing 500 uCi 99mTc sulfur colloid and 100
      mg of 13C-uracil, respectively, at Visit 2. A comparison will be made between the results
      obtained at Visits 1 and 2 along with a comparison of the data obtained during Visit 2 for
      evaluation of the 13C-uracil GEBT.
