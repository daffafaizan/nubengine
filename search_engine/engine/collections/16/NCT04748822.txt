    
      The standard DSM-5-based clinical assessment of AUD includes the number of AUD criteria
      (between 2 and 11) as well as various parameters related to the patterns of alcohol use
      (e.g., frequency of use, frequency of heavy use). In the contemporary clinical practice, more
      "functional" assessment tools are emerging such as quality of life, autonomy, cognitive
      functioning, but also other non-specific lifestyle habits, such as sleep quality and sexual
      functioning. These indicators are important because they define the broad impact of AUD on
      individual's life, and they are part of the overall rehabilitation, beyond the mere question
      of the relationship to alcohol. However, the determinants of quality of life of patients with
      AUD patients undergoing a detoxification program, and the factors associated with change in
      quality of life are not well identified.

      This prospective cohort study will recruit 200 patients undergoing a detoxification program
      (home-based or in addiction services). Patients' demographic data, socioeconomic status,
      physical diseases, medication use, clinical features of AUD, psychiatric variables,
      impulsivity, autonomy, sexual functioning, sleep quality, and cognitive functioning will be
      measured at baseline. The Alcohol Quality of Life Scale (AQoLS) will be completed at baseline
      and at 6-month follow-up. Alcohol status (relapse/abstinence) will be assessed at 6 months.
