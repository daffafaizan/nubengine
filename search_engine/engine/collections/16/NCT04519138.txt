      esophagus or duodenum (upper small intestine). The investigation will consist of one visit
      with an endoscopic examination with sampling of an observed lesion or suspected tumor. Six
      biopsies will be collected from each patient, three consecutive samples using the Endodrill
      Model X instrument and three consecutive samples using the standard fine needle. The order of
      instruments to be used will be randomly assigned. The patient will be under observation for 2
      hours after the procedure. Telephone follow-up will be performed 1 and 7 days after the
      examination. Visual confirmation of the biopsies size will be recorded at the examination. If
      the samples verify a tumor or not will be evaluated at Day 14 when the pathology report is
      concluded.
