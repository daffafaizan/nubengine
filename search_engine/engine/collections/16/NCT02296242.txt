      twice daily for 21-day cycles.

      Part 1 of the study will establish dose limiting toxicities (DLT), maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD), and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D).

      In Part 2 of the study, additional patients with particular tumor types and/or cancers
      harboring specific genetic mutations will be recruited for treatment at the Recommended Phase
      2 Dose (RP2D). Patients may also be assessed pharmacodynamic measures in healthy or malignant
      tissues, using biomarker assays for phosphorylation, cytotoxic or cytostatic measures.
