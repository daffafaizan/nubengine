      improves survival in metastatic breast cancer. Women who have metastatic breast cancer at the
      initial diagnosis will be included in the study. There will be two study arms: primary
      surgery and systemic chemotherapy groups.

      In the primary surgery group patients will have adjuvant therapies after they had the proper
      surgery. In the systemic chemotherapy group patients will be followed after their initial
      therapy and will have surgery only if they have locoregional problems (such as wide necrosis
      or bleeding, etc). During the follow-up period, patients will be seen in every 6 months.
