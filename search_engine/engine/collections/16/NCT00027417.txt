      stratified to each diagnostic category. All patients undergo preoperative echocardiograms to
      provide preoperative cardiac function data. The study drug or placebo will be provided in the
      operating room as an iv bolus just prior to cardiopulmonary bypass and as a bolus delivered
      on release of the aortic cross-clamp. This will be followed by iv for 12 hours. Operative
      data will be collected including CPB time, aortic cross-clamp time, length and degree of
      hypothermia. These data will be extracted from the anesthesia record.
