      Measures. The cat allergen levels in the model are similar to those found in homes with cats
      and are capable of inducing lower- and upper-airway responses that have been used to assess
      the efficacy of several asthma and allergy therapies.

      Cat allergen exposure was performed in a room furnished with upholstered furniture, a
      blanket, and a cat litter box. The door was kept closed at all times, except when personnel
      or study patients were entering or leaving the room. The ventilation system was operating at
      all times except during cat allergen challenges. Two neutered adult cats were kept in the
      room at all times and were free to move about except during challenges, at which time they
      are placed in wire cages. Immediately before a challenge, the blanket was shaken vigorously
      to distribute cat allergen throughout the room.
