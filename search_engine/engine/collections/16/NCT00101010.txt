      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in older patients with previously untreated
           aggressive diffuse large B-cell stage II-IV lymphoma treated with rituximab,
           cyclophosphamide, pegylated doxorubicin hydrochloride liposome (HCl), vincristine, and
           prednisone.

        -  Determine the cardiotoxicity and myelosuppression of this regimen in these patients.

      Secondary

        -  Determine disease-free survival and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive rituximab intravenous (IV), cyclophosphamide IV over 1-1Â½ hours, pegylated
      doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour, and vincristine IV on day 1, and oral prednisone on
      days 1-5. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning
      on day 6 and continuing until blood counts recover OR pegfilgrastim SC once on day 6 (24
      hours after the completion of chemotherapy). Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8
      courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity, disease progression, active hepatitis B
      virus infection, or hepatitis. Patients with no response OR who achieve less than a partial
      response after 4 courses are removed from the study.

      Patients are followed at 1 month, every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and
      then every 6 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 80 patients will be accrued for this study within 27 months.
