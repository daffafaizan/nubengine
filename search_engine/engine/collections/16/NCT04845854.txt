      patients receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy. According to the results of Minhas, Sadia,
      et al. -in which prevalence of oral adverse events was (92.6%)- and by adopting a confidence
      interval of (95%), a margin of error of (3%) with finite population correction; the predicted
      sample size (n) was a total of (292) cases. Sample size calculation was performed using Epi
