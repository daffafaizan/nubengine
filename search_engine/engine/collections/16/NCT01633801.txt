      be switched from PRVC to SIMV+PSV (10-15cmH20) which should be maintained for 4 hours. An
      arterial gas analysis will be performed after 20 minutes. Infants with normal gas-exchange
      are gradually weaned from mechanical ventilation At each weaning step an arterial
      hemogasanalysis is performed after 20 minutes, to assess if the decreased ventilatory support
      is tolerated. Increased work of breathing and respiratory acidosis (ph< 7.3 or pCO2 > 60
      mmHg) are considered criteria to withhold the weaning process. After a 4 hour period on
      SIMV+PSV the child should be switched to PSV for 30 minutes and then extubated. The following
      extubation criteria should be reached:

        -  Satisfactory blood gases with PCO2 under 45mmHg, pH greater than 7.30.

        -  Fractional inspired oxygen concentration of 65% and or less than the baseline value

        -  Adequate respiratory frequency according to age without dyspnea

      At this point criteria for extubation are reached. Once extubation has taken place the child
      will be placed either on traditional oxygen therapy or high flow nasal cannulae according to
      randomization.
