      inguinal canal. Open hernia repair with or without mesh or laparoscopic techniques with mesh
      have been advocated in the treatment of sportsman's hernia and associated athletic pubalgia.
      The results of the operative treatment from single centers are reported to be good to
      excellent in between 70 - 90% of patients with the most promising results reported using an
      open minimal repair (OMR) technique. There are no randomized trials comparing open versus
      laparoscopic techniques regarding time for recovery and relief of pain. The aim of this
      randomized study is to compare the effectiveness of OMR technique in local or spinal
      anesthesia to endoscopic Total ExtraPeritoneal (TEP) technique in general anesthesia for the
      treatment of SportsmanÂ´s hernia/athletic pubalgia. The primary endpoint is patient being free
      from intractable groin pain during sports activity or daily work four weeks after surgery.
