      years. In response, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has launched nationwide training
      initiatives to disseminate two PTSD treatments with strong empirical support: prolonged
      exposure (PE) therapy and cognitive processing therapy (CPT). Despite the well-documented
      effectiveness of PE and CPT, only a minority of Veterans with PTSD initiate these
      trauma-focused treatments. One approach to addressing PTSD in a non-trauma-focused fashion is
      to utilize empirically supported treatments focused on safety aid reduction. Safety aids are
      maladaptive cognitive and/or behavioral strategies designed to prevent, avoid, or alleviate
      anxiety. Initially introduced as a way to explain how pathological anxiety can persist
      despite repeated exposure to feared stimuli, safety aids have been found to play a critical
      role in the etiology and maintenance of various anxiety and related conditions including
      PTSD. Importantly, a separate line of research suggests that safety aids are amenable to
      change through cognitive behavioral interventions. Although promising, these trials did not
      include patients with PTSD. In this context, the purpose of this project is to examine the
      efficacy of a safety aid reduction treatment (START), compared to a wait-list control.
      Participants will include veterans with a diagnosis of PTSD who decline to participate in
      evidence-based psychotherapies (EBPs) for PTSD, namely PE or CPT. It is hypothesized that
      participation in START, compared to a wait-list control, will be associated with decreased
      PTSD symptom severity immediately and over time.
