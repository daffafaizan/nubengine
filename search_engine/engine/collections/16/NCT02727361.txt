      the degree of striatal ACh-I alterations.

      In this molecular imaging study, the investigators will directly test this hypothesis using a
      PET radiotracer of the vesicular acetylcholine transporter (VAT). Their goal is to explore
      the relationships between cholinergic dysfunction and clinical disease expression and the
      associated morphological and functional alterations. The experimental protocol will also
      include multimodal MRI, MRI diffusion tensor (to study the microscopic structure of white
      matter) and functional MRI of the resting state (to study the functional organization of
      cerebral cholinergic networks at rest).
