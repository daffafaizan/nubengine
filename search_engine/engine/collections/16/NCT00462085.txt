      gait analysis. Muscle activity is measured by surface electromyography (sEMG) of selected
      lower limb muscle groups. Kinematic, Kinetic, and sEMG data are compared between both lower
      limbs walking with and without an ankle foot orthosis. Data are also compared with those of
      an healthy control group.
