      challenge of obtaining the largest volume of tissue possible on one side while minimizing
      post-operative pain and reducing the risk of complications on the other.The present clinical
      study evaluated whether the additional use of diode laser would facilitate the donor surgery,
      improve the palatal wound healing and reduce post-operative morbidity after the bilaminar
      periodontal plastic surgery procedure for the treatment of isolated single gingival recession
      defects with no loss of interdental clinical attachment.

      In the test sites, an aluminum, gallium, and arsenide diode laser (wavelength 810 nm and
      power of 1W) was applied in continuous mode. In the control group,a free (epithelialized)
      gingival graft was harvested by two horizontal and two vertical incisions defining the area.
      The post operative course of the patients were evaluated by visual analogical scale and the
      oral health impact profile
