      postmenopausal women, ages 45 to 65, with uncomplicated T2DM and BMI ≥25. Women with history
      of kidney or liver disease, BMI>40, autoimmune disease or cancer were not included in the
      study.

      Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a capsule containing 4,000 IU of
      vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, n=52) or placebo (n=52), once a day during 6 months.

      Outcome variables were serum CRP, measured with a high-sensitivity assay (nephelometry), and
      HOMA-IR. Serum vitamin D (25-OH-D) was measured by HPLC. Outcome variables were measured at
      baseline, and 3 and 6 months thereafter. All participants received diet and physical activity
      counseling, and visited the clinic for medical check-up once a month.

      Baseline Results. Mean age was 56.8 ± 5.1 y. Baseline BMI was 30.7 ± 3.9. Median CRP
      concentration was 5.0 mg/L (Interquartile range: 1.0, 8.5). HOMA index at baseline was 7.13 ±
      3.8. Serum 25-OH-D concentration at baseline was 54.5 ± 15.7 nmol/L (~22 ng/mL). Almost 94%
      of patients had baseline serum 25-OH-D levels <80 nmol/L, and 25% were below 40 nmol/L. No
      one had levels <20 nmol/L. There were no statistical differences on important variables by
      treatment group at the onset of study.
