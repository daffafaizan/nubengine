        -  Determine the overall median survival time of patients with newly diagnosed brain
           metastases treated with whole-brain radiotherapy in combination with thalidomide and
           temozolomide.

        -  Determine the radiographic response rate, median time to tumor progression, and median
           time to neurologic response and progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the cause of death of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess quality of life of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo radiotherapy daily 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Beginning on the day before
      the first radiation treatment, patients receive oral thalidomide once daily and oral
      temozolomide once daily for 21 days. Patients continue to receive thalidomide daily for up to
      2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 and 3 months after completing radiotherapy, and
      then every 3 months thereafter.

      Patients are followed at 1 and 3 months and then every 3 months thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 62 patients will be accrued for this study within 10 months.
