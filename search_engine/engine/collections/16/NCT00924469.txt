      study drug is assigned by chance), and multi-center (conducted in more than one center) study
      of abiraterone in male participants with prostate cancer. The duration of study will be
      approximately 24-32 weeks per participant. The study consists of 4 parts: Screening (that is,
      30 days before study commences on Day 1); Treatment (abiraterone acetate 1000 milligram per
      day or leuprolide acetate as 22.5 milligram intramuscular injection [injection of a substance
      into a muscle] or prednisone 5 mg once daily); Prostatectomy (Week 24); and Follow-up ( 4-8
      weeks after prostatectomy). Participants will receive either abiraterone, leuprolide and
      prednisone for 24 weeks (that is, Group 1) or leuprolide once every 12 weeks up to Week 24
      then abiraterone and prednisone from Week 13 to 24 (that is, Group 2). All the eligible
      participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 treatment groups. Efficacy will be
      evaluated primarily through the concentrations of testosterone and dihydrotestosterone from
      prostate tissues at Week 12. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
