      pharmacokinetic profile, raltegravir has been used in several clinical scenarios. Since its
      initial clinical use in multiresistant patients throughout the Expanded Access and
      Compassionate Use Program (started in March 2007) raltegravir has been used successfully in
      other clinical scenarios, including but not limited to: enfuvirtide-related serious adverse
      events and intolerance, nucleoside analogue inhibitors' toxicity, ritonavir and protease
      inhibitor intolerance and to avoid significant drug-drug interactions. Early access to
      raltegravir was basically focused on patients on therapeutic failure and triple-class
      resistance and due to enfuvirtide intolerance. In order to achieve a better understanding of
      the efficacy and safety profile of raltegravir in the clinical setting, it is intended to
      evaluate retrospectively HIV patients treated in Portugal with raltegravir since the Early
      Access and Compassionate Use Program (EAP) was implemented.

      This is a national, multicenter, observational, clinical cohort study with retrospective
      collection of data. Each site will include patients who had started treatment with
      raltegravir under the EAP.
