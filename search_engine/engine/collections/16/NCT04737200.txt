      postoperative critically ill patients. Among the contributing factors is the common practice
      of administering nutrition support through feeding tubes overnight. The overall objective of
      the study is to examine a novel dimension of clinical nutrition by determining whether
      enhancing sleep quality and preserving robust circadian rhythms through daytime instead of
      overnight feeds will attenuate inflammation and improve cardiometabolic profiles of
      postoperative cardiac ICU patients on nutrition support. The investigators hypothesize that
      overnight nutrition support results in fragmented sleep and blunted circadian rhythms and
      thus represent a modifiable mechanism exacerbating inflammation and cardiometabolic
      derangements in postoperative cardiac patients. Results of this study will help in the
      development of evidence-based, cost-efficient, and effective enteral nutrition timing
      countermeasures against fragmented sleep, disrupted circadian rhythms, inflammation and
      cardiometabolic derangements and potentially modify the current widespread practice of
      overnight nutrition likely affecting 250,000 hospital admissions annually in the United
      States.
