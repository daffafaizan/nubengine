      controlled, local hypothermia of the pelvis. The study will evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of the device in inducing hypothermia of the neuromuscular tissues impacting
      continence during RARP.

      The UroCool system is designed to apply targeted temperature control to the pelvic anatomy
      during RARP. The pelvis is cooled transrectally via a closed cycle recirculation of chilled
      sterile saline using a single-use disposable balloon catheter connected via a circulation IV
      set to a control console that is covered by a current 510(k) and commercially available.

      The UroCool polymeric catheter is designed to be inserted within the rectal cavity adjacent
      to the prostate prior to surgery and removed upon completion of surgery. It is used in
      conjunction with the InnerCool Console which circulates cold saline in a closed loop within
      the UroCool catheter to allow for therapeutic localized cooling of the prostate gland and
      surrounding areas during prostate surgery.
