      years, various local therapies, especially radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been proved safe
      and effective.The main limitation of RFA is that its therapeutic impact is significant
      compromised by blood flow cooling effect, especially in hypervascular HCC. Recent studies
      showed combined therapy of TACE and RFA can decrease the blood supply of tumor, increase
      ablated volume and therefore improve the outcome. However, TACE application is limited in
      patients who cannot tolerate this therapy due to the side effects of repeated TACE, poor
      liver function or previously legated hepatic artery. The present study is focus on
      "difficult-to-treat" HCC patients who are neither surgical candidates, nor TACE candidates.
      The investigators introduce the novel treatment mode that RFA followed ultrasound guided
      percutaneous ablation of tumur feeding arterial to treat these difficult cases and evaluate
      the clinical effect.
