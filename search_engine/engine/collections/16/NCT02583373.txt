      bacterial pneumonia and its severe forms are associated with high morbidity and mortality,
      despite pneumococcal vaccines and medical treatment (antibiotic therapy, alone or in
      combination). Bacterial toxins, such as the pore-forming toxin (PFT) pneumolysin (from
      Streptococcus pneumoniae), are involved in the development of invasive disease and play a key
      role in severe and fatal complications. CAL02 offers a novel therapeutic approach by
      neutralising bacterial toxins, such as pneumolysin, which recognise specific microdomains on
      host cell membranes, called lipid rafts.
