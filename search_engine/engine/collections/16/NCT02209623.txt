    
      This is an observational study of both pregnant and non-pregnant women. Vaccine
      administration in the pregnant population will be part of routine care. Vaccine
      administration in the non-pregnant women will be provided as either routine care or as part
      of the study. Pregnant women at ≥ 20 weeks 0 days gestation who have not received Tdap during
      the current pregnancy will be enrolled, with prioritized emphasis on enrolling pregnant women
      who have received Tdap prior to the current pregnancy in order to attempt to address the
      question of closely-spaced repeated dosing. Detailed data will be collected from study
      participants on prior Tdap/Td/TT receipt. The non-pregnant women will consist of both Tdap
      naïve and those who have received Tdap previously. With Day 0 serving as the day of
      vaccination, participants will be followed through Day 7 for symptoms of reactogenicity. For
      Primary Objective 1, symptoms of reactogenicity occurring from Day 0 -7 will be compared
      between pregnant and non-pregnant women. For Objective 2, pregnant women will be followed
      through delivery for collection of pregnancy outcome data. Pregnancy outcomes among study
      participants will be compared with historical outcomes from summary data from both Vanderbilt
      and Duke. In addition, follow-up will be conducted for infants born to mothers who received
      Tdap during pregnancy to assess health outcomes and growth parameters through 6 months of
      life.
