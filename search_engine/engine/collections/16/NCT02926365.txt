      adolescents with anxiety disorders and OCD within routine health care in a rural area.

      Research questions

        -  Is ICBT an acceptable method for the patient group?

        -  Is ICBT effective in a clinical setting?

        -  Is further treatment needed after ICBT?

        -  What are the long-term effects of ICBT?

        -  What predicts treatment outcome?

        -  How does ICBT work in a clincal setting? (time spent, negative effects etc)?

      Design This is a uncontrolled intervention study where included families and children will be
      recruited consecutively during two years from a routine care CAMHS unit. All participants
      will be offered ICBT and assessed pre- and post-treatment, and at three-month follow-up
      through clinician ratings and self-report measures. The primary outcome measure is clinician
      rated severity of principal disorder at three-month follow-up. Long-term results will be
      assessed through study of medical records two years after completed ICBT.
