      level (1 mg to 6 mg per dose) when used in combination with domperidone (30 mg/day) will be
      evaluated in comparison with that of placebo in Parkinson's disease patients with motor
      response complications on levodopa therapy. The maintenance dose level for each subject will
      be determined using a titration scheme in 1 mg increments.
