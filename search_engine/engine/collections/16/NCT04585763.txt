      System to treat calcified peripheral arteries. A minimum of 40 lesions in up to 40 subjects
      at up to 6 sites in Australia and New Zealand will be enrolled with the aim of treating at
      least 20 target lesions with the 8.0 mm IVL catheter. A maximum of three target lesions may
      be treated per subject. Subjects with moderate and severely calcified iliac and
      femoropopliteal artery disease presenting with Rutherford Category 2 to 5. Approximately 6
      months of enrollment at up to 6 sites in Australia and New Zealand. Study subjects will be
      followed through discharge, 30 days, 6 and 12 months. Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) assessments
      will be completed at 12 months. Total anticipated study duration is 18 months. The primary
      safety endpoint is Major Adverse Events (MAE) at 30 days defined as: need for emergency
      surgical revascularization of target limb; unplanned target limb major amputation (above the
      ankle); symptomatic thrombus or distal emboli that require surgical, mechanical or
      pharmacologic means to improve flow and extend hospitalization ; or perforations that require
      an intervention, including bail-out stenting. The primary performance endpoint is technical
      success defined as final residual stenosis ≤30% without flow-limiting dissection (≥ Grade D)
      of the lesion by angiographic core lab.
