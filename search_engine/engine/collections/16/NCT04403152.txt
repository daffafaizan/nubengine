      of the muscles located in the surgical site. In addition, pulmonary dysfunction could develop
      due to reduced flexibility of the spine and mobility of the ribs. It is a known fact that
      cardiopulmonary functions in adolescent idiopathic scoliosis patients may not recover even
      two years after surgery. After fusion surgeries in patients with scoliosis have shown that
      the static and dynamic postural control were impaired and that the postural control could
      recover one year after the surgery. The increasing health expenditures over the years have
      brought along the need for rehabilitation programs conducted in the early term.

      Increased postoperative pain, impaired balance reactions in the short, weak EMG responses of
      the trunk muscles, decreased pulmonary capacity and increased health costs have necessitated
      early rehabilitation in patients who had undergone scoliosis surgery. Also, the need for
      further research on the effects of physiotherapeutic approaches on the aforementioned
      functional losses has been indicated in several studies.Although early mobilization has been
      accepted as a rule of thumb by spinal surgeons in preventing the performance loss and
      reducing the causes of morbidity in recent years, the investigators could not find any
      research on postoperative rehabilitation implemented on patients under the supervision of a
      physiotherapist, following scoliosis surgery.

      Therefore, based on these findings, the aim of this study was to compare effect of five days
      of intensive postoperative rehabilitation and mobilization on length of hospitalization and
      outcome in patients having scoliosis surgery.
