      big-bubble technique.

      Methods: Thirty four unselected consecutive patients were submitted to DALK big-bubble
      technique. Intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative uncorrected visual
      acuity (UCVA), best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), spherical equivalent (SE),
      corneal topography, and endothelial cell density were evaluated. All patients were followed
      for at least 6 months.
