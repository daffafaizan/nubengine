      normal subjects. Whereas in asthmatics with spontaneous bronchoconstriction (obstruction of
      the airway), DI was shown to worsen airway obstruction. The mechanism for this variability in
      response to DI is not well-understood, but seems to be a key in understanding the
      pathophysiology of the disease, and possibly in the development of an effective therapy. Air
      way inflammation resulting in airway wall thickening and peribronchial edema is thought to
      play a role how the airway responds to deep inhalation. This study assess if reduction in
      airway inflammation (as measured by level of exhaled NO)results in optimization of the
      bronchodilator response to deep inhalation
