      and 4) Pulse wave analysis (PWA). Patients will rest for 10 minutes between each test. They
      will be trained to use PARASYMTM unit for TVS. Blood collected, serum/plasma will be stored
      at -80F. Whole blood will be collected in PAXgene tubes. Patients will be instructed to apply
      TVS to either ear lobule (SHAM) or Tragus(experimental arm). Baseline characteristics will be
      collected including data on ventricular function(LVEF and left ventricular volumes).

      Visit 2 (4 weeks): Follow up tests(FMD,LSCI,EndoPAT,PWA) and repeat blood collection.

      Inflammatory cytokines and vascular function assays will be performed.
