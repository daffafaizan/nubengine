    
      OUTLINE: This is a multi-center study.

        -  Rituximab 375 mg/m2 day 1 of 21 day cycle

        -  Gemcitabine 1000 mg/m2 days 1 and 8 of 21 day cycle

      Subgroup 1. Relapsed after responding to first line chemotherapy, who are not candidates for
      salvage high-dose chemotherapy.

      Subgroup 2. Failure to achieve a complete response or relapsed after responding to salvage
      chemotherapy (any number of salvage regimens allowed), who are not candidates for high-dose
      chemotherapy.

      Subgroup 3. Refractory to first line chemotherapy and/or 1 (one) salvage chemotherapy
      regimen.

      Subgroup 4. Progression after high-dose chemotherapy. Patients with progressive disease
      within 3 months of high-dose chemotherapy are not allowed.
