    
      All consecutive patients scheduled to undergo elective, outpatient microsurgical testicular
      sperm extraction (TESE) beginning in 9/2011 will be invited for participation.
      Microdissection TESE will be performed unilaterally or bilaterally, through a midline scrotal
      incision, under general anesthesia.

      Participants will be prospectively randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 200 mg of celecoxib
      or placebo b.i.d. in a double-blind fashion, initiated the night prior to surgery, and
      continued for six days thereafter. The randomization sequence will be generated and
      implemented by the institutional investigational pharmacy. Placebo medication, identical to
      the study medication, will also be provided by the institutional pharmacy.

      Following surgery, all participants will be asked to complete a take-home post-operative
      questionnaire recording their maximum pain level on an 11-point visual analog scale (0-10),
      at specific time intervals over the course of the day, ranging from every six hours on
      post-operative day (POD) #1 to every 8 hours on POD #2, every 12 hours on POD #3, and every
      24 hours on POD #4 to POD #7. Patients will also record the number of 5/500 mg tablets of
      acetaminophen/hydrocodone used for supplemental pain control from POD #1 to POD #7. Thirdly,
      patients will record whether or not their pain was adequately controlled at each of the
      above-mentioned time intervals.
