    
      This is the first study of the oral formulation of BAL101553. BAL101553 will be administered
      once daily during each day of a 28-day treatment cycle in capsule form to adults with
      advanced or recurrent solid tumors or recurrent or progressive glioblastoma or high-grade
      glioma who have failed standard therapy, or for whom no effective standard therapy is
      available.

      In Phase 1, the highest dose of BAL101553 was determined that can safely be given to adults
      with advanced or recurrent solid tumors, recurrent or progressive glioblastoma or high-grade
      glioma who have failed standard therapy, or for whom no effective standard therapy is
      available.

      In Phase 2a, the tolerability and potential anticancer activity of oral BAL101553 will be
      assessed in patients with recurrent glioblastoma whose tumor tissue tests positive for
      end-binding protein 1 (EB1). The study will also measure pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic
      effects and assess biomarkers.
