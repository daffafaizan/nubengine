      lifestyle (with insulin rescue if needed) in GDM on eight clinically relevant pregnancy
      outcomes at delivery, summarized by means of an integrated, newly developed score, the GDM
      Outcome Score (GOS), and on other relevant outcomes on the longer term in mother and child.
      The investigators hypothesize that metformin given to women with GDM from the start of the
      diagnosis reduces risks resulting in relevant health benefits for mother and child during
      pregnancy, at delivery, and many years thereafter.

      The POEM study is a randomized controlled intervention study, consisting of three phases:

        -  Phase A - from inclusion until two weeks after delivery; intervention study with and
           without exposure of metformin in mother and (unborn) child: two arms after randomization
           with 1:1 allocation to Diet + Lifestyle + Metformin (DLM) or Diet + Lifestyle (DL);

        -  Phase B - from two weeks until 1 year after delivery; intervention study with exposure
           of DLM vs DL in mother;

        -  Phase C - from 1 until 20 years after delivery; observational extension study of mother
           and child without study medication.
