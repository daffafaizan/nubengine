      cancer. The aim of our study is to assess the efficacy and toxicity of a chemotherapy regimen
      combining carboplatin and etoposide in patients with metastatic hormone-resistant prostate
      cancer and neuro-endocrine differentiation. To be eligible, patients must have either
      circulating neuro-endocrine markers (Chromogranin A: CgA, Neuron Specific Enolase: NSE)and/or
      visceral metastases. Eligible patients are treated with the combination of carboplatin AUC4
      administered on day 1 and etoposide 100 mg/m2 given on day 1, day 2 and day 3 and repeated
      every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 cycles. The primary objective of the study is to assess
      objective response to the carboplatin - etoposide combination (according to RECIST criteria
      for lesions and defined as a 50% or greater decrease from baseline serum values for PSA and
      neuro-endocrine markers). Secondary objectives include evaluation of toxicity, duration of
      response, progression-free-survival and overall survival.
