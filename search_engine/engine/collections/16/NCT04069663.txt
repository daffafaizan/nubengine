      currently approved by EMA (European Medicines Agency) and ANSM (National Agency for the
      Safety of Medicines and Health Products) for the treatment of advanced Non-Small-Cell Lung
      Cancer (NSCLC) in first or second line with different strategies according to the expression
      of PD-L1. Moreover, durvalumab recently entered the treatment strategy for locally advanced
      disease in PD-L1 expressing (>1%) patients. Median progression-free survival (PFS) for
      patients with advanced NSCLC is approximately 3 to 4 months with this kind of drugs and
      chemotherapy is currently the reference treatment after progression. However, the scientific
      community is now evaluating the re-challenge strategy. Notably, in patients with metastatic
      melanoma, different trials have shown the efficacy and the good safety of re-challenge with
      ipilimumab or a combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab after an initial period of disease
      control with ipilimumab.

      To date, no studies have reported the clinical benefit of ICP re-challenge in patients with
      advanced NSCLC. The effectiveness and tolerance of the re-challenge strategy with the same or
      another ICP remains therefore a major issue.
