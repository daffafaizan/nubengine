      social, emotional, and educational functioning. This study will determine whether early
      intervention can improve such functioning in toddlers with autism.

      Each treatment session will last 6 months. Children with an autism spectrum disorder will be
      enrolled in one of two parallel classes and will receive one of two treatments 4 days a week
      for the duration of the session. Children in each class will receive the same amount and
      level of intervention, but with a different goal focus. Treatments will be school- and
      home-based; parents will receive instruction on administering the at-home part of the
      treatment. The intervention will include environmental engineering, developmental approaches,
      adaptations of traditional behavioral approaches, and contemporary behavioral approaches that
      apply principles of applied behavior analysis in more naturalistic teaching frameworks. A
      series of measures including scales, interviews, and observations will be used to assess the
      children at baseline, study completion, and 6 months after study completion. The children
      will be videotaped during the school-based intervention.
