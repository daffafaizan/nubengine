      the surgical position in the OR and then to confirm and extend the Japanese study described
      above. In the first phase of the study, 5-25 patients with palpable invasive breast cancer
      will undergo pre-operative supine MRI and optical scanning in the surgical position. The
      purpose of this phase will be ensure that the images created from the optical
      scanner-adjusted supine MRI images closely correspond to the location of the palpable tumors
      in these breasts. All patients will then have their tumor resected using the standard method
      of either palpation or image guided wire localization. The first phase has been completed.

      In the second phase of the study, patients with non-palpable invasive breast cancer or DCIS
      who desire breast conservation will be randomized to either a usual care group, or a group
      receiving a supine MRI in addition to conventional imaging (mammogram and prone MRI) and
      undergoing breast cancer resection without the wire localization technique.

      Our secondary objectives will be to determine:

        1. whether there are differences between the two groups in the volume of breast tissue
           removed.

        2. whether diagnostic information obtained from a supine MRI is equivalent to that obtained
           from the prone MRI.
