      despite current treatments. It is the most frequent haematological disorder after the age of
      65. Different approaches targeting the immune compartment have been developed but preliminary
      results seem to show variable response rates to these therapeutic highlighting the
      heterogeneity of MDS and the need to identify detailed immune profiles that are predictive of
      disease progression and can help in treatment choices. It therefore seems essential to
      complement the knowledge of immune profiles with an understanding of the metabolic profiles
      of MDS patients, as well as the links between these profiles and changes associated with
      progression and/or treatment resistance, in order to consider new therapeutic pathways.

      Fresh samples from patients with MDS will be used to perform flow cytometry mapping of immune
      populations, T-cell and blast cell metabolism. Subsequently, a study of energy metabolism
      will be conducted using an extracellular flow analyzer and a sensitivity test for certain
      molecules targeting metabolic pathways. If possible, samples will be taken at different times
      during the course of treatment, according to the therapeutic protocols: diagnosis,
      progression/transformation, during azacitidine treatment.
