      Earlier studies suggested that the bismuth quadruple therapy may be effective when given
      twice-a-day rather than q.i.d. and that b.i.d. therapy was associated with fewer side
      effects. The addition of the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri (Gastrus®) to Lactobacillus
      reuteri (Gastrus®) that has been shown to increase the cure rates by 10-14%. In another study
      bismuth supplementation with L. reuteri DSM 17938, in a modified low dose quadruple therapy
      provided good eradication rates (93.3%; 95% CI : 85-99%) in clinical practice.
