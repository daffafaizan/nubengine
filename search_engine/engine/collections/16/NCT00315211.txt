      treated with at least 2 cycles of topotecan and docetaxel. The secondary objectives were to
      determine the feasibility and toxicities of this combination. The final secondary objective
      is overall survival for patients that received 2 or more cycles.

      Methods: Eligible pts with recurrent small cell lung cancer had to be at least 3 months from
      initial treatment. Pts received Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 IV followed by Topotecan 3 mg/m2 IV Days 1
      and 8 of a 21 day cycle. Disease assessment was done every 2 cycles. Toxicity was measured
      each cycle.
