      skeletal Class II and Class III jaw relations based on clinical and cephalometric values.
      Each group will be further divided according to their vertical skeletal pattern. Gingival
      biotype will be determined -using the probe transparency method- into either thick or thin
      biotype for all anterior teeth in both jaws. Width of keratinized gingiva will be measured
      from the muco-gingival junction to the free gingival margin in the middle of the crown of the
      maxillary and mandibular anterior teeth using a digital caliper with a sensitivity of 0.01
      mm. Statistical analysis will be applied to see the correlation between gingival biotypes ,
      width of keratinized gingiva , and abnormal skeletal jaw relations.
