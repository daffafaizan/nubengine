    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate overall response rate associated with sapanisertib (MLN0128 [TAK-228]) in
      patients with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs).

      SECONDARY ENDPOINTS:

      I. To evaluate progression-free survival (PFS) associated with MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients
      with advanced pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (PNETs).

      II. To measure the safety and tolerability of MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients with advanced
      PNETs.

      III. To evaluate disease control rate associated with MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients with
      advanced PNETs.

      IV. To measure duration of response rate associated with MLN0128 (TAK-228) in patients with
      advanced PNETs.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly for 2 years.
