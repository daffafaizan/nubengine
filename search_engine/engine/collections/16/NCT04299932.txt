      individual and economy of society. Current European Association of Urology (EAU) guideline on
      incontinence recommends to initiate treatment targeted at predominant component of MUI.
      However, as to whether the interventions for stress urinary incontinence (SUI) can be
      effectively generalized to stress-predominant MUI, there is still no powerful evidence to
      support it. It is necessary to seek for interventions specific to stress-predominant MUI.
      Results of previous studies indicated that acupuncture might help to relieve the incontinence
      symptoms.
