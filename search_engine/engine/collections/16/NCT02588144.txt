      [STN+SNr] stimulation by "interleaving stimulation" as compared to [standardSTN] after 3
      months on refractory freezing of gait (FOG). The Trial is designed as superiority study with
      an 80% power to detect a mean improvement of 4.7 points on the Freezing of Gait Assessment
      Course (Ziegler et al., 2010) with one-tailed P < 0.2. To this end 54 patients will be
      studied. After a common baseline assessment in [standardSTN], patients will be randomized to
      either [standardSTN] or [STN+SNr] in 1:1 ratio (27 per arm). The primary endpoint assessment
      is scheduled 90 days from baseline assessment (V6). Additional interim visits are scheduled
      for secondary purpose from baseline at day 2 (V2), day 8 (V3), day 21 (V4), day 42 (V5).

      The rationale for this study comes from our previous phase II trial (Weiss et al., 2013) in
      which we have observed an improvement of freezing of gait from combined STN+SNr stimulation
      as secondary endpoint compared with standard STN stimulation at three-week follow-up.

      Secondary outcome measures include anamnestic assessments on freezing of gait and falls,
      balance, quality of life, neuropsychiatric symptoms and suicidality.
