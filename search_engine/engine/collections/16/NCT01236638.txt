    
      The myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), most notably polycythemia vera (PV), essential
      thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) are a diverse but inter-related suite
      of clonal disorders of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells (Tefferi et al., 2008). The MPN
      share a range of biological, pathological, and clinical features including the relative
      overproduction of one or more cells of myeloid origin, growth factor independent colony
      formation in vitro, marrow hypercellularity, extramedullary hematopoiesis, spleno- and
      hepatomegaly, and thrombotic and/or hemorrhagic diatheses (Tefferi et al., 2005).

      This is a multi centre, open-label, extension study of the core study (CCL09101). The primary
      aims of the study will be to determine the long term safety and tolerability of
      orally-administered CYT387 when administered as a capsule dose, on a 28-day treatment cycle.

      Following completion of the core study (CCL09101), patients who have tolerated the drug and
      derived clinical benefit will continue to be treated with CYT387 administered orally.

      Subjects will be evaluated every three months for up to 24 cycles of CYT387 treatment.
      Subjects will return for a follow-up visit 30 days after completion of the last dose of study
      drug.
