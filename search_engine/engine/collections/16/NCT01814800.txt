      system resulting in greatly enhanced susceptibility to infectious disease, autoimmunity and
      malignancy. As most subjects with PIDDs present with infections, the differential diagnosis
      and initial investigations for an underlying immune defect are typically guided by the
      clinical presentation. In subjects with PIDDs, individual infections are not necessarily more
      severe than those that occur in a normal host. Rather, the clinical features suggestive of an
      immune defect may be the recurring and/or chronic nature of infections with common pathogens
      that may result in end organ damage, such as bronchiectasis. Several immune globulin products
      have already been approved by the FDA.
