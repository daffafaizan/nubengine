      treatment of chronic wounds in diabetic patients (PMID: 32633896). During that research
      patients reported improvement in peripheral sensation after treatment. Therefore, in order to
      investigate the influence of transcutaneous application of gaseous CO2 in peripheral diabetic
      neuropathy the investigators designed a randomised double blind research. 60 diabetic
      patients with peripheral diabetic neuropathy will be randomised in study and control group.
      Study group will receive 20 treatments with CO2 (each workday for 4 weeks). Lower part of the
      body is inserted into therapeutic wrap that is filled with 99.9% CO2 gas for 45 minutes. The
      same approach will be used in control group but in their case the therapeutic wrap will be
      filled with air. In both groups investigator will evaluate vibration sensation, monofilament
      test and temperature of the big toe before first and after 4 weeks of treatment. Patients as
      well as investigator (doctor) will be blind for the group belonging of the patients. The
      medical nurse performing all the therapies will randomise the patients using random number
      generator into study and control group. The nurse will be the only one knowing group
      belonging of the patients until the obtained results from both groups will be compared.
