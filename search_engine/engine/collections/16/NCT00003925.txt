        -  Determine the maximum tolerated doses of gemcitabine, fluorouracil-uracil (UFT), and
           leucovorin calcium in patients with advanced refractory cancer.

        -  Assess the toxicity of this combination regimen in this patient population.

        -  Evaluate this regimen in terms of response rate, response duration, and overall survival
           in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine and fluorouracil-uracil.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Patients receive oral
      leucovorin calcium immediately followed by oral fluorouracil-uracil (UFT) three times a day
      on days 1-21. Courses are repeated every 28 days. Treatment continues in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine and UFT until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study.
