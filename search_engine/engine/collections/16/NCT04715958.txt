    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To apply and evaluate a novel biomarker from 3-dimensional subharmonic aided pressure
      estimation (3D SHAPE) to predict neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) response in patients with
      breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess whether the accuracy of 3D SHAPE for predicting NAC response varies with breast
      cancer subtype.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with Definity (perflutren lipid
      microspheres) intravenously (IV) over 10-15 minutes before NAC, after 10% (1-2 cycles) of
      NAC, and after 30% (2-4 cycles) of NAC.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at the completion of NAC.
