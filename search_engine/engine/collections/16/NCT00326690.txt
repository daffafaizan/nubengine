      Reconstruction (LVR) performed with the Blue Egg device improves cardiopulmonary exercise
      capacity in subjects with stable New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart
      failure due to ischemic cardiomyopathy with an akinetic or dyskinetic anterior wall. This
      shall be accomplished by comparing changes in cardiopulmonary exercise between a group of
      subjects treated with LVR and optimal medical therapy (Treatment) to a group treated with
      optimal medical therapy alone (Control).

      Secondary objectives will examine the difference in heart failure symptoms between the two
      groups.

      The primary hypothesis is that the average change in peak oxygen consumption (MVO2) observed
      in the treatment group from baseline to 6 months post surgery date is at least 1.2 ml
      O2/min/kg greater than the average change observed in the control group in the same time
      frame.
