      ovarian cancer cells sequentially in tissue culture. We have demonstrated that CAI given for
      8 days followed by paclitaxel is reasonably well tolerated and that paclitaxel administration
      causes a dose-dependent increase in CAI plasma concentration. CAI is a cytostatic drug and
      continuous exposure is needed. This study will evaluate the combination of continuously
      administered CAI with three-weekly paclitaxel.
