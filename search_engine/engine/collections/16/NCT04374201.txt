      3-unit zirconia-based FDPs were fabricated. Patients included in the present clinical study
      met specific inclusion criteria and clinical procedures were standardized.

      Frameworks with a 9 mm2 cross section of the connectors and 0.6 mm minimum thickness of the
      retainers were made by means of Computer Aided Design/Computer Assisted Manufacturing. A
      resin cement was used to lute the restorations. The patients were recalled after 6 and 12
      months and then yearly up to a total follow-up of 14 years. The United States Public Health
      Service criteria were used in order to examine technical and esthetic outcomes. Success and
