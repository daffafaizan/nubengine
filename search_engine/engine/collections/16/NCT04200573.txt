    
      This is a multicenter, non-randomized, open label, parallel group, single dose, 2-part study
      being conducted in adult subjects with mild, moderate, or severe HI (Child-Pugh Class A, B,
      and C), and in matching healthy subjects. The healthy matching group will be comparable to
      the corresponding hepatic impairment groups by matching subjects by weight (±20% of group
      mean), age (±10 years of group mean), and sex (equal ratios across groups).

      The study will be conducted in two sequential parts:

      In Part A, following a 28-day screening period, 6 subjects each with mild or moderate HI and
      6 matching healthy subjects who meet eligibility criteria will be enrolled and administered a
      single Dose A (Day 1).

      In Part B, following a 28-day screening period, 6 subjects with severe hepatic impairment
      will receive a single Dose A (Day 1). Furthermore, the Sponsor may choose to enroll up to 6
      additional healthy subjects in Part B to ensure matching of subjects across all groups for
      weight, age, and sex is maintained.
