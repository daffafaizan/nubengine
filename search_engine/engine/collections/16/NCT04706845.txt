    
      This is a comprehensive, cross-sectional study conducted with approximately 40-60 individuals
      affected by ACC who may know the results of molecular profiling of their tumor.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To identify the specific burdens faced by patients with ACC

        -  To compare/contrast the burdens faced by patients with ACC at different disease stages
           (no evident disease, metastatic disease/watchful waiting, progressive disease)

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess QoL implication in patients living with ACC (Adenoid Cystic Carcinoma)

        -  To compare the burdens and QoL impacts in people living with ACC, with their tumors
           bearing Notch mutations or Notch Wild Type due to:

             -  Rate of disease progression

             -  Location of Metastases
