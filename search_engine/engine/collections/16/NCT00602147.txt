        -  To determine whether single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that encode the
           melphalan transporters are associated with the development and/or severity of mucositis
           in patients with multiple myeloma receiving high-dose melphalan.

        -  To determine whether SNPs in genes that influence melphalan metabolism are associated
           with the development and/or severity of mucositis in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Blood or mouthwash samples are collected and DNA isolated from these specimens is analyzed
      for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in LAT1 or other candidate genes. Public databases
      (i.e., dbSNP and HapMap) are reviewed to select representative SNPs for genotype analysis.
