      per day) and the intensive insulin therapy (3~4 injections per day). The kinetics of
      exogenous insulin in the intensive insulin therapy imitate the kinetics of insulin secretion
      in a healthy person. A previous large clinical study (e.g. DCCT, Kumamoto study, etc.)
      suggested that intensive insulin therapy prevented microangiopathy and macroangiopathy, and
      inhibited progression of them, however many patients chose conventional insulin therapy
      because many hoped that they injected insulin as few as possible. The patients thought that
      their life styles were disturbed by many times of insulin injection.

      The current dual-acting insulin made from insulin as part modified by protamine is able to
      suppress postprandial hyperglycemia. The new insulin may possibly have the kinetics of
      insulin in the patient who uses insulin as the intensive insulin therapy. Moreover, the
      patients will receive the insulin therapy easily if the times of insulin injection are fewer.
      It may lead to perform the more effective insulin therapy to search for the optimal insulin
      therapy in induction in type 2 diabetes.
