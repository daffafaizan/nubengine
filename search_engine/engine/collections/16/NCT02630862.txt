      study is to analyze if dipyridamole retains the antioxidant in vivo in man.

      The investigators identified a clinical setting where dipyridamole is approved for clinical
      use, i.e. secondary prevention of stroke, to test the hypothesis that dipyridamole given
      orally could affect circulating markers of oxidative stress, in particular reduction in
      oxysterols (autoxidation products of cholesterol) and increase in vitamin E concentration.

      Methods. Two arms are included in the study: a) dipyridamole plus aspirin (in Italy the use
      of dipyridamole is approved in combination with aspirin); b) aspirin alone as comparison arm.
      Patients eligible for endoarterectomy for the presence of carotid stenosis >= 70% are
      randomized in the two arms. The study is open labeled for the patient and clinical
      investigators who have in charge the patinets . The study is blinded for the technicians
      performing biomarker assessment and investigators responsible for data analysis.

      Blood is taken at baseline (before surgery) and after six months of treatment. Oxysterol
      profiling and vitamin E are measured by isotope dilution gas chromatography and mass
      spectrometry.
