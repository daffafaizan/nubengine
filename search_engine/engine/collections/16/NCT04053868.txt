    
      The goal of this study is to better understand the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics
      responses produced by the JUUL e-cigarette, compared to tobacco cigarettes, in e-cigarette
      and tobacco cigarette smokers.

      Specific Aim #1- To categorize the nicotine pharmacokinetic (PK) profile (maximum plasma
      concentration; time to maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration-time
      curve) and compare when using the JUUL e-cigarette vs. a tobacco cigarette in a standardized
      manner.

      Specific Aim #2- To categorize the nicotine PK profile (maximum plasma concentration; time to
      maximum plasma concentration and area under the concentration-time curve(AUC)) and compare
      when using the JUUL e-cigarette vs a tobacco cigarette when using the product ad libitum.

      Specific Aim #3- To evaluate various outcomes following JUUL e-cigarette or tobacco cigarette
      use, both with standardized and ad lib use including: heart rate, plasma catecholamines,
      pulmonary function testing.

      Specific Aim #4- To evaluate and compare the effects on craving, reward and satisfaction when
      using the JUUL e-cigarette vs. tobacco cigarette.
