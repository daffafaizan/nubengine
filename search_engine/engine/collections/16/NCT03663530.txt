      influences health markers. The goal of the proposed study is to determine whether eating out
      of synchrony with sleep influences risk of chronic diseases. The proposed study has both
      mechanistic and translational objectives. First, the investigators will test whether eating
      late in the day will influence energy balance (hormones, energy expenditure, nutritional
      intakes). Next, they will observe how misaligned meals, relative to aligned meals, influence
      behavior. Overweight men and women will be recruited to participate in a 2-phase, crossover
      study, with constant sleep periods. Phases will only differ in the alignment of meals to the
      sleep period: aligned = meals starting 1 h after awakening; misaligned = meals starting 5 h
      after awakening. Mechanistic aims will be addressed from measurements taken after 3 and 14 d
      of the intervention. The translational aim will be addressed after a 4 wk free-living period
      following the prescribed meal times for each phase. This proposed study, which will
      manipulate meal timing, without affecting total sleep time, is important because it will
      provide information on the mechanism by which circadian misalignment influences health. As
      such, the proposed study will be a stepping-stone in the establishment of lifestyle
      recommendations or therapies to personalize chronotype to reduce the risk of chronic
      diseases.
