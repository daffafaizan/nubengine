      in the Stupp protocol. In this proposal, the dose of TMZ is the same, with the sole
      difference that TMZ will be given in a neo-adjuvant setting for two weeks and then continued
      at the same dose concurrently with the accelerated hypofractionated EBRT delivering 60Gy in 4
      weeks. The adjuvant component of TMZ remains unchanged from current standard practice.
