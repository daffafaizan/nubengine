    
      This study is a randomized (study drug assigned by chance), multicenter (when more than 1
      hospital or medical school team work on a medical research study), active-controlled,
      parallel group (each group of participants will be treated at the same time), double-blind
      (neither physician nor participant knows the treatment that the participant receives) study.
      The duration of the treatment will be 2 days and will be conducted in 4 periods: screening
      period (from 33 to 2 days before study drug administration to the first surgical incision),
      surgical period (to 1 day before study drug administration), qualification period (1 day) and
      double-blind treatment period (1 to 2 days). Participants will be randomly assigned to 2
      groups: study drug treatment group (ER) and comparator treatment group (IR). Participants
      will be administered 2 tablets of ER tramadol HCl (75 milligram [mg])/acetaminophen (650 mg)
      along with 2 tablets of placebo matching to IR tramadol HCl/acetaminophen in study drug
      treatment group; and 2 tablets of IR tramadol HCl (37.5 mg)/acetaminophen (325 mg) along with
      2 tablets of placebo matching to ER tramadol HCl/acetaminophen in comparator treatment group
      respectively at 0, 12, 24 and 36 hours. Participants will also be administered 2 tablets of
      placebo matching to IR tramadol HCl/acetaminophen in study drug treatment group; and 2
      tablets of IR tramadol HCl/acetaminophen in comparator treatment group respectively at 6, 18,
      30 and 42 hours. Participants will be administered investigational product at 6-hour interval
      from the time of the first investigational product administration over 48 hours. Efficacy
      will be assessed using 11-point numeric rating scale (NRS). Participants' safety will be
      monitored throughout the study.
