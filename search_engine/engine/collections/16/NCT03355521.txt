      remarkable features in Parkinson's disease (PD). Such changes are disabling for the
      performance of daily living activities (DLAs) as they represent a high risk of falls and
      impair quality of life (QL) in this population. Although exercise is recommended as an
      effective model of therapeutic intervention, to minimize the symptoms of this disease, little
      is known about the effects of Nordic walking on motor and non-motor symptoms in patients with
      PD. Purpose: The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of a Nordic and
      free walking training program on clinical, functional and biomechanical parameters of gait,
      in people with PD. Experimental Design: Randomized controlled clinical trial (RCT). Study
      Site: Physical Education School of the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul and the
      Clinical Hospital of Porto Alegre, in Porto Alegre, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Methods: The
      sample comprised 33 participants, aged above 50 years, of both sexes, with a clinical
      diagnosis of idiopathic PD, with the staging of 1-4 in the Hoehn and Yahr scale (H&Y). The
      participants received two types of intervention: Nordic walking training program (NW, n = 16)
      and free walking training program (FW, n = 17), during six weeks. Aiming to evaluate the
      effects of the training program, the participants underwent the tests in the following
      period: pre-training + pre-familiarization (T1); post-familiarization + pre-training (T2);
      post-training (T3).
