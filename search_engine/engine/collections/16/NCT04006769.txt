      the treatment of tyrosine kinase inhibitor(TKI) including Imatinib and Sunitinib.

      Entacapone and imatinib can each inhibit the role of v-kit Hardy-Zuckerman 4 feline sarcoma
      viral oncogene homolog(KIT) which is a kind of transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase
      promoting the clonal proliferation and growth of GIST cells, but they do so by different
      mechanisms.

      Entacapone has been approved from China Food and Drug Administration(cFDA) for controlling
      the symptom of Parkinson' s disease in the combination with levodopa. Recently, entacapone
      was identified to be an inhibitor of Fat mass and obesity-associated protein(FTO) enzyme,
      which was reported as the first N6-methyladenosine (m6A) demethylase of eukaryotic messenger
      RNA(mRNA). Entacapone can inhibit the transcriptional level of KIT mRNA leading to the
      decreased expression of KIT protein.

      Imatinib mesylate, an oral multiple TKI targeting the KIT-oncoprotein, was the standard
      first-line therapy of c-KIT-mutated GISTs. Imatinib can prohibit the activation of mutated
      c-KIT tyrosine kinase and then impede the kinase cascade of c-KIT signal pathway.
