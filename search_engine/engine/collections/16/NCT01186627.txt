      specifications slightly changed the Apgars' perspective, but did not alter the number of its
      components. The specified Apgar should therefore be easily applicable to every delivery room
      around the world. As a result of these specifications, the Apgar score will not express the
      efforts of the infant but describe its condition, independently of the requirements needed to
      achieve this condition. The advantage of the proposed definitions is the applicability in all
      infants, regardless of resuscitative efforts or gestational age.

      To validate the accuracy of the specified version to predict neonatal mortality and long term
      neurological outcome in preterm infants the present prospective, observational study is
      planned. The study will test the hypothesis that the specified APGAR-score predicts mortality
      and morbidity better at 2 years of age than the conventional Apgar-score. Furthermore, the
      predictive reliability of the specified Apgar can be improved in combination with perinatal
      data respectively with the expanded Apgar version of the AAP/ACOG.

      The primary outcome "condition at 2 years of age" is composed of death and a major
      neurological deficit. In this case "neurological deficit" is defined by the presence of one
      of the followings characteristics: index of mental development (Bayley Scale II) <85,
      blindness, deafness, cerebral palsy.
