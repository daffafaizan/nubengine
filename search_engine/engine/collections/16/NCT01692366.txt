      eligibility (screening period 28 days), followed by a treatment period of at least 1 cycle
      (28 days) of study treatment, and an end-of-treatment visit at least 30 days following the
      last administration of study drug. However, treatment may continue if patients are deriving
      benefit and do not have unacceptable toxicity or meet study withdrawal criteria.
