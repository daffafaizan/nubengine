      up from a chair, (2) walk up stairs, (3) walk down stairs, (4) level walking, and (5) a deep
      knee bend. Subjects will be video recorded from the waist down while performing the
      activities. The speed level of each trial will be based on the comfort level of the patient.
      The fluoroscopic images will be stored digitally for subsequent analysis on secure servers
      and workstations at the University of Tennessee.
