      burden, anxiety and depression among family members. Both pre- and post-injury family
      functioning have been linked to child outcomes, suggesting that improvements in family
      adaptation may result in fewer social and behavioral sequelae in the injured child. Despite
      this evidence, the development and evaluation of family interventions following TBI are
      extremely rare.

      Children with TBI are often treated at urban trauma centers then discharged to distant home
      communities where psychosocial follow-up is limited and/or difficult to access. Increasingly,
      the World Wide Web is being used to meet the mental and other health needs of individuals who
      have difficulty accessing care through traditional routes. Given the lack of specialized care
      and follow-up for TBI in many communities, the Web may provide an invaluable tool for linking
      families with state-of-the-art psychosocial care by reducing potential physical and
      psychological barriers (e.g., distance, stigma).

      Building on previous intervention research of the PI, this study targets the adolescent
      population between the ages of 12-18. By identifying the unique concerns and issues of this
      population following brain injury, Teen Online Problem Solving seeks to improve family and
      teen adaptation, thereby reducing social and behavioral sequelae.
