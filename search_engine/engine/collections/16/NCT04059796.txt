      an approved monofocal or Toric intraocular lens. Fellow eyes will receive an approved
      monofocal or Toric IOL (no Omega capsule).

      Eyes randomized to receive one of the Gemini capsules (both models) will be eligible to have
      a secondary procedure (post 1-month postoperative visit) to correct refractive error.
