      mainly related to the reflux of stomach content induced by the dysfunction of lower
      esophageal sphincter. The common symptoms of GERD are heartburn, acid regurgitation, and
      chest pain. The methods to treat GERD are changes of lifestyle, pharmacotherapy, antireflux
      surgery and endoscopy. However, the poor response to medicine was still noticed in patients
      with non-erosive reflux disease. And long-term use of medicine will result in many side
      effects including infectious, abdominal pain, diarrhea and osteoporosis. According to the
      theory of traditional Chinese medicine, acupuncture Neiguan (P6 point) could improve the
      uncomfortable symptoms of the chest and upper abdomen. Therefore, the aim of this study is to
      investigate the clinical efficacy of Neiguan (P6 point) acupressure in patients with GERD. 64
      patients with GERD were randomly divided into two groupsï¼šthe acupressure and control. In the
      acupressure group, in addition to receiving standard treatment, patients will band a hand
      ring over Neiguan (P6 point) and acupressure for seven days. In the control group, in
      addition to receiving standard treatment, patients will band a hand ring but no acupressure
      for seven days. Data was collected by self-recorded symptoms before and after the
      intervention, according to the Reflux disease questionnaire(RDQ) and the World Health
      Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire Taiwan condensed version. Data was analyzed by
      Student's t-tests, Paired Student's t-test, Chi-square, and Fisher exact tests for
      quantitative and qualitative variables. We anticipate the treatment of Neiguan (P6 point)
      acupressure will reduce the symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux and improve the quality of
      life.
