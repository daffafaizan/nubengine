      considered for a switch, combination or augmentation of treatment. Traditional augmentation
      agents, lithium, triiodothyronine (T3), buspirone, dopamine agonists, and stimulants have
      been commonly used for this patient population with limited supporting data. Recently,
      augmentation of atypical antipsychotics with antidepressant therapy has become a more
      commonly accepted treatment practice. This strategy has proven to be useful for enhancement
      of antidepressant effect, showing increased remission rates and early treatment effects on
      core depressive symptoms, and comorbid symptoms as well as antidepressant- mediated side
      effects (e.g., sexual dysfunction). Although, we have some limited treatment options to treat
      such patients as described above, it is not clear which treatment option would be best or
      acceptable for those patients in clinical practice yet.

      Among above augmentation agents, aripiprazole is the first drug approved by U.S. FDA. as an
      augmentation therapy to antidepressants in the treatment of patients with MDD showing
      imminent efficacy and reliable safety profile through adequately-powered well-designed
      controlled clinical trials.
