      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of successively higher doses of verteporfin
      (Visudyne [liposomal verteporfin]) and determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) in study
      participants with recurrent EGFR positive (+) glioblastoma (GBM). (Phase I) II. To evaluate
      the anti-tumor activity of Visudyne by assessing progression-free survival (PFS) and overall
      survival (OS). (Phase II) III. To describe the response rate of EGFR+ GBM in study
      participants treated with Visudyne. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of Visudyne by assessing progression-free survival
      (PFS) and overall survival (OS). (Phase I) II. To describe the response rate of EGFR+ GBM in
      study participants treated with Visudyne. (Phase I) III. To describe pharmacokinetics of
      Visudyne administered on a weekly schedule. (Phase I) IV. To evaluate the safety and
      tolerability of successively higher doses of Visudyne in study participants with recurrent
      EGFR+ GBM. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive verteporfin intravenously (IV) over 83 minutes weekly for 6 weeks in cycle
      1, then weekly for 5 weeks in subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 6 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 12
      weeks.
