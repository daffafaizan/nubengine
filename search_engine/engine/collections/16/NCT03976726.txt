      supraglottic airway device. In contrast to other devices its' cuff consists of a
      thermoplastic elastomer (styrene-ethylene-butadine-styrene) instead of an inflatable cuff.

      Previous studies have shown, that over time the sealing improved compared to the moment of
      insertion. The sealing process may be based on various mechanisms. It is assumed, that the
      warming from room to body temperature leads to an improved adaptation to the patient-specific
      anatomy due to a softening of the elastomer. By definition, an elastomer is softened by the
      effect of temperature and become harder when reaching the glass transition temperature.

      In this context, Dingley et al. described a change in the degree of hardness as a function of
      temperature. Prewarmed i-gel® masks (42°C, 30min.) seem to have smaller leak volumes compared
      to masks stored at room temperature postinsertion in paralyzed patients, but was not
      reproducible in non-paralyzed patients. Looking at the sealing pressure Chauhan et al.
      reported that i-gel® masks required a lower pressure compared to masks with an inflatable
      cuff.

      At this point it is not yet clear, whether the thermoplastic cuff material only expands due
      to an increase in temperature. Liquid absorption and a consecutive expansion is also
      theoretically conceivable.

      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to examine the i-gel® mask within the scope of a
      benchtop study for temperature-dependent volume expansion and liquid absorption.
