      the efficacy of standard therapy alone. The goal is identify improved treatment regimens for
      subsets on the basis of molecular characteristics (biomarker signatures) of their disease. As
      described for previous adaptive trials, regimens that show a high Bayesian predictive
      probability of being more effective than standard therapy will graduate from the trial with
      their corresponding biomarker signature(s). Regimens will be dropped if they show a low
      probability of improved efficacy with any biomarker signature. New drugs will enter as those
      that have undergone testing complete their evaluation.
