        -  Compare weight-gain effects of creatine vs placebo in patients with cancer-associated
           weight loss and/or anorexia.

        -  Determine the effect of these regimens on quality of life in these patients.

        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare survival rates of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Patients are
      stratified according to primary cancer type (lung vs gastrointestinal vs other), weight loss
      severity (< 10 lbs vs ≥10 lbs), age (< 50 years vs ≥ 50 years), planned concurrent
      chemotherapy (yes vs no), gender, and prognosis. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral creatine daily.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo daily. In both arms, treatment continues in the
           absence of unacceptable toxicity as long as treatment is considered beneficial.

      Patients are followed every 6 months for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients will be accrued for this study.
