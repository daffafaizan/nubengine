      procedures. Prospective patients were screened to determine if they qualified for the study
      within 28 days of enrollment. Patients who qualified received TRC105 i.v. over 1 to 4 hours
      on Day 1, Day 4, Day 8 and Day 15 of the initial 21-day cycle and Day 1, Day 8 and Day 15 of
      every subsequent 21-day cycle in combination with 1000 mg/m2 capecitabine BID for 14 days of
      each 21-day cycle. Those who tolerated TRC105 without any infusion reactions were eligible
      for reduced infusion durations. After 3 cycles of treatment, patients who demonstrated a
      response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) were
      eligible for additional treatment for up to six months (9 total cycles). Upon discussion with
      TRACON, patients judged by the Principal Investigator to be benefiting from treatment were
      able to continue treatment on this protocol beyond six months.

      Toxicities were graded according to the NCI CTCAE Version 4.0. Patients who exited the study
      for reasons other than drug-related toxicity prior to completion of the first 21-day cycle
      were replaced. Intra-patient dose escalation was not allowed.
