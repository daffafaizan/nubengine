      angiography study and intervention (n=300) with different disease entity such as
      atherosclerosis, tumor, aneurysm, arteriovenous malformation or fistula, and other vascular
      disorders. A period of about 20 seconds of the carotid phonoangiography was recorded.

      Standard for comparison: catheter angiography, CTA, MRI/MRA. The degree of stenosis, the wall
      thickness, SI and density change was clustered and compared. The clinical and laboratory data
      will be reviewed and the vascular risk factors will be calculated.

      Spectrum analysis: The sound spectrum will be analysis with the FFT, wavelet, entropy,
      complexity, and HHT algorithms.

      The correlation between change of spectrums and also the correlated clinical, images, and
      laboratory change will be further analysis by statistic method.
