      between groups at 6 months after the total knee arthroplasty.

      The investigators hypothesized that the clinical outcomes of rehabilitation by interactive
      home-based device are not inferior than that by conventional inpatient setting.

      The study design is a single-blind non-randomized controlled trial. Patients takes different
      rehabilitation method but the outcome assessor is blinded. The clinical outcome is compared
      at preoperative, postoperative 6weeks, 3months. And clinical outcome consists of Range of
      Motion (ROM), WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster University Arthritis Index ) score, Knee
      Society Score, Time-up-go (TUG) test.
