      Although they have few side effects, many patients report muscle pain, cramps, and weakness
      when using these drugs. We know very little on the real impact of these muscle symptoms on
      patient quality of life, especially in relation to muscle strength and endurance.

      Patients under statin therapy will stop medication for 2 months. Results from blood sample,
      muscle function and muscle biopsy (in some participants) will be compared with baseline.
      Participants will then take vitamin D supplementation or placebo for one month. Thereafter,
      statin will be reintroduced for two months while continuing vitamin D or placebo
      supplementation. At the end of that time, measures from blood sample, muscle function and
      muscle biopsy will be compared with other visits.
