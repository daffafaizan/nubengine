      temozolomide. Allowing for assessment of tumor therapy prior to treatment completion is
      important to select patients most likely to benefit from alternative treatment option.
      Multimodal advanced MR imaging- contrast-enhanced T1 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted
      imaging, chemical exchange saturation transfer imaging, and perfusion imaging on 3T enables
      quantitative assessment of treatment response. Quantifying changes in advanced MR imaging
      techniques would allow predict outcome for early and long-term treatment response and
      survival in glioblastomas.
