    
      This is a 3-part, single-center study of single and multiple ascending doses of CORT125329 in
      healthy participants.

      Part 1 will be a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessment of single ascending
      doses (SAD) of CORT125329 lipid capsule formulations. Participants will be enrolled
      sequentially into 1 of up to 8 cohorts, each containing 8 participants.

      Part 2 will be double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled assessments of multiple oral
      ascending doses (MAD) of CORT125329 lipid capsule formulations. Participants will be enrolled
      sequentially into 1 of up to 4 cohorts, each containing 8 participants.

      Optional Part 3 will be an open-label, 2-way fixed sequence cross-over study and will serve
      as proof of PD (glucocorticoid receptor modulation) for CORT125329 lipid capsule
      formulations. Participants will be enrolled in a single cohort of 10 participants.

      Throughout the study, routine safety tests will be performed. In selected parts of the study,
      assessments of PK (CORT125329), changes in serum cortisol and plasma adrenocorticotrophic
      hormone (ACTH), and changes in hematological and bone biomarkers will be measured.
