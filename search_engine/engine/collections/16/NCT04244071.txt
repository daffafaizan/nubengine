      temperature 1 h prior to anesthesia and up to 24 h following anesthesia is a common problem
      in patients undergoing surgery. Perioperative hypothermia leads to many problems.

      Given the negative effects of increased anxiety and deterioration in thermal comfort due to
      perioperative hypothermia (such as decreased satisfaction and increased pain) hypothermia
      poses a problem that should be highlighted and prevented. It is also important for nurses to
      understand hypothermia and the complications associated with it and take effective measures.
      In the present randomized controlled trials, gowns blowing warm air; heated blankets,
      fabrics, and liquid; and self-heating blankets were used for increasing thermal comfort. No
      common heating technique or heating area was used in these studies In this context, the
      primary purpose of the present study was to determine the effects of active (gown blowing
      warm air) and passive (heated blanket) heating on thermal comfort and anxiety in preoperative
      and postoperative periods in patients scheduled for open abdominal surgery.
