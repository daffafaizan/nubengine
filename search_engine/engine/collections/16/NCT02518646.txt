      prevention. A prediction model facilitates the identification of those patients at risk for
      delirium and therefore need prevention the most. At present, two ICU delirium prediction
      models are available. First the PRE-DELIRIC model was developed. This recently recalibrated
      model reliably predicts ICU patients' risk for delirium within 24 hours after ICU admission.
      Because a relevant number of patients develops delirium during the first 24 hours after ICU
      admission, and prevention ideally should be deployed as soon as possible, the investigators
      developed the 'early prediction model' (E-PRE-DELIRIC) which reliably predicts delirium
      immediately after ICU admission. To implement a delirium prediction model in clinical
      practice, one needs to know which model best can be used. Currently, the use of a delirium
      prediction model is not implemented as standard in clinical practice, as this information is
      unavailable. Therefore the main aim of this study is to compare the (predictive and clinical)
      performance of the PRE-DELIRIC model and the E-PRE-DELRIC model.
