           symptoms, dull ache in left chest and abdominal pain Cardiac tamponade is recognized by
           the excessive fall of systolic blood pressure

        -  Diagnostic workup A) Chest X-ray:_ chest X-ray can detect varying degree of
           cardiomegaly. B) Echocardiography: It is the first-line imaging test. clinically,
           two-dimensional echocardiography with Doppler provides the most cost-effective way of
           diagnosing C) Electrocardiograph D) cardiac computerized tomography :- Also may be
           helpful 4)Therapy of pericarditis in pediatrics the medical lines of treatment of
           pericarditis are:_ A)Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory:_ are the mainstay of
           the therapy of inflammatory pericardial diseases B)Steroids: a minority of patients will
           require treatment with systemic steroid therapy as

             -  Patients with symptoms refractory to standard therapy

                  -  Acute pericarditis due to connective tissue disease ●Uremic pericarditis
                     C)Immunosuppressant and biological drugs (more commonly used in recurrent
                     pericarditis) .Interventional therapeutic techniques-_

      Most patients with acute pericarditis can be managed effectively with medical therapy alone.
      However, patients may require invasive therapies for:

        -  A moderate to large pericardial effusion, particularly if hemodynamically significant.

        -  Frequent, highly symptomatic recurrences of acute pericarditis with pericardial effusion
           ●Evidence of constrictive pericarditis (a late occurrence when present) A)Pericardial
           drainage :Prolonged catheter drainage of a pericardial effusion is an effective means of
           preventing fluid reaccumulation.

      B)Pericardiotomy, pericardial window and pericardiectomy: pericardiectomy may be considered
      for frequent and highly symptomatic recurrences of pericarditis tamponade .. C)Surgical
      decompression of the pericardium :_can be achieved either by conventional heart surgery or
      video-assisted thoracoscopy.
