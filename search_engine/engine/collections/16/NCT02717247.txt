      modulation of the electrical activity of the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
      (DLPFC) by tRNS is able to act on the phenomenon of craving in other addictions. This allows
      us to make the assumption that tRNS stimulation could constitute a treatment for food
      addiction especially in obesity.
