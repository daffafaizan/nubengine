    
      Eighty-one participants with glaucoma after ocular surgery or secondary glaucoma with
      persistent and uncontrolled IOP > 21 mmHg were randomized for placement of Baerveldt implant
      or Ahmed implant models using a standardized surgical technique.

      The primary outcome was failure, which was defined as IOP >16 mmHg with glaucoma medication
      on 2 consecutive study visits. Secondary outcomes were IOP, medication use, visual acuity,
      complications, and interventions.
