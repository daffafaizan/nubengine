      psoralen and ultraviolet A given with peripheral stem cell transplantation in patients with
      hematologic malignancies or bone marrow failure myelodysplastic syndrome. II. Assess the
      toxicity of this treatment in these patients. III. Evaluate this regimen in terms of
      prevention of graft versus host disease and control of malignancy in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of T-cells photochemically treated with
      psoralen and ultraviolet A. Patients receive thiotepa IV over 2 hours on day 1,
      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days 2 and 3, and whole body radiotherapy on days 5-8.
      Patients undergo preserved stem cell or bone marrow allogeneic transplant plus psoralen
      treated T-cell allogeneic transplant on day 9. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating
      doses of photochemically treated T-cells until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 patients
      experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed for 100 days.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 37 patients will be accrued for this study.
