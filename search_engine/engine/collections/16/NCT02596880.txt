      tolerate interferon, the previous standard of treatment. The new direct acting antivirals
      have provided these patients with a new hope. One such combination is sofosbuvir (SOF) 400 mg
      and daclatasvir (DCV) 60 mg given once daily with or without weight-based ribavirin (RBV) for
      12 or 24 weeks. The current recommendation for cirrhotics is SOF/DCV/RBV for 24 weeks but
      that recommendation is based on the lack of data for shorter periods. In order to evaluate
      the response rate to the combination of SOF/DCV/RBV the investigators decided to treat 100
      HCV cirrhotics with this combination for 12 weeks. Subjects include genotype 1 and 3
      patients, the prevalent genotypes in Iran. Patients with Model for End stage Liver Disease
      (MELD) > 20 are excluded. The investigators will calculate the sustained viral response rate
      at 12 weeks (SVR12).
