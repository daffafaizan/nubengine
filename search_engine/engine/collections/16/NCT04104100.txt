      department of a medical center for urodynamic evaluation were reviewed. Nocturnal polyuria
      was defined when the proportion of night-time voided volume over 24-hour voided volume was
      greater than 33% for â‰¥65 year-old women, and when the proportion of night-time voided volume
      over 24-hour voided volume was greater than 20% for <65 year-old women. Backward stepwise
      multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed using all statistical variables in
      the univariate logistic regression analysis. P < 0.05 was considered as statistical
      significant.
