      ovulation (releasing an egg) is one of the most common causes of female infertility. The
      frequency and timing of intercourse is important because the best chance of pregnancy occurs
      around the time of ovulation. The days that pregnancy is most likely to occur with
      intercourse is referred to as the "fertile window".

      The fertile window lasts for 6 days. It starts 4 days before ovulation and continues through
      the day after ovulation. Intercourse on the day of ovulation gives the highest chance of
      getting pregnant. However, intercourse up to 4 days before ovulation can still result in
      pregnancy because sperm can survive for up to 6 days in the reproductive tract of a woman.

      Urinary testing for the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge is the most common method for
      predicting ovulation. The LH surge precedes ovulation by about 36 hours. When LH is detected,
      this gives a couple only 2 days to have intercourse that may result in fertilization.

      The OV-Watch is an FDA approved device that has been shown to predict ovulation 5 days in
      advance for women who ovulate regularly. This wristwatch-like device is worn daily to detects
      changes in sweat ions. The device allows for earlier detection of the fertile window, giving
      the couple more opportunities to conceive.

      For women who do not ovulate on their own or ovulate irregularly, medication can be taken to
      help make eggs and ovulate. Clomiphene citrate is the most commonly used medication for this.
      We plan to study the effectiveness of the OV-Watch in women who are undergoing ovulation
      induction with clomiphene citrate and will compare the results to standard urinary LH
      testing.
