      morbidity and health care costs. Management of asthma is focused towards reducing airway
      inflammation through a combination of avoidance of inciting and triggering pro-inflammatory
      agents as well as anti-inflammatory medication. Corticosteroids and anti-leukotrienes are
      efficacious, but are neither universally effective nor free of side effects. Statins, which
      are currently widely prescribed and used safely to improve serum lipids and cholesterol, have
      anti-inflammatory properties which may be clinically useful in asthma either in addition to
      or perhaps instead of corticosteroids.

      The objective of this research proposal is to conduct a randomized placebo controlled trial
      of 4 weeks statin therapy in patients in moderate to severe but stable asthma. We hypothesize
      that statins may directly reduce airway inflammation and/or contribute to the
      anti-inflammatory effects of corticosteroid treatment in these patients. We will measure the
      effects of statins by measuring airway sensitivity to methacholine, pulmonary function,
      sputum eosinophils, and quality of life in subjects with asthma after 4 weeks of treatment.
      Statins may become an alternative treatment option or act as steroid sparing agents in
      patients with asthma.
