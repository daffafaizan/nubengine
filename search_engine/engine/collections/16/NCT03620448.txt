      mechanical ventilation but these are of limited availability in developing countries.

      bCPAP is generated by exhalation against a constant opening pressure that produces positive
      end-expiratory pressure. This in-turn helps in maintaining lung volume at the end of
      expiration, preventing atelectasis, improving oxygenation, reducing respiratory fatigue and
      eventually preventing respiratory failure. bCPAP (Rice 360â—¦c low cost bCPAP device)
      consisting of 3 components: : (i)An air compressor connected to an oxygen concentrator with a
      gas flow fate of 3-4 L/min; (ii) A nasal interface (short nasal prongs) connecting the baby's
      airway to a two limb circuit i.e the inspiratory limb connected to the bCPAP machine and the
      expiratory limb connected to the water bottle and; (iii) An expiratory limb with the distal
      end submerged 6 cm in water to generate an end expiratory pressure

      At the neonatal unit at Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Center (KCMC), the standard of care for
      Preterm babies with RDS is receiving oxygen therapy via nasal prongs from oxygen cylinders.
