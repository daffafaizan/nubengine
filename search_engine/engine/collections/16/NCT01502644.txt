    
      The level of high, moderate or low NA was determined based on the participant's score on the
      Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The HADS is a self-reported questionnaire that
      has 14 questions related to 2 domains: Anxiety subscale (7 questions) and Depression subscale
      (7 questions). Each item on the questionnaire is scored from 0 (least amount of
      anxiety/depression) to 3 (greatest amount of anxiety/depression), with total score between 0
      and 21 for either anxiety or depression. Participants were assigned to high, moderate or low
      NA groups using the following HADS score criteria:

        -  High NA = HADS score ≥9 on each subscale

        -  Moderate NA = HADS score ≥6 to ≤8 on each subscale

        -  Low NA = HADS score ≤5 on each subscale
