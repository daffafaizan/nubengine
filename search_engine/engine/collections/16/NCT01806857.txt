      affecting the limbs, tongue, respiratory and pharyngeal muscles. Symptomatic treatments such
      as the placement of a feeding tube, can compensate for the inability to swallow. Riluzole,
      the only approved treatment for ALS, may slow disease progression but no treatment is
      curative and none have improved function.

      Unexpectedly, Nuedexta®, approved for the treatment of labile emotionality that occurs in
      association with ALS and other neurological disorders, has been observed to improve bulbar
      function, primarily speech and swallowing, in a number of neurological disorders, including
      ALS. The basis for this is conjectural but likely due to a direct effect of the drug on motor
      neurons in the part of the brain that controls speech and swallowing. The same part of the
      brain appears to modulate the expression of emotions and interestingly the site of action of
      the drug is the same as a site that has been implicated in a juvenile form of ALS.

      This is a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo controlled, cross over study
      evaluating the palliative effect of Nuedexta® on bulbar dysfunction. It is expected that
      approximately 60 ALS patients from 7 clinical centers in the US will be enrolled.
