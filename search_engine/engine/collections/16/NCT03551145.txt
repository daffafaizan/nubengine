      the soft tissue substitutes in comparison to the autologous connective tissue graft for the
      augmentation of the keratinized mucosa and gain of hygienic access to the implants with
      infectious pathology and with minimum or absent keratinized mucosa.

      Therefore, the aim of the study is to evaluate the change of clinical parameters of
      peri-implant health and the patient perception of the procedure for augmentation of the
      keratinized tissues around dental implants with peri-implantitis.

      The hypothesis is that collagen matrix of porcine origin is associated with lower patient
      morbidity, in comparison with autologous connective-tissue graft, when used for the
      augmentation of the keratinized tissues around endosseous dental implants with infectious
      pathology and with minimum or absent KT mucosa.

      A sample 48 patients will be recruited basing upon the diagnosis of peri-implantitis and
      absent or insufficient peri- implant mucosa. 1 month after the non-surgical treatment,
      surgical procedure will be performed.

      Peri-implant clinical and radiographic parameters, as well as patient perception of the
      therapy provided, will be evaluated before and at various stages (up to 52 weeks) after the
      surgical intervention. Also, change of vestibulum depth will be analyzed, as well as the time
      spent for the procedure measured.
