      antibodies targeting antigens involved in chronic disease. The humoral immune system is well
      known to produce anti-cancer and other antibodies that can be long lived in vivo. In this
      study we will evaluate the antibody status of the Wellderly with respect to neutralizing (i)
      molecules known to induce cholesterol like PCSK9, (ii) antibodies against cancer antigens
      like PMSA (prostate cancer) or Her2 (Breast cancer), (iii) antibodies against inflammatory
      molecules like TNFa or IL-6, (iv) antibodies that have broad neutralizing activity against
      infectious diseases like influenza.
