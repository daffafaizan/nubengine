    
      ET019003-T cells is a human anti-CD19 CAR-T cells by fusing the anti-CD19 antibody Fab domain
      with the transmembrane and intracellular domains from the γδTCR, which can avoid mispairing
      with the T cell's endogenous αβTCR chains. Meanwhile, an independent ET190L1-CSR(Chimeric
      Signaling Receptor) is added to ET019003-T cells in trans, which can bind CD19 to activate a
      novel costimulatory domain to further promote T cell proliferation and persistence.

      The trial is conducted to explore the safety and efficacy of ET019003-T cells in CD19+
      Leukemia and Lymphoma.
