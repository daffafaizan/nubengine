    
      1. To measure the time from biopsy to completion and final analysis of Whole Genome
           Sequencing (WGS) on patient tumor and non-tumor samples.

        2. To examine the frequency with which useable sequence data is obtained as a function of
           tumor volume received and percent tumor involvement in the biopsy

        3. To identify the frequency with which potential targets and pathways for therapy are
           discovered.

        4. To observe for any evidence that if anti-tumor activity from treatment is noted how
           would the genome sequencing have correlated with that activity.
