      fluconazole therapy. We assessed the clinical relief and mycological cure in response to oral
      fluconazole and boric acid suppositories in patients with diabetes mellitus and vulvovaginal
      candidiasis given in a Randomized trial. Fluconazole was given in standard oral single dose
      (150 mg) fluconazole and boric acid vaginal suppositories was given in dose of 600 mg/daily
      for 14 uninterrupted days.
