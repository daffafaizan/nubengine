      specific target at predefined stimulation parameters. Repeated sessions of rTMS therapy have
      been demonstrated to induce cumulative persistent benefits that can last weeks after the
      conclusion of the rTMS sessions

      The central hypothesis of this study is that rTMS therapy in PCD can potentiate the effects
      of BoNT injections. With the current standard treatment, the peak-dose benefits seen with
      BoNT are seen at about 4-6 weeks after the administration of injections. The investigator
      will introduce a 1 week course of rTMS around 2-8 weeks before or after BoNT or T1). The
      investigator will examine the effects of combined therapy at 10 weeks after BoNT and 12 weeks
      after BoNT injections follow-up.
