      insertion and technical ease to insert the stent. To discover a 12% difference between the 2
      groups, regarding patency, 400 patients must be included in the trial, alfa 0.05, beta 0.8.
      Investigators know from previous trials (Single center trial South Hospital GIE
      2006;63:986-995 and a newly finished similar swedish multicenter trial,prel data DDW- 09)that
      the 9 hospitals recruited will be able to include this no of patients in approximately 2.5
      years.

      Investigators will have a shortest follow-up period of 10 months, followup will be by phone
      with standard questions connected to stent failure, which is defined clinically AND by a new
      ERCP with intervention because of an obstructed stent.
