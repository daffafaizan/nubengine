      an action, in an internal way, without its actual motor execution. The Action Observation
      (AO) evokes an internal, real-time motor simulation of the movements that the observer is
      perceiving visually. Both mental processes trigger the activation of the neurocognitive
      mechanisms that underlie the planning and execution of voluntary movements in a manner that
      resembles how the action is performed in a real manner. The phenomenon of exercise-induced
      hypoalgesia is well known. This is why it has been suggested that these techniques could
      produce pain modulation similar to that produced by real exercise.
