      Primary

        -  Assess overall survival of patients with stage IIIB or IV primary non-small cell lung
           adenocarcinoma who have never smoked and are treated with erlotinib hydrochloride and
           bevacizumab.

      Secondary

        -  Assess progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Assess the response rate (confirmed and unconfirmed, complete and partial) in a subset
           of patients with measurable disease treated with this regimen.

        -  Evaluate the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with this regimen in these
           patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride daily on days 1-21 and bevacizumab IV over
      30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients will be accrued for this study.
