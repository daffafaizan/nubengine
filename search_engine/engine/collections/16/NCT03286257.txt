      control mechanisms including vascular function, with exercise training is beneficial in
      alleviating hot flushes in breast cancer patients and their associated quality of life
      symptoms. Participants will be recruited at least 3-months post breast cancer treatment
      (surgery, radio-therapy, chemotherapy). This time point has been chosen for this study to
      allow patients to fully engage in the exercise intervention following treatment. All
      participants will be asked to attend the laboratory at Liverpool John Moores University on 4
      separate occasions; 2 visits pre- and 2 visits following the exercise intervention for data
      collection including measures of vascular health, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and
      fitness. The investigators will also gain information on food intake and incidence of hot
      flushes across a 7-day period pre- and post the intervention.
