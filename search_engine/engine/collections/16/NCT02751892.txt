    
      This study was a randomized controlled feasibility trial consisting of a 3-months active
      lifestyle intervention and a 3-months follow-up period. Participants were allocated to an
      active lifestyle programme (ALP) or the standard (SC) care group. ALP was offered 12
      supervised exercise sessions over 3 months and six supportive behaviour change workshops. SC
      was encouraged to continue with their usual lifestyle. The intervention was informed by
      Self-Determination Theory.

      The supervised exercise sessions took place in small groups of maximum 7 participants and
      lasted approximately 1 hour. Exercise included aerobic and resistance exercises. The
      behaviour change workshops were delivered in a motivational interviewing style, also in small
      groups of maximum 7 participants.

      Participants were followed-up at 6 months. There was no contact with participants during the
      post-intervention and follow-up period.
