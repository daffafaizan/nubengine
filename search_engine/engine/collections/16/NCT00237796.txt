      supportive care (SC); and CBSST. Subjects (N=100) will be recruited, treated for 9 months and
      followed longitudinally for 9 months after treatment. A multidimensional evaluation of
      treatment outcome, including social functioning (primary outcome), neuropsychological
      functioning, cognitive insight, psychotic symptoms, and health services utilization, will be
      conducted at baseline, end of treatment (9-month follow-up), and 9 months post-treatment. 100
      patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder will participate on a voluntary basis
      and will be paid $50.00 per assessment visit. Subjects will not be paid or given any
      incentive for treatment. The following inclusion/exclusion criteria will be used: (i)
      Voluntary informed consent for participation (given by the patient or conservator); (ii) Age
      45 or older; (iii) DSM-IV-diagnosis (APA, 1994) of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder
      at any stage of illness; (iv) No prior exposure to SST or CBT in the past 5 years; (v) Level
      of care required at baseline does not interfere with outpatient group therapy participation
      (e.g., partial or inpatient hospitalization for psychiatric, or physical illness). We
      anticipate that we will be able to provide an empirically validated intervention that can be
      used by clinicians on multidisciplinary rehabilitation teams to reduce disability in aging
      patients with schizophrenia. The products from this research will be written research reports
      and a therapy manual and patient workbook to guide rehabilitation that can be disseminated
      (e.g., via the internet) to relevant clinicians.
