    
      Objective: Detect the expression of endothelial progenitor cells and endothelial cells from
      peripheral blood of patients with moyamoya disease, and to assess the relationship between
      clinical characteristics.

      Design: A single center study, and planned to enroll 120 patients. The present study was to
      detect the quantities of EPC from peripheral blood in Moyamoya disease by flow cytometry, and
      to identify the relationship of endothelial progeIlitor cells and effect of the
      revascularization on Moyamoya disease. The present study also use cerebral ischemia animal
      model foe intervention experiment, to explore whether EPC can promote vascular remodeling
      effect of ischemic cerebrovascular disease, and to provide new thought for the treatment of
      chronic cerebrovascular disorder.
