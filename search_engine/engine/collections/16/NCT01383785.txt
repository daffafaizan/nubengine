      with level of evidence B in European Guidelines) and intravenous abciximab (indication Class
      IIa an level of evidence A in European Guidelines) in primary PTCA. Direct intracoronary
      injection of abciximab get smaller infarct size than intravenous injection. The hypothesis of
      our study are that direct distal injection of abciximab by aspiration catheter will be better
      than proximal intracoronary injection with reduction in infarct size and microvascular damage
      quantified by Magnetic resonance (MR) and 6 months mortality.
