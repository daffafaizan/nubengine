      Every subject will receive a total of 4 vaccinations. Subjects and study personnel will be
      blinded to the group that they are randomized to (double-blind). The study is intended to
      substantiate the Phase 1 results with the 2 mg dose and to also determine if immunogenicity
      can be retained with a 1 mg dose (for HTNV DNA vaccine).

      For the 2 mg dose, each vaccination consists of 2 administrations of 1 mg (left and right
      deltoid) for a total of 2 mg/vaccination. For the 1 mg dose, each vaccination consists of 2
      administrations of 0.5 mg (left and right deltoid) for a total of 1 mg/vaccination.

      Group 1 will be vaccinated with the HTNV DNA vaccine, pWRG/HTN-M(co) at the 2 mg/vaccination
      dose. Group 2 will be vaccinated with the HTNV DNA vaccine, pWRG/HTN-M(co) at the 1
      mg/vaccination dose. Group 3 will be vaccinated with the PUUV DNA vaccine, pWRG/PUU-M(s2) at
      the 2 mg/vaccination dose. Group 4 will be vaccinated with the PUUV DNA vaccine,
      pWRG/PUU-M(s2) at the 1 mg/vaccination dose. Each group will be vaccinated on Days 1, 29, 57
      and 169. All doses will be administered with the PharmaJet Stratis device, which is FDA
      cleared for IM administration of vaccines. All subjects will be followed until 1 month after
      the last vaccination with Day 197 being the final study visit. Subjects will complete
      post-injection memory aids for 7 days after each vaccination.
