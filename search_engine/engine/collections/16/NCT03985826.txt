      accounting for 40-45 new cases every year in Denmark. Over the past decades, advances in
      treatment have led to an increasing number of children who survive cancer and more than 80%
      of children with ALL now become long-term survivors. This means a growing population of
      childhood ALL survivors. In survivors, the cancer itself and treatment late-effects can lead
      to ongoing health care use.

      Register studies of long-term survivors of childhood cancer have shown an increased risk of
      hospitalisation compared to the general population. It is mentioned in many of the studies
      that contact rates could be underestimated when looking at hospital contacts only.

      The literature about non-hospital-based contacts with a doctor in childhood cancer survivors
      is scarce.
