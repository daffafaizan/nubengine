    
      Patients will be randomized to the control group or the experimental group. Patients in the
      control group will receive the treating physician's standard of care, and undergo bladder
      scans in the post anesthesia care unit (PACU), upon admission to the unit, and prior to
      discharge from the hospital. Patients in the experimental group will undergo a multimodal
      pain control care pathway that minimizes opioid consumption.

      The primary endpoint will be the presence of or absence of post-operative urinary retention
      (POUR) between discharge from the PACU and prior to discharge from the hospital. POUR will be
      defined as bladder volume of greater than 500cc and the inability to void for at least 2
      hours within the first 24 hours. POUR, once identified will be treated with intermittent
      straight catheterization (ISC). Secondary endpoints will include opioid consumption (in
      morphine milligram equivalents; MME), genito-urinary consultation, type (knee or hip) and
      duration of surgery, type of anesthesia, duration of anesthesia, total amount of IV fluids,
      blood loss, length of hospital stay (LOS), discharge status (home with early outpatient
      physical therapy, etc.), time of first spontaneous voiding, and the number of ISCs and any
      necessary indwelling catheterization and adverse events of interest including POUR,
      post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV), severe pain of 7 or greater on the numeric rating
      scale(NRS), blood loss requiring transfusion, and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).
