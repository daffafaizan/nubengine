      After placement of their labor epidural catheter, parturients will be randomized by a
      computer generated number table into one of two groups. Group P - high protein drink with 30
      grams of protein and ice chips PRN, or Group C - control group consisting of ice chips PRN.
      The protein drink that will be used is Premier Nutrition Protein Shake, which contains 30
      grams of protein in 11 ounces. Measured variables will include; nausea and emesis at epidural
      placement, at hourly intervals until delivery, and 1 hour post delivery. Nausea will be
      evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS); 0 = no nausea and 10 = worst nausea ever.
      Episodes of emesis will be recorded as (yes/no). The parturient will be seen the day
      following delivery and evaluated for overall patient satisfaction. Parturients will rate
      their satisfaction level using a scale from 0-100 with 0=not satisfied and 100=very
      satisfied. The investigators believe that the incidence of emesis will be decreased in
      parturients who receive high protein intake during labor, and overall patient satisfaction
      will be increased.
