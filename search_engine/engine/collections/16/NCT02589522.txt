    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To conduct a phase 1 dose escalation trial in patients with brain metastases from
      non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of twice
      weekly intravenous (i.v.) M6620 (VX-970) administered concurrent with conventionally
      fractionated whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT), with M6620 (VX-970) starting 18-30 hours after
      the first dose of radiation (but prior to the second fraction of radiation).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the incidence of >= grade 3 delayed neurological toxicity at 2, 4 and 6-months
      post-completion of whole-brain radiotherapy (for patients without intracranial progression).

      II. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. IIa. To estimate the radiological response
      rates (RR) at 6 months including bi-directional and volumetric measurements of lesion size.

      IIb. To estimate the intracranial 6-month progression-free survival (PFS).

      EXPLORATORY/HYPOTHESIS GENERATING OBJECTIVES:

      I. Changes in dynamic susceptibility contrast enhancement (DSC-magnetic resonance imaging
      [MRI]) perfusion and mean apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) measurements in
      diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI). (Group I) II. To measure cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF) M6620 (VX-970) levels, tumor M6620 (VX-970) levels, and pATR T1989, pCHK1 S345
      and RAD51 multiplex foci. (Group II) III. Changes in DSC-MRI perfusion and mean ADC
      measurements in DWI. (Group II)

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of berzosertib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2
      treatment groups.

      GROUP I: Patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy once daily (QD), 5 days a week for 15
      fractions. Patients also receive berzosertib intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes twice a
      week, 18-30 hours after first radiation therapy. Treatment continues for 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive berzosertib IV over 60-90 minutes 2-4 hours prior to surgery.
      After surgery, patients undergo whole-brain radiation therapy and receive berzosertib as in
      Group I.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 6 months,
      every 3-4 months for 6 months, then every 6 months for 1 year.
