      vaccine in combination with PD-1 knockout T cells in the treatment of advanced prostate
      cancer. The therapeutic vaccine is a customized product involving ex vivo treatment of the
      patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells with a recombinant fusion protein (PAP-GM-CSF)
      to activate the expression of the antigen that would activate the immune function to kill
      cancer cells. The PD-1 knockout engineered T cells are also prepared using patient's T cells
      in which PD-1 gene will be knocked out using CRISPR Cas9 technology. The therapeutic vaccine
      and PD-1 knockout T cells will be infused back to the patient in 3 times with a 2-week
      interval.
