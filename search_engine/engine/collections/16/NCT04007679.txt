      students' knowledge of pain and their beliefs and attitudes about the treatment of patients
      with chronic pain. This study was a single-center, cross-sectional study on the pain
      knowledge of students in a four-year physiotherapy program and their beliefs and attitudes
      about patients with back pain.Students were eligible to participate if they were enrolled at
      physiotherapy undergraduate program at KÃ¼tahya Health Sciences University Faculty of Health
      Sciences. Individuals were excluded if they had previously received in depth-teaching on pain
      neuroscience. The study was completed with 156 students from different classes (first,
      second, and third year of the program) who agreed to participate in the study. All
      participants were informed about the study and signed informed consent forms. Pain
      neurophysiology questionnaire and Pain Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists were
      used to assess pain knowladge and attitudes and beliefs. After recording their demographic
      information, the participants completed the Neuroscience of Pain Questionnaire (NPQ) and Pain
      Attitudes and Beliefs Scale for Physiotherapists (PABS-PT) at three time points: pre-PNE,
      immediately post-PNE, and 6 months after PNE.
