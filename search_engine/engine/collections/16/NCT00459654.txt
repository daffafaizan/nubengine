    
      Primary objective:

      To study the biological effectiveness of radium-223 therapy measured as:

        -  Time to occurrence of skeletal-related events(SREs)

        -  Change in bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bone-ALP) levels

      Secondary objectives:

      To study the efficacy of radium-223 therapy in terms of:

        -  Frequency of new SREs

        -  Proportions of patients with an SRE

        -  Proportions of patients with SRE at different time points

        -  Changes of biochemical markers of bone turnover

        -  Treatment response with regard to pain and analgesic use(termed "Palliative effect" in
           study protocol)

        -  Quality of life assessment

        -  Overall survival To study the safety of the repeated radium-223 regimen Total
