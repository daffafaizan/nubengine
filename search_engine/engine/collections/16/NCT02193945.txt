    
      This study (TG-MV-022) is a retrospective study utilizing Spectral-domain optical coherence
      tomography (SD-OCT) in patients treated previously with JETREA® for VMA. The objectives of
      this study are to retrospectively review and further characterize anatomic and symptomatic
      changes over six months immediately following treatment of VMA with JETREA® (ocriplasmin),
      including incidence, time to onset and resolution of anatomy and symptoms. The retrospective
      study will collect Heidelberg Spectralis® SD-OCT images which will be masked and uploaded to
      a Central Reading Center (CRC) for review and analysis. The CRC will evaluate anatomic
      endpoints of interest from both baseline optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and all
      follow-up OCT scans over the 6 month follow up period. Endpoints of interest include
      ellipsoid zone disruption, development of subretinal fluid, resolution of VMA and macular
      hole changes. Further, trained clinical personnel at the participating centers will
      transcribe data from the patients' records, to be entered into the study database.
