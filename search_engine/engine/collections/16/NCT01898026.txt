      however, whole grain products consumption is below recommendations possibly due to the
      presence of unappealing characteristic organoleptic properties. White, refined products are
      still the choice of the general public. As such, we propose to investigate the feasibility of
      increasing health benefits of commonly consumed white, refined carbohydrate products by
      incorporating a soluble fibre blend.

      This research is important to determine the feasibility of developing fibre enriched
      carbohydrate foods that maintains the original organoleptic properties and is effective in
      reducing postprandial blood glucose response.

      35 subjects will be recruited in phase I to complete a sensory evaluation on the test foods.
      Following tasting of the control and fibre-enriched samples, data on each subjects' liking or
      disliking will be collected through a 9-point hedonic scale.

      An acute crossover RCT will be conducted in phase II by 10 healthy individuals. Subjects will
      be randomized to consume one the treatments at each visit and blood glucose levels over
      120min and satiety scores will be measured.
