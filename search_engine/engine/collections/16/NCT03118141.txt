    
      This is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety with
      transfer of embryos selected by next generation sequence (NGS) and morphologic criteria
      versus by morphological criteria alone. Subjects who obtain 3 or more good-quality
      blastocysts will be randomized to PGS or IVF group. All embryos will be frozen and a single
      thawed blastocyst will be transferred in both PGS and IVF group. Subjects in the PGS group
      will have 3 blastocysts sequenced and euploid embryos will be subsequently transferred.
      Subjects in the IVF group will have blastocysts selected by morphology assessment. The
      cumulative live birth rate will be counted after transfers of all euploid embryo in the PGS
      group and 3 blastocysts in the IVF group within 1 year after randomization.
