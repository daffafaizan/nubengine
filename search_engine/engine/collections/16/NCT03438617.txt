      of those with the disease, but also provides increased challenges for integration across the
      many dimensions of care (varied medications in addition to insulin, specialty services, diet,
      physical activity, stress management, etc.) and across the many who contribute to care
      (specialists, primary care providers, nurses, dietitians and patient educators, family
      members, friends, worksites). The Shanghai Integration Model (SIM) has made great strides to
      integrating specialty/hospital care with primary/community care. The addition of peer support
      can enhance patient engagement within that integrated care. Peer support can also integrate
      care with the daily behaviors and patterns that optimal diabetes management requires and with
      the family members and others in individuals' daily lives who can support diabetes
      management. This project will develop a combined model of the SIM and peer support, implement
      and evaluate it in ten Community Health Centers in Shanghai, disseminate the resulting model
      across the 240 Community Health Centers in Shanghai, and, in collaboration with the Chinese
      Diabetes Society, across care providers throughout China. To accomplish these ambitious
      objectives, the program is a collaboration among the Shanghai Sixth People's Hospital,
      Shanghai Jiao Tong University, the Shanghai Diabetes Institute, the Shanghai Health Bureau,
      the Shanghai Centers for Disease Control, and, at the University of North Carolina-Chapel
      Hill, Peers for Progress, widely recognized for its leadership in promoting peer support in
      health care and prevention.
