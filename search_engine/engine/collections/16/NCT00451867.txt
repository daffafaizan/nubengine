      chronic, with no universally successful treatment option currently available. Characteristic
      symptoms include pain with bladder filling, and marked urinary frequency (to relieve pain).
      The only FDA-approved oral medication for treatment of IC is pentosan polysulfate (Elmiron),
      recently demonstrated by our collaborative research network to perform with little more
      efficacy than placebo (ref), and which is expensive and has associated side effects. Current
      clinical treatment protocols are empiric and usually aimed at relieving pain. There is a
      pressing need for an effective oral medication for treatment of IC. The presentation of
      symptoms can be quite variable among patients, suggesting that IC is a multi-factorial
      syndrome with several proposed etiologies, some of which may be interrelated.
