    
      This is a 6-month randomized controlled trial comparing the efficacy of two smartphone-based
      dietary and weight change interventions among 70 parent-child dyads with at least one child
      between the ages of 2 and 12 (70 adults and 70 children ages 2-12). One intervention group
      (Simple) will use a simplified, low-burden form of dietary tracking in the study smartphone
      application and the other group (Standard) will use standard calorie tracking. Components of
      both interventions include (1) setting personalized goals for weight, dietary intake, and
      daily activity (2) adaptive text message interventions based on behavior change techniques
      such as goal setting and in-the-moment progress feedback several times per week, (3) weekly
      tailored feedback updated in the study smartphone app, and (4) weekly lessons on the
      smartphone app. The primary objective is to promote weight loss in the parents, and the
      secondary objective is to determine if one or both interventions produce a ripple effect of
      parent dietary change onto dietary changes in the child.
