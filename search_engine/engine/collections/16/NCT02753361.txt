    
      50 patients between the ages of 18 and 60 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists
      (ASA) physical status I-III, scheduled for superficial subcutaneous lipoma (sized from 5 to 7
      cm) excision will be enrolled in prospective comparative randomized clinical study.

      Patients will be randomized into two groups: U (n = 25), in whom regional blockade was
      performed using US-guidance; and C (n = 25), in whom regional block was performed using the
      traditional method. Patients will be randomly assigned on a one-to-one ratio. Randomization
      will be performed by means of a computer generated random-numbers table. Group allocation
      will be concealed in sealed opaque envelopes that will not opened until patient consent had
      been obtained.

      All patients will be pre-medicated with oral diazepam (7.5 mg) 30 min before the procedure,
      and IV fentanyl (50 ug) will be administered 5 minutes before placement of the block. Before
      the procedure, an IV access and standard monitoring of electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive
      blood pressure (NIBP), and peripheral oxygen saturation (SPO2) will be established.

      Primary outcome includes the number of needle attempts (number of skin punctures and needle
      redirections) needed to complete the block placement. It will be documented by an
      investigator blinded to the aim of the study. Patient demographics, duration of surgery,
      patient's ASA physical status and other study outcomes will be documented by independent
      investigators who were not involved in the block placement procedure and were blinded to the
      group assignment.
