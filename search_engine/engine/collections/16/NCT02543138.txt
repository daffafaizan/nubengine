      that the chest tube proceeds in only one direction. The mold also has a mark to indicate
      insertion depth. Sixteen participants without experience with thoracostomies observed one
      closed thoracostomy procedure using the new trocar and then performed three thoracostomies on
      a cadaver. For each of these thoracostomies, investigators measured the time required for
      chest tube insertion, the position of the tip of the chest tube within the thoracic cavity,
      the difficulty associated with the procedure, and the volunteer's confidence after the
      procedure.
