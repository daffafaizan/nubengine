      cord paralysis, sorethroat. Some study revealed that 60cmH2O of intracuff pressure is maximum
      pressure which is not increase side effect.

      The manufacturer recommends that the cuff is inflated with the minimum volume of air required
      to provide an effective seal(max volume - size 3, 20 ml; size 4, 30 ml; size 5, 40).

      The investigators will measure anatomical structure (neck circumference, neck length,
      thyroid-mental distance, etc.) which can influence cuff volume and pressure and find
      correlation between cuff volume and physical figure measured.
