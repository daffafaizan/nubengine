      communities. Among the infected are former commercial plasma donors who became infected
      through contaminated blood collection equipment. This study will evaluate the safety,
      efficacy, and tolerability of an antiretroviral (ARV) regimen given to treatment-naive HIV
      infected adults. Participants will be recruited in Wenxi County, Shanxi Province.

      This study will last 1 year. At study entry, all study participants will be given an ARV
      regimen consisting of lamivudine/zidovudine twice daily and efavirenz once daily. There will
      be 11 study visits; a physical exam, blood collection, and vital signs measurement will occur
      at all study visits. Participants will also receive safe sex and adherence counseling at all
      visits. Participants will be asked to complete an adherence questionnaire and will have their
      pills counted at most visits.
