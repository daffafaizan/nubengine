      for its application on the speech therapy, with the assistance of a feedback system - with
      WinpitchPro (Philippe Martin). A database was constituted on the basis of a patterned corpus
      (EUROM1) by its translation, recording and editing on .wav format. Throughout
      model-sentences, an experimental intervention program initiates with the participation of 2
      adults with stuttering problem and 2 with apraxia of speech. The efficacy of the therapeutic
      procedure is tested on the basis of the acoustical and the statistical analyses which have
      compared the first and the second speech samples taken before and after the twenty (20)
      therapy sessions held in a prosody approach only.
