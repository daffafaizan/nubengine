      with overt primary hypothyroidism (reduced T4 concentration accompanied by increased TSH
      concentration at the time of initial diagnosis) who did not receive thyroid hormones. All
      patients were divided into two groups: patients from Group A (n=20) were randomized to L-T4
      in dose of 1,6 μg per kg, followed by combined L-T4 and L-T3; and 16 women from Group B
      received the combination of L-T4+L-T3 (the dose of L-T4 was reduced by 25 μg and replaced
      with 12,5 μg of L-T3), followed by monotherapy with L-T4. The treatment periods lasted for 6
      months. Patients were examined at baseline and at the end of each treatment period.Blood
      samples were obtained to measure serum TSH, free T4, free T3, lipid profile, osteocalcin.
      Urine samples were collected to measure urinary deoxypyridinoline / creatinine ratio. 24-hour
      ECG-monitoring, osteodensitometry and psychological testing were also performed at baseline
      and at the end of each treatment period.
