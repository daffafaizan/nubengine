      I. To compare accuracies of whole body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) versus bone scan plus
      computed tomography (CT) scan in detecting bone or lymph node metastasis in high risk
      prostate cancer patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants undergo standard of care bone scan, CT of the abdomen and pelvis, and pelvic
      MRI. Participants also undergo magnetic resonance whole body (WB)-diffusion-weighted imaging
      (DWI) over 20-30 minutes.
