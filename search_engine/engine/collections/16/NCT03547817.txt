    
      Cross sectional study design. The equipment for physiological measurements will be attached
      to the patient, and the foot will then be placed in the pressure chamber. The device induces
      pulses of 10 sec negative pressure, and 7 sec of atmospheric pressure. Pressure levels of 0
      mmHg, -10mmHg, -20 mmHg, -40 mmHg and -60 mmHg will be tested.

      Patients will be recruited from the out-patient clinic at Department of Vascular Surgery,
      Oslo University Hospital, Aker.

      Inclusion criteria:

      Diagnosed peripheral artery disease (PAD), Ankle-Brachial Index <0.9 Outcome measures:

      Arterial blood flow: Ultrasound Doppler from peripheral arteries in the foot.

      Skin blood flow: Laser Doppler to measure acral skin blood perfusion.

      Skin temperature

      Systemic blood pressure: Finger arterial pressure will continuously be acquired by a
      photoplethysmographic pressure recording device (Finometer).

      Ankle brachial index

      Pressure recordings inside the pressure chamber: Continuously monitoring of pressure within
      the pressure chamber using a digital differential manometer.
