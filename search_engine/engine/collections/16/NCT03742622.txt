      exercise with and without an energy replacement snack on the following energy intake in
      adolescents with obesity. 18 adolescents with obesity will be asked to randomly complete
      three experimental sessions: i) one control session (rest); ii) one session with an acute
      exercise realized during the morning; iii) one session with the same exercise followed by a
      snack covering the exercise-induced energy expenditure. Their ad libitum energy intake will
      be assessed at the following meal as well as at dinner time. Appetite feelings will be
      assessed at regular intervals and their food reward in response to the lunch will also be
      assessed.
