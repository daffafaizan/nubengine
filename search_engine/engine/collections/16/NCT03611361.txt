      multispectral imaging (MSI) measurements across the visible and infrared spectrum to obtain a
      quantitative tissue viability assessment. These optical measurements are integrated using a
      CADe algorithm to categorize microvascular blood flow and provide a quantitative assessment
      to aid in selecting the appropriate amputation site.

      The investigators intend to gather data to train the CADe algorithm to predict ultimate
      healing status of tissue in the lower extremities of individuals suffering from peripheral
      arterial disease (PAD). The investigators will demonstrate the feasibility of using such an
      algorithm to accurately predict the location and extent of small vessel disease prior to
      amputation. Eventually, the invesitgators expect the DeepView to reduce the rate of
      re-amputation in patients with peripheral arterial disease if used for routine assessment of
      patients prior to amputation.

      The aims of the study are as follows:

        -  Evaluate performance of a Computer Assisted Detection (CADe) algorithm trained to assist
           selecting the level-of-amputation in patients with PAD.

        -  Identify multispectral signatures that are strongly predictive of viable skin tissue at
           proposed amputation sites.

        -  Create a representative database for training the CADe algorithm.
