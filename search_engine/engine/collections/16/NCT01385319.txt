      whether the Endeavor stent is superior to BMS in terms of efficacy and safety in

        1. Patients with coronary artery disease lesions at low risk of in-stent restenosis;

        2. Patients at high risk for bleeding or carrying impossibility to comply with dual
           anti-platelet treatment at long-term.

        3. Patients at high thrombosis risk due to systemic disorders or planned non-cardiac
           surgery within 12 months

      As the use of DES in these two patient/lesion subsets is debated due to lack of evidence,
      patients fulfilling at least one of these three medical conditions qualify for bare metal
      stent implantation and physicians may believe DES to be even contra-indicated in such cases.
      The current protocol has been developed on purpose to address the value of the Endeavor
      Sprint stent, which differs in many aspects from other FDA approved DES, including fast and
      complete degree of strut coverage after implantation and quick release of active drug after
      deployment (~15 days) which may help decreasing the need for prolonged dual antiplatelet
      treatment down to 1 month as it is currently recommended for bare metal stent implantation.
