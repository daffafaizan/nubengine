      malignant potential. Telomerase is an enzyme complex that lengthens telomeres and has
      enhanced expression in numerous malignancies. In this study, we evaluated the telomerase gene
      copy number, telomere length, cells in senescence, aneuploidy and additional parameters of
      telomere dysfunction from peripheral blood lymphocytes of patients.
