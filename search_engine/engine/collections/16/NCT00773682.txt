      in older people. Current treatment of OA include pharmacological and non-pharmacological
      modalities. Spa therapy has a long history in the treatment of OA, but few articles have
      evaluated the effectiveness of thermal treatment in patients with primary OA of the hands.

      The aim of this study is to assess the duration of the clinical effectiveness of mud-packs
      application and mineral bath in patients with primary OA of the hands in a single blind,
      controlled, randomized trial.

      Our study will follow the patients for a longer period of time (12 months) than was done in
      previous studies.

      60 outpatients will be enrolled; 30 patients will be treated with a combination of daily
      local mud packs and mineral bath water from the spa centre of Fonteverde Natural Spa Resort
      (San Casciano Terme, Siena, Italy) for two weeks; 30 patients will continue regular, routine
      ambulatory care. Patients will be assessed at baseline time, after 2 weeks, after 3, 6, 9 and
      12 months following the beginning of the study and will be evaluated by VAS for spontaneous
      pain, Dreiser Algofunctional index, HAQ, AIMS1 and symptomatic drugs consumption.
