        -  Compare the incidence of lymphedema of the lower extremity after lymph node dissection
           in patients with vulvar malignancies treated with fibrin sealant vs standard care.

        -  Compare the frequency of surgical complications in patients treated with fibrin sealant
           vs standard care.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms.

        -  Arm I: After radical vulvectomy or hemivulvectomy and lymphadenectomy, patients receive
           fibrin sealant to surgical site.

        -  Arm II: After surgery, patients receive standard care for closure of surgical site.

      Lymphedema is assessed at time of drain removal, at week 6, and then at months 3 and 6.

      Patients are followed at week 6 and at months 3 and 6.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120-130 patients (60-65 per treatment arm) will be accrued for
      this study within 2 years.
