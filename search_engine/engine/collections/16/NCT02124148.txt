    
      The primary purpose of Parts A, B, C, D and E of this study is to determine a recommended
      dose level and schedule of prexasertib (an inhibitor of checkpoint kinase 1 and 2 [CHK1/CHK2]
      in combination with:

        -  cisplatin (Part A)

        -  cetuximab (Part B)

        -  pemetrexed (Part C)

        -  fluorouracil (Part D)

        -  LY3023414 (Part E) [An inhibitor of phosphoinositide 3-kinase alpha (PI3K alpha) and
           mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK), and other
           class I phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) family members]

      in participants with advanced or metastatic cancer.

      Part A dose expansion of the study will evaluate the safety and toxicity of prexasertib at
      the recommended dose level in combination with cisplatin in participants with advanced or
      metastatic cancer, Part B dose expansion of the study will evaluate the safety and toxicity
      of prexasertib at the recommended dose level in combination with cetuximab in participants
      with advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer, Part C and D dose expansions have been removed
      and Part E dose expansion of the study will evaluate the safety and toxicity of prexasertib
      at the recommended dose level in combination with LY3023414 in participants with advanced or
      metastatic cancer, participants with PIK3CA mutations, or with advanced or metastatic breast
      cancer.

      In Parts A and B the effect of adding granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to
      cisplatin in combination with prexasertib and cetuximab in combination with prexasertib will
      be explored. In Part A the effect of changing the schedule of prexasertib and cisplatin also
      will be explored. In Part B the effect of changing the schedule of prexasertib and cetuximab
      also will be explored.
