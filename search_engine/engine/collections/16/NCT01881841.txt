        1. Assess cMET feasibility and acceptability and estimate its effect size on underage
           drinking. Hypothesis: Among 14- to 20-yr-old primary care patients, those receiving cMET
           will have lower rates of any alcohol use, days of alcohol use, drinks per drinking day,
           and days of heavy episodic drinking, than those receiving treatment as usual.

        2. Estimate effect sizes for tobacco, cannabis, and other drug use, and other
           substance-related risks and outcomes including substance-related driving/riding, and
           experience of substance-related problems.

        3. Identify potential moderators and mediators of cMET's effect.
