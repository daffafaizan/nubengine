      increased morbidity and mortality. Therefore nutritional therapy can be considered
      imperative. However, there is limited evidence on the treatment of malnutrition in patients
      with chronic pancreatitis. This study aims to investigate the effect of an intensified
      nutritional therapy on nutritional status in malnourished patients with chronic pancreatitis.
      By testing feasibility of this intensified therapy valuable recommendations for future
      treatment of malnutrition in patients with chronic pancreatitis can be derived.
