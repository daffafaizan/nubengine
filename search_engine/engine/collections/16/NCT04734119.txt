      influence patient satisfaction with anesthesia. Preoperatively all patients are routinely
      assessed by an anesthesiologist. However, in many centers, the anesthesiologist who performs
      the preoperative evaluation will not necessarily be the anesthesiologist who provides the
      intraoperative service. This study evaluated the effect of this practice on patient
      satisfaction, level of confidence and anxiety among adult patients undergoing elective
      surgery.

      Methods: 100 patients scheduled for elective surgery under general anesthesia were randomly
      divided into 2 equal groups: In Group A patients were evaluated and anesthetized by the same
      anesthesiologist. In Group B the preoperative assessment and actual anesthesia was performed
      by two different anesthesiologists. On the first postoperative day all patients completed a
      questionnaire designed to evaluate their sense of preoperative security (confidence) and
      their overall satisfaction with the anesthetic experience.
