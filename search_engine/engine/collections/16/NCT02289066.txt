      health on the complications of diabetes. The prevalence of periodontal disease among patients
      with diabetes is higher than in the general population. Periodontal disease is associated
      with dental loss and increased systemic inflammation which is associated with cardiovascular
      and bone disease. However, current evidence that treatment of POD will result in improvement
      of outcomes in patients with diabetes is mixed. Identifying patterns of disease and following
      biomarkers in patients with diabetes and periodontal disease will answer some of the
      questions and result in more appropriate recommendations and interventions with reduction in
      morbidity, mortality and healthcare cost.

      This study will be conducted using a cross-sectional design. Investigators will survey 200
      consecutive patients with diabetes during routine clinic visits using a questionnaire.
      Investigators will collect data on demographic information, socio-economic status, oral
      health status/care, diabetes history (duration, control and complications) and bone health. A
      subgroup of 24 participants with survey responses suggestive of periodontal disease will be
      selected to receive treatment for periodontal disease. We will measure their hemoglobin A1c
      and biomarkers before and after treatment and will compare their levels for changes with
      treatment. Investigators will analyze collected data using test of proportions, Student's
      t-test and multivariate regression analyses.
