      myeloma and are often given with a third drug (e.g. thalidomide, lenalidomide or bortezomib).
      The combination of conventional and new drugs has provided benefits in both overall survival
      and progression free survival, however there are few treatments available for patients who
      have not responded well (refractory) to their previous treatment or who need further
      treatment because their myeloma has come back (relapsed). Thus there is a need for new agents
      for these patients.

      The development of ixazomib provides the opportunity to increase anti-tumour activity against
      a wider range of tumour types. Early clinical trials data suggests it has anti-tumour
      activity in heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma patients with durable responses/disease
      control and is generally well tolerated.

      Cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone are both predominantly used in treatment of multiple
      myeloma and for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myelomas (RRMM), who have
      relapsed after bortezomib and lenalidomide. Therefore the evaluation of ixazomib in
      combination with cyclophosphamide and dexamethasone is the most valuable and practical option
      for patients.

      The primary end point of this study is progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points
      include toxicity and safety.
