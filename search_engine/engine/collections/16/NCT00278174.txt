      Primary

        -  Determine the objective response rate in patients with metastatic renal clear cell
           carcinoma treated with interferon alfa-1b.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label study.

      Patients receive interferon alfa-1b subcutaneously daily. Treatment continues in the absence
      of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.
