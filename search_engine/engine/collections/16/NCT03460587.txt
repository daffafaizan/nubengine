      chronic disease, with survivors living for years or decades after the event. Increasing
      evidence describes years of steady decline in several health measures for stroke survivors.
      Many factors contribute to this, including further strokes, uncontrolled risk factors,
      development of late complications of stroke, and limited access to rehabilitation therapy.

      New approaches are needed that address the many needs of stroke survivors, efficiently and in
      aggregate. Emerging telehealth technologies have high potential to address this major unmet
      need, but substantial innovation will be needed. The long-term goal is to establish a
      telehealth platform to treat chronic stroke.

      A telehealth system will be delivered to enrollee's home. Patients will be asked to interact
      with their system daily (at least 6 days/wk) for 12 weeks. For 3 times per week, during the
      first 2 weeks, and then 1 time per week thereafter, a study therapist or research assistant
      in the lab will use the telehealth system to have a videoconference with the subject, to
      answer questions, provide feedback, review progress, and make any changes needed in the
      therapy plan. Study personnel will monitor usage statistics and performance measures for all
      systems.

      A key strategy is to measure in parallel, patient behaviors in three categories of health
      issues central to chronic stroke: (1) medical management issues including risk factor
      knowledge and control, (2) disability issues including motor function, and (3) psychological
      issues including depression and anxiety.
