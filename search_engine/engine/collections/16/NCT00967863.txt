    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Assess the impact of increasing the radiation dose 10 Gy on biochemical or clinical
           progression-free survival at 5 years in patients with unfavorable-risk prostate cancer
           receiving prolonged hormone therapy.

      Secondary

        -  Evaluate overall and specific survival.

        -  Assess acute and late toxicities of different modalities (conformal or
           intensity-modulated radiotherapy).

        -  Evaluate toxicities of the different doses with respect to hormonal therapy.

        -  Assess the quality of life (QLQ-C30 and PR 25).

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo 80 Gy of conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy 5 times a
           week for 7-8 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo 70 Gy of conformal or intensity-modulated radiotherapy 5 times
           a week for 7-8 weeks.

      In both arms, patients receive goserelin subcutaneously once every 3 months for up to 3
      years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 10 years.
