      It is different from small bowel CE that it consists of two cameras at both ends of the
      capsule, so as to enhance the coverage of colonic mucosa visualization. An improved
      generation of this colon capsule, named PillCam Colon 2TM, is also in its developmental
      phase. With the new "adaptive frame rate" (AFR) technology, the CE optimizes the visual
      coverage of the bowel by increasing the frame rate up to 35 frames per second when the
      capsule is moving quickly in certain areas, while decreasing the frame rate down to 4 frames
      per second when the capsule is moving slowly or remains stationary so as to conserve the
      battery life. Preliminary data from colorectal cancer screening has shown that it could
      improve the diagnostic yield of colonic polyps.

      The investigators hypothesize that, by re-programming the PillCam Colon 2TM so as to initiate
      AFR since ingestion, it could improve the visualization of small intestinal lumen and hence
      improves the sensitivity of small bowel CE examination.
