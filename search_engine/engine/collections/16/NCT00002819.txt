      low-volume ovarian cancer that is persistent following standard therapy treated with salvage
      therapy comprising standard-dose paclitaxel and carboplatin vs high-dose carboplatin,
      mitoxantrone, and cyclophosphamide followed by bone marrow reconstitution. II. Compare the
      toxic effects of these two salvage regimens. III. Compare selected health-related aspects of
      quality of life in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by participating
      center and disease state at reassessment laparotomy. Patients are randomized to one of two
      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and carboplatin
      IV continuously on days 1-5 every 3 weeks for a total of 6 courses. Arm II: Patients receive
      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and mitoxantrone IV over 15 minutes on days -8, -6, and -4,
      and carboplatin IV continuously on days -8 through -4, followed by rescue with autologous
      bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. Quality of life is assessed at baseline,
      at 3 and 9 weeks after starting treatment, and every 3 months for an additional 5 assessments
      regardless of disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 275 patients will be accrued over approximately 60 months.
