      I. Assess the safety of drug delivery microdevice (microdevice) placement and removal in
      subjects undergoing resection of sarcoma.

      II. Determine the technical feasibility of microdevice placement and removal with intact
      surrounding tissue in subjects undergoing resection of a sarcoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. Use the intratumoral cellular response to evaluate individual agents and/or drug
      combinations released from the microdevice reservoirs to assess the relative drug efficacy
      across all individual agents or drug combinations tested using the microdevice technology.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the microdevice performance for its capacity to predict Response Evaluation
      Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) response in the subset of patients that receive systemic
      chemotherapies as part of their standard-of-care or clinical trial treatments. II. Determine
      genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic predictive biomarkers from resected specimens that
      correlate with local (i.e. microdevice-based) and systemic drug response. III. Determine, at
      a single-cell level, proteomic traits associated with chemosensitivity versus (vs.)
      resistance using mathematical notions of network robustness and fragility.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo percutaneous implantation of up to 3 drug delivery microdevices up to 2 days
      before standard of care surgery. Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride, ifosfamide,
      vincristine, irinotecan, temozolomide, pazopanib, everolimus, polyethylene glycol, ganitumab,
      and temsirolimus via the microdevice in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. At the time of
      surgery 2 days later, patients have the drug delivery microdevice(s) removed. Conditions
