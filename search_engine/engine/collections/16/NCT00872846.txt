      contractions and mimic the sensation of fullness (satiety). The patient is expected to feel
      full after eating smaller amounts of food than normal. In addition, duodenal stimulation has
      been shown to induce favorable changes in postprandial glucose levels, glucose tolerance
      testing and insulin levels.

      The target population type II diabetic patients uncontrolled with oral medications, and with
      overweight (BMI >30). The Balance System may overcome the known disadvantages of insulin
