    
      This Phase 3 study is a randomized, controlled, multicenter, double-masked, parallel trial to
      compare the safety and efficacy of TP-03 to vehicle control for the treatment of Demodex
      blepharitis. The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy of
      TP-03, 0.25% compared to its vehicle from Day 1 to Day 43 in adult participants with mild to
      severe Demodex blepharitis. The primary efficacy endpoint will be cure based upon
      collarettes. Safety will be determined by assessing adverse effects related to the treatment
      as well as evaluating any changes in visual acuity, intraocular pressure, slit lamp
      biomicroscopy, endothelial cell density, hematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis.
