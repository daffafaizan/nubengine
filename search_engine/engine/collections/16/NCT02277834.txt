      generally live fewer years than patients with other types of cancer. Part of the reason why
      pancreatic cancer is so hard to treat is because it is usually discovered when it is too
      advanced to be able to treat. The goal of this protocol is to find a way to detect pancreatic
      cancer earlier, when it is still treatable in order to improve the survival of patients.

      The pancreas is a gland which produces digestive juices that mix with food in the intestines.
      Normal patients as well as patients with pancreatic cancer produce these juices. Other
      researchers have collected this fluid from very small numbers of patients and their results
      suggest that pancreatic fluid can be used to detect pancreatic cancer. One of the major
      issues with these results is that pancreatic fluid from only a very few number of patients
      has been collected and analyzed. In order to find out whether the pancreatic fluid can be
      used as a standard test for pancreatic cancer, the fluid from a greater number of patients
      needs to be analyzed. Also, of all the different chemicals in the pancreatic fluid, in this
      study we will try to figure out what the most important chemicals are in diagnosing
      pancreatic cancer.
