    
      The SpinCare is an electrospinning portable device intended for the external treatment of
      burns and wounds. The SpinCare is the first made on the spot, bed side, and completely
      personalized dressing system; with excellent coverage of all size, shapes and difficult
      contours. The nano-fibrous dressing mimics the structure of natural body tissue and creates
      excellent medium for tissue repair and healing.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the performance, safety and efficacy of the
      SpinCare System in the treatment of superficial to intermediate partial thickness burns.

      The study will include up to 6 sites. Adult patients with superficial to intermediate partial
      thickness burns (second degree superficial to intermediate) of up to 10% TBSA (Total Body
      Surface Area); with an independent burn of up to 5% TBSA.

      A prospective single arm, safety and efficacy, open labeled, multi-center study for the
      treatment of partial thickness burn wounds not considered for surgery using the SpinCare
      System.

      20 patients will be enrolled in the study.

      Primary endpoints:

        -  Wound healing and re-epithelialization on day 21.

        -  The burn will be considered healed when at least 95% of the total area is
           re-epithelialized and no scabs exist.

             -  Ease of use

             -  At postoperative days 7, 14, 21

        -  Dermal safety assessed by Draize Score

        -  Visual estimate of wound healing and re-epithelialization

        -  Pain

        -  Infection

        -  Itching

             -  Itching and scar quality at 3 and 6 months

             -  Itching and scar quality at 12 months (optional)

             -  Device related adverse events
