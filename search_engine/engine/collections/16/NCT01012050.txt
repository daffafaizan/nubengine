      and forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) are benefits of noninvasive
      ventilation (NV) in the treatment of asthma. Despite these clinical improvements attributed
      to NV during asthma exacerbations and the well-established effects of nebulization, there are
      few studies in the literature coupling both therapeutic resources.

      In addition to this, no studies on scintigraphic analysis of radioaerosol deposition coupled
      with NV in asthmatics have published. A previous study was published by our group, but
      involved healthy subjects.
