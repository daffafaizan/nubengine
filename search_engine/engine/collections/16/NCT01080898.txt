      (OCT) + fundus photography; fluorescein angiography + fundus photography and the combination
      of all three techniques (OCT+ fundus photography + fluorescein angiography).The sensitivity
      and specificity of the latter combination will be assessed by comparison with the results for
      this combination reported by several readers. Inter- and intra-observer reproducibility of
      the different combinations will also be studied.
