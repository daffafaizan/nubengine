    
      Prospective, randomized, blinded, two-arms study of waist circumferential reduction following
      5 once-a-week treatments. One arm is the HFT group of 64 subjects who are treated with the
      BTL-9000 HFT and the other arm is the Placebo group of 38 subjects treated with the sham
      device. The objective of the study is to demonstrate the effectiveness of the BTL-9000 HFT
      treatment in achieving average post-treatment waist circumference reduction of 3 cm or
      greater across the waistline relative to the baseline assessment and of 1 cm or greater than
      the average waist circumferential reduction of the Placebo group.
