      persons with comorbidities (Age>60, hypertension [HTN], diabetes mellitus [DM], Cancer, and
      otherwise immunocompromised). Zinc is a supplement with possible antiviral properties, having
      been shown to have effect in the common cold, many of which are due to coronavirus. In
      addition, elderly patients and patients with co-morbidities have high incidence of zinc
      deficiency. We are repleting zinc in all patients and studying its direct effect in
      combination with hydroxychloroquine, and an antibiotic, either azithromycin or doxycycline to
      see if there is enhanced treatment efficacy in early COVID-19 infection and assess the safety
      of these two regimen.
