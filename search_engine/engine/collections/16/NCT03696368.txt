      addition to prospectively using genetic information to predict GDM risk, the Hoosier Moms
      Cohort will incorporate the use of wearable/digital devices for collection of detailed
      behavioral information, support development of novel dietary capture methods, and enable the
      collection of specimens specifically aimed at multiple 'omics' techniques to engage in a
      detailed, multidimensional assessment of pathophysiologic pathways and biomarkers.
