    
      Commissioned by the Ontario Ministries of Health and Long Term Care(MOHLTC) and Child and
      Youth Services(MCYS), an expert-developed clinical pathway(CP) has been created with two main
      goals: 1) to guide risk assessment and disposition decision-making for children and youth
      presenting to the emergency department(ED) with MH concerns, and 2) to ensure seamless
      transition to follow-up services with community MH agencies(CMHAs) and providers. This
      pathway, referred to as the EDMHCP, is unique in undertaking to provide a seamless transition
      of care for children/youth and caregivers between hospital EDs and CMHAs.

      Working with 4 exemplary hospital EDs and 2 Community Mental Health Agencies across Eastern
      Ontario, the investigators will conduct a 3-year mixed methods health services research
      project with three components to i) implement the EDMHCP using a theory driven,
      evidence-based approach, ii) evaluate EDMHCP effectiveness through measurement of relevant
      outcomes, and iii) conduct a process evaluation to document and assess the EDMHCP
      implementation strategy against the outcomes achieved.

      This 3 year study will take place in five different phases, which include:

        -  Preparation: Qualitative interviews with ED team members and strategy development

        -  Implementation: Working with each ED team to implement the clinical pathway (including
           standardized assessments) within 8 months

        -  Post-implementation: Qualitative interviews with ED team members

        -  Data collection: 9-month pre/post chart audits of patients with mental health and
           caregiver satisfaction surveys

        -  Follow up: to discuss findings, database creation, and dissemination strategy.

      To ensure the findings directly impact relevant service delivery areas, the investigators
      have specifically recruited study team members with decision-making authority and/or
      influence on delivery of care for children and youth with MH concerns. This project will
      provide an implementation model for the EDMHCP to be used in any ED and CMHA setting, and
      will demonstrate decreased wait times and increased access with EDMHCP adoption. The findings
      will guide policy decision-making on access to timely and appropriate MH care and add to
      current knowledge of implementation science. In addition to knowledge translation via team
      member dissemination within their areas of influence, the investigators plan to disseminate
      the findings through presentation at scientific and healthcare conferences, and publication
      in relevant peer-reviewed journals.
