      to treat with the MicroStent™ System per the current instructions for use (IFU), and who have
      given written informed consent, will be enrolled in this study. Up to 250 subjects in three
      cohorts will be enrolled:

      Up to 100 subjects or 1-year recruitment, whichever comes first in Cohort #1: Claudication;
      Rutherford ≤3 Up to 100 subjects or 1-year recruitment, whichever comes first in Cohort #2:
      Critical Limb Ischemia; Rutherford 4-5 Up to 50 subjects or 1-year recruitment, whichever
      comes first in Cohort #3: Critical Limb Ischemia w/major tissue loss; Rutherford 6

      Sites may follow routine follow up intervals per their standard of care, with data regarding
      clinical assessments regarding limb status being collected. Data from these visits that do
      not fall in the expected visit windows will be captured in the study database as unscheduled
      visits.
