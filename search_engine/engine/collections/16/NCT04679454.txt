    
      The research plan is conceived in two sections, as follows. (i)The technical study handles
      the set-up, motion and dosimetric issues of the radioablation technique using CyberKnife
      system.

      (ii)The clinical section is organized in two studies: a phase I dose escalation study to
      identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) delivering 18 Gy, 21 Gy and 24 Gy in single
      fraction and a phase II study to evaluate the rate of pathological complete response (pCR)
      when a dose level is chosen according to the results of the previous phase I study.

      Study population includes patients affected by cT1-T2 (up to 2.5 cm) cN0, adenocarcinoma of
      the breast, diagnosed with conventional workup. Surgical tumor removal will be scheduled
      after 4-8 weeks after radioablation. Whole breast radiation therapy without boost will be
      performed after surgery.
