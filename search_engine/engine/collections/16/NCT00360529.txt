    
      This trial was designed as a prospective, multicenter trial containing a 24-week, randomized,
      double blind, placebo controlled, parallel-group period that assessed the effects of
      flibanserin (maximum total daily dose: 100 mg q.d.) compared with placebo in premenopausal
      women with HSDD, determined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV- Text Revision (DSM
      IV-TRÂ®) criteria. Three hundred patients were to be randomized to each treatment group. This
      trial examined the safety and efficacy of flibanserin compared to placebo for 24 weeks.
