      eligibility requirements and giving written informed consent, will be randomized.

      The project is structured in two consecutive phases.

        1. st Phase: 3-month randomized pilot study. Patients will be randomized with a 1:1
           distribution to be included in the Drug Code Active Patient or DCAP (intervention group)
           or to receive usual care (control group). The pilot study will confirm whether the
           proposed methodology is feasible to implement it on a large scale, as well as providing
           the information necessary to calculate the sample of patients according to the main
           objective of the study.

        2. nd Phase: Randomized clinical trial lasting 18 months (6 of which will be recruitment
           and 12 months follow-up) following the methodology described for the pilot in a larger
           sample of patients until the calculated sample size is achieved.
