      replaced by fibrotic tissue. The most current thinking is that the fibrotic process is a
      reaction to tiny injury to the lung. When the scar forms, the tissue becomes thicker causing
      a permanent loss of the tissue's ability to carry oxygen into the bloodstream.

      We need to obtain lung tissue from patients without pulmonary fibrosis and compare it to lung
      tissue from patients with pulmonary fibrosis.
