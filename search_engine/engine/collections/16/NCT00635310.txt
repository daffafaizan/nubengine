      annual incidence of 3-80% and 2.9%, respectively. Currently, percutaneous liver biopsy (PLB)
      remains the gold standard for grading necroinflammation and staging fibrosis in patients with
      liver diseases. In addition, liver histology can help clinicians determine the eligibility of
      renal transplantation, prognosis, and necessity of antiviral therapy in dialysis patients
      with chronic viral hepatitis. In chronic hepatitis patients with normal renal function (NRF),
      the risks of fatal and non-fatal hemorrhage after liver biopsies for non-malignant diseases
      were 0.04% and 0.16%, respectively. However, the relative risks of post-biopsy hemorrhage in
      CHC patients with end-stage renal disease to those with NRF remain disputed.

      Deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic analogue of vasopressin, is a commonly
      used hemostatic agent to treat uremic bleeding by inducing the release of von Willebrand
      factor (vWF) and factor VIII from their storage sites in endothelial cells.Previous studies
      have shown that one dose of 0.3-0.4Î¼g/kg body weight DDAVP infusion for dialysis patients
      could normalize bleeding time (BT), and prevent surgical and renal biopsy bleeding.
      Nevertheless, two recent studies showed divergent liver biopsy-related bleeding complication
      rates (0% and 6%, respectively) in dialysis CHC patients pre-treated with DDAVP. Since most
      studies evaluating the safety of PLB in CHC patients with dialysis were small and
      retrospective in nature, and not controlled by the biopsy route, the type of biopsy needle,
      the use of ultrasound guidance, or the number of passes,further studies are urgently needed
      to solve this important issue. Thus, we aimed to conducted a large clinical trial to compare
      the safety profiles of PLB between CHC patients with hemodialysis (HD) who were pretreated
      with DDAVP and those with NRF by the same biopsy technique.
