    
      ADVANCE MPI 2 is a multi-national, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, parallel
      group clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of regadenoson in SPECT MPI compared
      to that of the approved pharmacological stress agent, Adenoscan. Patients referred for a
      clinically indicated pharmacological stress MPI study will be eligible for enrollment. The
      trial is designed: (1) to compare the pharmacological stress SPECT images obtained with
      regadenoson to those obtained with Adenoscan, and (2) to compare the safety and tolerability
      of the two stress agents.
