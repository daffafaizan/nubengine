      in Asia. Patients will receive erlotinib in combination with bevacizumab or erlotinib alone.
      This study will enroll EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients who have asymptomatic brain metastases.

      The primary objective is to compare the systemic progression-free survival (PFS) to
      bevacizumab plus erlotinib versus erlotinib alone in patients with EGFR mutant NSCLC who have
      asymptomatic brain metastases.

      Patients will be randomized, at a 1:1 ratio, into bevacizumab plus erlotinib group or
      erlotinib alone group. Compute tomography (CT) or MRI scans will be performed every 6 weeks
      in the first 12 months since start of investigational drugs, and then performed every 12
      weeks. Patients will be followed until documented progression at brain and/or extra-cranial
      lesions. Patients with intracranial progression only are allowed to continue investigational
      drugs until a second progression of either intracranial progression or extracranial
      progression, developed, and the time-to extracranial progression will be determined. In
      patients with EGFR mutant advanced NSCLC who had brain metastases, it was reported that PFS
      to erlotinib or gefitinib was 6.6 months(Park et al., 2012). In the current study, it is
      assumed that the median PFS, both intracranial and extracranial included, is 7 months for
      erlotinib group alone and is 12.3 months for bevacizumab plus erlotinib group (hazard ratio
      0.57) (Seto et al., 2014). 109 patients will be required for analysis in this randomized
      phase II study. Patients will be stratified according to the EGFR L858R mutation and the EGFR
      exon 19 deletion mutation.
