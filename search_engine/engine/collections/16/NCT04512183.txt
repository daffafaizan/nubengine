      To evaluate the effect of simulation (high and low fidelity) on the cognitive, physiological
      and emotional sphere of nursing students in caring for patients with signs of sepsis.

      Hypothesis of the study:

      Null hypothesis: Students undergoing high-fidelity simulation will show similar levels of
      stress, cognitive performance and retention of knowledge in relation to those who will
      perform low-fidelity simulation in patients with signs of sepsis.

      Alternative hypothesis: The cognitive performance and stress will be higher in students who
      experience high fidelity simulation when compared to students who experience low fidelity
      simulation.
