    
      A prospective randomized trial comparing intravenous analgesia alone and in association with
      loco regional anesthesia consisting in a homolateral Serratus Plan Block (SPB). Loco regional
      blockade of the serratus is further examined by allocating the patients to two different
      approaches: the block being performed under US guidance by the Anesthesiologist before the
      beginning of the procedure, or under direct visualization, by the operating surgeon, before
      entering the pleural cavity.
