      study. There were three comparison groups: control, diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic
      macular edema (DME) groups. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) scans measuring
      retinal thickness, vessel density, perfusion density, and foveal avascular zone were obtained
      at baseline and postoperative week one, month one and month three.
