      among which the disorders of immune homeostasis between the fetus and the maternal immune
      system, maintained by cytokines from the complex regulatory network, are considered one of
      the potential etiological factors underlying IRM.

      The IL-10 polymorphism -1082A/G (rs1800896), which is located in the promoter region of the
      IL-10 gene, was reported to be implicated in the abnormal expression of IL-10 in IRM by some
      studies.

      However, no such reports about the association between IL-10 polymorphism -1082A/G and IRM
      risk in Chinese Han.
