      strategy to reach women of reproductive age who are at risk of unintended pregnancy with a
      brief educational intervention about emergency contraception (EC). The investigators will
      assess whether a video or website link has superior reach, engagement, and return on
      investment (measured as cost per click) through a Facebook ad campaign. The investigators
      will also ensure that both modalities of consumer engagement (website and video) are
      efficacious at ensuring adequate and improved knowledge of emergency contraception through a
      laboratory-environment trial.
