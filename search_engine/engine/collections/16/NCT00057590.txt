    
      This study is conducted in three phases. In the first phase, employees from various companies
      participate in an on-line Health Risk Assessment survey at a secure website. Those who
      display symptoms of depression participate in a brief telephone interview to confirm the
      depression diagnosis.

      In the second phase, depressed participants are randomly assigned to receive either
      intervention treatment or usual care for 18 months. The intervention consists of periodic
      telephone contact with a mental health clinician who provides education regarding depression
      and its treatment. Participants receiving the intervention are also provided with resources
      to obtain psychotherapy and/or pharmacotherapy. Those who do not seek treatment are monitored
      and supported. Participants in the usual care arm are informed of their possible depression
      and are encouraged to seek professional treatment.

      The final phase of the study involves data analysis and dissemination of aggregated results.
      Surveys and questionnaires are used to assess participants.
