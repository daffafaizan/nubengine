      falciparum malaria from infected humans to mosquitoes by clearing gametocytes. However, the
      optimal dose for safety and efficacy has not been evaluated. Dose-finding data is important
      because primaquine has a dose-dependent risk of causing haemolysis (destruction of blood
      cells) in pre-disposed individuals, such as those with G6PD deficiency. G6PD deficiency is
      most prevalent in malaria-endemic areas. Therefore, it is essential that data on primaquine's
      safety is available in such areas.

      The investigators hypothesise that lower doses of primaquine have a lower risk of adverse
      effects compared to the WHO-recommended dose, but retain the transmission-blocking efficacy.

      The investigators propose to test this hypothesis in a four-arm clinical trial with a
      non-inferiority design to evaluate the efficacy and a superiority design to evaluate the
      safety of the WHO dose (0.75mg/kg) and lower doses of primaquine for clearance of P.
      falciparum gametocytes in children in Uganda. The study will include a pharmacokinetic
      analysis.
