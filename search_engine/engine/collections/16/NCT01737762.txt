      against Vehicle plus compression therapy in achieving complete wound closure over the 16-week
      treatment period. Vehicle looks the same as HP802-247 but contains no cells. Target wound
      status is evaluated at each study visit (closed, open, reopened). At wound closure or
      completion of treatment all subject will enter an observational safety followed up period
      which ends at one year after initial exposure to test article.
