      daily after previous PCI with coronary stenting were included in the study. Participants were
      randomly assigned to either the pantoprazole 40 mg once-daily group or the ranitidine 150 mg
      twice-daily group using a computer-generated randomized table. An independent investigator
      generated the random allocation sequence. Blood samples were collected at 9:00 on day prior
      to treatment (day 0) and on day 9. Measuring impedance was performed by one independent
      investigator in a blinded manner.
