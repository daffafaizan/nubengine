      labor pain comparing with intravenous opioid analgesic. Many literatures reported effects
      epidural analgesia for labor eg. prolonging the duration of second stage of labor, increasing
      the rate of instrumental delivery: vacuum extraction and forceps assisting labor. Some papers
      revealed the increasing in the rate of cesarean delivery. The main reason is assume to be a
      failure to progress labor after epidural analgesia. However, the recent report from Cochrane
      database systematic review showed no relation of epidural analgesia for labor and the
      increasing in the rate of cesarean delivery. Various factors that may involve in the
      increasing in the rate of cesarean delivery including the dilatation of cervix at the time of
      insertion of epidural catheter, nulliparous, size of the fetus or motor weakness after
      receiving epidural medication.

      The rate of cesarean delivery after epidural analgesia for labor has not been reported in our
      institute. The aim of this study is to elucidate incidence of cesarean delivery in parturient
      whom received epidural analgesia. Besides, factors associated with the rate of cesarean
      delivery were studied.
