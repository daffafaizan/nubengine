      mepivacaine 2%, in combination with epinephrine and diluted with saline solution, it's
      commonly performed in ambulatory phlebectomy procedures.

      Although this kind of anesthesia is among the most effective and safe available, the
      infiltration of local anesthetic is accompanied by pain in the majority of patients. This can
      be particularly important in ambulatory phlebectomy procedures, where large areas need to be
      anesthetized.

      Numerous methods have been proposed to alleviate the pain associated with LIA, such as
      reducing the rate of administration or warming the anesthetic solution.

      Sodium bicarbonate added in small concentrations, can also be effective in reducing
      significantly the pain associated with LIA. A recent trial has confirmed the viability and
      effectiveness of a solution of lidocaine 1% diluted in sodium bicarbonate 1.4%, in varicose
      vein surgery.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness in alleviating the pain associated
      with LIA, of a solution of mepivacaine 2%+epinephrine diluted with sodium bicarbonate 1.4%,
      compared with an analogous solution diluted with normal saline.
