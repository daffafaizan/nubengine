      HIV is quite small, these persons have a high risk of becoming infected and treatments are
      needed to prevent infection after such an exposure. In animal studies, AZT has prevented the
      development of infections after exposure of the animals to a retrovirus (the HIV is a
      retrovirus). In patients with AIDS, AZT has been effective in delaying the progression of the
      disease. For these reasons a trial of AZT is indicated.

      Persons accepted into the study will take AZT capsules every 4 hours (6 times daily) for 42
      days. Treatment with AZT should start as soon as possible, but no later than 5 days, after
      exposure to the HIV. Blood and urine samples for various studies will be taken at intervals
      during the 42-day treatment period, and blood samples will be taken every 3 months for 1 year
      and every 6 months for 2 years and tested for signs of HIV infection (HIV antibody
      determinations).
