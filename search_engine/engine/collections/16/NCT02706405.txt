    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of JCAR014 in combination with durvalumab in adult patients with
      relapsed/refractory (R/R) B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL).

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of durvalumab in combination with JCAR014.

      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of JCAR014.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the antitumor activity of JCAR014 in combination with durvalumab in R/R B-cell
      NHL.

      II. To estimate the duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall
      survival (OS) in patients treated with JCAR014 in combination with durvalumab.

      III. To characterize the PK profile of durvalumab. IV. To assess the immunogenicity of
      JCAR014 and durvalumab.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To assess the pharmacodynamic effects of JCAR014 and durvalumab in blood and within the
      tumor.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of durvalumab administered with a single fixed dose
      of JCAR014. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment arms, listed as Groups 1 and 2 below.

      LYMPHODEPLETING CHEMOTHERAPY: All patients receive cyclophosphamide and fludarabine
      intravenously (IV) for 3 days starting approximately on day -5 or day -4.

      GROUP I: Patients receive JCAR014 IV over 20-30 minutes on day 0 and durvalumab IV over 60
      minutes on day 21 (may occur as early as day 7) and then every 4 weeks for up to 10 doses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      GROUP II: Patients receive durvalumab IV over 60 minutes on day -1, JCAR014 IV over 20-30
      minutes on day 0, then up to 10 additional doses of durvalumab every 4 weeks in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 30 days for 30 months,
      every 3 months for 12 months, then periodically for at least 15 years.
