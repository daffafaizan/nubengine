      patients with AML. The main objective of this study is to investigate its effect (in
      conjunction with cytarabine) on progression free survival, as well as overall survival and
      morphologic response rate in patients with relapsed or refractory AML. This study will also
      attempt to identify specific populations of patients with relapsed or refractory AML who best
      respond to treatment with midostaurin to enhance treatment planning.
