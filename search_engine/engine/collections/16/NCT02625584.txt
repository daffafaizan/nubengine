      grammar abilities, and will be assessed on how they are implemented by caregivers across
      different socio economic groups, and how they affect children's development of these language
      skills. Previous research has found dialogic reading interventions to be less effective for
      children from low socio-economic backgrounds. This project will investigate whether a shared
      reading intervention, designed to require less of a behaviour change from caregivers than
      dialogic reading, can be used to effectively boost vocabulary and grammar development in
      children across the whole socio-economic spectrum.
