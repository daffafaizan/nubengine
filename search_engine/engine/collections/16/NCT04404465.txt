    
      This is a single center, longitudinal, observational cohort study. 3000 subjects are planned
      to be enrolled. Each subject will be consented, enrolled and assigned to a group based on AF
      diagnosis (AF Group, AF Risk Group and Control Group). All subjects will be given mobile
      devices (such as an AliveCor or similar device) for remote ECG monitoring. Additionally,
      sleep and activity can be monitored through a smartphone app (on the Eureka Research
      Platform). All subjects will receive serial blood draws and saliva sample collections to
      collect serum, plasma, whole blood, DNA and RNA in order to observe/identify any changes in
      blood-borne AF markers. Subjects will also undergo serial imaging in the form of an Echo to
      observe/identify markers and/or changes in cardiovascular structure and functioning.
      Evaluations will be taken at baseline and once a year for three years from their baseline
      visit. Additionally, electronic surveys will be administered periodically (eVisits occurring
      every 3-6 months) using the mobile app to observe any changes in participant reported
      symptoms.

      Any participant who receives an AF ablation as part of clinical care will additionally
      receive one in-person follow-up three months post-ablation procedure and an electronic survey
      one month post-ablation procedure to observe changes in symptoms after ablation.

      Subjects will be followed for at least 3 years. The total duration of the study is expected
      to be at least 10 years. It is expected that it will take 3-4 years for subject recruitment
      and at least 3 years for subject follow-up (3 yearly in-person visits), but anticipate the
      digital follow-up to go beyond that (at least 10 years of digital follow-up)
