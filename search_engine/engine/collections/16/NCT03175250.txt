      intervention procedure designed to reduce HIV risk and increase screening for HIV and other
      infections. A randomized trial was conducted (N = 343) to test effects on testing for
      infection (HIV and hepatitis B/C) and condom use frequency in a sample of drug offenders at
      risk for infection. Many populations of drug offenders are not currently receiving
      evidence-based prevention for HIV or hepatitis and are in need of effective interventions
      that can be used in existing drug programs. At three-month follow-up, the results revealed
      that the condition translating basic research on memory practice and integrative processing
      significantly increased the odds of infection testing as compared to two alternative
      conditions. This condition also significantly improved the extent of condom use, compared to
      a traditional health education condition. The results show promise for increased translation
      of basic research on memory to behavioral interventions on health and prevention science.
      Such procedures can be effectively applied in a complex field setting in existing drug
      diversion programs.
