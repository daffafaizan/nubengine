      1.5-3 years in patients with high-grade astrocytomas. Thus, there is a need for further
      therapeutic improvements in this patient population. The purpose of the current trial is to
      explore whether radiotherapy and temozolomide affect the tumor vasculature in patients with
      high-grade astrocytomas. If vascular effects are identified, future clinical trials can be
      proposed wherein anti-angiogenic agents are added to increase patient survival. Additionally,
      stem cells within malignant brain tumors is an important new area of research in this patient
      population, and investigations herein could contribute to identify new predictive markers and
      therapeutic targets.

      Primary objective: To assess the vascular perfusion and permeability characteristics of
      high-grade astrocytomas (anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma multiforme) using dynamic
      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) in patients receiving radiotherapy and
      temozolomide. Furthermore to assess whether therapy-induced changes in tumor perfusion is
      correlated with progression-free survival.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Analyze circulating endothelial cells in the blood by flow cytometry to explore whether
           these cells can be used as an indirect estimate of angiogenesis in high-grade
           astrocytomas

        -  Analyze tumor specimens from patients that have had their gliomas debulked before
           commencing therapy

             -  immunostaining of the tumor vasculature to assess microvessel density

             -  immunostaining for tumor stem cells

             -  flow cytometric assessment of dissolved tumor tissue to look for tumor stem cells

        -  Assess progression-free survival of all patients included in the study, in order to
           correlate the survival data with the above tissue sampling results.
