      randomized crossover clinical trial was performed with 30 patients (66.5 Â± 17.3 years) with
      hypersecretion. The ventilator hyperinflation was performed in five ventilatory modalities
      for five minutes, with an interval of 2 hours, the order being determined by randomization:
      controlled ventilation at volume (VCV) with constant flow of 20 (VCV20) Lpm and 40 Lpm
      (VCV40), controlled ventilation pressure ventilation (PCV), controlled pressure ventilation
      associated with inspiratory time adjustment (PCV + Tins) and support pressure ventilation
      (PSV). In VCV mode, the volume was increased every 50mL, until reaching a maximum pressure of
      40cmH2O. In the pressure controlled modes, the inspiratory pressure was increased every 5
      cmH2O until the total pressure reached 40 cmH2O. The inspiratory time was adjusted so that
      the inspiratory flow reached the baseline. The following variables were evaluated: tidal
      volume, inspiratory time (Tins), mean airway pressure (Pmean), peak inspiratory flow (PIFR)
      and expiratory flow (PEFR), PIFR / PEFR and Bias Flow (PEFR-PIFR).
