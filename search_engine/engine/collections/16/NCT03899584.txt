      continuity will be recruited in the departments of neurology, neurosurgery or rehabilitation
      from hospitals of Social Security Mexican Institute (IMSS) in 8 states . Just patients who
      meeting inclusion criteria, will be selected for the study until reach 150. After signing an
      informed consent, they will be randomized into 75 for the intervention arm and 75 for the
      placebo arm. All patients will receive capsules for daily consumption according to their
      assignment. They will receive ascending doses of the drug starting with 10 milligrams and
      progressively increasing every 2 to 4 weeks 10 mg until reaching the maximum dose proposed
      according to weight (maximum 1 mg/kg/d). Questionnaires and functional evaluations will be
      administered at the beginning of the study, and at the end of the treatment to evaluate the
      efficacy. The evaluations include the International Standards for Neurological Classification
      of Spinal Cord Injury motor and sensory Scale, the Spinal Cord Injury Independence Measure
      (SCIM III), quality of life (SF-36), sphincter bladder/anal sensation/control in both genders
      and psychogenic erection in males as primary outcomes.

      After the follow-up period, all test results will be analyzed and compared to determine the
      efficacy and safety of 4-aminopyridine. The Mann-Whitney U and Chi-square test will be used
      for statistical analysis.
