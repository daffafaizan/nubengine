      subjects will be sent home with a wireless, portable thermal therapy device and examined pre
      and post treatment period. Subjects will be asked to use the device at bedtime for 5 minutes
      daily for 4 weeks. After treatment subjects will be re-examined and measured for clinical and
      symptomatic change in their MGD as well as changes to their sleep quality and anxiety index.
      Subjects will also be followed after treatment has been completed.
