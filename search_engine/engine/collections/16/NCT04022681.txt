    
      The Birmingham and Lambeth Liver Evaluation Strategies (BALLETS) study was a prospective
      study of people in General Practice who had an abnormal liver function test result.
      Recruitment took place between 2005 and 2008, and patients were able to be grouped into four
      primary categories: hepato-cellular disease, hepato-biliary disease, tumour, non-specific
      with or without fatty liver. This study will focus on the fourth, non-specific, group of
      which there were 1,237 patients.

      This study will follow-up this cohort of patients using a database search based on their
      individual National Health Service (NHS) numbers. The investigators will interrogate the
      Hospital Episode Statistics database (health outcomes) and the Office of National Statistics
      database (death), and examine three categories of end points: death, inpatient attendance
      primarily due to liver disease, and outpatient attendance primarily due to liver disease.
      Deaths would be sub-categorised as including liver disease, or not.

      A logistic regression analysis will then be conducted to determine associations between these
      end points and the presence, and degree, of fatty liver in the original BALLETS study, with
      adjustment for age and sex. Similar age- and sex-adjusted analyses will be conducted to
      investigate the association with other patient risk factors - alcohol intake and BMI. The
      analyses will be repeated incorporating an additional adjustment for baseline Alanine
      Aminotransferase (ALT) measurement.
