      moderate AS generally is well tolerated severe AS is associated with considerable morbidity
      and mortality.

      The consequence of AS is increased pressure load on the left ventricle, which causes changes
      in the ventricular function and structure (Left ventricular remodeling, hypertrophy,
      fibrosis).

      With longstanding elevated filling pressures the left atrium will dilate and heart failure
      symptoms will develop.

      When apparent, symptoms of heart failure, in AS are associated with high mortality rate and
      aortic valve replacement (AVR) is recommended.

      The clinical assessment of heart failure symptoms in AS is however challenging particularly
      in the elderly, as symptoms progress slowly and may mimic age related fragility.

      In this observational study, the goal is to investigate the importance and possible
      implications of left atrial dilation and heart failure among 100 patients with asymptomatic
      severe aortic stenosis. Participants undergo echocardiographic evaluation for diastolic heart
      failure and we assess myocardial fibrosis using magnetic resonance imaging and exercise
      testing with invasive hemodynamic monitoring (right heart catheterization).

      LA dilatation may potentially identify patients likely benefiting of early surgery. The
      importance and possible implications of LA dilatation in asymptomatic AS patients has however
      not yet been established.
