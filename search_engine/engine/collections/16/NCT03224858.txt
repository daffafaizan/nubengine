      care for "high utilizer" patients with medical, behavioral, and social complexity. A small
      proportion of patients use > 50 % of healthcare resources. It is currently unknown what
      interventions can help reduce inappropriate utilization due to lack of studies with rigorous
      study design, particularly in patients with high rates of homelessness, mental illness and
      substance use. The use of high-risk teams for select patients is a promising model of primary
      care that removes barriers to accessing usual care services by centralizing medical and
      behavioral clinical services, promotes ability to outreach beyond the clinic, and promote
      continuity of care and trust-building between patient and provider teams.

      This study will test the hypothesis that a stand-alone clinic based intervention of a
      multidisciplinary, co-located physician, mental health behaviorist, nursing, pharmacist, and
      care coordinators with reduced panel size, and focus on patient capacity building and
      decreasing treatment burden will improve health outcomes at 6 and 12 months in a low-income
      high utilizer population with history of homelessness.

      Enhanced usual care comprises of care delivered at Old Town Clinic (OTC) a Federally
      Qualified Health Center (FQHC) that is modeled on the Patient Centered Medical Home (PCMH)
      model. Patients have a designated primary care physician and care team with access to chronic
      disease education, mental health, social work, and substance abuse programs through referral
      system. In addition, participants thought to have difficulty engaging in primary care have
      access to a Health Resilience Specialist, a community health worker intervention who conducts
      outreach and assists the patient in care navigation.
