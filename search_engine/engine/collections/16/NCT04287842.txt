      pore permeability. Mitochondria pores opening results in a release of factors triggering
      apoptosis. primarily the cytochrome ะก Inhibition of the pores opening protects ischemic
      damage of the cells. The key enzyme regulating the mitochondrial permeability transition pore
      is glycogen synthase-kinase 3b (GSK-3b): the phosphorylation of the enzyme inactivates the
      enzyme and prevents pore opening. We have shown in previous study that preconditioning with
      sevoflurane increases the content of the phosphorylated form of 6SK-3b and protects the
      mitochondria of neurons in rats brain during ischemia/reperfusion. Aim of studi is to
      determine content of the phosphorylated GS K-3b in neurons of rat brain in the model of total
      ischemia/reperfusion influenced by: 1 MAC desflurane vs control group; 1 MAC desflurane vs 1
      MAC sevoflurane and 1 MAC desflurane vs training ischemia.
