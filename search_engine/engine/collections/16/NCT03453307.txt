        1. Enrolled patients (before or after surgery) were treated with chemotherapy or target
           therapy. The medication regime and treatment cycle were decided based on the clinical
           guideline and evidence-based medicine. This clinical study will not affect the treatment
           plan of the patients.

        2. The resection tissue or biopsy tissue of NSCLC will be collected, and subject to ex vivo
           3-D culture to establish patient-derived tumor organoid models, which will be used for
           drug sensitivity test.

        3. The patient-derived organoid-based drug sensitivity test will be compared with clinical
           treatment data of chemotherapy or target therapy, followed by correlation analysis.
