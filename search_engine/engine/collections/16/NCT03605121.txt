      reflects abdominal obesity and may increase cardio-metabolic risk and all-cause
      morbidity/mortality. In this observational study, we will review the electronic medical
      records of patients underwent cardiac surgery and assess their waist circumference, measured
      on preoperative computed tomography, as well as body mass index. The relationship between
      body mass index or waist circumference and mortality after cardiac surgery will be analysed.
