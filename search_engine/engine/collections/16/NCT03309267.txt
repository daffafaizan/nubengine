      were examined. A retrospective evaluation was made of the data that was retrieved from the
      records of a total of 49 patients aged 18-75 years, ASA I-III, who were applied with
      Intercostal (IB) or Serratus anterior plane(SAPB) for a thoracotomy operation. The patient
      information was retrieved from the patient records and anesthesia block forms. The data were
      examined in respect of age, sex, height, weight, ASA, operation type, operating time, the
      amount of postoperative analgesic consumption, VAS at 1.,2.,4.,6.,12.,24. hours and
      complications (atelectasis, nausea, vomiting, hypotension and bradycardia).

      Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS program for Mac, version 17.0
      (SPSS,Chicago,IL). Descriptive statistics are presented as mean and SD, and as the number of
      cases (n) and the corresponding percentage (%) for nominal variables. T tests were performed
      for normally continuous variables. The Mann-Whitney U test was used for non-parametric
      variables. A value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
