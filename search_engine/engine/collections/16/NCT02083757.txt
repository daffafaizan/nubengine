      critically ill patients. Although hemodynamic maximization was proposed, this approach was
      associated with a risk of fluid overload and excessive inotropic support. Therefore, fluid
      optimization was seen as a significant step forward and has been shown to decrease
      complications. Significant effort has been devoted to defining and developing simple means
      for predicting fluid responsiveness, i.e. whether the patient will benefit from fluid
      administration. Passive leg raising (PLR), a bedside performed test, could be used to
      accurately predict fluid responsiveness in most conditions.

      However, most parameters that provide information about fluid responsiveness during volume
      expansion and PLR are invasive and time-consuming. A completely noninvasive and atraumatic
      parameter to predict fluid responsiveness might be need urgently. Transcutaneous partial
      pressure of oxygen (PtcO2), a measure to detect tissue ischemia or inadequate perfusion,
      might reflect the change in cardiac output, thus predict fluid responsiveness. The purpose of
      this study was to study the feasibility of predicting fluid responsiveness by transcutaneous
      partial pressure of oxygen in the critically ill patients.
