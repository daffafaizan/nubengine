    
      - Patients will be randomized to receive regimen A (AC) and regimen B(TX), preoperatively,as
      follows: Regimen A (AC): Intravenous infusion of Adriamycin 60mg/m2 , over 30 min, onD1 and
      Intravenous infusion of cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 over 30 min on D1. Regimen B(TX):
      Intravenous infusion of Taxotere 75 mg/m2 over 1 hr, on D1, and Xeloda 1000mg/m2.p.o. BID x
      14days on D1-D14 The cycle repeats every 3 weeks for 4 times. Premedication for regimen A
      includes antiemetics, for regimen B, dexamethasone as routinely given.

      Patients who do not respond to the initial two cycles of preoperative chemotherapy will
      undergo operation.

      The response rate will be determined by the number of patients with complete and partial
      responses according to RECIST guidelines. Pathologic complete response is defined as no
      pathologic evidence of residual disease. Safety will be evaluated by the frequency, severity,
      and relationship of adverse events graded by NCI Common Toxicity Criteria(CTC) that occur
      during the treatment and follow-up periods. Time to disease progression will be calculated
      from the date of study entry to the first objective documentation of progressive disease.
      Response duration will be measured from the date a patient first fulfills the CR or PR
      criteria to the first date of objective documentation of disease progression. Survival time
      will be calculated from the date of study entry to the date of death
