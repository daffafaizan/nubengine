      followed by a qualitative design. Sixty participants will be randomly assigned to the 8-week
      mindfulness course (n=30) or a wait-list control group (n=30). Block randomisation will be
      used and the randomisation scheme will be generated using the randomisation.com website.
      One-hour sessions will be delivered to groups of 5 people using Skype video-conferencing. As
      this is a pilot study analyses will largely be descriptive. Further, inferential analyses
      using mixed modelling will be conducted by intention-to-treat. At the end of the
      intervention, the investigators will interview the participants of the mindfulness group
      about their experiences of the course.
