    
      Cryoneurolysis, is a novel technique that can yield temporary blockade of superficial sensory
      nerves, generating immediate and meaningful relief of pain.The technique generates an
      axonotmesis of the targeted peripheral nerves by percutaneously applying low temperatures
      (-100 °C to -20 °C). Wallerian degeneration is produced whereby the axons and the myelin
      sheath are damaged but the endoneurium, perineurium and epineurium remain intact. Therefore,
      permanent damage to the nerve is avoided as it retains its regenerative properties. With
      regards to the knee, the infrapatellar branch of the saphenous nerve (IPBSN), a sensory
      branch serving both the inferior and anterior portion of the knee capsule and the
      antero-medial skin of the knee is the prime target for the procedure.

      Your participation in this study requires that you allow the radiology department of Texas
      Orthopedic Hospital to administer Cryoneurolysis using the Iovera device with the functional
      smart tip approximately 1 week prior to total knee arthroplasty surgery. A highly localized
      cold zone is created via the Joule-Thompson effect as nitrous oxide enters the needles.
      Nothing is injected into the body and the nitrous oxide gas is vented safely out of the
      handpiece. Cryoneurolysis is administered following local anesthesia.
