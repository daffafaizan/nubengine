      included, subjects had to have deep partial-thickness burn injuries. The subjects were
      consecutively allocated to a subject code providing they fulfilled all inclusion criteria and
      none of the exclusion criteria and had signed a written informed consent form. Two evaluators
      independent of each other made the judgment regarding depth of the burn before enrolling a
      subject. The subjects were randomized to either receive Mepilex Ag or SSD.

      Treatment period were up to four weeks with either SSD or Mepilex Ag. Changes of the
      investigation products were performed according to a standardized schedule, unless the wound
      healed before.
