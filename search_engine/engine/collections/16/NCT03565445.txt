    
      This is a dose-escalation and expansion study of ASP1948 as a single agent and in combination
      with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. The study consists of 3 periods for monotherapy and
      combination therapy: screening, treatment and follow up, followed by an optional Re-treatment
      period for participants that qualify.

      The escalation cohorts will evaluate escalating dose levels of ASP1948 in participants with
      locally advanced (unresectable) or metastatic solid tumor malignancies.

      After discontinuation of study drug, all participants will complete an end-of-treatment
      visit, along with 30-day and 90-day safety follow-up visits from the last dose of study drug.

      For dose expansion, the tumor-specific cohorts will include participants with squamous cell
      carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer and breast
      cancer, as well as any tumor types that respond to study drug treatment during dose
      escalation.
