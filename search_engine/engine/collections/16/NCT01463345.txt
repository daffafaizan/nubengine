      cardiac surgery. Despite the many blood conservation techniques that are available, safe, and
      efficacious for patients, many of these operations continue to be associated with significant
      amounts of blood usage. We believe that transfusion protocols which employ specific
      guidelines for transfusion can decrease blood product usage and improve outcomes for patients
      undergoing cardiac surgery. Our goal is to demonstrate that a carefully chosen trigger can
      achieve better outcomes.

      Our hypothesis is that a transfusion trigger of Hgb 7.5 g/dl will lead to decreased
      utilization of blood transfusions and will have many positive effects on the patients post
      cardiac surgery in addition to substantial cost savings. We will use an evidence based
      approach to observe the relative safety of a conservative transfusion trigger (7.5 g/dl) as
      compared to a more liberal trigger (9.0 g/dl). We will also study the effect of blood
      conservation on the incidence of transfusion-related complications such as transfusion
      related lung injury (TRALI) and infectious complications as well as length of hospital stay,
      cost and ventilator time.
