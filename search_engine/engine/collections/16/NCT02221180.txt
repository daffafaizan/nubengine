    
      This is a randomized (study medication assigned to participants by chance), open-label
      (identity of study drug will be known to volunteer and study staff), single-center,
      single-dose, 4-treatment, 4-way crossover (method used to switch participants from one study
      group to another in a clinical trial, like the flip of a coin) study in healthy adult
      participants. The study will have 3 phases: Screening Phase (approximately 3 weeks, Day -22
      to Day -2), Open-Label Treatment Phase (consisting of 4 single-dose treatment periods of 3
      days each [Day -1 to Day 2], each separated by a washout period of 7 days) and Follow-up
      Phase (5 to 7 days after last study-related procedure on Day 2 of treatment period 4). All
      the eligible participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment sequences and will
      receive 2 treatments under fasting and 2 treatments under fed conditions. Blood samples will
      be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the body,
      distributed within the body, and how it is removed from the body over time) at pre-dose and
      post-dose of study treatment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
