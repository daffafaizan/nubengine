      decreased immune function, increased protein catabolism, and may compromise the ability to
      wean patients from mechanical ventilation. Critically ill patients may appear to sleep
      throughout most of their stay, but their quality of sleep is different from that of a normal
      healthy subject.Critically ill patients spend more time in the wakefulness stages of sleep
      (Stage 1 and 2) at the expense of the restorative stages (Stage 3 and 4) and REM sleep. These
      patients also experience an increased number of arousals and awakenings. Various factors are
      thought to be the cause of abnormal sleep architecture: ICU environment, pain, illness
      severity, psychosocial stress, medications, and mechanical ventilation.

      Sodium oxybate (Xyrem®) is the sodium salt of the central nervous system depressant
      γ-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) and is currently approved for use in narcoleptic patients to
      improve cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness.

      Studies evaluating the use of sodium oxybate in narcoleptic patients suggest that sodium
      oxybate is effective at increasing slow-wave sleep, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and
      REM-sleep efficiency, while also decreasing REM-sleep latency, stage 1 NREM sleep and sleep
      fragmentation.3, 16-19 Currently there is a lack of data evaluating the effects of sodium
      oxybate on sleep in critically ill patients. Obtaining evidence that sodium oxybate improves
      sleep architecture in the critically ill, may provide the foundation to complete future
      studies evaluating the effect of sodium oxybate on clinical outcomes such as duration of
      mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay. Based on sodium oxybate's ability to improve
      sleep architecture in narcoleptic patients along with the fact that critically ill patients
      have similar disrupted sleep architecture, it's postulated that sodium oxybate may improve
      the sleep architecture in critically ill patients.
