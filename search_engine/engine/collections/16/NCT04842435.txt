    
      Objective:

      To study the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of COVID-globulin, in addition to standard
      therapy for the treatment of patients with a moderate COVID-19 form.

      Study Objectives:

      The study comprises two stages, 1 and 2 Stage 1 tasks

        1. to determine and compare the safety parameters of COVID-globulin after a single infusion
           at doses of 1 mL/kg, 2 mL/kg, 4 mL/kg and placebo in addition to standard therapy in the
           treatment of patients with COVID-19;

        2. to determine and compare the efficacy parameters of COVID-globulin after a single
           infusion at doses of 1 mL/kg, 2 mL/kg, 4 mL/kg and placebo in addition to standard
           therapy in the treatment of patients with COVID-19;

        3. to determine the optimal therapeutic dose of COVID-globulin for the treatment of
           patients with moderate COVID-19 by comparing the safety and efficacy parameters of doses
           of 1 mL/kg, 2 mL/kg, 4 mL/kg and placebo;

        4. to study the pharmacokinetic parameters of COVID-globulin in the blood plasma of
           patients after a single infusion at a dose of 1 mL/kg, 2 mL/kg, 4 mL/kg, in addition to
           standard therapy for the treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19

      Stage 2 tasks

        1. to study the efficacy of COVID-globulin, in addition to standard therapy, for the
           treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19;

        2. to study the safety of COVID-globulin, in addition to standard therapy, for the
           treatment of patients with moderate COVID-19;

        3. to conduct a comparative analysis of the efficacy and safety of a group of patients with
           moderate COVID-19 disease who receive COVID-globulin in addition to the standard
           therapy, and a group of patients who receive placebo in addition to standard therapy.
