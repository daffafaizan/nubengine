      double blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel group study to evaluate the efficacy
      of Sativex in subjects with pain due to diabetic neuropathy. Subjects were screened to
      determine eligibility and completed a seven-day baseline period. Subjects then returned to
      the centre for assessment, randomisation and dose introduction. Visits occurred at the end of
      weeks two, six, ten and at the end of the study (treatment week 14) or earlier if they
      withdrew. A follow up visit occurred 28 days after completion or withdrawal. Subjects in this
      study were given the opportunity to be enrolled in an open label extension study.
