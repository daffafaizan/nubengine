      couples. While condom use has been a major component of most AIDS prevention programs since
      the mid-1980s, there has been little emphasis on promoting condom use within stable
      partnerships. The most effective way to promote condom use among discordant couples remains
      largely unknown.

      A pilot study to assess the acceptability of intervention precedes the main study. The Phase
      I study recruits 15 HIV-infected men and 15 HIV-infected women and their partners at each of
      three sites (India, Thailand, and Uganda). Volunteers participate in a multi-session
      group-based condom promotion program for approximately 12 months. Couples are organized into
      small groups consisting of 4 to 6 couples per group. Each group meets for a total of 4
      sessions within a 2- to 4-week period. Follow-up interviews are conducted at Months 1 and 3
      following completion of the intervention.
