      connective tissue (JCT) disorder (i.e. arthritis, lupus, gout, fibromyalgia, neck or back
      pain, etc.). As the population ages, this estimate is expected to grow rapidly. Traditional
      treatments for most of these disorders attempt to address only the symptoms (pain,
      inflammation, and discomfort) associated with the diseases. This usually involves the use of
      analgesics (i.e. acetaminophen, oxycodone, propoxyphene) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
      drugs (NSAIDs) (i.e. ibuprofen, diclofenac, celecoxib), alone or in combination. Most of
      these treatments have shown limited effectiveness in randomized controlled clinical trials
      (RCTs) or are known to have significant and sometimes severe side effects. To avoid the
      cardiac risks, gastrointestinal issues , and dependency issues associated with traditional
      JCT treatments (particularly with long-term use), many patients have turned to complementary
      and alternative medicines (CAMs) such as dietary supplements.

      Glucosamine, chondroitin, and methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) alone and in combination, are
      widely marketed as dietary supplements to treat joint pain due to osteoarthritis (OA). Other
      vitamins, minerals, and botanicals such as kava, pine bark extract, capsicum, boswellia root
      extract, turmeric/curcumin, etc. are also marketed for various JCT pain maladies. We present
      here the use of eggshell membrane as a possible new natural therapeutic for JCT disorders. A
      single center, open label human clinical study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of NEMÂ® as a treatment for pain associated with joint and connective tissue disorders.
      Subjects were to take NEM, 500mg, once daily for 30 days. Subjects were then evaluated for
      pain.
