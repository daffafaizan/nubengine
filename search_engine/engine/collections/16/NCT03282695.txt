      carried out, to which the treatment with ozone will be offered, without giving up the planned
      surgical intervention.

      The main objective of this prospective, post-authorization follow-up study is to estimate the
      cost-effectiveness of ozone therapy (compared to standard care) in patients with disc
      herniation waiting for surgery (by microdiscectomy). Besides utilities of patients with disc
      herniation on a waiting list for surgery will be estimated, social/economic burden of disc
      herniation will be quantified and a decision aid will be developed and applied.

      The main outcome measures are "Direct hospital cost", "Percentage of executed surgeries" and
      "Change in sciatic pain". In addition, data on health-related quality of life and resource
      utilization will be collected which will permit to estimate the incremental
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), comparing incremental costs and quality adjusted life years
      (QALY).

      The variables will be collected at the beginning, on the day of treatment and at 1, 3, 6, 12
      and 24 months. The enrollment period will be 24 months. The follow-up period will be 24
      months.

      The results of the study will allow a better understanding of the value of ozone therapy in
      the management of patients on the waiting list for herniated disc surgery. In addition, it
      will contribute to the development of a more patient-centered health system.
