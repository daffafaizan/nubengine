      dengue virus (DV)-induced DAP12 phosphorylation. Data suggests that CLEC5A is a potential
      therapeutic target for dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF)/dengue shock syndrome (DSS). This
      project will study the genes of CLEC5A, Mannose receptor, DC-SIGN, NALP, decoy receptor 3
      (DcR3), Toll-like receptors(TLRs), and (Nod)-like receptors (NLRs) for both DF and DHF
      groups. In addition, serum level of decoy receptor 3 (DcR3) will be tested. The study will
      collect the blood samples from 350 healthy persons and 350 persons infected with dengue
      fever.
