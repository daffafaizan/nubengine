      preserve spinal mobility. In the early stages of the disease, spinal stiffness is reversible
      but eventually the spine can fuse causing permanent loss of flexion. Traditional tests for
      spinal mobility using tape measures are inaccurate and do not capture many aspects of
      kinematics such as spinal rotation or speed of movement. There is also a need for wearable
      sensors to give patients feedback and encourage more regular exercise.

      The investigators will be using IMU spinal sensors to measure spinal ROM in a group of 40
      patients with axial spondyloarthritis. The investigators will be testing aspects of
      inter-rater and intra-rater reliability, comparing sensor reliability to the accuracy of the
      traditional tape measure test (BASMI).
