      important factor in the distribution of fat and lean tissue in the body. Previous studies
      suggested that the GH response to aerobic exercise may be attenuated by obesity. The effect
      of obesity on GH response to anaerobic effort is unclear. The aim of the present study is to
      asses the effect of obesity on anaerobic exercise's GH response. We will recruit 12 obese
      (BMI > 30) healthy adults and 12 age and gender matched normal weight (BMI < 25) controls.
      All the participants will conduct a "wingate" anaerobic test (30 seconds of intense effort
      against resistance calculated by the individual's body weight). Blood sample for GH level
      will be collected at 5 different time (0, 20, 30, 40 and 60 minutes after the test). We will
      compare the GH response in the two groups.
