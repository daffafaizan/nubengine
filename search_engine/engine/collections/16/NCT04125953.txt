      from diagnosis through treatment and throughout cancer survivorship (fear of cancer
      recurrence), this study focusses on activation the parasympathetic nervous system and making
      patients as comfortable as possible during treatment. The scope of this study is based on
      previous research, that has shown that controlling physical and psychological complications
      during treatment may have a positive (preventive) effect on late term and long-term quality
      of life and survival outcomes. Breast cancer patients will receive andullation during their
      irradiation period. The primary outcome measure of the autonomic nervous system is vagal
      nerve activity, a modulator of the parasympathetic nervous system. Secondary outcome measures
      are stress, pain and lymphedema.
