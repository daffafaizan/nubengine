      participation in the study after giving their written consent. After a second contact with
      the participants, forms regarding the inclusion and exclusion criteria were sent for
      completion.

      Of the 136 that initially answered positively for participation, 62 did not meet the
      inclusion criteria, based on their reports and the clinical examination by a health
      professional. Of the remaining 74 participants, 32 were excluded because of previous low back
      pain incidents and other recent musculoskeletal injuries that led to rehabilitation, while 22
      decided to not participate for personal reasons.

      The remaining 20 participants were randomly allocated to either training group or
      intervention group, by a neutral, blinded investigator who had no involvement and was unaware
      of the study purposes. The intervention group will be trained and supervised by a certified
      fitness instructor in a gym class, who will be responsible for the correct execution of the
      exercises. The duration of the intervention will be 5 weeks, 3 times a week.
