    
      Prospective, randomized, controlled trial of transeptal, transcatheter mitral valve-in-valve
      versus redo surgical mitral valve replacement.

      After multidisciplinary, heart team discussion, patients meeting inclusion criteria will be
      randomized 1:1 to receive either transcatheter, transeptal mitral valve-in-valve replacement
      (TsMViV) with the SAPIEN 3 transcatheter heart valve (THV) or redo, mitral valve replacement
      with 3 commercially available surgical bioprosthetic valves. A sub-randomization in the
      surgical group will define which bioprosthetic valve will be used. Patients will be seen for
      follow-up visits at discharge, 30 days, 6 months and annually through 10 years.
