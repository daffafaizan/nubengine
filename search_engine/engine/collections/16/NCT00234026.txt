      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of gemcitabine, in terms of objective response and tolerability,
           in patients with newly diagnosed, relapsed, or chemotherapy-resistant mantle cell
           lymphoma.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to progression and time to treatment failure in patients treated with
           this drug.

        -  Determine the response duration in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the adverse reactions in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3
      weeks for up to 9 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6
      months for 1 year, and then annually for 3 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-29 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
