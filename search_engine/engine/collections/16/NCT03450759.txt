    
      This study is a randomized, open-label, single-center study conducted on 12 healthy male
      subjects. This consists of three periods:

        -  Screening period (only prior to Day-1)

        -  Residential/treatment period (Part A and Part B)

        -  Follow-up period (5 to 7 days after-final dose)

      The study is divided into 2 parts: Part A and B. The subjects will participate in both Part A
      and Part B. Part A will be a 4-way cross-over study to compare the PK of 3 different solid
      formulations with different release rates with an oral suspension of AZD9977 in fasting
      conditions. Subjects in Part A will receive the following treatments on Days 1, 3, 5 and 7:

        -  AZD9977 oral suspension 15 mg/mL (15 mg/mL = 195 mg) (reference)

        -  AZD9977 capsule, 65 mg (3 x 65 mg = 195 mg)

        -  AZD9977 extended release (ER) capsule, 65 mg, fast (3 x 65 mg = 195 mg)

        -  AZD9977 ER capsule, 65 mg, intermediate release (Int) (3 x 65 mg = 195 mg) Subjects will
           be resident from 1 day before Part A until at least 36 hours post last dosing in Part A.
           Subjects will return to the unit for Part B after completion of Part A. There will be a
           washout period of at least 2 days between the doses for a subject. Based on the results
           in Part A, one of the solid formulations will be selected and evaluated in fed
           conditions on Day of Part B. Subjects will return to the unit for a final study visit 5
           to 7 days post- dose in Part B. Each subject will be involved in the study for
           approximately 9 weeks.
