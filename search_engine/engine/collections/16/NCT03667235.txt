      for 10 minutes to improve stability (OKAZI technique).

      This study investigates whether treatment with 0.6% glutaraldehyde for 20 minutes improves
      mechanic and thermic stability of autologous pericardial tissue. Autologous pericardium
      remaining after aortic valve reconstruction surgery is used.

      To investigate 10 versus 20 minutes treatment of removed original aortic valve tissue with
      glutaraldehyde as a reference.
