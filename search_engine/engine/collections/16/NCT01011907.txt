      needs. Although there has been some progress with pharmacotherapy for alcohol-dependent
      individuals, a critical need for the development of novel and additional therapeutic
      approaches remains. Pharmacotherapy development for AUDs as a therapeutic area has had
      several recent advancements, where clinically as well as commercially successful additions to
      available treatment options are available and several more are expected in the near future.
      Based on recent preclinical work, we believe that varenicline has potential to become one of
      the first among those newly evolving treatments.

      In this study, participants with nicotine dependence will receive standard varenicline or
      placebo treatment over the recommended course of 12 weeks. Since our research question
      addresses whether alcohol drinking also diminishes with varenicline treatment, we will not
      ask participants to alter alcohol use; we will simply follow their use over time. Study
      visits will take place at the Ernest Gallo Clinic and Research Center. The procedures to be
      completed include vital signs, blood samples at screening and end of study, urine toxicology
      screening and the completion of standard questionnaires. No special facilities are required
      for these procedures. Group therapy (which is not a research procedure, but part of standard
      nicotine dependence treatment) will take place at the Gallo Center.
