      been shown to be efficacious in reducing drinking in non-HIV samples. Our goal is to
      determine whether offering counseling beyond Brief Advice, namely MI, has greater alcohol
      reduction effects. In the proposed randomized trial, all 300 HIV-HCV co-infected participants
      will receive BA delivered by their HIV PCP during a regular HIV visit and will then be
      randomized to either a 30-minute Motivational Interviewing Intervention with a Behavioral
      Counselor (MI) or to HIV clinic treatment-as-usual. After this initial meeting, drinking
      "check-in" (MI or BA) sessions will then be provided telephonically every three months for 18
      months. Research assessments will also be done every three months, with a final assessment at
      24 months. Our primary outcome is drinks per week.
