      which is that there is greater oxidative stress associated with a proinflammatory state, or
      even metabolic alterations after exposure to heavy metals, as well as differences in
      intestinal microbiota. This situation could negatively influence the correct establishment of
      neuronal synapses and their functioning, which have still been poorly investigated,
      especially in children. In this way, an early intervention with nutritional supplements with
      DHA, which could be deficient in autism, could decrease the proinflammatory and oxidative
      stress state, favoring the formation of neuronal synapses as well as their activity. This
      intervention could positively influence to prevent the clinical deterioration associated with
      ASD and it would be of special interest in early childhood since at this stage of
      neurodevelopment there is maximum neuronal plasticity.
