      target lesion, Pd）to mean proximal pressure (aortic pressure, Pa) in the coronary
      artery(Pd/Pa) while the maximal hyperemic flow is achieved. Nowadays, FFR-guided PCI is
      highly recommended for the assessment of physiologic ischemia in intermediate coronary
      lesions. However, hyperemia with adenosine was an elemental process in FFR examination.
      Adenosine injection will induce some discomfort, and increase cost expenditure. Based on the
      clinical and physiologic outcome study, a lot of non-hyperemic indexes had been proposed, and
      adenosine injection could be waived. Whereas, these novel physiologic indexes are limited to
      the proprietary software of each vendor, curtailing clinical application. Intracoronary
      nitroglycerin injection was needed before each FFR assessment. Nitroglycerine will induce an
      acute drop of Pd/Pa, and this lowest Pd/Pa was determined as NTG-Pd/Pa. NTG-Pd/Pa has a
      linear relationship with FFR value and has a good diagnostic accuracy to predict FFR≤0.80 in
      our recent study. There is only one prospective study report on the relationship between
      NTG-Pd/Pa and FFR. In this study, we aim to evaluate the safety of NTG-Pd/Pa, the
      repeatability and dose-response of this novel index. Furthermore, we will investigate the
      diagnostic accuracy of NTG-Pd/Pa, with FFR≤0.8 and Resting full-cycle ratio≤0.89 as ischemic
      threshold respectively.
