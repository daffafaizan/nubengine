      countries. In France, primary resistance to isoniazid and rifampicin were estimated at,
      respectively, 5.2%, and 1.2 %. Based on these estimates, French guidelines currently
      recommends to initiate a 4-drug containing regimen associating isoniazid (INH or H),
      rifampicin (RIFor RMP or R), pyrazinamide (PZA or Z) and ethambutol (EMB or E) pending the
      results of drug susceptibility testing (DST). The rationale behind routine use of EMB is to
      prevent the emergence of resistance to rifampicin (RMP), in case of primary resistance to
      INH. Hence, early detection of resistance to INH and RIF using molecular testing in
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis could allow early adaptation of antituberculosis treatment: i)
      start with a 3-drug containing regimen (i.e. INH, RIF, and PZA), in patients with fully
      susceptible isolates (currently 95% of cases); ii) early enforcement of treatment when
      resistance is suspected, pending in depth susceptibility testings. GenoType Â®MTB DR plus
      sensitivity for RIF and INH resistance detection has been estimated at 100% and 83%,
      respectively.
