    
      The aim of the survey is to describe the current and past patterns of use of tobacco products
      in the general adult population of the Greater London area and in adult IQOS users registered
      in the IQOS user database of Philip Morris Limited (UK IQOS User Database), and explore their
      association with key independent variables. More specifically, the objectives are:

        1. Estimate the prevalence of current tobacco use status in the study population.

        2. Describe the past tobacco use status (cigarette, IQOS and other innovative products,
           including e-cigarettes) in the study population (i.e. never-use, initiation, product use
           transition, cessation, re-initiation, and relapse).

        3. Explore the association between self-reported health status and use of tobacco products
           in the study population.

        4. Explore the association between patterns of IQOS use including motivation to use,
           mis-use, satisfaction, and self-reported changes since switching to the product (in a
           number of domains where IQOS may have potential benefits), and consumer's satisfaction
           in the population of IQOS users in the Greater London area registered in UK IQOS User
           Database.
