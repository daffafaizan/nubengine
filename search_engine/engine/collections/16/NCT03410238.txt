      primary care settings and test implementation of the Saferteens brief intervention in primary
      care using the RE-AIM framework: reach (e.g., number of patients screened and given BI);
      effectiveness (e.g., change in violent behaviors, peer victimization, and violence-related
      consequences among intervention and control groups); adoption (e.g., number of providers
      trained, hours participated in training); implementation (e.g., participant ratings of
      intervention); and maintenance (e.g., ongoing screening and interventions during maintenance
      phase). Specifically, a control sample of youth ages 14-18 will be obtained, who will
      complete a baseline and 3-month follow-up survey, but who will not receive the intervention,
      and an intervention sample of youth ages 14-18 will be obtained, who will receive the
      Saferteens BI and will complete a baseline and 3-month follow-up survey. These data will
      provide a control sample for testing effectiveness of the Saferteens intervention package,
      versus the intervention sample.
