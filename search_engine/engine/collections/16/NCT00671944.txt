      followed by a 6.5-week experimental period. During the adjustment period, subjects consume a
      well-balanced lead-in diet designed to stabilize baseline Ca homeostasis. In the subsequent
      experimental period, subjects will consume the experimental diet containing 0.7 g protein/kg,
      800-1200 mg phosphorus, 800 mg calcium and 2300 mg sodium. During days -6 to -1 of the
      adjustment diet, 5-10 and days 40-45 of the experimental period, we will measure Ca
      absorption and kinetics. Weekly assessments of Ca homeostasis will be done using our standard
      measures of calcitropic hormones, markers of bone turnover, and urine and serum minerals.
