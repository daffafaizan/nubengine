      fail to respond to current treatments. Intravenous (IV) low-dose ketamine has remarkable
      efficacy in even the most treatment-resistant depression (here defined as failure to at least
      two adequate trials of Level 1-evidence psychiatric medications), inducing remission in
      25-50%.

      Over 100 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) show that music can mitigate hemodynamic and
      psychological stress caused by even highly invasive medical procedures. Though never studied,
      music may similarly improve ketamine tolerability.

      In this randomized, single-blind (assessors will not know whether participants receive music
      or not) single-center trial, 20 participants with TRD will receive 1) curated music or 2) no
      music during their course of 6 IV ketamine treatments (0.50mg/kg bodyweight) over 4 weeks.
      The primary aim is to compare changes in systolic blood pressure from the beginning to the
      end (40 minutes, peak plasma concentration) of each infusion between groups.
