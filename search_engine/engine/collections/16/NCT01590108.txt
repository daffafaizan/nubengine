      and treatment. Existing biomarkers, tissue characteristics and definite treatment are
      restricted. There are many evidences suggested that Apelin-APJ system associated with
      Idiopathic Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (IPAH). A comprehensive characterise circulating
      peptide levels and investigate any tissue gradients of apelin in patients with idiopathic
      pulmonary arterial hypertension and healthy volunteers might provide important information
      about pathophysiologic process and diagnostic marker. In addition, first time human study to
      assessment the effect of exogenous apelin infusion on exercise performance in healthy
      volunteers and patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension is essential to
      confirm whether the relevance between animal models and clinical subjects.
