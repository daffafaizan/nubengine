      a pre-cancerous state, which justifies systematic screening for HCC. Screening currently
      relies on measurement of alpha-foetoprotein (AFP) levels and ultrasound scans every 4 to 6
      months. However, AFP has poor sensitivity as a marker for HCC. We have recently shown that
      plasma proteasome levels have a higher sensitivity than HCC for detecting HCC in cirrhotic
      patients, particularly when the tumors are small and can still benefit from curative
      treatment. The hypothesis of the study is that plasma proteasome levels will decrease
      following curative treatment, and that proteasome levels could be used as a marker to detect
      early recurrence. The goal of this study is to determine whether plasma proteasome levels in
      cirrhotic patients with HCC decrease following curative treatment (radiofrequency, surgical
      resection, liver transplantation). Plasma proteasome levels will be measured before treatment
      and 3 months after treatment, then subsequently at 3 month intervals over one year following
      treatment. The variation of proteasome levels will be compared to AFP levels. The sensitivity
      of proteasome as a marker to detect tumor recurrence will be evaluated, and compared to AFP.
