      lamotrigine when each is added to mood stabilizer therapy in patients with acute depressive
      episodes of bipolar I or Bipolar II disorder. Efficacy of therapy will be evaluated using
      improvements in clinical symptomatology after 8 weeks of treatment as measured by reductions
      on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-29) total score >50% from baseline. We also
      would like to assess the efficacy of venlafaxine XR and lamotrigine when each is added to
      mood stabilizer therapy in improving clinical symptomatology after 8 weeks of therapy as well
      as to evaluate the side effect profile, safety and tolerability of venlafaxine XR and
      lamotrigine.
