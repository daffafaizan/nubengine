    
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard approach for the treatment of gallbladder
      disease. Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is now performed as an outpatient procedure and it
      commonly requires the use of 4 separate small incisions. Single incision or single access
      trans-umbilical surgery may provide less pain, scarring and may improve patient's overall
      satisfaction.

      In this phase I trial we aim to evaluate the safety, feasibility and short-term outcomes of
      Single Incision Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy for the treatment of symptomatic cholelithiasis
      (gallstones).
