      agents in patients with relapsed and refractory CTCL despite their suppressive effects on T
      cell function, yet the overall response rate and response duration with these agents remains
      suboptimal. Immune stimulatory agents may be the ideal therapy to combine with HDACI. To
      date, no one has evaluated whether the abscopal effect of radiation with and without the
      additional immune stimulation of a TLR-3 agonist can augmented the efficacy of anti-tumor
      directed epigenetic therapy in mycosis fungoides (MF) patients. The investigators hypothesize
      that a combined modality immuno-chemotherapy may be highly effective in patients with
      advanced MF.

      This is a phase I study. It involves two arms of patients (A and B) who will be treated
      following a standard 3+ 3 design. Patients on Arm A are the ones who are initiating HDACI
      therapy, and patients on Arm B are the ones with stable disease or partial response with
      HDACI treatment. Both groups receive HDACI, plus at level 1, focal lesional radiation; at
      level 2, radiation in combination with Poly ICLC. Each arm will be evaluated and escalated
      independently.
