      Frailty is a complex clinical syndrome describing a loss of physical and/or cognitive
      functionality which leads to a decreased resistance to stressors such as operations or
      illness. It is associated with increased number of falls, exacerbations, adverse health
      outcomes and a higher mortality [6-9]. Frail LTx-candidates have a higher risk of being
      delisted before transplantation, adverse transplantation outcomes and a higher
      one-year-mortality compared to non frail candidates. However, studies show that frailty can
      be decreased by physical training [10-12]. A recent prospective cohort study in the UK
      observed a significant decrease of frailty in patients with COPD participating at an
      inpatient rehabilitation programme [4]. Singer et al. (USA) could detect a significant
      decrease of frailty by a homebased training for LTx-candidates [5].

      Aim of this study is to investigate the effects of a three-week inpatient rehabilitation
      programme on physical frailty (measured by Short Physical Performance Battery) in lung
      transplant candidates. Additionally, other functional measures as well as the cognitive,
      social and psychological state will be assessed in order to better understand the complex
      syndrome of frailty and the effects of rehabilitation.

      Design:

      This study is a prospective observational trial. The number of 32 participants is based on a
      sample size calculation. Asssessments will take place in the beginning of rehabilitation
      programme and at discharge.
