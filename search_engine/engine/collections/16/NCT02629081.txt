    
      Evaluation of the utility of image-enhanced endoscopy (IEE) in the diagnosis of non-erosive
      reflux disease (NERD), defined as heartburn documented to be associated with reflux on
      impedance-pH testing in the absence of erosions on standard white-light endoscopy (WLE)
      during initial endoscopy.

      The investigators will examine the following characteristics for IEE sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive values, and negative predictive value: squamo-columnar
      junction (SCJ) vascularity, micro-erosions, SCJ pit pattern, and combinations of these
      characteristics. The investigators will also look at abnormal morphology of intra-papillary
      capillary loops (IPCLS) using the newer generation Narrow Band Light (NBI-190 endoscopes and
      assess the identification of their presence using I-scan. Additionally, the investigators
      will examine real-time diagnostic yield of reflux diseases by IEE (in vivo diagnosis of
      reflux disease) and analyze obtained images and results to calculate inter-observer
      agreement.

      IEE utilized will be commonly available I-scan (Pentax) and Narrow Band Imaging (Olympus).

      Consecutive patients who meet eligibility criteria and are scheduled for upper endoscopy at
      locations specified in this record will be invited to participate.
