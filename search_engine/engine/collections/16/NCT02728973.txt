      pain management, intestinal dysfunction and immobilisation are the main factors associated
      with delay in recovery. This study aims to assess the short and medium term results achieved
      by an enhanced recovery program based on previously published protocols. This prospective
      study will be performed at a major hospital in China, involved 200 patients. All patients
      underwent elective colorectal resection for cancer are divided into enhanced recovery program
      group or conventional treatment group. The main elements of this program were: preoperative
      advice, no colon preparation, provision of carbohydrate-rich drinks one day prior and on the
      morning of surgery, goal directed fluid administration, body temperature control during
      surgery, avoiding drainages and nasogastric tubes, early mobilization, and the taking of oral
      fluids in the early postoperative period. Perioperative morbidity and mortality data will be
      collected and the length of hospital stay and protocol compliance recorded.
