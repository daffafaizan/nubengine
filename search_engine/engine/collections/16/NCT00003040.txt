      III squamous cell carcinoma of the supraglottic larynx with endoscopic surgery and
      irradiation. II. Estimate the 3 year progression free survival and describe the location of
      disease progression.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive carbon dioxide laser laryngectomy within 28 days following protocol
      registration. Patients with N1 disease may undergo an optional neck dissection ipsilateral to
      the neck mass. Neck dissection includes complete removal of at least lymph node levels 2-4.
      Radiation therapy begins 14 days following laser surgery. Patients are followed every 3
      months for the first year, every 6 months for the second year, and every 12 months thereafter
      until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 50 patients accrued into this study in 3 years with an
      estimated accrual rate of 20 patients per year.
