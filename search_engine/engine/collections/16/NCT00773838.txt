      when the primary endpoint of 29 responders has been met, or the time when all participants
      have discontinued treatment or have been enrolled in the study for at least 6 months (if the
      primary endpoint is not reached by this time). Following the Final Analysis, participants
      will be allowed to continue study treatment in an extension as long as they have not met the
      criteria for discontinuation, and will be followed for overall survival and serious AEs.
