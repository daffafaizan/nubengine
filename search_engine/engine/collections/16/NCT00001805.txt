      (HAMA) and antitoxin antibodies (HATA) to immunotoxin LMB-1 by Rituximab (anti-CD20). The
      primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of Rituximab on HAMA and HATA
      response to LMB-1 administered to patients with advanced carcinoma that express the B3
      antigen. Other objectives include evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and anti-tumor effects.
