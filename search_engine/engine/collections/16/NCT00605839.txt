      which often results in poor glycemic control. Optimizing parent-patient interaction is
      crucial to improving self-management. Mobile technology with integrated glucose monitoring
      capability that links adolescents to providers may reduce parental hypervigilance and assist
      them to better understand self-management. .

      This study will investigate a novel cell phone glucose monitoring system (CPGM) with the
      following specific aims:

        1. To establish feasibility of a CPGM system as a component of an adolescent diabetes
           management program.

        2. To determine if the technology will improve a) quality of parent-child relationship, b)
           patient quality of life, c) competence in diabetes management, and d) metabolic control.

        3. To gather preliminary data for development of future intervention studies.

      120 adolescents with type I diabetes will be randomly assigned to either an experimental or
      control group. Experimental subjects will use the CPGM which will transmit all blood glucose
      data to a host computer. A nurse practitioner in the pediatric endocrinology clinic will
      determine need for telephone contacts based on evaluation of transmitted data. Subjects might
      be telephoned to discuss possible regimen adjustments, need for clinic visits, or referrals
      to additional services. Subjects will also be able to initiate contact with the project
      nurse. Control subjects will continue to receive standard care. .

      This study will assess the effect of the intervention in the four primary domains stated in
      the specific aims. These domains will be measured at baseline, three months, and six months.
