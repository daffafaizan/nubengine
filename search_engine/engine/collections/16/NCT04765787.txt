      available include non-pharmacological treatments , complementary therapies, and
      pharmacological interventions. In order to provide optimal care to patients with
      musculoskeletal pain and ensure the efficient use of healthcare resources, a comprehensive
      overview of the available evidence for the most effective treatment options for
      musculoskeletal pain presentations is essential. In this context, an observational study is
      planned on the efficacy and safety of analgesic combination (i.e Nuberol Forte®). Nuberol
      Forte® is a combination of muscle relaxant (Orphanedrine) and an analgesic/antipyretic
      (Paracetamol/Acetaminophen). There are clear indications that the combination of Orphenadrine
      with Paracetamol may give increased antinociceptive activity and duration of action over and
      above the use of Orphenadrine or Paracetamol alone.
