      with statins seems to have a positive impact on brain function and reduces the risk of AD.
      The CLASP trial will test the link between using a cholesterol lowering medication and
      slowing disease progress in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD).

      CLASP is a research study to investigate the safety and effectiveness of simvastatin (a
      cholesterol lowering drug or statin) to slow the progression of AD. The clinical trial will
      include the treatment of patients with mild to moderate AD, and the objective is to evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of simvastatin to slow the progression of AD, as measured by the
      cognitive portion of the AD Assessment Scale. Measures of clinical global change (ADCS-CGIC),
      mental status, functional ability, behavioral disturbances, quality of life and economic
      indicators will be made also. The study design is randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel group design with equal randomization to drug and placebo.
      Randomization will be stratified and blocked to ensure balanced assignment within site.
      Sample size will include 400 participants enrolled from approximately 40 sites with a goal of
      10 to 15 volunteers enrolled at each site. Study medication will be as follows: 20 mg of
      simvastatin or matching placebo to be given for 6 weeks, followed by 40 mg of simvastatin or
      matching placebo for the remainder of the 18-month study period. Participants will be
      instructed to take the medication once a day in the evening. Safety parameters to be checked
      will include adverse events, symptom checklists, vital signs, physical and neurological
      examinations, and laboratory tests.
