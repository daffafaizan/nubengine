      (HE) and hypereosinophilic syndromes (HES). Clinical practice shows that HE/SHE patients can
      present 4 evolutionary profiles:

      A. a single flare-up of their disease, with favourable evolution spontaneously or under
      corticosteroid therapy, without further recurrence B. recurrent flare-ups with a variable
      free interval of several months to several years, with or without persistent eosinophilia
      between flare-ups C. a chronic disease requiring the continuation of a substantive treatment
      D. chronic asymptomatic HE for years: the mechanisms involved in the occurrence of possible
      organ damage are unknown

      The primary objective of the study is to describe the frequency of the different clinical
      manifestations during the diagnostic and follow-up of the hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES).
      The primary endpoint is the frequency of the different clinical manifestations and/or organs
      damage related to eosinophilia.
