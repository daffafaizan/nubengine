      were screened for recruitment. Out of which 67 subjects met the inclusion criteria, 3 failed
      to give the informed consent and were excluded. The final sample size of the study was 64
      patients. The duration of study was August 2010 to September 2013. Peginterferon alfa-2a
      180µg 20kDa (Unipeg®) solution for injection was administered as single dose sub-cutaneous
      once weekly for 24 weeks to patients with genotype 3 and 48 weeks in patients with genotype 1
      at the site of recruitment. Ribavirin (Ribazole) orally were given in divided daily dose
      according to body weight-based dosing recommendations (< 75kg = 1000 mg and ≥ 75 kg = 1200
      mg). Quality of life related Physical Component Score (PCS) & Mental Component Score (MCS)
      were measured through Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL) Questionnaire (SF-36). The SF-36
      questionnaire was completed for all patients during their evaluations before treatment, at 4
      weeks, at the end of treatment and at 24 weeks after completion of treatment.
