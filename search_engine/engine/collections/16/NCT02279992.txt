      tumor) will be randomly assigned to receive either a phosphodiesterase-V inhibitor
      (vardenafil) followed by carboplatin or carboplatin alone. All patients will have tumor
      resection performed from 2 to 6 hours after administration of carboplatin. Using high
      performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) or ELISA methodology, carboplatin levels will be
      determined from both serum and resected tumor tissue. Patients will be followed for four
      weeks after craniotomy for toxicity associated with the administration of carboplatin and a
      phosphodiesterase-V inhibitor plus carboplatin.

      These data will provide quantitative measures of intratumoral carboplatin levels with and
      without alteration of blood/tumor barrier (BTB) permeability with vardenafil.
