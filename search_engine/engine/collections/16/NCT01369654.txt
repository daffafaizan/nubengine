    
      Specific Aim 1) Conduct formative research to assess how sociodemographically diverse women
      who will be undergoing hysterectomy for non-cancerous conditions view elective BSO and to
      assess their information needs and desires regarding shared decision making in this context.

      Specific Aim 2) Create a BSO Decision Support Guide using information obtained from the
      literature, from our formative research, and the experience of providers who have counseled
      women about this choice.

      Specific Aim 3) Pilot test the BSO Decision Support Guide among women scheduled to undergo
      hysterectomy for benign conditions to assess its usefulness and usability for patients and
      their providers and to prepare for a randomized study of its impact on decision quality and
      use of BSO.
