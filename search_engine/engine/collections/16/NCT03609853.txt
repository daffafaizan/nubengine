      Unit (BPRU). Participants will complete 9 acute drug administration periods in which they
      will administer THC alone, limonene alone, THC and limonene together, or placebo. Subjective
      drug effects and vital signs will be assessed following drug administration. Each participant
      will receive all 9 dose conditions in a randomized order using a placebo controlled
      within-subject crossover design. The study will help us understand the individual and
      interactive effects of THC and d-limonene, two common constituents found in cannabis.
