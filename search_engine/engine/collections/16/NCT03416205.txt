      two groups. The bile duct stone diameter of group A is less than 1.0cm while group B is more
      than 1.0cm and less than 1.5cm. Each group compared Endoscopic sphincterotomy (EST),
      endoscopic papillary balloon dilation (EPBD), and endoscopic sphincterotomy plus balloon
      dilation (sEST+EPBD) in ERCP. Through the postoperative comparison of relevant inspection
      test indicators, the recovery of patients, whether the occurrence of complications, including
      infection,bleeding,pancreatitis,perforation , and 1 year stone recurrence rate,Investigators
      assess the advantages and disadvantages in three different strategies in different sizes of
      common bile duct stones , and finally get a relatively objective evaluation to guide our
      daily ERCP work on the choice of duodenal papillary sphincter treatment strategy.
