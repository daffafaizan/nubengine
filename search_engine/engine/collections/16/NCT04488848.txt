      of cardiovascular death than non-diabetics. However not only hyperglycaemia per se but also
      glycaemic variability is currently particularly regarded as a risk factor for cardiovascular
      and microvascular complications. Intermittent blood sugar excursions with pronounced
      fluctuations between high and low values instead of constant, even increased blood sugar
      exposure, have been shown to be more harmful in several studies.

      AIM: The aim of this study is to determine the effect of rapid glucose excursion versus
      continuous glucose infusion on cardiovascular and metabolic parameters in healthy volunteers.

      METHODS/DESIGN: In this study, ten healthy male subjects will be studied on two occasions. In
      a random order the subjects will receive 3 times 20 grams of glucose intravenously as a bolus
      or, on the other occasion, 60 grams of glucose continuously over 3 hours. Cardiometabolic
      biomarkers will be analysed serially to analyse the effects of glucose excursions.

      PROSPECT: Glycaemic variability may be a crucial factor in the development of diabetic
      complications, but there is currently a lack of conclusive evidence. The causes and
      mechanisms of these negative influences on the cardiovascular system due to high glucose
      variability have not been sufficiently investigated and are therefore not fully understood so
      far. To date, however, there have been no studies with acutely altered glucose concentrations
      in healthy volunteers that have investigated the effects on traditional as well as recently
      identified cardiovascular and metabolic biomarkers. Knowledge of such effects may improve the
      therapeutic strategy in diabetic patients.
