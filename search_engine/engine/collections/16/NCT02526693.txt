      eye-tracking and automated blink detection technology to analyze and quantify the pupillary
      response to light.

      During the scheduled appointment, all patients will receive an undilated fundus examination
      by the attending ophthalmologist. The following data will be collected; Demographic
      information, Visual acuity, Intraocular pressure (IOP) measured by Goldmann applanation
      tonometry, Disc damage likelihood scale (DDLS), Vertical cup/disc ratio, Gonioscopy (if not
      documented in the chart within the past 2 years) and Humphrey visual field examination.

      Each participant will undergo RAPDx testing with two different testing sequences. They are
      separated by a 10-second resting period during which the patient is instructed to close his
      or her eyes. The exam may be paused at any time and re-alignment may be performed during any
      pause. The two testing sequences are:

        1. Standard Factory Setting: 0.1-second stimuli with 2-second inter-stimuli pauses;

        2. Custom Setting: 3-second stimuli with 1-second inter-stimuli pauses
