      acid (EACA) in reducing blood loss in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Methods: This was
      a double-blinded randomized trial. Patients (n=100) undergoing cardi- ac surgery were
      randomized to receive either TXA (10 mg/kg bolus followed by an infu- sion of 1mg/kg/hr) or
      EACA (150mg/kg bolus followed by an infusion of 20 mg/kg/hr). The primary outcome measure was
      a difference in transfusion amounts.
