        -  Determine whether magnetic resonance image monitoring during radiofrequency interstitial
           thermal ablation can accurately predict complete destruction of focal tumor along with
           an adequate margin of normal tissue, as demonstrated by absence of growth on subsequent
           imaging studies for a 1-year period, in patients with primary renal cell carcinoma,
           hepatic metastases, or other solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (localized hepatic metastases vs
      primary renal neoplasms vs solid tumors in other sites).

      Patients undergo thermal ablation by radiofrequency energy under magnetic resonance guidance.
      Thermal ablation continues until the entire tumor is treated. Treatment ceases when the
      entire lesion has undergone necrosis or the zone of necrosis or significant heat deposition
      approaches vital neurovascular structures.

      Patients are followed at 2 weeks and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 22-36
      months.
