      standards targeting family child care homes in South Carolina. To accomplish this goal, we
      are assessing the effects of the standards on the dietary intake and physical activity levels
      of racially diverse low-income children in family child care homes. The specific aims of the
      "CHEER" study are as follows:

      Aim 1. Evaluate the extent to which the new regulatory standards impact children's dietary
      intake assessed via direct observation in homes and 24-hour recalls with parents, and
      physical activity and sedentary behavior assessed via accelerometry.

      Aim 2. Evaluate the extent to which the new regulatory standards impact children's body mass
      index computed from researcher-measured height and weight.

      Secondary Aim. Evaluate the extent to which family child care homes in the SC ABC Child Care
      Program comply with the new healthy eating and physical activity regulatory standards,
      compared to family child care homes not participating in the program.

      We hypothesize that most homes will comply with the new standards, yielding improvements in
      children's healthy eating and physical activity levels. As an exploratory aim, we will
      examine the effects of the standards on children's weight status.
