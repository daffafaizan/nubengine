    
      Patients will be randomised into two groups as Group E (those who received general anesthesia
      after the erector spina plan block) and Group T (those who received general anesthesia after
      thoracic epidural block).

      After the block skin conductivity (galvanic skin response - GSR), body temperature changes,
      sympathetic and sensory block levels, peri-operative hemodynamic data, postoperative pain
      scores and analgesic consumption will be recorded.
