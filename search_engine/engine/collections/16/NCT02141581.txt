    
      The aim of this study is to compare the response to different formulations of licensed
      influenza vaccines.

      The type of seasonal influenza vaccination(s) received independently by volunteers in the
      year(s) since their last study visit will not impact eligibility. Volunteers will be assigned
      into one of three vaccine groups (intramuscular trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine
      (TIV); live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV- given year 1 only) or intradermal TIV, based
      on the type of study vaccine they received in 2010, 2011, 2012, or 2013. All participants
      will receive a single dose of their assigned seasonal influenza vaccine. Volunteers will
      complete 3 study visits at Day 0, Day 6-8 and Day 24-32.
