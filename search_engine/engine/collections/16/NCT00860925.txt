      researchers require prior to conducting a large international study to test the effect of ASA
      and Clonidine in preventing major vascular complications during the first 30 days after
      surgery.

      The POISE-2 Pilot Trial is a factorial design randomized control trial that will compare ASA
      to placebo and clonidine to placebo. Patients in the POISE-2 pilot trial will be randomly
      assigned to one of four groups: ASA and Clonidine together, ASA and Clonidine placebo, ASA
      placebo and Clonidine, or a ASA placebo and Clonidine placebo. Two to four hours prior to
      surgery, eligible patients are given ASA study drug and Clonidine study drug orally (162mg
      ASA or its placebo and 0.2mg Clonidine or its placebo) and a patch to apply (0.2mg/day
      Clonidine or its placebo). The patch will remain in place for 72 hours after surgery. After
      the surgery, patients ingest one tablet a day (81mg ASA or its placebo) for 7 days if patient
      was were taking ASA chronically prior to surgery or for 30 days if they were not chronically
      taking ASA prior to surgery. Troponin measurements will be collected between 6 to 12 hours
      after the operation and on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd days after surgery. If blood tests reveal an
      elevation in the troponin measurement an electrocardiogram (ECG) will be undertaken
      immediately.

      Research personnel will follow patients until 30 days after surgery.
