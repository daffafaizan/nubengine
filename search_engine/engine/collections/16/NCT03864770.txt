      contraction at night, which often affects sleep quality due to pain and tight discomfort in
      the thigh, calf and foot. The pathophysiology of nocturnal leg cramps is unclear, but it is
      generally considered to be associated with excitability lower motor neurons, sleep posture at
      night, leg muscle fatigue, nerve disability or damage (eg, Parkinson's disease), metabolic
      diseases (eg : hyperphosphatemia). Generally, quinine or magnesium oxide is the most commonly
      used pharmacological treatment. The common non-drug treatments are stretching exercise,
      massage or hot therapy, but there is not enough evidence to indicate which treatment is
      specific effective.

      In a previous study, they proposed that nocturnal leg cramps may be associated with
      myofascial trigger points (MTrPs) of the gastrocnemius. Other studies have also proposed that
      extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) applying to the MTrPs of the upper trapezius muscle
      could improve cervicogenic headache. We will conduct a randomized parallel study to
      investigate the efficacy of ESWT on nocturnal leg cramps. Participants will be randomized
      into two groups: one is only general physical therapy (gPT) and the other one is ESWT + gPT.

      The outcome measurement tools including the frequency of nocturnal leg cramps, visual analog
      scale (VAS), pain pressure threshold (PPT) and muscle tone in the gastrocnemius, range of
      motion of knee and ankle, and quality of sleep questionnaire were used to compare two groups
      with regard to the pain intensity, quality of sleep, and overall satisfaction in subjects
      with nocturnal leg cramps.
