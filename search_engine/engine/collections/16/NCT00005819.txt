        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of fenretinide, paclitaxel, and
           cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors.

        -  Determine the effect of fenretinide on the pharmacokinetics of paclitaxel and cisplatin.

        -  Assess the relationship between dose or plasma levels of fenretinide and the safety and
           antitumor effects, in terms of overall response, response rate, and progression-free
           survival rate, in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of paclitaxel and cisplatin.

      Patients receive oral fenretinide twice daily for 7 days. Patients receive paclitaxel IV over
      3 hours and cisplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 7. Courses repeat every 21 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of paclitaxel and cisplatin until the
      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at
      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is
      determined, additional patients are accrued to receive paclitaxel and cisplatin at the
      recommended phase II dose.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-24
      months.
