    
      This protocol is designed for the screening of patients with either diagnosed or undiagnosed
      conditions, and serves as a first step for individuals who may be eligible, and wish to
      participate in NEI- National Eye Institute clinical research studies.

      Each individual will be thoroughly evaluated during the screening process to determine if
      they are suitable candidates for inclusion in any of the NEI ongoing studies. The screening
      evaluation will include past and current medical histories, and an appropriate physical
      examination. Other routine diagnostic procedures and tests may also be completed in order to
      help determine a subject's eligibility. These tests and procedures are of minimal risk and
      will be described in more detail in section III: "Study Procedures". Once the screening
      process is completed and their eligibility is assessed, the subjects will be informed of
      their options to participate in one or more of the current clinical research studies. If no
      appropriate protocol is identified, recommendations for other treatment options may be given
      to the individual, their primary doctor, or referring physician.
