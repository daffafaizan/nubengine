    
      After surgery patients will be transferred to the ICU and will be randomly allocated by use
      of sealed envelopes ;into one of three groups 20 patients each.

      All ICU measurements will be recorded by an observer

      The following data will be collected:

        -  Patients' demographic and clinical data including age, sex, weight ,operative procedure
           time and type and patient's SOFA score.

        -  Mean arterial pressure, heart rate (HR), central venous pressure (CVP), and temperature
           will be continuously monitored . Urine output will be measured hourly and fluid balance
           will be calculated every 12 hours. All measurements will be obtained at the start of the
           study (baseline), then at the 24th and 48th hours.

        -  Lactate, platelets, leukocytes, bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase, and creatinine will
           be determined at the same times TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6 levels will be obtained at
           baseline, and at the 24th and 48 th hours.

        -  Intraabdominal pressure and abdominal perfusion pressure will be measured at baseline
           (15 min before start of the study) and at the 24th and 48th hours per the study
           protocol.

        -  Behavioral pain scale, ramsay sedation score and post operative analgesics requirements
           as a rescue analgesia.

        -  Duration of mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay.
