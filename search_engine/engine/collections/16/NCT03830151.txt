      I. To establish a clinical infrastructure for performing hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate
      (hyperpolarized 13-C-pyruvate) imaging in the human brain at MD Anderson.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the correlation between conversion rate of hyperpolarized pyruvate to lactate
      (kpl) values and Ki-67 quantitation in the tumor.

      II. To compare kpl values between tumor and normal brain within patient. III. To assess the
      association between kpl values and pathology results, including conventional, diffusion,
      perfusion, and permeability imaging.

      IV. To assess the association between kpl values and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging
      findings.

      V. To assess the association between kpl values and genomic findings, including methylation,
      ribonucleic acid [RNA], and deoxyribonucleic acid [DNA]).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive hyperpolarized carbon C 13 pyruvate intravenously (IV) over 10-20 seconds
      and then undergo an MRSI scan.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 1 day.
