      I. To determine the toxicities, pharmacokinetic profile and the recommended phase 2 dose of
      SJG-136 in patients with an advanced solid tumor.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine preliminary efficacy data and evaluation of correlative markers of DNA damage
      and apoptosis in peripheral blood lymphocytes.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive SJG-136 intravenously (IV) over 20 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts
      of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SJG-136 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is
      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients
      experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.
