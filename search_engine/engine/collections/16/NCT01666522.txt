      populations and the lessened physical activity (PA), sarcopenia and osteopenia /osteoporosis
      are emerging as major health concerns. Lack of PA is a significant risk factor for
      sarcopenia. Vitamin D plays an important role on bone and muscle development.

      This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of sarcopenia and to evaluate the
      effectiveness of PA and vitamin D supplementation in enhancing muscle mass and strength in
      community-dwelling older adults with osteopenia /osteoporosis.\ One hundred and forty-five
      individuals aged 65 years and above with documented osteopenia/osteoporosis were scanned for
      sarcopenia (defined as a relative skeletal muscle index (appendicular skeletal muscle mass
      divided by height) below 5.45 kg/m2). The participants were randomly assigned to one of four
      groups: Group 1-PA and vitamin D (n= 38), Group 2-PA(n=36), Group 3-vitamin D (n= 36) or
      Group 4-healthy lifestyle(n =35) for 16 weeks. The PA group received a 60-minute 3-day/week
      exercise programme, the vitamin D group received oral cholecalciferol 2000 IU/day and the
      control group was provided with health education using videotaped presentations, physician
      talks on topics concerning bone and muscle health. Body composition was measured by dual
      energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). Vitamin D levels were measured by Liaison immunoassay. PA
      was measured using the Baecke Physical Activity Questionnaire. Physical performance was
      assessed using upper limb grip strength, walking speed and knee extension strength. All data
      was collected at baseline and at 4 months.
