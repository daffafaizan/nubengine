      Primary

        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of paclitaxel-loaded
           polymeric micelle and carboplatin as first-line therapy in patients with advanced
           ovarian cancer. (Phase I)

        -  Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen, in terms of CA-125 response rate after 6 courses
           of therapy. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  Assess, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of this regimen, in terms of objective
           response rate (complete response and partial response), time to tumor progression, and
           progression-free survival, in these patients. (Phase I)

        -  Evaluate the safety profiles of this regimen in these patients. (Phase I)

        -  Determine the objective response rate, as measured by RECIST criteria, in patients
           treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Determine the overall response in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  Evaluate the safety and toxicity of this regimen in these patients. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive paclitaxel-loaded polymeric micelle and carboplatin.
