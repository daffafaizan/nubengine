      personalized cancer therapy through the use of targeted therapies and their associated
      biomarkers. Assays to quantify tumor acidosis and hypoxia are hypothesized to potentially
      represent such biomarkers. However there is currently no gold standard for measuring either.

      This trial will evaluate the feasibility of translating preclinical Chemical Exchange
      Saturation Transfer (CEST) MRI protocol designed to estimate tumor extracellular pH (pHe), to
      a clinical MRI scanner in women with early stage breast cancer. This trial will generate
      preliminary data regarding the feasibility of this imaging technique. If successful, in
      future studies CEST MRI may serve as an imaging biomarker for acidosis and hypoxia.
