      efficacy and safety profile, compared with other PDE-5 inhibitors. Also, laboratory data
      showed that udenafil inhibits ventricular hypertrophy and fibrosis in rat heart failure
      model. Based on these results, the investigators hypothesized that udenafil would improve
      symptom, exercise capacity and hemodynamic status in patients with systolic heart failure. In
      this 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, patients with systolic
      heart failure will be enrolled according to the eligibility criteria. After randomization,
      study participants will be assigned to receive either 50mg of udenafil or placebo two times a
      day for 4 weeks, and then the dosage will be doubled to 100mg two times a day for next 8
      weeks. Participants will attend study visits at baseline and weeks 4 and 12. Physical
      examination, medical history review, blood sample collection and electrocardiogram will be
      conducted on each study visits. At baseline and week 12, participants will undergo
      cardiopulmonary exercise test and exercise echocardiography. At every study
      visits,researchers will collect health information.
