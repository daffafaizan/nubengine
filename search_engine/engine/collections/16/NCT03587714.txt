      prevalence of HCV RNA was found to be 7.0%.(1) The prevalence of HCV was studied in
      Rheumatoid arthritis in few studies(2,3), but to our knowledge, no previous work studied it
      in other rheumatologic diseases.

      This study aims at detecting the prevalence of subclinical HCV infection in different
      rheumatologic disease groups in Egypt.

      Consecutive patients with different rheumatologic diseases from seven- geographically
      different- rheumatology departments were prospectively studied. None of the patients was
      known to have previous HCV infection. Patients' serum samples were screened for the presence
      of anti-HCV antibodies. Patients with positive serology were further evaluated for the
      presence of HCV ribonucleic acid by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)
