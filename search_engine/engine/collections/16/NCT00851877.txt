      Primary

        -  To determine the maximum tolerated dose of paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle
           formulation when combined with cisplatin, cetuximab, and radiotherapy in patients with
           local-regionally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. (Phase I)

        -  To evaluate the disease-free survival of patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

      Secondary

        -  To identify dose-limiting toxicities in these patients treated with this regimen. (Phase
           I)

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of this regimen. (Phases I and II)

        -  To assess progression-free survival and survival of patients treated with this regimen.
           (Phase I)

        -  To assess overall survival in patients treated with this regimen. (Phase II)

        -  To assess response rates in patients treated with this regimen. (Phases I and II)

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, phase I dose-escalation study of paclitaxel
      albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive cetuximab IV over 120 minutes in week 1. Patients then receive cetuximab IV
      over 60 minutes, paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation IV over 30 minutes,
      and cisplatin IV over 60 minutes once weekly in weeks 2-8. Patients also undergo 3D conformal
      or intensity-modulated radiotherapy over 30 minutes on days 1-5 in weeks 2-8.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 4 years.
