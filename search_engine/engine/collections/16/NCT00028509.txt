        -  Compare the incidence of neuropsychological abnormalities and leukoencephalopathy in
           children previously treated with methotrexate on protocols POG-9605 versus POG-9201.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      More than 3 years after completion of therapy, patients undergo 9 different tests to assess
      intelligence, memory, learning, attention, concentration, processing of information,
      functioning, and visual-motor integration. Patients also undergo MRI of the head.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-54 patients previously treated on protocol POG-9201 will be
      accrued for this study. A total of 60-108 patients previously treated on protocol POG-9605
      will be accrued for this study.
