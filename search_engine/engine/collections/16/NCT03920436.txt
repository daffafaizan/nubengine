      the effects of oral ingestion of drinking water using a tumbler that emits far infrared rays
      at room temperature on metabolic profile in adults for 8 weeks; the safety of the compound
      are also evaluate. The Investigators examine lipid profile, glucose, liver and renal function
      at baseline, as well as after 4, 8 weeks of intervention. Thirty adults were administered
      either 1.8 L of drinking water using a tumbler that emits far infrared rays at room
      temperature or drinking water using a sham-tumbler each day for 12 weeks.
