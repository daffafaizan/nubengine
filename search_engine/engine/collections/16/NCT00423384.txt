      measurements of Bone Mineral Density (BMD), laboratory efficacy and safety variables as well
      as Quality-of-Life scores will be undertaken in the period from 1 week prior to
      transplantation until 1 week after transplantation. In this period, any existing fractures
      will be determined using traditional x-ray of the thoraco-lumbar columna. Renal graft
      functioning as well as transplantation complications will be followed tightly, and calcium
      supplementation as well as active vitamin D (calcitriol) will be administered together with
      the standard immunosuppressive regimen.

      As soon as patients have recovered from transplantation, and renal functioning is considered
      sufficiently stable, and no later than 28 days after the transplantation, qualified patients
      will be randomised to receive either ibandronate or placebo, stratified by gender. Bone
      mineral density and most of the clinical data and laboratory tests will then be followed
      until 12 months after transplantation as described in the attached flowchart (section 11.1),
      with hospital visits for administration of study drugs and follow-up of at 13, 26, 39 and 52
      weeks after transplantation. Furthermore, all the patients will be followed prospectively
      from the time of transplantation and for ten years with regard to cardiovascular events. Data
      concerning cardiovascular events will be collected from the Norwegian renal registry for the
      whole study population in the follow up period of about 10 years.
