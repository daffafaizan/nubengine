      and reliable tests aimed to mimic activities of daily living, quantify cardiovascular health,
      and quantify muscle power declines. Also, patients will undergo a walking program during
      their hospitalization, which is designed to increase physical activity levels and maintain
      and improve physical function and quality of life. Additionally, using valid and reliable
      questionnaires, the researchers will gauge perception of exercise, quantify current exercise
      levels, determine preference of exercise programs and counseling, and measure differences in
      quality of life before and after HSCT treatment.
