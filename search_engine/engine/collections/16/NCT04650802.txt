      elicited during short, intensive gait training interventions. The aim of this study was
      therefor to investigate the effect of a five-week gait training on paretic propulsion,
      propulsion symmetry, gait capacity, and daily-life mobility and physical activity in chronic
      stroke survivors. We hypothesize that the robotic gait training will improve propulsion
      symmetry and, thereby, gait speed and functional gait tasks. In addition, we expect that
      improved gait capacity might lead to less impact of stroke on daily-life mobility and a
      higher physical activity level. Thirty-three chronic stroke survivors with impaired paretic
      propulsion (â‰¥8% difference in paretic vs. non-paretic propulsive impulse) will be enrolled in
      this proof-of-concept study. Participants receive five weeks individual robotic gait training
      targeting paretic propulsion (60 minutes, two time a week). The robotic gait training is
      complemented with daily home exercises (15 minutes/day) focusing on increasing strength and
      practice of learned strategies in daily life. Propulsion measures, self-selected gait speed,
      performance on functional gait tasks, and daily-life mobility and physical activity are
      assessed five weeks (T0) and one week (T1) before the start of the intervention, and one week
      (T2) and five weeks (T3) after the end of the intervention.
