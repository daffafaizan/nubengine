    
      This study seeks to enroll patients with AL amyloidosis who have been recommended for
      standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant.

      Standard treatment for this disease is high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of standard treatment
      with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant, compared with investigational bortezomib
      when used in combination with standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell
      transplant for AL amyloidosis.

      Patients enrolled in this study will receive either standard treatment with high-dose
      melphalan and stem cell transplant, or investigational bortezomib used in combination with
      standard treatment with high-dose melphalan and stem cell transplant.
