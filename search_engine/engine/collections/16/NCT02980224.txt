      fatty acids relative to omega-6 levels can mediate immune responses. Evaluating whether
      omega-3 supplementation can improve dry eye disease signs, symptoms and associated measures
      of inflammation may present a new therapeutic option for dry eye disease.

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of twice daily
      (BID) dosing of OmegaD softgels in subjects with dry eye disease.

      Male and female subjects between 18 years and 90 years of age, with patient-reported dry eye
      symptoms and a clinical diagnosis of dry eye disease supported by global clinical assessment
      will be screened and enrolled. Each subject must have, in at least one eye, tear osmolarity
      of ≥ 312 mOsm/L and meibomian gland dysfunction as defined by a grade of 1 or 2 on the
      meibomian orifice size scale at both Screening and Baseline in at least one eye. In addition,
      Tear break up time (TBUT) must be ≤ 7 seconds in both eyes at both Screening and Baseline and
      the Schirmer's test score in both eye(s) must be ≥ 5 mm at Baseline.

      Approximately 164 subjects will be randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 treatment arms and treated for
      84 days (12 weeks) with either OmegaD softgels; 2 softgels BID or placebo softgels; 2
      softgels BID. The study will be double-masked with OmegaD and placebo being
      identical-appearing softgels.

      Subjects will participate in safety and efficacy assessments throughout the study. Efficacy
      assessments will include, tear osmolarity, meibomian gland dysfunction grading, TBUT,
      Schirmer's Test, and dry eye symptoms based on the OSDI questionnaire, Safety assessments
      will include, slit lamp examination and adverse events.
