    
      This is a randomized (treatment is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither the physician
      nor the patient is aware of the received treatment), placebo-controlled study of multiple
      subcutaneous (SC) administrations of golimumab at 2 doses as monotherapy or in combination
      with MTX in patients with active RA despite treatment with MTX. The duration of participation
      in the study for an individual patient will be upto 268 weeks. The patients will be randomly
      assigned in a 3:3:2:2 ratio to receive golimumab 50 mg or 100 mg or placebo injections under
      the skin every 4 weeks through week 20 and methotrexate or placebo capsules will be given in
      addition. At Week 24, all subjects will receive golimumab 50mg or 100mg injections, and
      golimumab continues for all groups for about 4 and a half more years. At Week 16 any patient
      in the study who meets criteria for < 20% improvement from baseline in both swollen and
      tender joint count will enter early escape in a double-blinded fashion. Treatment during the
      long-term extension will start at Week 52 and continue every 4 weeks thereafter for a total
      of approximately 5 years from the initial (Week 0) administration of study agent. Patients
      will return for scheduled follow-up visits generally every 12 weeks for a total length of
      follow-up of approximately 5 years from the first administration of the study drug.
