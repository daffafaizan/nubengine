      Belgian context with main focus on the patients' quality of life, stroke recurrence and
      secondary cardiovascular prevention. Main focuses are on patient-empowerment, shared-decision
      making and health literacy, as these items are linked with better therapeutic adherence and
      self-care for chronic diseases.

      In case of a positive result, implementation of this individualized chronic stroke care
      program executed by a personal stroke coach, initiated during hospitalization and using a
      web-based intervention program, can easily be unrolled in other Belgian stroke units. The
      program can be cost-effective if better clinical outcome, stroke recurrence rates, number of
      in-hospital consultations, number of rehospitalisations are reduced. This will be evaluated
      in a in-depth healt-economic analysis.
