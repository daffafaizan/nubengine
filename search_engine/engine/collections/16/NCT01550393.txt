        -  To validate the prognostic performance of specific-candidate Wilms tumor markers by
           measuring their urinary concentration using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs)
           in urine specimens collected at diagnosis from 50 patients with favorable histology
           Wilms tumor who relapsed and 50 patients who did not relapse.

      OUTLINE: Urine specimens are analyzed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for
      biomarkers.
