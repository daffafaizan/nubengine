      bowel preparation is indispensable to ensure a clear vision of colonic mucosaï¼Œcomplete
      inspection of all colon segments, and furthermore improves the detection rates of small
      adenomas. Thus, the adequacy of bowel preparation should be accurately evaluated and
      documented. However, the accuracy of current bowel preparation quality scales greatly relies
      on intra-observer and inter-observer consistency for lack of objective measurements.
      Recently, deep learning based on central neural networks (CNN) has shown multiple potential
      in computer-aided detection and computer-aided diagnose of gastrointestinal lesions. While,
      no studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of deep learning algorithm in
      bowel preparation quality scoring. This study aims to train an algorithm to assess bowel
      preparation quality using the BBPS, and testify whether the engagement of AI can improve the
      quality control parameters of colonoscopy.
