      Acupuncture is used for indications such as pain and nausea, but for radiotherapy (RT)
      induced nausea it is still an unexplored treatment. For evaluation of the method, the use of
      sham acupuncture as a control treatment provides a tool resembling placebo for drugs. The aim
      of the studt is therefore to investigate whether acupuncture reduces nausea caused by
      radiotherapy in a patient group with a >50% risk of experiencing the symptoms (abdominal or
      pelvic region). Patients are randomised to invasive acupuncture (IA) or placebo acupuncture
      (PA) 30 min, 2-3 times/week during the whole RT period. IA is administered bilaterally to the
      point PC6 using an invasive needle and PA with a needle, which looks identical but is not
      pointed and is not fixed in its handle. When this comes into contact with the surface of the
      skin and gives a feeling of penetration it glides upwards in its handle and is therefore
      shortened, which gives an illusion that the needle has entered the tissue. Nausea and
      vomiting is documented in diaries and questionnaires under the entire treatment period as
      well as two and four weeks after radiotherapy.
