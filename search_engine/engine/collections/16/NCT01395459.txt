      Determine if there is a difference in completion of a home blood stool test kit by type of
      home test being employed Fecal Occult Blood Test (gFOBT) vs. Fecal Immunochemical Test (FIT),
      and to determine predictors of test completion.

      Substudy methods/design/arms/eligibility:

      All patients who picked up a home blood stool test kit during the 6-12 month study
      recruitment time period were randomized to receive either a gFOBT or FIT kit. Randomization
      occurred by the month. Medical assistants (MAs) handed out the kits. Participants who picked
      up a kit (either gFOBT or FIT) were given a study information card that briefly described the
      study and had a study opt out phone number on it. If patients did not call and opt out, the
      card let the patient know that he/she would be contacted via telephone to complete a brief
      survey, for which they were given a small incentive upon completion.

      A bilingual member of the study staff telephoned individuals, who had not opted out, who
      picked up a home blood stool test kit during the study period. Four to six weeks post kit
      pickup, staff determined if the patient had returned a completed test to the clinic (yes vs.
      no) by examining the electronic medical record. This information- whether a patient had/had
      not returned a completed test was used to tailor some questions asked on the survey. Study
      staff obtained verbal informed consent before survey administration. Participants who cited
      that time was a burden stopping them from starting the survey were offered an abbreviated
      version of the survey.

      This study was limited to age eligible patients who picked up a home colon cancer screening
      kit.
