      during the Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention (PPCI), larger infarct size, increased
      ischemic complications and mortality. No-Reflow phenomenon is related to higher incidence of
      complications, and short- and long-term morbidity and mortality in acute STEMI patients.

      Although many risk factors were suggested, Tragically there's no widely accepted risk
      stratification method to anticipate these complications.

      CHA2DS2-VASc score is a sum of several risk factors for thromboembolism. It is considered a
      clinical indicator of thromboembolic diseases and is recommended by the current guidelines
      for the estimation of thromboembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation.

      In this study, we evaluate the use CHA2DS2-VASc score as a novel rapid simple tool for
      predicting No-reflow and clinical outcomes among patients with STEMI who underwent primary
      PCI.
