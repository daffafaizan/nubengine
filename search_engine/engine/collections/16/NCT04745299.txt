    
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by
      selective and progressive loss of motor neurons. Disease progression leads to death within
      2-4 years, but there exists no definite treatment so far.

      Based on phase I/II clinical trial(NCT01363401), twice intrathecal autologous bone
      marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (Lenzumestrocel) injections showed significant
      therapeutic benefit lasting at least six months with safety in patients with ALS.

      Additionally, the switch from pro- to anti-inflammatory conditions, which was indicated from
      the inverse correlation between TGF-Î²1 and MCP-1 levels after Lenzumestrocel injections in
      the good responder, has been considered a plausible beneficial action mechanism.

      This study is designed to investigate the following. First, to reconfirm and evaluate the
      long-term efficacy of twice injections (single cycle) of Lenzumestrocel, group 1 will receive
      a single cycle injection with a 26-day interval.

      Second, to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of Lenzumestrocel repeated injections,
      group 2 will receive a single cycle injection a 26-day apart followed by three times
      injections every three-month interval.

      Group 3 will receive comparator injections.
