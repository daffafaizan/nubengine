      delivery will be analyzed for inflammatory cytokines. The impact of these inflammatory
      markers will be assessed by comparing the data to measures of vitamin D (25(OH)D, calcitriol
      and parathyroid hormone) and infections and inflammatory complications abstracted from
      medical charts. Placental samples were collected from a subset (n=132) of these pregnant
      teens and these tissues will be analyzed using genome wide microarray of messenger
      ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) related to inflammatory processes. A separate
      group of pregnant adolescents (n=140) will be recruited at entry into prenatal care for a
      vitamin D supplementation trial. Teens will be randomly assigned to one of two supplements
      (200 IU D3/d vs. 2000 IU D3/d). Similar to the retrospective analysis, maternal calciotropic
      hormones and inflammatory cytokines will be assessed at entry into the study, mid-gestation
      (23-28 weeks) and at delivery. Inflammatory processes and infections reported across
      pregnancy will be evaluated in relation to vitamin D status and inflammatory markers.
