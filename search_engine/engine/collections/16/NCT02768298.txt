    
      This study was a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, active-controlled,
      two-arm trial to compare LCZ696 200 mg twice daily (bid) to enalapril 10 mg bid in improving
      exercise capacity, daily physical activity and quality of life in patients with stable
      chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association III) and reduced left ventricular ejection
      fraction (LVEF ≤ 40%).

      The study consisted of a screening period of 2 weeks during which the subject's eligibility
      for the study was assessed followed by a double blind treatment period of 12 weeks. Eligible
      subjects were randomized 1:1 to receive either LCZ696 or enalapril during the double-blind
      period. Treatment was initiated with LCZ696 100 mg bid or enalapril 5 mg bid (enalapril 10 mg
      bid for patients at a stable daily dose of enalapril above 10 mg per day or corresponding
      doses of other angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor
      blockers (ARB) prior first screening visit), respectively. Dose was up-titrated after 2 weeks
      to the final dose of LCZ696 200 mg bid or enalapril 10 mg bid.

      Patients continued to take their background medications for chronic heart failure during the
      study, with the exception of ACEI or ARBs which were replaced by investigational treatment
      and had to be discontinued before first dose of study drug.

      The primary objective was to demonstrate the superiority of LCZ696 200 mg bid compared to
      enalapril 10 mg bid in improving exercise tolerance (peak respiratory oxygen uptake
      (VO2peak), adjusted to body weight) as assessed by cardio-pulmonary-exercise testing (CPET)
      in patients with stable chronic heart failure (NYHA III) and reduced ejection fraction (LVEF
      ≤ 40%) after 3 months treatment.
