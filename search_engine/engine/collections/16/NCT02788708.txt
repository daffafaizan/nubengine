      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of combination lenvatinib mesylate
      (lenvatinib) and weekly paclitaxel in patients with recurrent endometrial, epithelial
      ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube carcinoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of combination lenvatinib and weekly paclitaxel
      in patients with recurrent endometrial, epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian
      tube carcinoma.

      II. To explore the objective antitumor activity (complete and partial response) of
      combination lenvatinib and weekly paclitaxel as measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in
      Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria.

      III. To measure the progression free survival. IV. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics of
      combination paclitaxel and lenvatinib.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose -escalation study of lenvatinib mesylate.

      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      lenvatinib mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 3 months for 3 years.
