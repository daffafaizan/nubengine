    
      PROpel is a phase III study evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of olaparib
      versus placebo when given in addition to abiraterone to patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who have not received prior chemotherapy or new
      hormonal agents (NHAs) for metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)
      (first-line setting).

      Approximately 720 patients globally were planned to be randomized in PROpel in a 1:1 ratio to
      treatment with either olaparib and abiraterone or placebo and abiraterone. Enrolment had
      completed with a total of 796 patients randomised. Following the completion of global
      enrolment, the China cohort will randomise approximately 108 additional patients at sites in
      China, also in a 1:1 ratio.

      Patients will receive oral treatment with olaparib 300 mg twice daily + abiraterone 1000 mg
      once daily or placebo twice daily + abiraterone 1000 mg once daily. Patients in both
      treatment groups will also receive either prednisone or prednisolone 5 mg twice daily.
