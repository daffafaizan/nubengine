      patient will participate in the trial for 30 days.

      During this period of time the patients' breathing patterns, heart rate, restlessness and
      tremor in sleep will be measured by the EarlySense device which is put in the patient's bed.
      These measured values will be compared to:

        1. glucose values measured by a "Guardian RT" device - an approved device for CBGM -
           Continuous Blood Glucose Measurement;

        2. glucose levels tested by SBGM -Self Blood Glucose Measurement.

      These comparisons will show whether the EarlySense device is applicable in predicting
      hypoglycemia events in type I diabetes patients.
