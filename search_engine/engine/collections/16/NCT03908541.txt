      are associated with outcome in patients with disorder of consciousness.

      Objective: The aim of this study is to assess the value of peripheral inflammatory markers
      and brain structural alterations in the chronic phase after severe traumatic brain injury.

      Methods: Serum levels of Interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-13 and TNF-α were
      investigated in patients with chronic disorder of consciousness and healthy volunteers.
      Correlations were carried out between GM, WM, and CSF volumes and inflammatory cytokines
      levels. In addition, the Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) score was used to quantify the
      severity, and long-term recovery clinical outcome at 12 month was determined according to
      Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS).
