      middleaged patients with meniscal symptoms in excess of a structured rehabilitation program.
      In this study consecutive patients aged 45-64 years referred to the orthopaedic department at
      the University hospital Link√∂ping for a suspected meniscal injury will be randomised to a
      rehabilitation program or a knee arthroscopy + the same rehabilitation program. Functional
      tests will be performed by a physiotherapist. There will be patient administrated
      questionaries sent out after 3 and 12 month.
