      evidence indicates this is potentially achievable through application of four key
      interventions within routine maternity care delivered as NHS England's Saving Babies' Lives
      care bundle. However, adoption of the care bundle by UK maternity services is still in its
      infancy and there is significant variation in the degree of implementation between and within
      units. The effectiveness of the care bundle, when implemented as a package, in reducing
      stillbirth and service delivery has not yet been evaluated. This study aims to evaluate the
      impact of implementing the care bundle on UK maternity services and perinatal outcomes.
