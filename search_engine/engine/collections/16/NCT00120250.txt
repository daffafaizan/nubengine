    
      Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is characterized by three symptom groupings:
      re-experiencing symptoms including flashbacks, nightmares, and intrusive memories;
      physiological hyperarousal; and avoidance symptoms. Of the three major categories of symptoms
      in PTSD listed by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, sleep-related
      problems are listed in two of them: difficulty falling asleep is considered an aspect of
      hyperarousal symptoms, and nightmares are a type of re-experiencing symptom. Both are found
      commonly in PTSD. Little is known about the relationship of neuroendocrine dysregulation in
      PTSD and sleep disturbance. It is possible that successful treatment of sleep disturbance in
      PTSD may alter an abnormal stress hormone pattern. The novel cyclopyrrolone hypnotic
      eszopiclone thus presents an intriguing opportunity to examine the treatment of sleep
      disturbances and nightmares in PTSD. This study will determine the safety, efficacy and
      impact on neuroendocrine parameters of eszopiclone compared to placebo for sleep disturbance
      and overall PTSD symptoms in individuals with PTSD and reported sleep disturbance.
