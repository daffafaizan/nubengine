      controls.This study will investigate 1)abnormalities of the glutamate level of ACC in
      patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy controls by using 1H-MRS technique.
      2)potential modulation effects of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation(dTMS) on anterior
      cingulate cortex function of patients with schizophrenia. 3)the therapeutic efficacy of dTMS
      on cognitive impairments and other psychotic symptoms of patients with schizophrenia by
      adopting cognitive function and psychotic symptoms evaluation,as well as to explore the
