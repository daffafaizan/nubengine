        -  Determine response (partial and complete response at metastatic sites) in children with
           relapsed stage 4 neuroblastoma or primary resistant high-risk neuroblastoma treated with
           high-dose iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine, topotecan hydrochloride, and peripheral
           blood stem cell transplantation.

        -  Determine the proportion of patients who, as a result of this treatment, are able to
           progress to potentially curative surgery and further systemic treatment.

        -  Correlate tumor dosimetry (to determine whether the tumor absorbed the radiation dose)
           with response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to tumor progression.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      disease type (relapsed stage 4 vs primary resistant high-risk neuroblastoma).

      Patients receive topotecan hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5 and 15-19 and
      high-dose iodine I 131 metaiodobenzylguanidine (^131I-MIBG) IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and
      15. Patients receive autologous CD 34+ peripheral blood stem cells when ^131I-MIBG dosimetry
      levels reach an acceptable low on days 25-29.

      Total whole-body absorbed dose is measured periodically after the first ^131I-MIBG dose is
      administered and periodically thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for up to 10 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 67 patients will be accrued for this study.
