      pregnancy after intrauterine flushing of infertile patients with follicular fluid plus
      granulosa cells - Randomized controlled trials. The study protocol is approved by the Ethics
      Committee (Institutional Review Board) of Royan institute and all participants provide
      informed consent.

      The main objective of this study is evaluation of implantation rate and clinical pregnancy
      after flushing of uterine in infertile patients with follicular fluid plus granulosa cells in
      IVF/ ICSI cycles.

      Material and methods: In a randomized clinical trial, 140 patients with Male factor
      infertility referring to infertility clinic of Royan Institute, Iran, who received ovarian
      stimulation with agonist protocol, will be randomly assigned to two groups: in case group, if
      the follicular fluid of two clear dominant follicles contain at least 2 COC, after removal of
      the COCs, follicular fluid will be collected Endometrial cavity flushing with 2 ml of
      follicular fluid will be performed by IUI caterer. In control group only catheterization of
      uterine cavity will be performed. Primary outcome is comparison of implantation rate between
      case and control group. Secondly outcome is assessment of clinical pregnancy rate in both
      groups.
