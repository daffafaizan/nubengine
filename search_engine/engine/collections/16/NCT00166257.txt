      unknown origin a possible cause is a small opening between the upper heart chambers (patent
      foramen ovale, it is called). After birth this opening closes in 75% of the population, while
      it persists in 25% of people. It may allow a small blood clot to pass from the veins of the
      legs through the heart into the brain or other parts of the body. In order to reduce the risk
      for a further attack we have today more therapeutic options to choose from but it is unclear
      which strategy have the best outcome. This study is created to compare the effect of two
      treatment strategies:

        1. Medical treatment The purpose of medical treatment is to dilute the blood to a degree,
           that no thrombus formation occurs. Since the opening in the heart persists, treatment is
           usually recommended lifelong. And patients treated with coumadin must undergo regular
           blood tests to ensure an adequate effect of the drug.

        2. Catheter closure of patent foramen ovale An alternative method developed to close the
           small opening in the heart utilizes catheters which are introduced in a blood vessel in
           the groin and from there advanced to the heart. An umbrella device is then delivered
           through the catheter, positioned within the small defect and released. The umbrella is
           overgrown with own tissue within weeks to months and closes the small defect for ever.
