      test the hypotheses that, compared to the wait-list control group, the treatment group will
      demonstrate significantly greater improvements in cognitive outcomes, specifically:
      processing speed, executive functioning, working memory and long-term memory.

      Aim 2. The current study will examine the impact of an aquatic exercise on fatigue, mood,
      wellness, QOL and physical functioning. Specifically the investigators predict that aquatic
      exercise will lead to improvements in: 1.Fatigue 2. Health related QOL 3. Depression/anxiety
      4. Self-efficacy 5. Physical Functioning (i.e. gait and walking).

      Aim 3: Examine the long-term effects of aquatic exercise on all outcome measures.
