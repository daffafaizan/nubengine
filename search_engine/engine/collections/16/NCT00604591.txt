      per 100,000 persons in the 45- to 64-year-old age range. Despite the magnitude of this
      problem, there is currently a relative lack of understanding of the causes of, and treatments
      for, FTD, possibly because criteria for its diagnosis have only recently been developed. As
      an outcome of the proposed investigations, the investigators expect to determine the effects
      of cortical dopamine augmentation in FTD, evaluate the effect of dopamine augmentation on
      processing efficiency with fMRI, and explore the effects of a genetic polymorphism on symptom
      presentation and disease course. The research proposed in this protocol is significant
      because it could provide a new class of treatments for FTD, identify the fMRI findings
      associated with symptom improvement, and determine the contribution of a genetic polymorphism
      to symptom presentation and disease course.
