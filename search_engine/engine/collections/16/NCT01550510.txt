      relatively safe and well-tolerated. This aim will be assessed by enrolling a minimum of 6
      subjects meeting inclusion criteria, using a modified 3+3 design. Safety will be assessed
      with the following: toxicity graded by the NCI CTC, urinalysis pre- and post-infusion, basic
      metabolic panel, and CBC. From our experience and in the experience of our study
      collaborators, we hypothesize that the combination of IV AA with irinotecan will not be
      associated with adverse events.

      Phase II: To utilize CT or PET/CT (when available) scans to evaluate disease progression to
      assess overall tumor response rate (complete and partial response) in subjects with advanced
      or recurrent colorectal cancer treated with the combination of ascorbic acid and irinotecan
      versus irinotecan alone.
