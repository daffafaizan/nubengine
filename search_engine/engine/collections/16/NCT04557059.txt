      with 1 million diagnosed per year and mortality burden of over 300,000 deaths. The hypothesis
      of study is addition of apalutamide to RT+ LHRHa provides superior efficacy in terms of
      PSMA-PET metastatic progression-free survival-ppMPFS. Apalutamide is a non-steroidal androgen
      receptor (AR) antagonist being developed for the treatment of prostate cancer. RT+LHRHa is a
      combination therapy, when administered concomitantly, in high-risk patients with BCR
      relapsing after RP, potentially leads to relevant delay in the metastatic progression of
      prostate cancer at an early stage of the disease, or even cure in some cases. Study consists
      of 2 cohorts (intervention and observational cohort). At screening, eligible participants
      will undergo prostate-specific membrane antigen-positron emission tomography (PSMA-PET),
      whole-body Tc-bone scan, computed tomography (CT). Interventional Cohort, consisting of
      PSMA-PET positive participants, will undergoes 3 phases: Treatment Phase, a Post-treatment
      Phase and a Post-PSMA-PET Progression Phase. After 6-month Treatment Phase, participants will
      be prospectively assessed in Post-treatment Phase until PSMA-PET-positive metastatic
      progression is confirmed. Observational cohort will run parallelly to interventional cohort.
      PSMA-PET negative, participants will be observed until time-point when number of events
      required for analysis of primary endpoint is reached in Interventional Cohort. This cohort
      provides an approach to document the selection of treatments and observation of interventions
      in a real-life clinical practice setting. The duration of the study is estimated to be
      approximately 7 years.
