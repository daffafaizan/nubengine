      elevated CA 125 and histologically proven epithelial adenocarcinoma of the ovary, fallopian
      tube, or peritoneum, but without other evidence of disease. II. Determine the time to disease
      progression, overall survival, CA 125 levels, immune responses, and quality of life of these
      patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment
      arms: Arm I: Patients receive placebo IV during weeks 1, 3, 5, 9, 13, 25, 37, and 49. Arm II:
      Patients receive OvaRex monoclonal antibody B43.13 (MOAB B43.13) IV during weeks 1, 3, 5, 9,
      13, 25, 37, and 49. Patients in either treatment arm who have no disease progression after
      week 49 receive MOAB B43.13 once every 12 weeks until week 121. Patients with disease
      progression after week 49 may receive MOAB B43.13 alone, in combination with, or following
      chemotherapy. Quality of life is assessed during the study.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 102 patients will be accrued for this study.
