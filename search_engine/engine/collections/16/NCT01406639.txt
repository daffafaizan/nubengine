      HHT. Plans are to recruit patients with HHT from the UCSD Nasal Dysfunction Clinic.

      Those who come for evaluation and are deemed appropriate for topical ranibizumab without
      laser will be recruited for this study. Ten (10) consented, enrolled subjects will receive a
      pulsatile nasal irrigator to clean their nose twice daily. They will complete the initial ESS
      and have a blood test for Hct, Hgb, serum ferritin, liver function tests, renal function
      tests and if of child-bearing age, a urine pregnancy test. They will return 1 week later and
      will then receive intranasal sprays of ranibizumab administered once per week during clinic.
      Patients will be treated with a total of 4 applications of ranibizumab in a fine mist spray.
      This will be done with 2 mgs in 0.2cc; 0.1cc sprayed into each nostril a day; therefore 8 mgs
      will require 4 days of application. If, following the first treatments, they experience
      recurrent bleeding (equal to or less than a 75% reduction in their ESS number as compared to
      pre treatment), they will be offered the opportunity to be prescribed a second
      administration, to be completed in the same way (4 applications of 4 mg in 0.4 cc with 0.2cc
      per nostril).

      At the completion of the treatment, subjects will be observed monthly for examination and ESS
      until 6 months from the first treatment. At 3 and 6 months laboratory tests will be
      performed.
