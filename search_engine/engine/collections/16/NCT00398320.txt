        1. Determine an estimation of median time to progression (TTP) for patients treated with
           bevacizumab in combination with capecitabine and oxaliplatin

        2. Assess the toxicities associated with this regimen

      SECONDARY

        1. Determine objective response rate (RR) for patients treated with this regimen

        2. Conduct exploratory analyses of efficacy according to degree of tumor differentiation
           and primary location

        3. Determine utility of biochemical markers as a surrogate endpoint for tumor response
