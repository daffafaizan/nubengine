      compared to placebo with as needed basis (PRN) haloperidol (as a back-up in both arms) for
      treatment of hyperactive or mixed delirium. Patients will be randomized to scheduled VPA or
      placebo (normal saline) and both arms will have flexible PRN dosing of haloperidol. Thus, the
      investigators plan to learn the time to delirium resolution in patients treated with VPA
      versus placebo; percentage of patients responding to VPA versus placebo; tolerability of VPA
      versus placebo. If addition of scheduled VPA proves to shorten time to delirium resolution as
      compared to placebo, lead to less use of haloperidol, and/or have fewer side effects, it
      would provide a very important addition to our limited evidence-based repertoire of delirium
      treatment. Moreover, this pilot study would then pave the way for the bigger randomized
      control trial powered to detect its effect size.
