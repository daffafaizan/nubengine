      with increased intraocular pressure, which causes optic nerve damage and field defects if
      untreated. The aqueous humor leaves the anterior chamber through the trabecular meshwork and
      flows into the aqueous vein and the superior scleral vein through the collector channels and
      Schlemm's canal. If the trabecular meshwork is not blocked, a wide angle allows enough
      aqueous humor to drain out. The iris corneal translocation may lead to angle-closure
      glaucoma.

      Laser peripheral iridectomy is recognized as the best surgical method to relieve pupil block.
      Previous studies have shown increased anterior chamber depth (ACD), area (ACA), and volume
      (ACV), and increased Angle open distance (AOD) after LPI surgery.

      However, postoperative outcomes of LPI were not the same for patients with different angle
      closure mechanisms.

      Postoperative outcomes for LPI were best for patients with pupillary block type, but were
      moderate for patients with plateau iris group and mixed group.

      The purpose of this study, conducted in Chinese subjects, aims to use UBM to evaluate changes
      in the anterior segment parameters of LPI, and to propose methods to predict postoperative
      outcomes of LPI.
