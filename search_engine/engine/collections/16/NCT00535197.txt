    
      The proposed trial will involve the recruitment of a total of 10 patients.

      The cells will be collected from each subject recruited, via bone marrow sampling. CD34+ stem
      cells will then be isolated and harvested during a process of immuno-selection in accordance
      with the principles of Good Manufacturing Practice. The CD34+ cells will then be directly
      infused into the area of the stroke intra-arterially using the middle cerebral artery.

      Initially, the investigator will monitor each patient for a period of 6 months post-stem cell
      infusion. Thereafter, they will revert to their previous treatment regime in the clinic.

      Assessment of adverse events will be by physical examination and measurement of laboratory
      parameters. Assessment of efficacy will be by physical examination and the measurement of
      laboratory, CT and MRI parameters.
