      regional dyssynchrony at various sites of left ventricular (LV) lead placement in humans
      undergoing CRT device implantation. This study will test the following hypotheses during the
      funding period:

        1. LV lead impedograms as an implant tool to place leads at sites of latest mechanical
           delay are feasible and correlate with other means of assessing dyssynchrony.

        2. LV lead impedograms vary significantly depending on LV lead location.

        3. There are several characteristics of LV lead impedograms that correlate with mechanical
           phenomena of the heart.
