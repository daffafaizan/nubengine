      the lacrimal duct, cornea and conjunctiva.The single lipopolysaccharide on the surface of
      bacteria and the receptors on the surface of immune cells are linked by SP-D ,which acts as a
      bridge to neutralize viruses in the innate immune defense system and assists other immune
      cells in clearing bacteria and fungi.SP-D can also participate in the acquired immune
      response after combining with lipopolysaccharide on the surface of microorganisms.Some single
      nucleotide polymorphisms of SP - D can not only affect the plasma level of SP - D, which
      leads to the differences of pathogen defense capability, but also can affect the space
      configuration and structure of carbohydrate recognition domain of SP-D, causing the change of
      ability of SP - D combined with pathogens to influence its defensive role.The concentration
      of SP - D in ocular surface is closely related to the occurrence and progression of
      infectious keratitis.Association between single nucleotide polymorphisms of SP-D and the
      occurrence and development of infectious keratitis has yet to be confirmed by research.
