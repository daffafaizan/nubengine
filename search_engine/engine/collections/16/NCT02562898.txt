      mortality in the United States, with an estimated 39,950 deaths attributable to PDAC in 2014
      (http://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/pancreas.html). Over 90% of patients have inoperable
      disease at presentation, at which point systemic therapy becomes the primary form of
      treatment.

      Treating PDAC has been challenging and few approved drugs are available. Recently, however,
      some breakthroughs have occurred, raising hope that this aggressive disease can be better
      controlled. FOLFIRINOX, a combination of 5FU, oxaliplatin, and irinotecan, has been found to
      be substantially superior to treatment of gemcitabine alone in patients with metastatic
      disease and good performance status. Similarly, gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel, a regimen
      with less non-hematologic toxicity, demonstrated improved overall survival and
      progression-free survival compared to gemcitabine alone. Both of these combinations or
      modifications of these combinations are now front line options for patients with good
      performance status. Furthermore, these improvements in survival, however incremental, now
      afford patients with pancreatic cancer time to participate in and possibly benefit from
      clinical trials of novel therapeutics.
