      a correlation between the level of NKp30 and NKp46 receptor-activators expression on the
      surface of NK cells and 1) the survival time, 2) the response time to castration in patients
      with metastatic prostate cancer.

      Prospective monocenter, open-label study.

      During a visit in the frame of management of the disease, a single blood sample will be
      collected. Patients will then have a standard care follow-up for a period of 5 years. Follow
      up data (death, progression) will be collected every 6 months.
