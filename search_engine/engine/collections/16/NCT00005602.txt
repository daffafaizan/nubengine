        -  Determine the maximum tolerated duration of lobradimil plus carboplatin with
           radiotherapy in patients with newly diagnosed brain stem gliomas.

        -  Determine the toxic effects of this treatment regimen in these patients.

        -  Assess the response to radiotherapy in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive radiotherapy for 5 consecutive days a week for 6.5 weeks, for a
      total of 33 doses. Patients receive carboplatin IV over 15 minutes followed by lobradimil IV
      over 10 minutes concurrently with radiotherapy.

      The first cohort of 3-6 patients receives treatment with carboplatin and lobradimil for the
      first three weeks of radiotherapy, with the duration of chemotherapy increasing by one week
      with each subsequent cohort until the maximum duration of 6.5 weeks is reached or until
      unacceptable toxicity occurs in 2 of 6 patients.

      Patients are followed at 6 weeks; every 3 months for 2 years; every 6 months for 3 years; and
      then annually thereafter.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months.
