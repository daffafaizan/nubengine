      with SANTYL or silver-containing products, both in combination with sharp debridement as
      needed. One hundred two subjects with qualifying DFUs were randomized to daily treatment with
      either SANTYL or a silver-containing product for 6 weeks followed by a 4 -week follow-up
      period. The primary outcome was the mean percent reduction in DFU area. A secondary outcome
      was the incidence of ulcer infections between groups.
