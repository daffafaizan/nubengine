      chronic inflammation of the bladder. The enrolled subjects were collected from May 2019 to
      October 2020. The subjects were given intravesical injections of 10% dextrose under
      intravenous general anesthesia in the operating room: 2 mL of 50% Dextrose (Vitagen Inj.,
      Taiwan Biotech co. ltd., Taipei, Taiwan) was briefly diluted with 10 mL of normal saline and
      11 sub urothelial injections (1 mL each site) were performed. The injection needle was
      inserted into the urothelium at the trigone (1 site), the posterior (6 sites), and the
      lateral walls (4 sites) of the bladder, using a 23-gauge needle under rigid cystoscopic
      injection instrument (22-Fr; Knittlingen, Richard Wolf, Germany). No post-injection
      analgesics were provided to patients. Treatment was repeated based on the patients' condition
      once every 2 weeks for the first 6 cycles and once every month for the remaining 3 cycles
      with a maximum of 9 planned therapy cycles up to 6 months. The patients would be followed-up
      and assessed at each treatment time and up to 1 month after the last treatment. 19 health
      subjects were also recruited as a healthy control as the comparison.
