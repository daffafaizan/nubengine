      is being done to determine the feasibility of obtaining tumor tissue for genomic analysis.
      Patient will be offered enrollment into this trial at the time that they are being considered
      for participation in a phase I treatment trial. After consenting for this study, patients
      will undergo a fresh tumor biopsy and collection of research blood samples. Archived tumor
      specimens will also be obtained and analyzed. At the time of disease progression, fresh tumor
      biopsies and blood samples will be collected in patients who have evaluable pre-biopsy
      specimens and who are eligible to be screened for another study. This will be informative to
      evaluate the mechanisms of resistance to that agent.
