    
      The study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of deresuscitation with target CVP 0 - 4 mmHg on
      septic shock patients in the ICU on capillary perfusion density, AKI stage (based on KDIGO
      criteria), the incidence of intubation, duration of use of mechanical ventilation, and length
      of stay in the ICU which can reduce the number of morbidity and mortality.

      The study evaluates the difference in capillary perfusion density, AKI stage (based on KDIGO
      criteria), and the Cardiac index value between groups septic shock patients with CVP 0-4 mmHg
      on the 7th day after deresuscitation compared with the control group (CVP 8-10 mmHg on the
      first 7th day after being given deresuscitation).

      The study evaluates the difference in the number of intubation incidents, duration of use
      ventilators, and care in the ICU between groups of patients with septic shock CVP 0 - 4 on
      day 28 after being given a degree of comparison with a control group (CVP 8-10 mmHg on day
      28th after being deresuscitation).
