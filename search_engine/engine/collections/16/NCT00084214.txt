      In an attempt to improve efficacy, paclitaxel is sometimes used in combination with other
      anticancer agents. When paclitaxel is combined with other anticancer agents, although
      response rate is usually increased, side effects are usually increased as well. There is an
      urgent need for agents that can enhance the antitumor effects of paclitaxel without further
      increasing undesirable side effects.
