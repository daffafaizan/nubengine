      Additionally, since the majority of HIV-1 infections occur after inoculation of a mucosal
      surface, it is desirable to induce mucosal immunity as well as systemic immunity. The HIV
      p17/p24:Ty-VLP vaccine may potentially induce both CTL and mucosal antibody responses against
      HIV-1.

      Volunteers receive HIV p17/p24:Ty-VLP vaccine or placebo by IM injection (with or without
      alum adjuvant) at months 0, 2, and 6, and then either by mouth or rectal enema at months 10
      and 11. Volunteers who receive oral vaccine boosting will receive concurrent omeprazole to
      decrease stomach acid.
