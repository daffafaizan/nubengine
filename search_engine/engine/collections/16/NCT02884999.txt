      Haemorrhagic shock secondary to uncontrolled bleeding is the leading cause of preventable
      death in this population, making bleeding and coagulopathy treatment a key element of the
      early phase of trauma management. European trauma guidelines have been developed to help
      clinicians in severe trauma management and improve bleeding and coagulopathy treatment in
      this population. Investigating who these guidelines are followed in routine is crucial to
      identify opportunities to improve early management of bleeding severe trauma patients.
