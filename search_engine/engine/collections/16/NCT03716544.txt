      mechanisms have been viewed as a negative consequence of neural plasticity in the central
      nervous system after peripheral aggression. Cortical changes (neural activity in the
      deafferented cortical area was reduced but the adjacent frequencies of the hearing loss
      region activated more extensive cortical areas) occur after sensorineural hearing loss, while
      exposure to an acoustically enriched environment or using hearing aids may minimize or
      reverse the plastic tonotopic map changes in the auditory cortex. The use of hearing aids in
      tinnitus management for people with significant hearing loss will always be associated with
      an improvement in hearing handicap and quality of life, and that complicates the
      interpretation of how much hearing aids specifically affect tinnitus. Thus studies on
      tinnitus patients with mild hearing loss could be illuminating, and this population will be
      targeted in the present study.
