      cause of focal central nervous system infection in patients with AIDS. If untreated, the
      encephalitis is fatal. At present, it is standard practice to give a combination of
      pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine to treat toxoplasmic encephalitis. The high frequency of
      sulfonamide-induced toxicity in AIDS patients often makes completion of a full course of
      therapy difficult. There is some information that high doses of parenteral (such as by
      injection) clindamycin used with pyrimethamine may be as effective as pyrimethamine plus
      sulfadiazine in the management of the acute phase of toxoplasmic encephalitis in patients
      with AIDS. Administration of parenteral clindamycin for prolonged periods of time, however,
      is costly, requires hospitalization, and is inconvenient for the patient. There is some
      indication that treatment of AIDS patients with acute toxoplasmic encephalitis with oral
      clindamycin may be effective. Leucovorin calcium is useful in preventing
      pyrimethamine-associated bone marrow toxicity.

      Amended: Projected accrual increased to 50 patients. Original design: Patients receive study
      medications for a total of 6 weeks unless there are intervening events that require the
      discontinuation of study therapy. Patients are initially treated in the hospital (minimum of
      7 days). Patients who are considered responders at day 7 may complete therapy on an
      outpatient basis. Nonresponders at day 7 may also be managed on an outpatient basis when it
      is medically appropriate.
