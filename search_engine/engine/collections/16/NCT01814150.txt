    
      Docetaxel based chemotherapy is a standard therapy in various metastatic cancers including
      non small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, gastric cancer, prostate cancer, and bladder
      cancer.

      One of the main plasma protein carriers of docetaxel is Alpha 1 acid glycoprotein

      Retrospective data suggests that plasma level of alpha 1 acid glycoprotein is associated with
      the outcome of docetaxel based therapy in non small cell lung cancer patients.

      The investigators aim to prospectively study the association between the baseline plasma
      level of alpha 1 acid glycoprotein (measured on the first day of the first cycle of
      docetaxel) and the outcome (response rete, progression free survival, overall survival) of
      docetaxel based therapy in patients with metastatic non small cell lung cancer, breast
      cancer, stomach cancer, prostate cancer, and bladder cancer.
