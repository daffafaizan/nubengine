      levels, with 65% of adults over the age of 20 being overweight. Recently, there have been a
      number of advances in our understanding of the underlying causes of obesity, including
      greater understanding of both the effects of the environment and effects that are hereditary
      (i.e., genetic).

      One area in which obese versus lean individuals may be different is how their bodies handle
      water balance and thirst. Studies done in animals suggest that individuals with greater body
      fat may tolerate periods without water better than lean animals. Thus, at least in animals,
      others have found a link between ability to tolerate periods without water and increased body
      weight.

      We are studying whether the ability to tolerate periods without water and ability to feel
      thirst might differ in lean versus obese individuals. To do so, we will ask lean and obese
      individuals to undergo tests that include a period of approximately 24 hours without drinking
      any water, and on a separate day a shorter period of an intravenous high salt solution
      infusion. We will be looking at how the ability to withstand thirst (dehydration), subsequent
      water intake (rehydration), changes in hormone levels during these periods, and behavioral
      and physiological responses to thirst and rehydration differ in lean versus obese
      individuals. We hope that the data gathered from this study will give us more information
      about important differences in how water balance is regulated in lean versus obese
      individuals. Understanding these questions may provide new insights into differences between
      lean and obese individuals.
