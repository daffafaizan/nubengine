      concern due to its high prevalence which raise 10% of the general population.

      It is characterized by recurrent episodes of airflow obstruction in the upper airway (UA)
      consequence of passive collapse of the UA, particularly at the tongue level. These collapses
      induce recurrent asphyxia that results in oxygen desaturations with persistant and crescendo
      respiratory efforts inducing arousals from sleep.

      Indeed, despite its large efficacy some of the patients will never accept continuous positive
      airway pressure treatment or will not tolerate. To this extent, alternative treatement has
      been developed: implanted hypoglossal stimulation. This treatment has been developed by
      Inspire Medical Device. The InspireÂ® system is intended to prevent base-of-tongue obstruction
      as well as specific soft palate obstructions by stimulating the hypoglossal nerve synchronous
      with respiration.

      A selection processus will be applied in order to identify the patients that will be good
      responders to the hypoglossal stimulation.

      The main criterion of selection is based on Drug Induced Sleep Endoscopy(DISE) that will be
      performed by a trained endoscopist dedicated to this study.

      This sleep endoscopy allows to visualize during induced sleep the shape of the UA and the
      type of collapsus. Indeed an antero-posterior collapsus is related to a good response to
      hypoglossal nerve stimulation while complete concentric obstruction at velopharyngeal is a
      predictor of poor response.

      In this pilot study, the investigators evaluate as a primary outcome the delta range of blood
      pressure during sleep but also other cardiovascular indexes targeting blood pressure and
      heart rate variability as secondary outcomes.
