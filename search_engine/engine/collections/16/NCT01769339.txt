    
      This is an open label (all people know the identity of the intervention), single-arm,
      prospective (study following participants forward in time) study to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of miconazole plus hydrocortisone cream in participants with vulvar candidiasis.
      Participants will be evaluated and assessed on the degree of pruritus (itchiness) and
      screened for candidiasis on the baseline. Participants will apply the cream once enrolled and
      will be assessed for 1-hour to get the time to relief. Each participant will apply the study
      medication topically (applied to skin) to the lesion twice daily up to Day 14 by rubbing
      gently until it has been completely penetrated into the vulvar area affected and the
      treatment should be continued without interruption. Participants will be followed-up after 14
      days and will be assessed clinically for signs and symptoms of vulvar candidiasis; if not
      cured, participants will continue the medication up to Day 28. Primary efficacy endpoint will
      be the time needed to achieve pruritus relief. Participants' safety will be monitored
      throughout the study.
