      to estimate the effectiveness of mindfulness meditation (MfM) to improve the severity of PTSD
      symptoms, specifically sleep and anxiety, and to improve the psychological wellbeing in Iraqi
      veterans with PTSD. The study is a repeated measures, comparative study using a parallel
      design. Both groups will receive routine treatment for PTSD; in addition, the treatment group
      will receive 8 weeks (1.5 hours/week) of mindfulness meditation from a trained psychologist,
      (Co-PI, N Chychula) who has been conducting these mindfulness meditation groups with combat
      veterans for 3 years. Subjects will be asked to commit to practice mindfulness meditation
      practice for 45 minutes each day. Data will be collected at baseline, eight weeks, and twelve
      weeks (one month follow-up). An equal number of participants will be randomly assigned to
      each group with 15 assigned to each group.

      Methodology: For purposes of this pilot study, mindfulness meditation will be delivered in
      the context of a structured manual driven program, developed to enhance awareness of
      moment-to-moment experience of perceived mental processes. Although rooted in Buddhist
      traditions, this program is not religious but aims to create a greater awareness of body
      sensations, feelings and thoughts. This is thought to allow greater perception of one's
      responses and a gradual reduction in negative affect accompanied by an improvement in
      vitality and coping and psychological wellbeing (Grossman, 2004).
