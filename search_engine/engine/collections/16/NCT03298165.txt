    
      each patient should have at least two deep carious lesions The first clinical step in all
      teeth will be the opening of the cavity and the removal of undermined enamel . Caries at the
      lateral walls of the cavity and at the enamel-dentin junction was completely removed with
      excavators and/or round carbide burs at low speed. Subsequently, the central cariogenic
      biomasses and superficial part of the necrotic and demineralized dentin were removed. then
      excavation continued until the pulp exposure would occur with further excavation; thus, a
      layer of soft carious dentin was left on the cavity floor adjacent to the pulp wall.

      A dentine samples will be then collected from the base of the cavity using sterile spoon
      excavator from the both groups for baseline bacteriological assessment and another sample
      will be taken after disinfection with diode laser in the intervention group .

      In the two groups The remaining innermost layer of carious dentin are covered with calcium
      hydroxide The cavity was then sealed with restorative material (resin modified glass ionomer)
      after a 6 month period. This time was considered adequate for calcium hydroxide to exert its
      effect and for the pulp to respond with possible formation of tertiary dentin. The teeth were
      followed up every month and the integrity of the temporary restoration checked. After this
      interval of 6 months. After the rubber dam application, the temporary filling is removed
      samples are collected and the teeth are finally restored
