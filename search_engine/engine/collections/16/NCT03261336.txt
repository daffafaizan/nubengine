      calcitriol and ketoconazole and hydrocortisone-among patients with measurable disease using
      modified RECIST 1.1 criteria.

      Additionally, we will determine toxicities, and tolerability of oral calcitriol combination
      with daily oral ketoconazole, and hydrocortisone in this patient population.

      this is a single arm phase II trial of ketoconazole (400mg QD + hydrocortisone 20mg AM, 10 mg
      PM) among men with CRPC in whom disease has progressed despite abiraterone
