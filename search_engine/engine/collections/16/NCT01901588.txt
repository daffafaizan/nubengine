    
      Emergence delirium (ED) is a complex behavioral disturbance characterized by psychomotor
      agitation, perceptual disturbances, delusions, and disorientation during recovery from
      general anesthesia. In the population of subjects who undergo strabismus surgery, there are
      multiple factors that may increase the risk of ED. These include age, typically preschool
      children aged 1-7 years, rapid surgical times with rapid awakening, use of sevoflurane as the
      primary anesthetic, and surgically-induced postoperative visual disturbance. The aims of this
      study are: 1) To examine whether post-induction treatment with an Î±-2 receptor agonist,
      precedex (dexmedetomidine), decreases postoperative emergence agitation after strabismus
      surgery compared to placebo, and 2) to determine whether treatment has any effect on
      postoperative pain, nausea/vomiting, number of pain-related interventions, and time to PACU
      discharge. We hypothesize that precedex will attenuate the ED response greater than placebo
      or a lower dose after strabismus surgery and will reduce PACU pain scores without increasing
      PACU length of stay.
