    
      This is a 2-group, prospective, randomized controlled design to test the effect of an
      intervention, as compared to a usual care control group, on family caregivers (CG) outcomes,
      patient outcomes, and healthcare utilization outcomes during treatment.

      The objectives of this study are to:

        -  Evaluate the effect of a CG intervention, as compared to a control group, on CG primary
           (anxiety) and secondary (depression, health-related quality of life [HRQOL], and
           fatigue) outcomes.

        -  Measure the effect of the intervention, as compared to a control group, on patient
           outcomes (HRQOL and interrupted treatment course), and healthcare utilization outcomes
           (unplanned hospital admissions, unplanned emergency room visits, and unplanned use of
           intravenous [IV] fluids).

        -  Determine if CG self-efficacy mediates the effect of the intervention on CG anxiety.

        -  Determine if patient illness factors, care demands (hours per week spent caregiving),
           and patient and CG demographic factors moderate the relationship between the
           intervention and CG outcomes.

        -  Compare the costs of healthcare utilization (unplanned hospital admission, unplanned
           emergency room visits, and unplanned use of IV fluids) between the intervention and
           control groups.
