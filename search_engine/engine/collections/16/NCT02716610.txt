      Dance-501, a novel inhaled human insulin liquid formulation (INH) and device. Twenty-four
      subjects with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) received 3 INH doses: low (69 units), medium (139 units)
      and high (208 units) and 1 equivalent medium dose (18 units) of subcutaneous insulin lispro
      (LIS).

      The medium dose was repeated to determine within subject variability. PD was investigated
      during a 12 hour euglycemic clamp.
