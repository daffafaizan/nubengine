      waterborne diarrheal pathogen resistant to chlorine. Ceramic filters are effective at
      improving drinking water quality, including removal of protozoa. In a recent preliminary
      analysis of >22,000 children <5 years enrolled in the Global Enterics Multi-Center Study
      (GEMS) case-control study of moderate-to-severe diarrhea, Cryptosporidium was identified as a
      leading cause of diarrhea in infants across all four participating African sites. This pilot
      is the first Cryptosporidium specific intervention trial of household ceramic water filters
      to reduce the burden of cryptosporidiosis acquired through drinking water in rural Kenya.
