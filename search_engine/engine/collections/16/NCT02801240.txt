      Bowel Diseases (IBD) Crohn's disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC). The pathophysiology of
      IBD involves malnutrition, malabsorption, altered intestinal permeability, inflammation, and
      gut flora alterations. Individuals with IBD are at risk for nutrient deficiencies due to
      decreased intake, decreased absorption and/or increased enteral losses. The most common
      deficiencies involve many micronutrients including vitamins and minerals; less commonly,
      adults may also be at risk for macronutrient deficiencies involving protein and total energy
      intake. The product being studied is a comprehensive nutrition support product that was
      formulated to meet the nutritional needs of individuals with digestive complaints. This study
      will assess the effect of the study product on blood markers of nutritional status in adults
      with IBD.
