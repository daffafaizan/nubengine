      problems of ageing western societies. Many factors condition and favour falls; one of them is
      old age, usually related to a decline in sensorial functions and worsening of balance
      Vestibular rehabilitation has been shown to be effective to improve balance and reduce the
      number of falls in older people. Previous studies have demonstrated that exercises in
      computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) are more effective than other vestibular
      rehabilitation strategies in this group of age. But CDP is very expensive and not widespread.
      It would be important to minimize cost of posturographic vestibular rehabilitation.

      This study compare vestibular rehabilitation with two different posturographic devices (CDP
      and mobile posturographic system with vibrotactile stimulation), in people over 65 years.
      Additionally, we try to assess whether the reduction in the number of vestibular
      rehabilitation sessions (five) leads to an improvement in balance and in reducing the number
      of falls similar to those obtained with ten sessions.
