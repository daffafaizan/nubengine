      making prevention of preterm birth difficult. The incidence of preterm birth worldwide varies
      between 6%-11% in singleton pregnancies, and 64-93% of preterm deliveries occur after the
      spontaneous onset of labor (preterm labor). The risk factors associated with preterm birth
      include demographic variables such as ethnic group, past obstetric history, and complications
      of the current pregnancy such as infection and fetal congenital anomalies. The current study
      aims to investigate the basic mechanisms of preterm labor by systematically cataloging the
      changes in expression levels of all expressed genes whose sequences are available. The goals
      will be accomplished by using microarray technology followed by subsequent confirmative or
      complementary analyses.
