      to moderate and heavy alcohol users who are social drinkers.

      The specific aims are to:

        1. Determine if levetiracetam alters daily alcohol consumption by comparing the mean drinks
           consumed per day during levetiracetam administration compared with the mean drinks per
           day consumed during placebo administration.

        2. Obtain blood that will be banked for future genetic analysis of polymorphisms in genes
           that may predict the level of response to alcohol or effects of levetiracetam on alcohol
           consumption.

        3. Test whether the AccuswayTM platform can detect changes in body sway in light to
           moderate or heavy social drinkers and in subjects taking levetiracetam versus placebo.
