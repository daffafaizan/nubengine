    
      Objective: The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety of ocular NT-501 device with
      encapsulated NT-201 cells releasing Ciliary Neurotrophic Factor (CNTF) to the retina of
      participants affected with CNGB3 achromatopsia.

      Study Population: Five participants affected with CNGB3 achromatopsia will be enrolled, with
      one eye treated per participant.

      Design: This is a Phase I/II, prospective, single-center study. One eye of each participant
      will receive a vitreous NT-501 device implant releasing CNTF. The study will be completed
      once the final participant has received three years of follow-up.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the number and severity of adverse events and
      systemic and ocular toxicities at six months post-implantation. Additional safety of ocular
      CNTF implants in participants with CNGB3 achromatopsia will be determined from assessment of
      retinal function, ocular structure and occurrence of adverse events at all time points.
      Secondary outcomes include changes in visual function including visual acuity and color
      vision, electroretinogram (ERG) responses, and retinal imaging with optical coherence
      tomography (OCT).
