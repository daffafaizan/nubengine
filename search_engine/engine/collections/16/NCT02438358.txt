      fluorescence-based imager that collects the emission of activated LUM015 in and around tumor.
      The LUM Imaging System is designed to detect microscopic residual cancer cells in real-time
      within the tumor bed. In this study, we will evaluate the performance of the LUM Imaging
      System in detecting residual cancer and guiding its removal during lumpectomies.

      In Phase A, all patients will receive standard of care surgery followed by intraoperative
      imaging of the tumor bed and resected tissue with the LUM 2.6 Imaging Device. In Phase A, no
      clinical decisions are made based on the imaging results. Standard of care margin assessment
      will be performed and compared against the imaging results with the LUM Imaging System.

      Subjects in Phase B will receive standard of care surgery followed by intraoperative imaging
      of the tumor bed with the LUM Imaging System. In Phase B, the surgeon will remove an
      additional shaved margin specimen if indicated by the LUM Imaging System. Final margin
      assessment will be performed on the very last shaved margin specimen removed.

      All participating subjects will be observed to collect safety data from the time of injection
      of LUM015 to the time the clinical team decides no additional surgery is needed.
