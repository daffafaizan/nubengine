      without AIDS and in more than 70% of those with advanced disease. The condition is
      progressive but may be halted with disease remission. Disability is often significant.
      Peripheral nerve axons and sensory neuron cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia are the
      principal targets of the process leading to symptoms. Alpha-lipoic acid occurs naturally in
      every cell of the body. In high concentrations it acts as an anti-oxidant which regenerates
      other anti-oxidants and promotes glutathione synthesis. Clinical studies for diabetic
      neuropathy have shown significant benefit at daily oral doses that are well-tolerated.

      This placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the effects of daily oral alpha-lipoic
      acid supplements (600mg, three times per/day) plus standard medical care in the treatment of
      painful HIV-associated neuropathy over a 24-week period in adult subjects. Possible benefits
      of the study include reduction in pain and disability, reduced use of medications, and
      enhanced cellular metabolism.
