      according to the hospital policy, national guidelines(Ministry of Health, 2016) and WHO
      policy(World Health Organization, 2014)

      The target sample size for observation will be 30 babies requiring resuscitation at Mbale
      Regional Referral Hospital Delivery suite.

      The researchers will observe midwives and mothers during the process of resuscitation. This
      will be a non-participant observation. The researchers will collect data on: demographics,
      the timing of cord clamping, time to establish ventilation, intervention provided on the kit,
      post-resuscitation temperature, need to move the baby to provide extra care, and notes of the
      ease of use or challenges experienced with the kit. The researchers will ask health workers
      for their views of the usability of the kit in comparison to the equipment in current use.

      The researchers have developed a usability checklist to assess how health workers are using
      the BabySaver kit.
