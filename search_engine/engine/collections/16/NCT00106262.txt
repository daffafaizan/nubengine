      squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, or adenosquamous cancers originating in the cervix,
      vagina, or vulva will be eligible. Measurable disease by either clinical exam or radiography
      is also required. Patients receiving cisplatin-based chemoradiation as definitive treatment
      for local disease will be eligible. Patients must have no more than one prior platinum-based
      chemotherapy regimen in the metastatic setting. Patients presenting with distant metastatic
      disease (beyond the pelvis) will be eligible, as long as they are not eligible for a higher
      priority study.
