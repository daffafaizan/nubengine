      tumor grows slowly with a high potential of local recurrence. Approximately 50% of patients
      develop distant metastases, and 33% patients die within 2 years. The initial therapy of these
      malignancies consists of surgical resection followed by radiotherapy. Systemic therapy is
      crucial in the management of recurrent and metastatic disease. However, nowadays, there were
      no standard chemoimmunotherapy regimes. Previous report showed that overall response rate was
      only less than 10% using single-agent chemotherapies, and the best results were achieved by
      cisplatin. Chidamide is a new benzamide class of histone deacetylase inhibitor with marked
      antitumor activity. And a phase I study has showed that one of three patients with
      submandibular adenoid cystic carcinoma achieved a partial response treated with Chidamide.
      The investigators conducted this study to evaluate the efficacy of Chidamide combined with
      cisplatin in recurrent or metastatic head and neck adenoid cystic carcinoma, in order to find
      a potential promising way to treat this kind of disease.
