      cardiovascular disease has become increasingly prevalent and a significant cause of
      mortality. Activation of the innate immune system may stimulate inflammatory mechanisms of
      atherosclerosis development. Loss of gastrointestinal (GI) mucosal epithelial integrity and
      loss of CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria occur in HIV-infected patients
      and are not fully restored by cART. Translocation of microbial products from the intestinal
      lumen into the systemic circulation has been demonstrated to be increased in HIV-infected
      patients and the investigators hypothesize that it is a key driver of monocyte and macrophage
      activation. In turn, these pro-inflammatory monocytes and macrophages can induce
      atherosclerotic disease development. The purpose of the research study is to determine the
      effects of a glucagon-like peptide-2 analog, teduglutide, on intestinal epithelial integrity,
      microbial translocation across the gut lumen, markers of innate immune system activation
      including the monocyte transcriptome, bone, arterial inflammation, and atherosclerosis in a
      6-month randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled proof of concept trial in HIV-infected
      individuals.
