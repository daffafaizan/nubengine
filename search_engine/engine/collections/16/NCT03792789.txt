      palsy accounts for about one third of cases. Improving spasticity and upper limb function in
      these children can lead to better functional outcome and quality of life. TMS is an upcoming
      rehabilitative modality which has shown promising results in western studies. It has benefits
      of being non-invasive and has shown to have additive effect when used with CIMT which is
      standard of care in hemiparetic CP. However, randomized controlled clinical trials comparing
      it with CIMT alone in hemiparetic CP are very few, none from India so far. The dose, type and
      duration of TMS and its feasibility in resource limited set up needs to be investigated in
      children .Therefore, the investigators aim to evaluate efficacy of TMS as an adjunct to CIMT,
      assess its safety and tolerability and study cortical excitability with help of TMS.
