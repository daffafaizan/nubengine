      administered on a continuous or intermittent, but there were no consensus on which should be
      adopted. Continuous feeding were thought to be better tolerated by patients with the limited
      absorptive gut surface area or gastrointestinal dysfunction, but associated with more tube
      clogging and required the patient to be attached to an infusion pump for significant periods
      of time. Intermittent infusion resembled more physiological feeding process, which allowed
      greater patient mobility and might reach goal enteral calories earlier, and the latter were
      considered to effectively decrease the LOS-in-hospital and mortality. However, it also had
      some previous study found that intermittent infusion had more complications, such as
      diarrhea, regurgitation than continuous.

      Recently, some study found that it was an efficient way to prevent aspiration and reflux by
      increasing the enteral nutrient solution viscosity and improve bolus intermittent feeding
      intolerance. In dementia or Parkinson's patients, one study showed that high-viscosity liquid
      meal could decrease the incidence of aspiration, compared with the thin liquid, but the study
      about the viscosity of nutrition was little and the sample size was small.

      In this study, the primary goal of this was to study whether receiving semi-solidification of
      nutrients could increase the percent prescribed calories received by improving the feeding
      intolerance, and secondary goal was to observing the effect of semi-solid nutrient to the LOS
      of ICU and in-hospital, lung infection, 30-days mortality and the glycemic variability (GV).
