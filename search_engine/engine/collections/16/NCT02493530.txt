      or hydroxyurea-resistant/refractory PV patients already taking therapeutic levels of
      ruxolitinib, but who are not achieving maximal response at the highest tolerated dose of
      ruxolitinib as discussed among investigators. Only TGR-1202 will be escalated in a modified
      3+3 dose escalation algorithm to determine the MTD of TGR-1202 to be given with any given
      dose of ruxolitinib.

      Stage 2 will include myelofibrosis or hydroxyurea-resistant/refractory PV patients who have
      never been on JAK-STAT inhibitory agents, and includes simultaneously initiation of both
      ruxolitinib and TGR-1202. In Stage 2, JAK Inhibitor na√Øve patients will receive TGR-1202 at
      the recommended dose established in Cohort 1, and ruxolitinib. As patients in Stage 1 will be
      on ruxolitinib at different doses, dose levels in Stage 2 will expand to meet requirements
      for safety analysis.
