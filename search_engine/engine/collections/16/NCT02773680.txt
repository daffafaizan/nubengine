      measuring changes in bioimpedance as compared to a reference state (and not absolute
      quantities). Therefore, the technique cannot differentiate between extrapulmonary structures
      (muscles, thorax, heart, large vessels, spine, etc.) and non-aerated lung tissues - which is
      a major limitation for the clinical use of information derived from EIT-imaging. Moreover,
      current EIT-reconstruction algorithms are based on the consideration of a complete circular
      thoracic shape and do not take into account the body contours and lung borders.

      The investigators are convinced that EIT-derived dynamic bedside lung imaging can be advanced
      by morphing computed tomography (CT) scans of the respective thoracic levels with concomitant
      EIT images - thus enhancing EIT-image information with CT-data. Integrating the anatomy of
      thoracic shape and lung borders provided by high-spatial resolution multi detector CT-scans
      (MDCT) with high-temporal resolution EIT has the potential to improve image quality
      considerably. This data can be used to compute mean EIT-reconstruction models that further
      offer the possibility to develop novel and clinically meaningful EIT parameters.

      Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that by integration of CT-scan information of body
      and lung contours (and by computing different EIT reconstruction models) the current
      methodological limitations of EIT technology can be overcome.
