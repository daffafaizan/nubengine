    
      OBJECTIVES:

      To determine the safety and preliminary efficacy of 4 TB HDT candidates:

        1. Safety (treatment emergent serious adverse events and SUSARs)

        2. Microbiologic effects in sputum (culture conversion, change in MGIT TTP) and blood (WBA)

        3. PET/CT imaging

        4. Serum markers of inflammation

        5. Effects on Mtb-specific and general immune function

        6. Pulmonary effects (spirometry, 6MWT, O2 saturation, and St. George Respiratory Symptom
           Questionnaire) In each case, TB HDT effects will be determined by comparison to patients
           treated with standard TB therapy alone with regard to a common set of primary and
           secondary endpoints.

      PRIMARY ENDPOINTS

        1. For auranofin, everolimus, and vitamin D: the proportions of patients experiencing
           suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs).

        2. For CC-11050: the proportion of patients experiencing treatment emergent serious adverse
           events (SAEs).
