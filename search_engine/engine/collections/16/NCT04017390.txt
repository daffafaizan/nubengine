      symptoms will be by exam, questionnaires, and ultrasound of the median nerve. These will
      document baseline/change in the size of the median nerve and improvement in
      function/symptoms. The questionnaires are 1.) Boston Carpal Tunnel (BCT). 2.) Carpal Tunnel-6
      (CTS-6); and 3.) Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH). These will be used to
      document a baseline and change (if any) in nerve size and hand symptoms, over a 2 week time
      frame, that are common in carpal tunnel syndrome (including numbness, pain, tingling, and/or
      decreased function).

        1. The Boston Carpal Tunnel is a 19 question tool that assesses function (8 items) and
           symptom severity (11 items). Score range is from 0 to 95 with a high number indicating
           more severe/worsening symptoms and lower number less severe/improving symptoms.

        2. The CTS-6 is a six item tool that combines reported symptoms with a physical exam of the
           hand. Scores range from 0 to 26 with a higher score reflecting increased severity.

        3. The DASH is a 30 item tool with each scored 1 to 5. Scores can range from 0 to 150 and
           the higher the score the worse the symptoms/disability.

      Treatment groups are as follows:1.) Theraworx foam alone; 2.) Theraworx foam with night time
      splint; 3.) Placebo foam alone; 4.) Placebo foam with night time splint. The active
      ingredient in Theraworx foam is magnesium sulfate and will not be in the placebo foam.
      Instructions on how to apply the foam, whether or not and how to wear the splint, and return
      visits will be provided. If in a group that requires night time splinting, the subject must
      wear the splint only at night and for a minimum of 8 hours.
