      can potentially help guide target volumes for patients with unfavorable-risk prostate cancer
      receiving radiation by designing a radiation treatment plan so that the entire prostate
      receives the prescribed dose of radiation in addition to the visible tumor in the prostate as
      detected by mpMRI and/or PSMA-PET receiving any inevitable intrinsic plan "hot spots" or
      areas of dose above the prescription.
