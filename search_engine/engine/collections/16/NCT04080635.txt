      continue on standard dosing schedule of brodalumab (i.e. one loading dose first (210mg), once
      a week for 2 weeks (210mg), then a regular dose regimen (210mg) every 2 weeks). During each
      study visit, blood will be taken in order to quantify Ctroughs and/or anti-drug antibodies
      towards brodalumab. In addition, the Psoriasis Severity and Area Index (PASI) and the
      Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score will be evaluated by a physician. Patients
      complete the Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) and European quality of life EQ-5D
      instrument at each visit.
