      participated in this double blind randomized control trial. Each subject presented to the
      exercise lab on four separate occasions. Trial 1 was a familiarization trial to determine
      each subject's maximal aerobic capacity and peak treadmill running speak (VO2 Peak test).
      Trials 2, 3 and 4 utilized the same exact protocol, differing only in pharmacological
      intervention. In a randomized, double-blind order (both participant and investigator blinded
      to the intervention), either a placebo pill, the V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan (Samsca™,
      30mg tablet), or the V2 receptor agonist desmopressin (DDAVP™, 0.2mg tablet) was ingested
      along with the CorTemp™ Core Temperature Sensor two hours before commencement of the Exercise
      Trial with 240mL of bottled water. The exercise protocol consisted of 60 minutes of treadmill
      running at 60% of peak speed (steady-state) followed by a performance test (the VO2 Peak
      test). Blood, saliva and urine, were collected before the exercise trial (baseline) and again
      after both the steady-state run and performance runs. Sweat was obtained from sweat patches
      after both the steady-state and performance runs. Core temperature, fluid intake, performance
      time, body weight, thirst and sodium palatability ratings were also assessed. Free access to
      water was allowed during the trial and all urine produced during the trial was measured and
      collected. The main outcome measure was sweat sodium concentration.
