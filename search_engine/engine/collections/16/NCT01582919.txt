      association with longitudinal epidemiologic cohorts (AMI and 3C). The first objective is to
      investigate the association between the evolution of imaging markers and the evolution of
      cognitive performance in normal and pathological aging. This objective will be conducted
      among subjects having already participated in AMImage1, thereby permitting the longitudinal
      study of MRI data. An MRI exam will also be proposed to 100 subjects (members of the AMI and
      3C cohorts) in order to provide a third wave of MRI (for a longer-term MRI follow-up) or a
      second one for the participants who only had one MRI exam in the AMImage project. Our second
      objective is cross-sectional and will study the imaging parameters of subjects presenting
      signs of cognitive decline over the previous 4 years (through the follow-up conducted in the
      AMI cohort). Finally, an additional objective will consist in a comparison between two
      populations very contrasted in terms of cognitive reserve: AMI (very low education level in
      rural area) and 3C (higher level of education in urban area).
