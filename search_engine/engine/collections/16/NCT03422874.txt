    
      This is an open label, dose escalation, phase I study of the combination of MLN9708 MLN9708
      plus Nelfinavir. It will use a 3+3 cohort design to determine the maximum tolerated dose of
      the combination, which will be defined as the highest dose cohort where < 1/6 patients
      develop a dose limiting toxicity. The maximum tolerated dose cohort will be expanded to have
      at least 6 patients with biopsiable tumors who undergo pretreatment and post treatment tumor
      biopsies for molecular pharmacodynamic markers.
