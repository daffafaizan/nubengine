    
      Patients with dementia often experience poor quality transitions from the hospital to the
      community. In response, the investigators developed and piloted the Coordinated-Transitional
      Care (C-TraC) program--a low-cost, telephone-based intervention designed to improve care
      coordination and outcomes in hospitalized patients with dementia or other high-risk
      conditions discharged to community settings.

      A single-blind, prospective, randomized-controlled trial will be used with participants being
      randomly assigned to receive usual (i.e. standard) care, or usual care plus the C-TraC
      intervention. Outcomes will be assessed via scheduled phone-calls at 14, 30, and 90 days
      post-hospitalization. A 45-day phone call will also be conducted to complete a brief
      satisfaction survey with the caregiver about their post-hospital experience.
