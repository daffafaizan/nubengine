      Dual diagnosis (psychiatric and substance use) patients' (DDPs) participation in 12-step
      mutual-help groups is linked to lower relapse and treatment utilization rates. However, under
      usual referral, many DDPs do not attend, or sustain attendance of, substance-focused groups
      (SFG). DDPs may benefit from dual-focused groups (DFGs).

      Objectives:

      (1) Implement and validate procedures to help counselors make effective referrals to DFGs.
      DDPs were assigned to a standard- or intensive-referral to DFG condition to determine the
      extent to which intensive referral, compared to standard referral, increased patients'
      mutual-help group participation. (2) Determine whether DDPs who received intensive referral
      had better substance use and psychiatric outcomes.

      Methods:

      DDPs entering VA outpatient mental health treatment received either standard (N=145) or
      intensive (N=142) referral. Standard referral consisted essentially of the counselor
      recommending DFG participation. The keys to intensive referral were a DFG orientation and the
      counselor facilitating direct contact between the patient and a DFG member, and following up
      on recommendations for mutual help. Patients were followed at six months (80%), one year
      (81%) and two years (80%) to determine whether intensive referral resulted in more DFG and
      SFG participation, and better substance use and psychiatric outcomes.

      Status:

      Completed.
