      health benefits. However, a systematic literature review (Kapp & Sumner, 2019) revealed a
      lack of evidence for human health benefit. Despite the lack of evidence, U.S. retail sales of
      kombucha and other fermented beverages have increased 37.4% in 2017, and kombucha is the
      fastest growing product in the functional beverage market.

      As a phase 0 clinical trial, we will learn how kombucha influences glucose metabolism in
      humans. We plan for 20 subjects to take part in this study.

      This is a randomized-controlled counter-balanced study design. Subjects will be asked to
      complete 4 in-person visits over 2 months time (twice per month). At the first visit,
      subjects will be randomized into one of four groups. At each subsequent visit, subjects will
      be randomized into one of the remaining groups until they have completed each arm.

      Arms (at least 5 subjects in each arm, minimum total=20 subjects)

        1. Intervention group 1: commercial kombucha: drink 8oz kombucha

        2. Intervention group 2: brewed kombucha: drink 8oz kombucha

        3. Control group: drink 8oz tea (the same type as used to brew the kombucha)

        4. Control group 2: drink 8oz tap water
