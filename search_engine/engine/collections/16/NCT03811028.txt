    
      This is an open, single-arm, multicenter extension study to assess the safety, tolerability
      and efficacy of long-term SOBI003 treatment in pediatric MPS IIIA patients. The study is an
      extension of the First in Human (FIH) SOBI003-001 study, allowing continuous treatment of
      SOBI003 for up to 2 years. Study patients who complete Week 24 of the FIH study (SOBI003-001)
      will be invited to continue to Week 25 in the extension study.

      When entering the extension study, these patients will receive the highest dose that has been
      declared safe in the ongoing FIH study (SOBI003-001). Upon completion of the FIH study, an
      analysis aimed at selecting the dose for forthcoming studies will take place. Once the dose
      has been selected, this dose will be applied to all patients enrolled in the extension study.
      The total duration of the extension study for an individual patient is 80 weeks, resulting in
      a total of 104 weeks (2 years) of SOBI003 treatment.
