      findings suggest that Bowen Therapy has inconsistent immediate effects on postural control
      and pain threshold in healthy subjects. Further studies are needed using symptomatic
      participants. No previous randomized control trial, to our knowledge, has investigated the
      effectiveness of Bowen's technique on health status in dentists suffering from postural neck
      pain. Moreover, there is limited evidence and low agreement regarding the effect of Bowen's
      therapy on neck pain. Thus, this study aims to answer the question: Bowen's technique is
      effective for improving neck pain dentists' function by reducing pain, and disability, and
      improving posture, and health status, without need for ergonomic alternation?"
