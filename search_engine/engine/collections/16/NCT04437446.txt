      with infrared light, with no radiation nor side effects, to evaluate within seconds the
      vascularization of the fundus, retina and optic nerve head, which may be useful for the
      glaucoma diagnosis. A recent meta-analysis has shown a decrease of the vascular density (DV)
      in glaucoma, so that OCTA may be useful in the advanced diagnosis of glaucoma. However, the
      VD values obtained were different depending on the device. In addition, no studies with the
      OCT Triton (TopconÂ®) device were considered in the analysis. The authors suggested the
      development of dedicated software, which would allow the evaluation of VD with different
      devices for a more independent and valid assessment. On the other hand, recent studies show
      that the diagnostic capacity of OCTA may be superior to that of OCT, and that OCTA may be
      more useful in determining the severity of glaucoma than OCT. It is therefore necessary to
      evaluate the additional diagnostic tests whether they are non-invasive and whether it allow
      us to give a faster diagnosis.

      This study is aimed at comparing the diagnostic utility of OCTA with standard complementary
      glaucoma examinations (OCT and CV).
