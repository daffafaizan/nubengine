    
      -  20 postmenopausal women unexperience in strength training or resistance training,
           without musculoskeletal, neurological diseases, and cardiovascular limiting-diseases
           were recruited.

        -  Maximum strength of lower limbs during leg-press exercise was measured for future
           analysis.

        -  The force-time curves were measured during climbing a step and rising from a chair.

        -  A fragility phenotype test was applied to the subjects to determine frailty phenotype
           classification, including; weight loss of greater than 10 lbs in the past 12 months,
           maximal handgrip strength, time to walk 15-ft at usual pace, self-reported leisure time
           physical activity, and self-reported exhaustion.

        -  The anthropometric measurements were performed by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry.
