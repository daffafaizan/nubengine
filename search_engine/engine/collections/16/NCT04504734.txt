    
      This is a Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, clinical study
      of bucillamine (2 dosage levels) in patients with mild-moderate COVID-19. Patients will be
      randomized 1:1:1 to receive bucillamine 100 mg 3 times a day (TID), bucillamine 200 mg TID or
      placebo TID for up to 14 days. After the first interim analysis when a single dose is
      selected, patients will then be randomized 2:1 to the selected bucillamine dose or placebo
      The study will be overseen by an independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Up to
      10 centers in the United States will conduct this study.

      Patients qualifying for study enrollment will initiate therapy as outpatients, under home
      quarantine. Patients will receive continued standard care of therapy (per study site written
      policies or guidelines) together with bucillamine and/ or matching placebo for up to 14 days.
      Dosing should continue until the treatment course is completed or as medically indicated
      (e.g., deterioration of clinical status and alternative therapy required). If the patient
      requires hospitalization during the study period, treatment will be discontinued.

      Following completion of the treatment course, follow up assessments will be performed by a
      study nurse 14, 28, 42, and 60 days following the end of treatment.

      Up to 1000 patients will be enrolled in this study. Patients will participate in the study
      approximately 45 days.
