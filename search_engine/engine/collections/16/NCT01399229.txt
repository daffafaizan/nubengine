    
      The SureCALL® Labor Monitor® (SureCALL®) is a transabdominal electromyography monitor
      intended to measure uterine activity. It is intended for use on pregnant women, with
      singleton pregnancies, using surface electrodes on the maternal abdomen. The device is
      intended for use by healthcare professionals in a clinical setting.

      This measurement study was designed to evaluate the performance of SureCALL® Labor Monitor®
      (SureCALL®) compared to the predicate Tocodynamometer device (TOCO) in pregnant laboring
      preterm patients, nonlaboring preterm patients, and nonlaboring term patients.

      This study involved 25 women at a Gestational Age of 36 weeks or less and 5 women at a
      Gestation Age of greater than 36 at five clinical sites. Each study subject was instrumented
      with two technologies for measuring uterine activity:

        1. Standard tocodynamometer attached to the maternal abdomen,

        2. SureCALL® with a set of abdominal surface electrodes for uterine electromyography
           attached to the maternal abdomen

      Subjects did not recieve any interventions as a part of this study.
