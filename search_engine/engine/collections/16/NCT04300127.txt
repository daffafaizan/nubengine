    
      Objective • The principal objective of this pilot study will be to evaluate whether 8 weeks
      of treatment of pioglitazone will improve symptoms as measured by the Gastrointestinal
      Symptom Index Daily Diary (GCSI-DD) in patients with Idiopathic Gastroparesis

      Secondary objectives of this study include:

        -  To determine the effects of pioglitazone on other symptoms associated with gastroparesis
           using the Patient Assessment of Upper Gastrointestinal Symptom Severity Index (PAGI-SYM)
           and the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS),

        -  To determine the effects of pioglitazone on gastric emptying as measured by the 13C-
           Spirulina breath test,

        -  To determine the effects of pioglitazone on satiety as measured by a liquid caloric test

        -  To determine the effects of pioglitazone on depression and anxiety using the Beck
           Depression Inventory and State-Trait Anxiety Scores,

        -  To determine the effects of pioglitazone on Quality of Life using the PAGI-QoL and Short
           Form (SF)-36 questionnaire,

        -  To determine the effects of pioglitazone on markers of inflammation (CRP and ESR) and
           serum cytokine levels

        -  To determine the nature and incidence of adverse effects from a 12-week course of
           pioglitazone.

      • Pioglitazone (30 mg po qd)

      Population • Age 18 years or older at registration with nausea, vomiting, and other symptoms
      suggestive of patients with chronic nausea and vomiting of presumed gastric origin, with
      symptomatic gastroparesis.

      Study duration

        -  Up to 4 weeks of screening prior to pioglitazone treatment

        -  8 weeks of treatment starting at initial dose of pioglitazone

        -  4 weeks of washout period

        -  Length of recruitment: 16 months

      Sample size justification

        -  Total of 10 patients

        -  Primary comparison: Baseline PAGI-SYM score versus 4, 8, and 12 weeks.
