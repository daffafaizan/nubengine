      symptomatic developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH) in most patients with closed triradiate
      cartilage. First developed by Ganz in 1984, this technique utilizes 4 osteotomies to
      completely mobilize the acetabular fragment 1. Although a technically demanding procedure, it
      allows optimal correction in all planes and maintains integrity of the posterior column,
      enabling early weight bearing and mobilization. Several groups have confirmed the long-term
      efficacy of this joint preservation procedure with a recent report from the inventing
      institution documented impressive survivorship up to 30 years after surgery 2. Treatment with
      PAO is more controversial for mild forms of dysplasia where the lateral center-edge angle
      (LCEA) is 18° - 25° and/or the Tӧnnis angle is 8° - 15°. In these patients the delta
      correction is more limited, thus creating a more unpredictable result with equally invasive
      surgery.
