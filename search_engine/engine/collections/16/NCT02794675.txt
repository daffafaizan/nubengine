      To assess the effect of Cesium 131 brachytherapy in subjects with resectable recurrent cancer
      of the head and neck by evaluating disease free survival (DFS) and comparing to a previous
      cohort. Potential effects on locoregional control rate and overall survival will be explored.

      Secondary Objective:

      To assess toxicity associated with cesium 131 brachytherapy treatment.

      Study Design Patients with a head and neck recurrent cancer who are planned to undergo
      definitive tumor resection surgery that meet our inclusion and exclusion criteria will be
      offered participation in this clinical trial.

      Participant's Follow-up. The participant's medical records will be reviewed every 3 months
      for 24 months to assess: loco-regional control, distant metastasis free survival, disease
      free survival, and overall survival. This will allow us to assess the potential treatment
      effect of cesium 131.
