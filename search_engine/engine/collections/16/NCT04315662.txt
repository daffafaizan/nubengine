      a physical activity instructor with different velocity loss (VL) thresholds: 10% (VL10) and
      30% (VL30). Subjects followed a muscle power training for 8 weeks (2 sessions per week on
      alternate days) using the leg extension exercise, with similar relative intensity (50% 1RM).
      Between weeks one and four two series will be performed per session. Then the number of
      series will increase to three per session. The inter-set recovery period will be always of
      2-min.

      Before and after the muscle power training the following tests will be performed: 1) measure
      of body composition with dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry for determining the lean mass of
      thighs; 2) three functional test (chair stand test, time up go test with cognitive task and
      gait speed test); 3)Progressive loading test in a leg extension machine until finding the
      mean muscle power corresponding to 50% of 1RM (speed of concentric phase of 6.67 Â± 0.04 m/s
      measured using a camera-based optoelectronic system).
