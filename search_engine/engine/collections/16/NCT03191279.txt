      ambulance services, the personnel of first unit to reach the scene of accident for any
      emergency response to trauma will register what first aid measures (if any) are indicated and
      have been performed by the bystanders on the scene up til the point where the ambulance
      arrives. Hospital data for each case will be retrieved. Those patients who did receive
      correct first aid will then be compared to those patients who did not receive first aid, and
      those where first aid was attempted but not correct for differences in share of survivors,
      length of hospital stay, and need for admission to ICU.
