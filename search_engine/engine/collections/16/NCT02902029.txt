      effective therapeutical approaches as targeting the Ras/Raf signalling pathway by BRAF and
      MEK inhibition or targeting immunologic checkpoint control with an antiPD-L1 antibody.

      This is a prospective, open, multicenter, randomized phase II study in patients with
      unresectable or metastatic BRAFV600 mutant melanoma. In this study the scheduling of the
      treatment with a combined BRAF/MEK inhibition and the treatment with an anti-PD-L1 antibody
      will be assessed.

      After a 3 months run-in period with vemurafenib and cobimetinib, all patients who did not
      show disease progression or treatment interruption for more than 28 days during run-in phase
      will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio:

        -  either to proceed vemurafenib and cobimetinib until disease progression and subsequently
           cross-over to atezolizumab treatment until disease progression (Arm A).

        -  or to receive the anti-PD-L1 antibody atezolizumab until disease progression and
           subsequently cross-back to vemurafenib and cobimetinib until disease progression (Arm
           B). In a translational research program tumor tissue, blood plasma and peripheral blood
           mononuclear cell will be analyzed to evaluate the biologic effects of treatment sequence
           on the molecular profile and biomarker expression in tissue and plasma.
