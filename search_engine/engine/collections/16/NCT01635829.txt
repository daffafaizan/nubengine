    
      This is a Phase I, open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized
      (the study medication is assigned by chance), 2-panel, sequential treatment study. In this
      study 24 healthy participants will be randomly assigned equally to 2 panels. In Panel 1 the
      participants will receive telaprevir in Part 1 (telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours from Day 1 to
      Day 9 followed by a single 750 mg dose in the morning on Day 10) and phenytoin/telaprevir in
      Part 2 (phenytoin 200 mg every 12 hours from Day 1 to Day 16 followed by a single 200-mg dose
      in the morning on Day 17; and telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours from Day 8 to Day 16 followed
      by a single 750 mg dose in the morning on Day 17). In Panel 2 the participants will receive
      telaprevir (telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours from Day 1 to Day 9 followed by a single 750 mg
      dose in the morning on Day 10) and carbamazepine/ telaprevir (carbamazepine 200 mg every 12
      hours from Day 1 to Day 16 followed by a single 200-mg dose in the morning on Day 17; and
      telaprevir 750 mg every 8 hours from Day 8 to Day 16 followed by a single 200-mg dose in the
      morning on Day 17). In both panels, Part 1 and Part 2 are separated by a washout period of at
      least 2 weeks and maximum 4 weeks. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by evaluating
      adverse events, electrocardiogram, clinical laboratory examinations, vital signs and physical
      examination throughout the study period.
