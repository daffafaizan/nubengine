      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate in patients with refractory chronic graft-versus-host
           disease treated with pentostatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the time to next immunosuppressive agent (i.e., the time to progression from
           best response) in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the infection rate in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients.

        -  Determine the changes in lymphocyte populations in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the survival of patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive pentostatin IV over 20-30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days
      for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients who achieve a complete response after 6 courses receive 4 additional courses.
      Patients who achieve a partial response, minor response, or stable disease after 6 courses
      may receive up to 6 additional courses.

      Patients are followed every 4 weeks for 1 year, every 3 months for 2 years, and then annually
      for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 37 patients will be accrued for this study.
