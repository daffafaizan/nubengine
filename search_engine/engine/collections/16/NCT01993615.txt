      Healthcare System with a diagnosis of FAI that are surgical candidates and have already
      failed at least six weeks of conservative treatment.

      This is a randomized controlled study comparing outcomes for the standard treatment for FAI
      and/or acetabular labral pathology (arthroscopy with or without labral repair) versus
      physical therapy. For subjects in the arthroscopy group, the surgery will be performed by the
      Orthopedic Surgical Service at Madigan Army Medical Center.

      Subjects randomized to the physical therapy group will follow a treatment plan implemented by
      a physical therapist within the Madigan Army Healthcare System.

      After consent, subjects will be randomized into one of two arms (Group I = hip arthroscopy,
      Group II = physical therapy). Group I will undergo hip arthroscopy with or without labral
      repair. Group II will follow a FAI-based physical therapy program x 12 sessions (6 weeks).

      The arthroscopy group will complete outcome measures at time of consent and following surgery
      at 6 months, 1 year and 2 year time periods. Subjects in this group will follow a
      standardized post-operative rehabilitation protocol.

      The physical therapy group will complete outcomes measures at time of consent and at 6 month,
      1 year and 2 year time periods following the initial physical therapy evaluation. Subjects in
      this group will complete 6 weeks of an impairment-based physical therapy program.

      In addition to the outcome measures taken, healthcare utilization and associated costs for
      hip-related care during this 2-year period will also calculated for comparison between the 2
      groups.
