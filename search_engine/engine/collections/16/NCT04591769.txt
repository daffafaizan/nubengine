      recurrent laryngeal nerve paresis/ palsy and results in post-anterior cervical spine surgery
      (post-ACSS) dysphonia. Control of intraoperative ETCP during ACSS may benefit voice outcome.
      The taper-shaped tracheal tube cuff was originally designed as a new strategy to reduce fluid
      leakage across the conventional cylindrical cuff and prevention of ventilator associated
      pneumonia. Literature has revealed the just seal pressure for the tapered-shaped tracheal
      tube (TT) cuff was lower than conventional cylindrical cuff. Therefore the investigators
      hypothesize that use of a tapered-shaped ET cuff during the surgery can lead to a lower ETCP
      during retractors splay and improve voice recovery after ACSS. In this study, 80 patients
      were randomized into 2 groups, to receive endotracheal intubation using TaperGuard tracheal
      tube (tapered- shaped cuff) or a conventional tracheal tube (a cylindrical cuff). The just
      seal pressure, intraoperative cuff pressure, and postoperative sore throat and voice outcome
      are recorded and compared.
