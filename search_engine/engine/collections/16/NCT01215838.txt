    
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), a form of liver cancer, is the seventh most common cause of
      cancer mortality in the US. The incidence rate of HCC is increasing along with the incidence
      of Hepatitis B and C which are known to promote HCC. Patients have a better prognosis
      (survival outlook) if HCC is found and treated at an early stage. MRI is the best imaging
      modality for diagnosing HCC.

      This study will compare standard MRIs and MRIs performed with a newly developed MR protocol
      to determine if it is possible to more confidently diagnose HCC.
