      feasibility and safety of elimination of the scar-related monomorphic ventricular tachycardia
      (VT) or tachycardias by stereotactic radiosurgical ablation that is completely non-invasive.
      The arrhythmic substrate is defined as the scar after myocardial infarction (MI) described by
      transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and specified by PET-CT or MRI. All sustained
      monomorphic VT induced by programmed ventricular stimulation via implanted ICD (Implantable
      Cardioverter Defibrillator) will be analyzed using body surface ECG mapping. The target
      volume for stereotactic radiosurgical ablation (single dose of 25 Gy) will be based on
      accordance between a post-infarction scar (PET-CT or MRI imaging) and arrhythmic substrate
      (body surface ECG mapping).
