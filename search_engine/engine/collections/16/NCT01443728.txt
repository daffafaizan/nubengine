      sickle cell disease, ages 3 to 20 years-old, comparing a 2-year monthly oral dose of vitamin
      D3, 100,000 IU (equivalent to 3,300 IU/day) to a standard monthly dose, 12,000 IU (400
      IU/day) in reducing the rate of respiratory events (defined as respiratory infections, acute
      asthma exacerbation, and the acute chest syndrome) in children and adolescents with sickle
      cell disease in comparison with the rates of respiratory events over a baseline period of one
      year.

      Eligible participants (130 patients) will initially be screened to determine their blood
      vitamin D levels (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D). Those with 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels between 5
      and 60 ng/mL will be eligible for randomization. At study entry, blood and urine samples will
      be collected for routine and special blood tests including tests on immune function,
      inflammation, and bone function. Children above 5 years old will also have lung function and
      muscle strength tests. Participants will be followed once a month to administer the study
      medication (oral vitamin D3) and to monitor any side effects from the study medication by
      history, examination and blood and urine tests. After 12 and 24 months of therapy, the same
      study procedures at study entry will be repeated.

      This study could help establish oral vitamin D3 as a simple, low cost treatment to reduce
      respiratory complications in children and adolescents with sickle cell disease.
