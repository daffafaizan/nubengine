      disease relapse, and so the standard of care is to give either whole brain irradiation or
      stereotactic radiosurgery to the resection cavity in order to prevent disease recurrence.
      Stereotactic radiosurgery generally offers a more favorable side effect profile than whole
      brain irradiation, but targeting a surgical resection bed can be a challenge, as post
      surgical changes make it more difficult to distinguish residual tumor from scar, and much of
      the dose ends up being focused on the center of the resection cavity, where there are no
      substantial tumor cells.
