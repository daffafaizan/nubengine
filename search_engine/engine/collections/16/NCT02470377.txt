      treatment with rTMS. Up to 20 treatments with rTMS with either anatomically or functionally
      determined targets will be administered. Treatments will be preceded by an fMRI scan and EEG
      recording prior to the first rTMS treatment and will be followed by an fMRI and EEG after the
      last treatment. Post treatment diaries will continue for up to 12 weeks after rTMS
      administration.
