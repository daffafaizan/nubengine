      within 7 days or of intra-amniotic infection:

        1. Optimises antenatal management (regarding steroids, tocolysis, antibiotics, maternal
           length stay duration) without worsening perinatal outcomes.

        2. It is a cost-effective strategy.

        3. It improves neonatal outcome (in premature newborns <30 weeks), and reduces infectious
           maternal morbility.

        4. It improves neurodevelopmental outcome at 1.2 and 5 years.
