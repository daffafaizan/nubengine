    
      The duration of each subject's participation in this study will be approximately 64 weeks (or
      1 year, 12 weeks), comprised of a five study periods (Screening, Baseline, Pre-transplant,
      Transplant, and Post-transplant Follow-up). During the Screening Period (approximately 8
      weeks), written informed consent (and assent, if applicable) will be obtained and the subject
      will complete other Screening procedures to confirm study eligibility. Once study eligibility
      is confirmed, subjects will enter the Baseline Period (up to 3 days) during which time
      assessments will be performed to establish a pre-transplant baseline. Once baseline
      assessments are complete, the subject will enter the Pre-transplant Period (approximately 6
      weeks) during which time mobilization, apheresis, AVR-RD-01 drug product preparation and
      testing for release, and conditioning regimen administration to achieve myeloablation will
      take place. Following completion of the Pre-transplant Period, the subject will enter the
      Transplant Period (1 day) during which time AVR-RD-01 infusion will take place. After
      AVR-RD-01 infusion, the subject will enter the Post-transplant Follow-up Period
      (approximately 48 weeks), during which time periodic safety and efficacy assessments will be
      performed to assess measures of engraftment, clinical response, and safety post-transplant.
      Post-transplant follow-up will occur at the following time points: Week 1 (Days 1 through 7),
      Week 2 (Days 10 and 14), Week 4 (Day 28), Week 8 (Day 56), Week 12 (Day 84), Week 24 (Day
      168), Week 36 (Day 216), and Week 48 (Day 336).

      After study completion, consenting subjects will continue periodic safety and efficacy
      assessments for approximately 14 years (for a total of 15 years post-transplant follow-up) in
      a long-term follow-up study to AVRO-RD-01-201.
