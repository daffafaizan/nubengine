      mortality in nursing home residents. MRSA is predominantly spread from patient-to-patient by
      health care workers. The use of gowns, gloves and hand washing prevents this spread; however,
      their use detracts from a patient-centered, home-like environment which is an important
      priority for nursing homes. The goal of this project is to determine when it is most
      important for health care workers to wear gowns and to wash their hands when caring for MRSA
      colonized Veterans in community living centers. To meet this goal, the investigators will
      enroll ~400 MRSA-colonized residents and health care workers from VA community living centers
      in four states and the District of Columbia. Additionally, the investigators will enroll some
      non-MRSA colonized residents as control subjects. Each enrolled resident will be followed for
      6-25 episodes of care observations over 30 days. During each observation, the investigators
      will have health care workers wear disposable gowns and gloves during each care activity
      (e.g. wound dressing) that occurs during the study visit. At the end of each care activity,
      the investigators will swab the gown and gloves prior to disposing of them. Each swab will be
      tested for MRSA to determine if MRSA from the resident was transferred to the healthcare
      worker's gown or gloves during that episode of care. The results of the investigators'
      analysis will be used to develop new infection control guidelines which balance patient
      safety and a home-like, patient-centered environment.
