      A. To determine composite criteria (combining elastographic, parity and Bishop score
      information) that predict delivery mode.

      B. To determine the prognostic value of elastography as concerns delivery within 24 hours
      among patients induced via oxytocin with an intravaginal device releasing PGE2 (Bishop score
      < 6).

      C. To determine the prognostic value of elastography as concerns delivery mode (vaginal
      versus cesarian for slow dilatation (more than 2-3h without fetal suffering))among patients
      induced via oxytocin alone.

      D. To evaluate the intra- and inter-operator reproducibility of the cervical hardness score
      determined via elastography.

      E. To evaluate the economic impact of using the cervical hardness score from the point of
      view of the French social system (French health insurance) and the hospital.
