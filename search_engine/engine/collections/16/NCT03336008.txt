      them. After obtaining the informed consent, their genotypes will be determined and collect
      clinical information. Some of the participant will have clear genotyping via Department of
      Health. Participants with a genetic confirmation of SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 12 genes will be
      included in the study. The relatives of genetically confirmed participants, who also had
      ataxic symptoms, might be included in the study without further determination of the
      genotypes.

      Detailed clinical history including age of onset, clinical symptoms will be collected. A
      detailed neurological examination with an emphasis of eye movements (such as pursuit,
      saccadic, and convergence eye movements). We will also perform SARA scale, a validated ataxia
      scale. Timed 25 foot-walk test will be performed.

      Two-year annual follow-up will be arranged for recruited subject for neurological physical
      examination, SARA scale, in order to continue assessment for any progress change in disease
      stage.
