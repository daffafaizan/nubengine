      specific question regarding the role of the cardioprotective therapy in Duchenne Muscular
      Dystrophy and Becker Muscular Dystrophy patients. In this light, CMR could provide relevant
      data, reinforcing the scientific background, to start early (particularly in BMD patients in
      whom this is still a debated question) a cardioprotective treatment with carvedilol or
      ramipril.Finally,this clinical trial will clarify whether a preventive therapy may be helpful
      on the clinical outcome, both in reducing myocardial fibrosis and preventing the progression
      towards the cardiomyopathy.
