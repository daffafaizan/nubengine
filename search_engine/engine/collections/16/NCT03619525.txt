      incidence of about 25%. the formation of atelectasis appears to be the primary factor
      responsible for increased intrapulmonary shunt after cardiac surgery with CPB. The
      investigators will use the lung ultrasound to evaluate the effects of intermittent
      recruitment of the lungs during CPB on extra vascular lung water (EVLW).

      Objectives :

      To evaluate the effect of intermittent lung recruitment during CPB in cardiac surgery on:

      Lung ultrasound score (LUS),Oxygenation at different times postoperatively,Time for
      extubation and length of ICU stay

      sixty patients aged from 18-60 years old, scheduled for elective cardiac surgery with CPB
      will be included in the study. Patients will be randomly allocated into one of two groups:
      Group A (n=30): will receive intermittent lung recruitment during CPB.Group B (n=30): control
      group.
