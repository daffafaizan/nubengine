      I. To estimate the antitumor activity of gemcitabine hydrochloride in patients with
      persistent or recurrent endometrial adenocarcinoma who have failed higher priority treatment
      protocols.

      II. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity of this drug in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat
      every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.
