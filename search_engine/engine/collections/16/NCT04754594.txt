      to receive BNT162b2 or placebo (saline) at 27 to 34 weeks' gestation. IRC review of safety
      data through 7 days after the second dose for all Phase 2 participants will be completed
      before participants in the Phase 3 portion can be enrolled.

      The Phase 3 portion of this study will assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of
      BNT162b2 among pregnant women enrolled at 24 to 34 weeks' gestation.

      Maternal participants who originally received placebo will receive BNT162b2 at defined time
      points as part of the study.
