      I. To establish the magnetic resonance (MR) imaging signal characteristics of macrophages in
      pediatric patients (>= 2 years old) with newly diagnosed malignant brain tumors using
      ferumoxytol, an ultrasmall superparamagnetic iron oxide (USPIO) particle.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate the MRI signal of ferumoxytol uptake in macrophages with the number of
      macrophages in surgical tumor specimen at histopathology.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive a single intravenous infusion of ferumoxytol over 15 minutes. After 24
      hours, patients undergo ferumoxytol-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients will
      then undergo MRI-localized tissue sampling and tumor resection.
