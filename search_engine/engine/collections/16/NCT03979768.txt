      years. Our aim was to explore the capacity of Norwegian community pharmacies to identify
      people at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes and the impact of the risk assessment
      service on self-rated health.

      Methods: Nineteen community pharmacies were randomly allocated to a diabetes risk test only-
      group or Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) -group were the participants with a high risk of developing
      type 2 diabetes also received a HbA1c-measurement. Two pharmacists at each pharmacy were
      trained to perform risk assessments and counselling. The pharmacists at the 11 HbA1c
      pharmacies were also trained in how to perform the HbA1c- measurement. During six months,
      pharmacy customers equal or above 45 years old, wishing to participate contacted the pharmacy
      staff. Participants completed a validated diabetes risk test and a background questionnaire
      including a validated instrument for self-rated health. In the risk test only-group,
      participants with a high risk of developing type 2 diabetes were referred to their general
      practitioner for follow-up, while in the HbA1c-group, participants with HbA1c â‰¥ 48 mmol/ mol
      (6.5%) were referred to their general practitioner.
