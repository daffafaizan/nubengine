      randomized controlled trial of Lisdexamfetamine (Vyvanse) versus placebo, with 50 patients
      randomized to Lisdexamfetamine and the other 50 patients to placebo. The investigators will
      acquire high-resolution, anatomical and functional MRI images at baseline and after 12 weeks
      of treatment.

      In addition, 75 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects will be imaged at baseline.
