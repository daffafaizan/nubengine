    
      The spondyloarthritides are a group of inflammatory rheumatic diseases, including ankylosing
      spondylitis, reactive arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease-related rheumatic disease, and
      psoriatic arthritis.

      The frequence of axial spondyloarthritis is 0.41% in the french population. This disease is
      associated with a reduction of physical capacities and quality of life. NSAIDs or even
      biologic therapies do not always permit a sufficient control of the disease. Different
      physical exercise programs can be effective as an additional therapy for spondyloarthritis,
      with positive effects on spinal mobility as well as main disease activity and functional
      indices (BASDAI, BASFI and BASMI). The severity of the disease does not seem to influence
      significantly the patients' motivation in practicing physical activity.

      This proposed study aims to demonstrate the beneficial effect of physical exercises coached
      with a specific internet program diffused on a secured platform.

      Each patient will have to connect 3 times weekly in order to follow the entire program.

      The impact will be evaluated at 3 months and 6 months.

      Potential impacts of video-coaching program are:

        -  reduction of the intrinsic inflammatory activity of the rheumatic disease;

        -  improvement of the global physical condition: muscular strength and resistance, walking
           ability, chest expansion;

        -  reduction of fatigue and improvement of sleeping;

        -  reduction of consumption of symptomatic drug (analgesics, NSAIDs, corticosteroids).
