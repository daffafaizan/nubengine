    
      We will provide a 15g mixed essential amino acid feed or 4 x 3.75g.

      There is sexual dimorphism thus initially we will just recruit males. Powering calculations
      dictate n=8 in each group.

      We will use well established stable isotope tracer techniques (with 13C6 Phenylalanine) to
      measure muscle protein synthesis and breakdown by Gas Chromatography - combustion - isotope
      ratio mass spectroscopy.

      We will measure leg blood flow by phase shift Doppler and muscle microvascular flow by
      contrast enhanced ultrasound.
