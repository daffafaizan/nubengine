      with poor cardiac function preoperation, long surgical time, complicate or difficult surgical
      procedure or uncompleted corrected malformation currently. Thus, it is necessary to search
      other approaches to improve cardiac function for cardiac surgery patients in order to
      increase the success, decrease complication and mortality in cardiac surgery.

      Although statin has been used to low cholesterol to prevent and treat coronary artery disease
      for many years, it has been reported that statin could protect endothelial function and
      cardiac function in coronary artery bypass graft. However, some results were controversy.
      Also, there is no clinical data available on statin cardiac protection during surgery in
      China where rheumatic heart disease is prevalence.Thus, it is necessary to perform a double
      blind, randomised clinical trial in China to determine whether statin can protect heart
      injury during heart surgery in China and what's its mechanism.
