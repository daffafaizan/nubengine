           or hemodynamic parameters has the superiority as a valid tool to evaluate the renal
           perfusion improvement and whether the changes can better predict AKI occurrence in
           severe sepsis or septic shock patients.

        -  Methods: Measure the renal resistive index and take record of hemodynamic parameters
           (use a PiCCO monitoring to measure cardiac output if the patient's next to kin agree to
           undertake such a catheter ) before and after successful resuscitation for severe sepsis
           or septic shock patients, followup to determine the occurrence of AKI and mortality.

        -  Hypothesis: The changes of resistive index or cardiac output during shock resuscitation
           may be a better parameter to evaluate renal perfusion and predict AKI, and may have a
           better value to guide renal protective therapy in septic shock.
