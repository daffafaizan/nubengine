      intravenously at varying intervals prior to spinal anaesthesia, at which time 5mls of
      cerebrospinal fluid and 10mls of blood were sampled, and analysed for concentrations of
      paracetamol, paracetamol glucuronide, paracetamol sulphate, and AM404, a known
      endocannabinoid reuptake inhibitor, and metabolite of paracetamol.

      Paracetamol readily penetrates into the cerebrospinal fluid in animal studies and in
      children. This could account for the rapid central analgesic and antipyretic action of
      intravenous paracetamol however this remains to be studied in adults. AM404 has never before
      been identified in humans, and its presence in CSF following paracetamol supports the
      hypothesis of a central mechanism of action of paracetamol via AM404.
