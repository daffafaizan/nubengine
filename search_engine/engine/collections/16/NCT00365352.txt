      study to assess the efficacy and safety of XP13512 in subjects with Restless Legs Syndrome
      (RLS). Eligible subjects were randomized to receive 1 of 3 once daily oral doses of XP13512
      1200 mg, XP13512 600 mg, or placebo. The primary study objective was to compare the efficacy
      of XP13512 1200 mg taken once daily for 12 weeks versus placebo. The secondary study
      objectives were to assess the efficacy of XP13512 600 mg taken once daily for the reatment of
      RLS and to assess the onset of treatment benefits and improvement in sleep, pain, mood,
      quality of life, and safety and tolerability of both XP13512 1200 mg and 600 mg.
