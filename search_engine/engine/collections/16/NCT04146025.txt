      following the birth of a child, occurs in 10-15% of women. PPD peaks within the first 2-3
      months following delivery, but can occur anytime in the first year, representing one of the
      most common complications of childbearing. The consequences go beyond impaired functioning
      for the woman, and include harmful effects on the cognitive and emotional development of the
      woman's infant. Despite this, many women are undiagnosed and do not get adequate treatment.

      Living near and spending time in green space is associated with a host of mental health
      benefits, including reduced depression and improved well-being. Research has shown that women
      who live near more green space have improved birth outcomes such as higher birthweight
      infants.

      Despite the growing body of evidence linking nature with improved mental health, spending
      time in green space is not a standard health promoting tool to address mental illness.
      Behavioral economics concepts have been used successfully in promoting other preventative
      health behaviors such as physical activity and healthy eating.
