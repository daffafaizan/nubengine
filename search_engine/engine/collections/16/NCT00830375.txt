      compulsive buying. Sixteen subjects meeting criteria for compulsive buying will receive 8
      weeks of open-label memantine. The hypothesis to be tested is that memantine will be
      effective and well tolerated in patients with compulsive buying. The proposed study will
      provide needed data on the treatment of a disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly
      effective treatment.
