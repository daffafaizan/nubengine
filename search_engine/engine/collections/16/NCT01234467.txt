      after therapy with bendamustine combined with rituximab in older (≥65 years old) patients
      with previously untreated stage II-IV DLBCL deemed poor candidates for cyclophosphamide,
      doxorubicin hydrochloride, vincristine (Oncovin®), prednisone, rituximab (CHOP-R); n=37. The
      hypothesis being tested is that this regimen will be safe and effective as frontline therapy
      in older DLBCL patients deemed poor candidates for CHOP-R. After 3 cycles of therapy,
      patients with less than a partial response (PR) will come off study, and be managed at the
      discretion of their treating physician. Patients who achieve a PR after 3 cycles will
      continue for a total of 8 cycles of therapy, while patients who achieve a CR will continue
      for a total of 6 cycles of therapy. Secondary objectives include overall response rates
      (ORR), disease-free, progression-free and overall survival, and an evaluation of the toxicity
      and tolerability of the regimen.

      This trial also includes an exploratory analysis designed to evaluate a potential correlation
      between expression of the senescence marker p16INK4a and the toxicity associated with this
      regimen.

      In addition, patients will be asked to participate in a Geriatric Assessment (GA) tool during
      the trial.
