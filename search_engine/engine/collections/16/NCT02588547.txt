        1. Granisetron1 group: women will receive 1mg IV granisetron

        2. Granisetron 0.7 group: women will receive 0.7 mg IV granisetron and

        3. Control group: women will receive 2 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride. Throughout the study
           period,shivering scores, core temperature, sensory level and motor block will be
           recorded, heart rate will be measured continuously using an electrocardiogram; blood
           pressure will be determined. If heart rate decreases by more than 20% of the baseline
           atropin will be received and if blood pressure decreases 20% of the baseline ephedrine
           will be received.

      Also, Apgar score at one minute and five minutes will be recorded. At the end patient
      satisfaction will be assessed using Verbal Numeric Scoring system Side effects (bradycardia,
      hypotension, hypothermia, nausea and vomiting, pruritus etc ) will be recorded
