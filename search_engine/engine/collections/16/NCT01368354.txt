      sample frame, shortly followed by a baseline survey during which baseline data on human
      cysticercosis, porcine cysticercosis (serological test), STH infection prevalence
      (quantitative coprological test) and anthropometric data (weight, height, arm circumference)
      will be obtained from the study communities (infected people will receive treatment). The
      study communities will be subsequently randomly allocated a status of intervention or control
      community, and this will determine the point at which CLTS will be administered, but all
      communities will ultimately receive CLTS. CLTS will be conducted in intervention communities
      for 12 months by UNICEF. A post-intervention survey will follow the 12 month CLTS campaign,
      and all factors investigated at baseline will be revisited in both intervention and control
      communities. The compliance of the CLTS approach will also be measured. CLTS will be
      administered to control communities after the completion of the post-intervention survey.
      Baseline data will be used to show that the groups are comparable; in the primary analysis
      the difference between intervention and control at follow up will be analyzed to evaluate the
      impact of CLTS. If this intervention can be demonstrated to have an impact on the occurrence
      and burden of sanitation-linked diseases, then this will provide advocacy for such an
      approach at policy-maker level.
