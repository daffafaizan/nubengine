      after a localized trauma such as hip fracture, or blunt solid organ injuries. In addition, in
      critically ill patients on the medical ICU, early mobilization improves patients' functional
      outcome and decreases ICU length of stay (1). This study evaluates if critically ill patients
      in a surgical ICU can safely and effectively be mobilized early after trauma and surgery. The
      investigators propose to conduct a randomized controlled study in surgical intensive care
      unit patients to evaluate the effects of mSOMS guided early mobilization. Additionally, the
      study will examine known genetic polymorphisms as related to sleep quality and muscle
      strength and how it relates to early mobilization of surgical ICU patients. In particular,
      the study will focus on the following polymorphisms: CLOCK, NPAS2, PER2 and PER3, PDE4D,MUC1,
      ATP2B1, DCDC5, TRPM6, SHROOM3, and MDS1 genes.
