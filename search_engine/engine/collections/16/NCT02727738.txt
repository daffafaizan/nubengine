      patients will be treated with an anti-thyroid drug (methimazole) at the dose aimed to control
      hyperthyroidism. Group B patients will be treated with methimazole plus selenium (160 mg
      daily). Patients will be evaluated at time 0, 45 and 90 days for symptoms of hyperthyroidism
      (by a specific questionnaire), clinical status (weight, heart rate), laboratory (thyroid
      function tests, TSHR autoantibodies, serum selenium, index of oxidative stress-MDA,
      cholesterol, SHBG) and EKG. The aim of the study is to evaluate if the combined treatment
      (methimazole plus selenium) is more effective than methimazole alone in controlling GD
      hyperthyroidism.
