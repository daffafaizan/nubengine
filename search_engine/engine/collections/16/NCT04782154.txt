      artery to measure cardiac output, pulmonary artery pressures (Richard C, 2011) as well as
      cardiac filling pressures. Since its initial presentation by Swan in 1970 (H J Swan, 1970),
      several modifications were made on the initial catheter now allowing continuous assessment of
      cardiac output, continuous monitoring of stroke volume (SV), systemic vascular resistance
      (SVR) and mixed venous saturation (SvO2) (Arora, 2014) (H J Swan, 1970) (Richard C, 2011). We
      intend to enhance current Swan-Ganz catheters with clinical decision support tools to early
      identify hemodynamically unstable states that can lead to further deterioration of the
      patient's health state.

      Right ventricular (RV) dysfunction is mostly associated to a decrease in contractility, right
      ventricular pressure overload or right ventricular volume overload (François Haddad, 2008).
      RV dysfunction can occur in several clinical scenarios in the intensive care unit (ICU) and
      operating room (OR): pulmonary embolism, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic
      shock, RV infarction, and in pulmonary hypertensive patients undergoing cardiac surgery
      (François Haddad, 2008). RV dysfunction has been associated with increased mortality in the
      ICU and cardiac surgical patients (André Y. Denault, 2006) (Denault AY B. J.-S., 2016). Thus,
      early identification of RV dysfunction at less severe stages will allow for earlier
      intervention and potentially better patient outcomes. Unfortunately, identifying which
      patients will develop RV dysfunction and then progress towards RV failure have proven
      difficult. One of the reasons for delaying the diagnosis of RV dysfunction could be the lack
      of uniform definition, especially in the perioperative period. Echocardiographic definitions
      of RV dysfunction have been described in previous studies: RV fractional area change (RVFAC)
      < 35 %, tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) < 16 mm, tissue Doppler S wave
      velocity <10 cm/s, RV ejection fraction (RVEF) <45% and RV dilation have been related to RV
      dysfunction (Rudski LG, 2010). However, these echocardiographic indices cannot be
      continuously monitored and are insufficient in describing RV function. The diagnosis of
      fulminant RV failure is more easily recognized as a combination of echocardiographic
      measures, compromised hemodynamic measures and clinical presentation (Raymond M, 2019)
      (François Haddad, 2008) (Haddad F, 2009). RV dysfunction is inevitably associated with
      absolute or relative pulmonary hypertension because of the anatomic and physiological
      connection between the RV and pulmonary vascular system (Naeije R, 2014) (François Haddad,
      2008). The gold standard for measuring pulmonary pressure is still the pulmonary artery
      catheter. However, RV output can initially be preserved despite of pulmonary hypertension
      (Denault AY C. M., 2006). It is therefore mandatory that early, objective, continuous, easily
      obtainable and subclinical indices of RV dysfunction are found and validated to initiate
      early treatment of this disease.

      Since 2002, Dr Denault's group at Montreal Heart Institute has been using continuous RV
      pressure waveform monitoring initially for the diagnosis of RV outflow tract obstruction
      (Denault A, 2014) and then for RV diastolic dysfunction evaluation (St-Pierre P, 2014)
      (Myriam Amsallem, 2016). Preliminary data based on a retrospective study on 259 patients
      found that 110 (42.5%) patients had abnormal RV gradients before cardiopulmonary bypass
      (CPB).Abnormal RV diastolic pressure gradient was associated with higher EuroSCORE II (2.29
      [1.10-4.78] vs. 1.62 [1.10-3.04], p=0.041), higher incidence of RV diastolic dysfunction
      using echocardiography (45 % vs. 29 %, p=0.038), higher body mass index (BMI) (27.0
      [24.9-30.5] vs. 28.9 [25.5-32.5], p=0.022), pulmonary hypertension (mean pulmonary artery
      pressure (MPAP) > 25 mmHg) (37 % vs. 48 %, p=0.005) and lower pulmonary artery pulsatility
      index (PAPi) (1.59 [1.19-2.09] vs. 1.18 [0.92-1.54], p<0.0001). Patients with abnormal RV
      gradient had more frequent difficult separation from CPB (32 % vs. 19 %, p=0.033) and more
      often received inhaled pulmonary vasodilator treatment before CPB (50 % vs. 74 %, p<0.001).
      However, this was retrospective and limited to the pre-CPB period.

      In 2017, in a review article on RV failure in the ICU (Hrymak C, 2017), RV pressure waveform
      monitoring using the paceport of the pulmonary artery catheter was recommended as a simple
      method of monitoring RV function (Rubenfeld GD, 1999). However, no studies have reported
      prospectively the prevalence of abnormal RV pressure waveform during cardiac surgery and in
      the ICU.
