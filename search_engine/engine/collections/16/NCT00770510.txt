      to investigate and evaluate the efficacy of eszopiclone in Japanese participants with primary
      insomnia. The treatment period consists of two consecutive days (two nights) as one term.
      Patients will receive oral eszopiclone (1, 2, 3 mg), zolpidem tartrate (10 mg), or placebo
      once daily at bedtime for each use. Participants were randomly assigned to one of 10
      prespecified treatment sequence patterns.
