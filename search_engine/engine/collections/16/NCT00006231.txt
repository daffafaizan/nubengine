        -  Determine the efficacy of radiotherapy in the prevention of metastatic skin nodules or
           tumor seeding following invasive diagnostic procedures, such as chest drain insertion,
           pleural aspiration, pleural biopsy, and thoracoscopy, in patients with malignant
           mesothelioma.

        -  Determine whether the nodules that develop after radiotherapy are symptomatic in these
           patients.

        -  Compare the quality of life of patients treated with radiotherapy vs standard care
           alone.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.

      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive radiotherapy on 3 consecutive days beginning within 3 weeks
           after chest drain insertion, pleural aspiration, pleural biopsy, or thoracoscopy and
           once the wounds have healed.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard supportive care alone. Quality of life is assessed at
           baseline, and then at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months.

      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, and 12 months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44 patients (22 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      2 years.
