      (HeadStart Test system) in addition to answering questions abut their daily COPD symptoms for
      6 months.

      In summary, this study aims to validate a novel non-invasive point of care (near-patient)
      testing system, to allow people with COPD to detect pulmonary exacerbations by measuring
      urinary biomarkers. If successful, we hope that this will provide patients with an easy to
      use device, which will empower patients and their caregivers to treat exacerbations at an
      earlier stage, with potential health and economic benefits.
