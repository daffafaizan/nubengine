      Aim 1: Compare the effects of two evidence-based strategies on lowering blood pressure and
      other outcomes important to patients: best-practice clinic-based care and home-based
      telehealth care.

        -  Hypothesis 1.1: Compared with patients in clinics assigned to clinic-based care,
           patients in clinics assigned to telehealth care will have a 5 mm Hg greater change in
           systolic blood pressure over 12 months of follow-up.

        -  Hypothesis 1.2: Compared with patients in clinics assigned to clinic-based care,
           patients in clinics assigned to telehealth care will report: a) fewer treatment side
           effects; b) better ratings of patient experience of hypertension care; and c) higher
           self-monitoring rates and confidence in self-care.

      Aim 2: Conduct an evaluation of the reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance of the
      telehealth care and clinic-based care interventions using a mixed-methods approach supported
      by the RE-AIM framework and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).
