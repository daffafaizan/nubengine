      volume of blood from the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit involves centrifugation and washing
      of whole blood with a saline solution. This process is sufficient for the recovery of red
      blood cells however; it results in the discarding of other important components of the blood.
      The removal of white blood cells, plasma proteins and clotting factors may result in an
      increased risk of a adverse outcomes during the post-operative period. The new technique our
      team wants to investigate returns a greater proportion of the patients' whole blood for
      reinfusion. Our study objectives are to compare the two techniques and determine which
      technique produces the safest most reliable method of blood processing to help the patient
      have a smooth, short, transfusion free post-operative period in the intensive care unit
      (ICU).
