      and skin conductance during specific tasks (e.g., emotion recognition, fear learning and
      extinction). However, not much is known about the influence of oxytocin on those measures
      during rest. Therefore, in this randomized, placebo controlled, double blinded study, the
      investigators will investigate the influence of oxytocin during a resting period of 5
      minutes. Heart rate, skin conductance, respiration and EEG will be measured before and after
      oxytocin or placebo administration. The investigators expect that oxytocin will increase the
      heart rate variability and decrease the skin conductance levels. Exploratory, the
      investigators will conduct a cross-frequency analysis of band power and asses the
      relationship between distinct indexes of sympathetic / parasympathetic balance.

      Please note that this study is part of a larger study in which the investigators also asses
      the influence of oxytocin on neurophysiological responses elicited by direct gaze
