      operated annually to restore knee stability. Despite recovery of knee passive laxity and
      muscle strength, dynamic knee stability is often not restored. In additional to muscle
      strength, muscle elasticity and muscle coordination may also play an important role in knee
      stability. However, there is no evidence regarding the changes in muscle elasticity after
      ACLR and its contribution to dynamic knee stability. This study is a cross-sectional study
      designed to compare the the difference in muscle strength, muscle elasticity and muscle
      coordination of quadriceps and hamstring muscle in 30 ACLR patients and investigate its
      relationship with knee biomechanics during single leg hop landing. Patient selection was base
      on medical records and subjective knee functional scores. Patient enrollment and informed
      consent was conducted first. Muscle strength was measured by isokinetic muscle
      testing(Biodex) at two speeds. Muscle elasticity was assessed by ultrasound shear wave
      elastography. Muscle coordination evaluated by electromyography(EMG) and knee biomechanics
      including kinematics and kinetics was measured by 3D motion analysis system(VICON) and all
      the assessments were done in CUHK-ORT Sports Injury Research Laboratory in the Prince of
      Wales Hospital, Hong Kong. All data was collected and analyzed by qualified personnel.
