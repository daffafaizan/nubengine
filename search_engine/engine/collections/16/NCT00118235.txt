      I. To determine the percentage of patients with extensive stage small cell lung cancer
      treated with cisplatin, irinotecan and bevacizumab who live longer than 12 months.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate of patients treated with cisplatin, irinotecan and
      bevacizumab.

      II. To evaluate the toxicity and tolerability of the combination of cisplatin, irinotecan and
      bevacizumab.

      III. To determine the association between VEGF/KDR complex expression and VEGF plasma levels
      and tumor response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 60 minutes and irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and
      8. Patients also receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then
      every 6 months for 3 years.
