    
      This study is a national multicentre (~15 sites), prospective, single-arm, observational
      study in patients treated with rivaroxaban 2.5mg bid on top of ASA75-100mg OD (N=1000).
      Female and male patients with a diagnosis of CCS and/or symptomatic PAD will be enrolled in
      the (outpatient) clinic after the decision for treatment with rivaroxaban 2.5mg bid,
      co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid has been made by the treating physician.

      The primary effectiveness endpoint is a composite of:

        -  Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE including stroke, cardiovascular mortality and
           myocardial infarction)

        -  Clinically driven coronary, peripheral or carotid revascularization

        -  Stent thrombosis at one year

      The primary safety endpoint is Major Bleeding at one year. These major bleeding complications
      are analysed according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)
      criteria as a composite of fatal bleeding, symptomatic bleeding into a critical organ (such
      as intracranial, intraspinal, intraocular, retroperitoneal, intra-articular or pericardial,
      or intramuscular with compartment syndrome), bleeding causing a fall in haemoglobin level of
      2 g/dL (1.24 mmol/L) or more, or leading to transfusion of two or more units of whole blood
      or red cells.

      The secondary endpoints will be:

        -  Occurrence (and date) of stroke

        -  Occurrence (and date) of myocardial infarction

        -  Occurrence (and date) of cardiovascular death

        -  Occurrence (and date) of coronary revascularization procedures (PCI, CABG).

        -  Occurrence (and date) of peripheral revascularization procedures.

        -  Occurrence (and date) of carotid revascularization procedures.

        -  Occurrence (and date) of minor bleeding complications (according to ISTH)

      In addition, all bleeding events including minor bleedings according to ISTH definitions will
      be reported.
