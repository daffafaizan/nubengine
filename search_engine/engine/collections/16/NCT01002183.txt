      parasite to synthesise isoprenoids, as precursors of many essential compounds including
      sterols, carotenoids and ubiquinones. This is effected through blockade of the non-mevalonate
      pathway by fosmidomycin as a potent inhibitor of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate
      reductoisomerase coupled with targeting of protein biosynthesis by azithromycin through
      binding to the 50S ribosomal subunit. This mode of action contrasts with the ability of the
      human host to utilise the mevalonate pathway for isoprenoid synthesis and accounts for the
      safety profiles of both drugs through the mechanism of selective toxicity. Moreover it
      affords protection against cross resistance with existing chemotherapeutic agents.
