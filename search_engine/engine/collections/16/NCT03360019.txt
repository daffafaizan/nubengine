      will be evaluated in two studies. Study 2a will use the insole system with dementia patients
      residing in skilled or memory care. Data regarding caregiving activity will be collected from
      their paid professional care providers. Study 2b will use participant localization data
      collected on 80 independently dwelling mild dementia patients. In this case data will be
      collected from their unpaid family caregivers. Both studies will result in evaluating the
      efficacy of the WiFi-based insole to provide caregivers with augmented patient awareness,
      helping to improve their immediate quality of life by reducing their direct burden of
      continuous oversight of their person in care.
