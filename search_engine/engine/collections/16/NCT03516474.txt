      (MIMOSA) Device, which attaches to a smartphone and assesses tissue health parameters in a
      quick, non-invasive way using near-infrared light. This study will use MIMOSA to monitor
      patients at 4 sites in Toronto (St. Michael's Hospital, Women's College Hospital, South
      Riverdale Community Health Centre and at Westpark Healthcare Centre). These study sites were
      chosen to cover patients from diverse clinical backgrounds: St. Michael's Hospital is an
      Acute care centre for the diabetic lower extremity, Women's College Hospital is an outpatient
      wound clinic focused on the management of DFUs, South Riverdale is a Community Health Centre
      focused on prevention, and Westpark is a rehabilitation site focused on
      post-operative/amputation care and preservation of the opposite limb. conducted on patients
      who present with a non-healing diabetic foot ulcer and are already receiving standard best
      practice as prescribed by the diabetic foot multi-disciplinary team.
