      Disorder (CUD) and 25 light users (<1 joint/week) to complete three guided imagery conditions
      (stress, cannabis, neutral) in inpatient research units. During the guided imagery, repeated
      measurements of subjective (i.e., craving, negative affect), neuroendocrine (i.e., cortisol),
      and physiological variables (i.e., heart rate variability [HRV]) will be collected.
      Thereafter, individuals with CUD will begin one-month of drug counseling treatment coupled
      with surveys delivered via smartphones daily in the morning, evening, and at four random
      times during the day.
