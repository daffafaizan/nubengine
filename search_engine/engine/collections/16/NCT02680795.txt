    
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized study to determine the PK profiles of belinostat
      in patients with relapsed/refractory solid tumors or hematological malignancies who have
      heterozygous and homozygous UGT1A1*28 genotypes and wild-type UGT1A1 gene. Enrolled patients
      will be assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts (A, B, or C) based on their UGT1A1 genotype

      Enrollment into all cohorts will occur simultaneously rather than sequentially. Belinostat
      will be administered via a 30-minute infusion once daily from Day 1 to Day 5 of one 21-day
      cycle. Clinical safety will be monitored in each patient. Blood samples for PK analysis will
      be collected from Day 1 to Day 3, and urine samples for PK analysis will be collected from
      Day 1 to Day 4.
