      examine the safety and efficacy of repeated subcutaneous ghrelin administration in frail
      individuals. There will be a screening visit plus three additional study visits at the CTRC
      on Days 1, 2, and 7. Participants will receive an injection of ghrelin subcutaneously once
      daily on Days 1 and 7 and will self-administer the subcutaneous injection before breakfast on
      Days 2-6 at home. A food record will be kept from Day -3 to Day 6. We will assess the
      efficacy of repeated ghrelin doses to sustainably increase caloric intake from pre-treatment
      baseline without hyperglycemia or raising of cortisol levels.
