      acarbose (an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor) seems a promising possibility as a potential
      therapeutic agent. Although designed as a second-line diabetes drug, this medication has very
      little risk of hypoglycemia in older adults. In fact the risk of hypoglycemia is extremely
      low even in patients concurrently taking concurrent hypoglycemia agents (including insulin),
      and there is almost no risk of hypoglycemia in subjects not on other diabetes medications.
      Acarbose suppresses postprandial glycemia by slowing small intestinal digestion and
      absorption of carbohydrate, and has been shown to slow gastric emptying Acarbose has yet to
      be examined in a prospective fashion in older adults, despite the prevalence of PPH in this
      patient population. Preliminary, pilot work done in our laboratory on older adults with PPH
      has demonstrated that the hypotensive response over 90 minutes to a standardized meal was
      significantly reduced by the administration of acarbose
