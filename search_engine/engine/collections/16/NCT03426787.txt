    
      First, for Aim 1, Investigators along with direction from a diverse expert advisory group of
      nephrologists, hepatologists, and patient partners developed a decision aid based upon
      International Patient Decision Aids Standards guidelines, literature reviews, and expert
      advisory reviews. It includes plain language education, interactive learning modules
      personalized tailored information to help individuals use and consider information
      appropriate to their values and needs, and guidance on discussions with clinicians about
      treatment goals. Second, for Aim 2, Investigators will pilot-test the decision aid with 70
      individuals in a pre-post within-subjects study design to evaluate the tool's efficacy,
      usability, and the likelihood of using it in clinical practice. Lastly, for Aim 3,
      Investigators will conduct 30 semi-structured qualitative interviews with both clinicians and
      participants after the pilot evaluation of the decision aid to gather feedback about
      implementing the tool into clinical practice.
