      therapy protocols for pharyngeal phase swallowing impairment in the stroke population. For
      this study, patients with chronic dysphagia secondary to stroke will be assigned to one of
      four treatment protocols. These four protocols differ in respect to the intensity of
      treatment and the inclusion of surface electromyography (SEMG) biofeedback as an adjunct to
      treatment. All patients will complete a total of 30 hours of therapy with data collection to
      assess progress at intervals of every 10 sessions. Treatment outcomes will be measured using
      a combination of physiologic and behavioral measures. Data derived from this study should
      contribute significantly to our understanding of the rehabilitative process in the neurogenic
      dysphagic population and will provide the foundation for the establishment of efficacious,
      cost-efficient patient services.
