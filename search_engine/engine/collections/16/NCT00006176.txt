    
      This project involves the study of a novel familial neurodegenerative disorder, familial
      encephalopathy with neuroserpin inclusion bodies (FENIB). This disorder, which has a
      characteristic clinical course of progressive dementia and neurologic involvement, was
      initially defined in one extended family. Neuroserpin is the gene for this disorder and a
      mutation is present in this large kindred and four additional families/cases. This protocol
      will characterize the clinical phenotype, delineate the natural history of the disorder and
      explore genotype/phenotype correlations in the index family and possibly in other reported
      cases. Families with immunohistopathologically-neuroserpin positive neuronal inclusions on
      autopsy/biopsy in an affected member(s), neuroserpin mutation-positive proband, or with
      familial presenile dementia with neurologic features consistent with the original FENIB
      family will be enrolled.
