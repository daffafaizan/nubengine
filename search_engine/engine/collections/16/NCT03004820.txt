      ischemic conditioning (RIC) as an adjunctive therapy to medication were involved in the
      study. RIC consisted of five cycles of 5-min inflation (200 mmHg) and 5-min deflation of cuff
      on bilateral upper limbs twice a day. The study is to test whether RIC is effective in
      preventing ischemic evens after a minor ischemic stroke/transient ischemic attack within 3
      months and to explore the safety and compliance of chronic RIC. Medication strategy is based
      on physician's best judgement.
