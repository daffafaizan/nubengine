      endocrine, subjective and cardiovascular effects and the temporal concordance with increases
      in serum nicotine and cotinine levels. Possible gender and menstrual cycle phase influences
      on the effects of nicotine on HPA and HPG hormones have not been clearly delineated.
      Accordingly, we propose to compare the acute effects of nicotine in men and women, and to
      study women at the follicular and the luteal phases of the menstrual cycle.
