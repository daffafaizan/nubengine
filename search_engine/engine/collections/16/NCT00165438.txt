           offers more structured timing of these standard tests.

        -  Due to the potential lung toxicity associated with bleomycin-based chemotherapy,
           pulmonary function tests are routinely performed. Pulmonary function tests will be
           performed by a licensed, registered respiratory therapist and performed prior to the
           beginning of treatment, between the chemotherapy and radiation therapy (only for
           patients receiving both chemotherapy and radiation therapy), and at approximately 1
           month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after the completion of all treatments.

        -  A CAT scan will be performed prior to the beginning of treatment, and approximately 1
           month, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years after the completion of all treatments.

        -  A self-administered questionnaire will be performed on the days the patient is
           undergoing pulmonary function tests.
