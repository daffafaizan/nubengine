      dramatically decrease their quality of life. Most of the patients diagnosed with stress
      urinary incontinence also have a degree of pelvic organ prolapse and vice-versa.

      One of the more promising new approaches in treating disorders connected to pelvic floor
      dysfunction has been the introduction of vaginal erbium laser treatment for pelvic organ
      prolapse.

      The primary aim of the present retrospective study was toassess the effectiveness of vaginal
      erbium laser with SMOOTH mode for the treatment of patients with pelvic organ prolapse and
      co-existing stress urinary incontinence, if present.
