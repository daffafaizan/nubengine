    
      In a clinical randomized controlled trial, participants randomized to the intervention arm
      will be followed with monthly meetings by a stroke coordinator for 18 months.

      The stroke coordinator will assess the patients risk factors within the domains of physical
      function, cognitive function, social function, medication and lifestyle factors and make a
      treatment plan targeting the individual needs for further follow-up.

      Those randomized to the control group will receive standard care.

      Patients living in the municipalities of Trondheim, LÃ¸renskog and Skedsmo admitted to
      Akershus University Hospital or St. Olavs University Hospital will be included at the
      outpatients clinic 3 months after the stroke.

      All patients will be re-assessed at 6, 12 and 18 months after inclusion. Primary outcome will
      be modified Rankin Scale at 18 months.
