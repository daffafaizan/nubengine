    
      Multicenter phase 2 study evaluating the efficacy and safety of trifluridine/tipiracil in
      women with metastatic or locally advanced breast cancer not amenable to curative treatment by
      surgery or radiotherapy. This study will be conducted under the sponsorship of BOOG,
      Amsterdam, NL.

      Objectives:

      To evaluate the efficacy of trifluridine/tipiracil by determination of the percentage of
      patients being progression free at 8 weeks on trifluridine/tipiracil prescribed for
      ER-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer patients previously treated with an
      anthracycline, a taxane and capecitabine.

      Endpoints:

      Progression-free survival Response rate CR/PR at 16 weeks Adverse events Translational
      research on biological factors that may be of influence on the outcome of treatment QoL

      Main eligibility criteria:

      Metastatic Her2 negative, ER-positive breast cancer patients that progressed on, or after
      treatment with Capecitabine. Previous treatment with antracyclines and Taxanes is obligatory.
      Adequate hematology, liver and renal function tests.
