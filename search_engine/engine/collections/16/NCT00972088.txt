    
      IBD of the small bowel is associated with perianal disease such as ano-rectal abscesses and
      fistulas. Colonoscopy with ileoscopy and small bowel series are relied upon to document the
      presence of Crohn's disease of the small bowel. We suspect that the prevalence of
      inflammatory small bowel disease is underestimated.

      In my practice I have cases that had negative colonoscopy ileoscopy and positive findings at
      capsule endoscopy. These patients are receiving therapy for Crohn's disease. It is important
      to prove that the prevalence is higher.

      Capsule Endoscopy (CE) is the "first line tool" diagnostic procedure for the examination of
      the small bowel. It is performed today in more than 2,900 GI clinics in hospitals, outpatient
      departments and physicians' offices all over the world using the PillCamÂ® Platform. Over
      500,000 CE procedures with the Given PillCam SB have been completed to date.
