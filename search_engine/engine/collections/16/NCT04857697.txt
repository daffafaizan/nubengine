      I. To conduct a pilot study of probiotics prior to surgery in operable breast and lung cancer
      patients.

      II. To evaluate systemic and intratumoral immunomodulatory effects of probiotics in operable
      breast and lung cancer patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline and time of surgery, and collection
      of stool samples at baseline and after completion of probiotic regimen. Patients receive
      probiotics orally (PO) once on day 1, and then twice daily (BID) or three times daily (TID)
      for 2-4 weeks before standard of care surgery. Patients also undergo collection of tissue
      samples during standard of care surgery.
