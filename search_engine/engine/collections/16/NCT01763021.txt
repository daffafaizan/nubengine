      (study conducted at one site), sequential study (it is a design in a single group of
      participants are administered one or more study medication in a sequence) to evaluate the
      potential effects of rifampin on the pharmacokinetics of PCI-32765 in healthy
      participants.The study consists of 3 phases: screening phase (21 days prior to first dose of
      study medication), treatment phase (14 days), and a follow up phase (10 to 12 days after the
      last dose of study medication). In the treatment phase, a single dose of PCI-32765 560 mg
      will be administered orally on Day 1 and Day 11. Rifampin 600 mg (2 X 300 mg) will be
      administered orally on Days 4 to 13; followed by a single dose of PCI-32765 on Day 11. Follow
      up will be continued until Day 14. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory
      tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination will be monitored throughout
      the study. The duration of the study will be approximately for 45 days.
