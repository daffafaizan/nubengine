      for the patient with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), which should be applied urgently
      and that some would only be available in tertiary stroke centers (TSC). However, the
      transportation criteria for ICH patients are not well defined.

      Objectives: Design and implementation of a registry (HIC-CAT) of patients with HIC in the
      healthcare network of public hospitals in Catalonia, which does not modify the current
      logistics but collects data related to patients and TSC, interhospital transfers and non-TSC
      centers. The registry will allow us to evaluate the hypothesis that: 1) Patient care in TSC
      decreases the probability of death or dependence in patients with spontaneous ICH compared to
      non-TSC; and 2) The shorter the time until admission to a TSC, the better the survival and
      functional outcome. This will be due to the application of diagnostic, therapeutic and
      structural measures at the TSC. In addition, organ donation will be more frequent in a TSC.

      Methods: Observational, prospective, multicentre, population study of 2500 consecutive
      patients with spontaneous ICH of less than 24 hours from the onset of symptoms and Rankin
      scale score 0-3. We will collect times, clinical and radiological variables, vital and
      functional outcome at 3 months follow-up. Number of organ donations. Primary variable:
      Functional outcome at 3 months (Rankin 0-3). Statistics: Multivariate analysis with logistic
      regression, propensity matching scores.
