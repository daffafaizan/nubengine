      assess the efficacy and safety of SD-101 dermal cream (3% or 6%) on skin lesions in
      participants with Simplex, Recessive Dystrophic, or Junctional non-Herlitz EB.

      SD-101 cream [containing 3% or 6% or vehicle (0%)] was applied topically, once a day to the
      entire body for a period of 90 days. Eligible participants had a target wound assessed at
      baseline. Selected target wound had to be at least a certain age and within a prespecified
      size range at study entry. Photographic confirmation of the target wound location was
      collected at baseline, and the picture saved from the first visit was used to confirm
      location of the target wound at subsequent visits. The participant returned to the study site
      at Week 2, Month 1, Month 4, and Month 5 (at 14, 30, 60, and 90 days, respectively) to have
      the target wound previously identified at baseline re-assessed for the level of healing. In
      addition, changes in itching, pain, body surface area coverage of blisters and lesions, and
      scaring of the healed target wound were also assessed at each visit.
