      identify and track swallowing problems associated with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS)
      over time. Also, this study will provide insight into the natural progression of swallowing
      impairment in persons with ALS over time.

      Participants enrolled in this study will complete an evaluation at the University of Florida
      Aerodigestive Research Core laboratory located at Shands Hospital, Gainesville every three
      months. Each evaluation will take approximately 90 minutes. During these evaluations, a
      videofluoroscopy (X-ray of swallowing) examination, cough tests and questionnaires will be
      completed.
