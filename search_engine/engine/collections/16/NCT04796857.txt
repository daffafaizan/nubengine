      a bad prognosis. These patients cannot be treated successfully or tolerated the conventional
      chemotherapy. Lenalidomide has a unique therapeutic effect in Non-GCB DLBCL. Some studies
      have shown that the combination of lenalidomide and PD-1 antibody shows a synergistic effect
      in the exploration of DLBCL, and the patients are well tolerated.The investigators will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of tislelizumab in combination with lenalidomide in the
      elderly patients with relapsed refractory non-GCB DLBCL failed from second line chemotherapy.
