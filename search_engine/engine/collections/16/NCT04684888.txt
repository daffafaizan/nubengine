      microkeratome to the automated one with the use of microkeratome and more recently to
      Femto-laser procedure using a variety of machines.

      Authors have reported that the primary vision nearly the same despite the different methods
      of flap creation in the first 6 months post LASER vision correction. Others have reported
      that a thinner flap is associated with better primary vision and refractive outcomes. SBK
      (Sub Bowman Keratomileusis), is a procedure in which the Lasik flap is thinner, and has the
      advantage of leaving a sufficient stromal bed for safer excimer Laser ablation.

      There are five types of femtosecond Laser that were already approved currently for Lasik flap
      creation.

      The Zeiss (Visumax FSL ) which has been used in the current study uses 1043 nm, a repetition
      rate of 500 kHz, and 220-580 femtoseconds pulse duration. Each laser pulse produces
      micro-photo disruption in the tissue, contiguous few microns sized photo disruptions will
      create a continuous cut in the corneal tissue at precise preset position and depth.

      In the current study, the Visumax flap thickness predictability, accuracy, and variability
      were compared with the flap created by a single-use Moria SBK microkeratome.
