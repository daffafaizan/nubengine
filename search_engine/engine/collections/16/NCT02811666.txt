      will be evaluated by the decrease in muscle surface (assessed by CT-Scan) associated with a
      decrease in muscle strength (assessed by hand gauge). Preoperative evaluation will also
      include nutritional status by physical examination and laboratory tests, and many nutritional
      questionnaires. The same data (including sarcopenia, laboratory tests and nutritional
      evaluation) will be collected at 7 days, 30 days and 12 months, as well as the morbidity and
      mortality. Statistical tests might evaluate if sarcopenia may be an independent factor of
      morbidity and mortality among these patients.
