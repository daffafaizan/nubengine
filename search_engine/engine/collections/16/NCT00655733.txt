    
      This was a double-blind, randomized, multicenter, placebo-controlled study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of oral HMPL-004 in subjects with active moderate Crohn's disease (CD) -
      Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 220 to 400 - on stable doses of CD medications who had
      not received anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-Î±) for at least 3 months prior to
      start of treatment. HMPL-004 (or placebo) was added to the subject's existing CD medications.
      Subjects were observed for an 8-week treatment period and a subsequent 4-week follow-up
      period.
