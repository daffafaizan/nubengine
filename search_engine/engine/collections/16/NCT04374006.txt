      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antiapoptotic.Propolis has even been
      shown to have an antibacterial effect in vitro, without requiring human immunological
      reactions.

      The immunological effect of propolis is generated through immune suppression directly and
      decreasing cytokine production which stimulates immune process. Although proven to have a
      various efficacy, propolis can't be used as a therapeutic drug due to the difficulty of
      obtaining standard chemical composition as a requirement to be the drug's substances.
      Therefore, it is necessary to have biological composition in each propolis prepartions
      written down before comparing the efficacy.

      Anti tumor activity by propolis, which has been tested in animal previously, showed that
      propolis can inhibit DNA synthesis in tumor cells, induce cell apoptosis and activate
      macrophage to produce factors which regulate the function of B, T, as well as NK cell.

      Dienogest, is the next choice of progestin drug class. It has high selectivity binding in
      progesterone receptors, inhibits cytokine secretion in endometriosis stroma cell and induces
      apoptosis in endometriosis cell. Dienogest also has slight inhibitory effect against
      estradiol, so it can deminisce the symptoms due to hypoestrogenic such as decresing in bone
      mass density.
