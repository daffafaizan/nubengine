    
      Prospective, serially-recruited, blinded and unblinded, validation study to test that the
      adjunctive combination of the SoftScan with x-ray mammography provides diagnostic accuracy
      that is significantly better than x-ray mammography alone. Healthy volunteers and patients
      scheduled for tissue biopsy/excision of a suspicious breast lesion will be enrolled. Reader
      Studies will be performed in which interpreting investigators will perform blinded
      mammography interpretations, and reinterpretations of mammography and SoftScan
      interpretations. Diagnostic accuracy will be calculated using tissue histopathology as the
      reference standard.
