      often encountered in the postnatal adaptation phase. Severe, prolonged hypotension
      contributes to cellular dysfunction and cell death. Systemic hypotension affects close to
      half of all ELBW infants and a significant portion of LBW infants. The true definition of
      hypotension remains to be a question. There is a linear association between birth weight,
      gestational age, and mean blood pressure but blood pressure can vary significantly in the
      first day of life. The critical period tends to be the first 24-36 hours of life as blood
      pressure tends to rise significantly in the first 72 hours of life regardless of gestational
      age. Preterm infants suffering from hypotension have a higher incidence and increased
      severity of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), and
      long-term neurodevelopmental sequelae compared to normotensive preterm infants. Effects on
      other organ systems can result in renal injury, hepatic injury, and the development of
      necrotizing enterocolitis among other complications. An important aspect in the management of
      infants with hypotension is the decision of when to treat and with what agent. Dopamine is
      commonly used as first-line therapy, but issues with efficacy and its side effect profile
      have lessened its favorability over the years. Few studies compare dopamine to other agents
      as a first -line treatment. This study hopes to contribute to the literature information on
      vasopressin as a potential first-line agent for treatment of neonatal hypotension in low
      birth weight infants.
