      complaint of pain. Patients will be consented for participation and will fill out a brief
      survey concerning the current visit in the ED. There will be two forms of the survey.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the two survey forms. Participants will
      first be asked if their pain score for this visit is greater than or less than an anchor
      number provided. In this survey, the investigators will use 20 and 80 as our anchoring
      numbers. The participants will then have a follow up question asking them to estimate their
      pain score on a 0-100 scale. Investigators will then perform a chart review to determine
      patient satisfaction scores for that specific visit to determine if the anchoring effect has
      any input on patient satisfaction scores.
