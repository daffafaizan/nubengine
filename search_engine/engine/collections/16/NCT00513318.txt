        -  To assess the feasibility of performing umbilical cord blood transplants in older adults
           or younger infirm patients using a reduced-intensity preparative regimen. Feasibility of
           the procedure is defined as an engraftment rate of >80% at Day 180 post-transplantation
           and a transplant related mortality (TRM) of <50% at Day 100. A TRM of >50% will be
           considered unacceptable.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  To describe the time to neutrophil and platelet recovery following mini-UCB
           transplantation.

        -  To assess lineage-specific chimerism following transplantation and to describe the
           contribution of each individual CB unit to post-transplantation hematopoeisis.

        -  To describe disease-specific, event-free and overall survival rates at 180 and 360 days.

        -  To describe the incidence, severity, and timing of acute and chronic GVHD following
           reduced-intensity UCB transplantation.

        -  To evaluate T-cell, B-cell, and NK cell recovery following reduced-intensity UCB
           transplantation.
