      and nodal stage as determined on MRI. Unfortunately, the information provided by standard
      T2-weighted MRI is not sufficient to accurately assess nodal involvement and tumour response
      after neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. Additional functional information is required for
      reliable (re)staging. Diffusion-weighted imaging and gadofosveset-enhanced MRI are two new
      imaging techniques that have all shown great potential in rectal cancer staging. In order to
      provide definite evidence there is a need for a multicenter study with a large patient
      population.
