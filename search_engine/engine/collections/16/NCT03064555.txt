      ~740 million people worldwide. End stage renal disease (ESRD) is the result of a progressive
      loss of kidney function where the patient requires dialysis to replace the typical functions
      of the kidney. The quality of life (QOL) of these individuals is severely impaired as a
      result of various complications associated with CKD (e.g. heart disease, diabetes, muscle
      wastage, decreased fitness). In an attempt to combat this decrease in physical fitness, many
      studies have applied long term exercise interventions. However, the acute response to
      exercise in this population is not entirely understood and a comprehensive set of guidelines
      that informs safe and effective exercise prescription is lacking.

      The use of exercise as a therapeutic intervention in ESRD has grown in popularity, and
      evidence provided by numerous long term studies indicates cardiopulmonary, metabolic and
      inflammatory system adaptations. Despite these positive findings, the specific mechanisms
      through which exercise benefits these patients have not yet been fully established. In
      addition, the extent to which 'normal' physiology is acutely altered by dialysis treatment,
      and the effect that aerobic exercise may have on this, is unknown.

      In patients with ESRD, this study aims to characterise the acute physiological response to
      exercise under different conditions. In doing so, the study aims to inform the development of
      guidelines for safe and effective intra-dialytic exercise training.
