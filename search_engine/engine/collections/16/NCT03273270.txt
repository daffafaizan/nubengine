      from the MUSC Movement Disorder Clinic by clinical staff. Subjects will undergo identical
      imaging protocols before and after intervention. Subjects will undergo ten, 20 minute, dual
      task training sessions immediately following each rTMS session. Subjects will be randomized
      to either active rTMS + rehabilitation or rehabilitation alone at a 2:1 ratio (10 active: 5
      control). The primary outcome measure will be dual task interference for turning.
