    
      Liposarcomas (LPS) are soft tissue tumours of mesenchymal origin. The most common
      histological subtypes, represented by well differenciated Lipsarcomas (WD-LPS) and
      dedifferenciated (DD-LPS), are characterized by the quasi-systematic amplification of the
      q13-15 of chromosome 12 containing the Mdm2 gene.

      The systematic amplification of the Mdm2 gene is such that it is used clinically to
      distinguish WD/DD-LPS from other types of sarcomas. These observations raise key questions
      about the high selection pressure that leads to the almost systematic amplification of Mdm2
      during the development of these LPS.

      Mdm2 is an oncoprotein whose roles in p53 tumour suppressor degradation are broadly
      described. However, the different inhibitors targeting this interaction were disappointing in
      clinical trials.

      Recently a team from the U1194 INSERM unit of the IRCM which collaborates in this project
      showed by a pan-genomics analysis, that Mdm2 is recruited to chromatin within a multiproteic
      complex having as target a transcriptional program involved in the metabolism and in
      particular in the biosynthesis of the serin.

      This clinical-biological basis will allow the continuation of this research project on
      liposarcomas and the development of new research projects on other histological types of
      sarcomas.
