      Omega, that differs from Epoetin alfa in the sugar moiety of the molecule were compared in
      regard of efficacy and safety to treat end stage renal disease anemia. Study hypothesis was
      that Epoetin Omega is non-inferior to Epoetin alfa in correcting renal anemia in dialysis
      patients. A 12-weeks randomized comparative efficacy study was performed including 77 end
      stage renal disease patients (epoetin omega:n=39, epoetin alfa: n=38). All patients were
      anemic (Hemoglobin < 90 g/L), treated by regular hemodialysis and without signs of bleeding,
      hemolysis, inflammation or history of major surgery.Treatment was started with 50 IU/kg body
      weight subcutaneously per week and thereafter adjusted according to the hemoglobin response.
      In the intent-to-treat analysis, average weekly difference in hemoglobin versus baseline
      value was higher in omega-treated patients: 1.94+-0.81 vs. 1.23+-0.62 g/dl. The unadjusted
      and adjusted omega-alfa differences were 0.71 g/dl (95%CI 0.38 to 1.04; p<0.001) and 0.78
      g/dl (0.49 to 1.08;p<0.001), respectively. Average weekly epoetin dose was lower in the omega
      group: 87+-25 vs. 108+-21 IU/kg. The unadjusted and adjusted omega-alfa differences were
      -21IU/kg (-32 to -11; p<0.001) and -24IU/kg (-35 to -13; p<0.001), respectively. Epoetins
      were comparably well tolerated. In dialysis patients, subcutaneous epoetin omega apparently
      provides a greater anti-anemic effect per administered dose (IU) than epoetin alfa.
