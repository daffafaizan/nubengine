        -  Identify gene expression profiles associated with survival by DNA microarray assay
           analysis using RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples from patients
           with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated on clinical trial RTOG-9501.

      OUTLINE: Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples are analyzed by DNA microarray
      analysis for gene expression profiling.
