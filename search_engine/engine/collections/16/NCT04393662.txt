      elbow. Patients with a partial or complete rotator cuff tear often suffer a lesion of the
      long head of the biceps tendon (LHBT). The two most common surgical treatments options are
      tenotomy or tenodesis. This study is to assess the Supination Strength Index SSI (the
      operated side in relation to the healthy side) after proximal biceps tenotomy versus
      tenodesis.
