      States and is usually fatal. Surgery provides the only chance for long-term survival. Pain is
      a significant, often difficult to control component of survivorship for many who succumb to
      this disease. The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the effect of ethanol celiac plexus
      neurolysis (alcohol nerve block) in patients undergoing surgical intervention for pancreatic
      cancer. Patients undergoing surgery for pancreatic cancer will be enrolled in a prospective
      randomized double blind placebo controlled clinical trial.

      This protocol is designed to definitively determine the role of ethanol celiac plexus
      neurolysis as a simple addition to the surgical management of pancreatic adenocarcinoma and
      help define the standard of care for cancer associated pain management in this disease.
