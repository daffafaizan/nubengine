      pharmacodynamic properties of implants eluting 16 mg of afamelanotide produced by this final
      optimized manufacturing process are essentially the same as those of implants manufactured
      with the same formulation that have been used in earlier clinical studies

      The study will involve the use of an implant, which comes in the form of a small rod to be
      administered under the skin.

      For this study, afamelanotide has been formulated as a controlled release depot injection
      (implant). This means that the afamelanotide will be released slowly into the body over a few
      days. Once inserted, the implant will remain in the body after afamelanotide has been
      released and will slowly dissolve.
