      biofilm that actually embeds itself into the catheter material. Additionally, the catheter
      hub and skin around this area may be colonized with bacteria. It is by this route that
      pathogenic organisms migrate to the external surface of the catheter, which then can progress
      to the intravascular tip. To decrease the risk of CVC associated infections, antibiotic
      coated catheters have been used. Since 1990, several types of antiseptic or antimicrobial
      vascular catheters have been developed. These catheters are designed to protect both the
      external and internal surfaces of the device from colonization of certain bacteria. Raad et
      al, have demonstrated in a randomized multicenter clinical trial among hospitalized adult
      patients that CVCs coated with minocycline and rifampin significantly reduced the risk for
      catheter-related colonization and bloodstream infections[8]. However, there have been no
      clinical trials reported in the pediatric population on this issue. This study will
      prospectively compare in a randomized, blinded fashion the use of two Food & Drug
      Administration (FDA) approved central venous catheters - an antibiotic coated CVC to
      non-coated CVC at DeVos Children's Hospital at Spectrum Health, Grand Rapids, Michigan.
      Additional major pediatric teaching hospitals may be added at a later time.
