      independence in everyday life, with older adults who identify cognitive complaints. Evidence
      suggests that 25-50% of community dwelling older adults report cognitive difficulties, such
      as reduced memory or concentration, in the absence of any diagnosed condition. Cognitive
      skills are crucial to living independently. The investigators plan to examine two approaches
      in a randomized controlled trial. Based on our successful pilot study, the investigators
      hypothesize that this training which combines education on healthy lifestyles and problem
      solving training to address everyday life difficulties, will be effective in maximizing and
      maintaining independence of older adults.
