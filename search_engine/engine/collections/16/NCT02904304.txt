    
      The investigational product is a combination of desloratadine, phenylephrine hydrochloride
      and ibuprofen.

      The desloratadine is a antihistamine and selectively block the activity of histamine
      receptor-1 (H1) resulting in a non sedative and prolong antiallergic effect.

      The phenylephrine is a potent stimulator of the postsynaptic α receptor with minimal effect
      on β receptors in the heart.

      The ibuprofen's mechanism is not fully known. It is a non selective inhibitor of
      cyclooxygenase, an enzyme that is involved in prostaglandin synthesis by the route from
      arachidonic acid. It is believed that the pharmacological effects are due to inhibition of
      cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), which reduces prostaglandin synthesis involved in the mediation of
      inflammation, pain, fever and swelling.
