      secretagogue. This signaling is blocked by exendin-9,39. The relative importance of glucagon
      signaling through its cognate receptor or through GLP1R is unknown. Despite the lower
      affinity of GLP1R for glucagon, intra-islet concentrations of glucagon are sufficiently high
      to stimulate GLP1R. The other situation where this may occur is in response to pharmacologic
      doses of glucagon as used for β-cell function testing or raising peripheral glucagon
      concentrations above fasting values. The experiments proposed will characterize the role of
      GLP1R in glucagon's actions on the β-cell and the potential therapeutic role of dual (GLP-1R
      and glucagon receptor) agonists for the treatment of T2DM and obesity.
