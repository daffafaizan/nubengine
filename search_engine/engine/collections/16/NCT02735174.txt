      Medical Center (CCHMC), the local public health department and designated inner city schools.
      The purpose is to address school-based asthma care barriers and then to test the efficacy of
      this program in a pilot study to improve asthma outcomes in 30 urban core youth.

      Greater Cincinnati's geography places it at the environmentally tricky confluence of
      low-lying smog-trapping hills, three heavily traveled interstate highways, and high rate of
      allergen exposure. This makes it an area ripe for asthma. The overall rate of pediatric
      asthma in Greater Cincinnati is more than twice the national average and, in some urban-core
      neighborhoods, as high as 10 times the national rate.

      Poor asthma control across the nation and locally in Cincinnati is associated with an
      overrepresentation of children from minority groups, low-income families, and single parent
      households who deal with economic hardship and familial strain compared to those with
      well-controlled asthma. Data show that no more than 50% of patients keep appointments or fill
      prescriptions, leading to continued poor asthma control and risk for future exacerbation.

      This is an interventional pilot study where about 30 high-risk asthmatic participants will be
      identified to participate and a number of interventions will be incorporated including asthma
      specific questionnaires, use of a commercially available inhaler cap with monitoring sensor,
      a mobile software management platform that tracks adherence of all asthma medications, mobile
      based telehealth medical visits to assess asthma control, and mobile based telehealth
      adherence problem-solving interventions.

      This proposal is funded through a Luther Foundation and Verizon Foundation philanthropic
      gifts.
