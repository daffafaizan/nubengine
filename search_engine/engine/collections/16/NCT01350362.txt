      multiple centers in the European Union. Patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease
      will undergo a screening period, and then they will be randomized to one of these four
      groups: tideglusib 1000 mg once daily (Q.D.), tideglusib 1000 mg every other day (Q.O.D.),
      tideglusib 500 mg Q.D., or matching placebo, for a 26-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled
      treatment period.
