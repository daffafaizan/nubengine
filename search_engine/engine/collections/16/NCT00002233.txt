      inhibitors (3TC and abacavir) and two protease inhibitors (amprenavir and indinavir) for a
      minimum of 48 weeks. At specified time points, patients undergo physical assessments and
      efficacy evaluations which include plasma HIV-1 RNA measurements and CD4 cell counts.
      Depending on the immunologic and virologic status of the patient, further testing may be done
      to determine whether quadruple drug therapy can attain undetectable viral levels.
