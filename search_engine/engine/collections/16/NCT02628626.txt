      There is very limited, mostly uncontrolled, evidence to support the approaches currently used
      to manage FI. The alpha-2 adrenergic agonist clonidine decreased the frequency of loose
      stools in FI patients with diarrhea. Among patients with diarrhea, clonidine decreased the
      proportion of days with FI; however results were not statistically significant. Uncontrolled
      studies suggest that the bile acid binding resin colesevelam also increased stool consistency
      in patients with functional diarrhea. In this study, the investigators propose to compare the
      effects of a combination of colesevelam and clonidine to placebo on bowel symptoms in
      patients with urge or combined type of FI. The investigators hypothesis is that combination
      treatment with clonidine and colesevelam is better than placebo in reducing stool frequency
      and rectal urgency in FI.
