      were pair-matched on urban/rural location and school type, and one community in each pair
      randomly selected to receive the peer-health education programme immediately or after a
      delay, to permit evaluation. The intervention programme comprised training of peer health
      educators, teacher coordinators, and members of drama troupes, in key malaria messages and
      principles of health education. The peer educators then conducted a rolling programme of
      presentations to children and youth in their own schools using drama, puppetry, small group
      and in-class presentations about malaria, as well as community outreach programs targeting
      out-of-school youth and the general public. In each school a systematic sample of 75 students
      were interviewed 10 weeks and 6 months after the start of the programme, and in each school
      catchment area a sample of 80 women were interviewed at the same time, and bednet use by
      children under 5 yrs in their care was recorded. From the interviews scores were derived for
      knowledge about malaria treatment and prevention and knowledge scores and net coverage in
      children compared between intervention and control schools.
