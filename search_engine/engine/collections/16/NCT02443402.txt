      an increased risk of hospital complications. High glucose increases the risk of wound
      infection, kidney failure and death. Patients with high glucose are treated with insulin
      given through an arm vein or by frequent insulin injections under the skin. This study will
      determine if sitagliptin can prevent the development of high glucose after heart surgery.
      Sitagliptin is a diabetes pill approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat
      patients with diabetes.
