      an adjuvant systemic strategy to improve time to progression and survival in this patient
      population. Adding a well-tolerated oral targeted therapy such as Sutent, after a combined
      chemo/radiation/surgery approach in this patient population has the potential to impact on
      the minimal residual disease left behind by relatively effective pre-operative chemoradiation
      and surgery. This has the potential to improve survival. The primary endpoint is to determine
      the feasibility and efficacy of adjuvant Sutent therapy (SU11248) after concurrent
      neoadjuvant therapy with irinotecan, cisplatin, external beam conformal radiotherapy plus
      surgery for potential resectable esophageal cancer. Preclinical and clinical data suggest
      that Sutent will have activity in esophageal cancer, as the results of Sutent activity in
      solid tumors appear to be superior to the results of other antiangiogenic compounds in
      development for esophageal cancer. Therefore, by extrapolation from promising phase I, II and
      III Sutent trials we propose to translate the target effects achieved with Sutent to reduce
      local and systemic therapy failure, and thus metastasis in esophageal cancer.
