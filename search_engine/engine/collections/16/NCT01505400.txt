      genetic aberrations that drive cancers leave us on the threshold of a new era of
      "personalized cancer medicine", in which specific biomarkers will be used to direct targeted
      agents only to those patients deemed most likely to respond. The potential medical,
      scientific and economic benefits of such a personalized approach to cancer therapy are
      immense and self-evident. Yet despite some important advances, only a limited number of
      approved targeted agents have had their approvals predicated on specific biomarkers of
      sensitivity or resistance.

      The premises behind personalized cancer medicine include: i) genetic aberrations exist in
      human malignancies; ii) a subset of these aberrations, often present across multiple cancer
      types, have functional relevance as "hallmarks" or "drivers" for oncogenesis and tumor
      progression; iii) such genetic aberrations are potentially "druggable" targets; and iv) there
      are tolerable medicinal compounds that can effectively modulate such targets. A key
      requirement of this new, personalized approach to anti-cancer therapy is that specific
      patients must be matched to a particular drug or combination of drugs. Molecular profiling of
      tumors to identify somatic mutations and/or other genetic aberrations are examples of
      enrichment strategies to assist in matching patients to drugs or treatments that have gained
      increasing interest in the oncology community.

      The present protocol seeks to provide molecular profiling data to the treating physician for
      patients with advanced breast, non-small cell lung, colorectal, genitourinary,
      pancreatobiliary gastrointestinal, upper aerodigestive tract, gynecological, melanoma,
      unknown primary, and rare carcinomas, as well as patients who are phase I trial candidates,
      in order to help identify which standard regimens or clinical trials of molecularly targeted
      therapies may be most appropriate for the individual patient.
