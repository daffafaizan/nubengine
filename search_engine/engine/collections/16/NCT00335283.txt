      primary care physicians. It is also one of the most common reasons for patients to seek care
      from otolaryngologists. Traditionally, PND has been considered and treated as a symptom of
      sinonasal pathology. It has also been shown, along with Gastroesophageal reflux disease
      (GERD) and asthma, to be a major contributor to the development of chronic cough. PND
      refractory to treatment aimed at sinonasal disease is sometimes treated with anti-GERD
      therapy. This treatment modality is based on clinical experience. To date, there are no
      studies in the literature to support a causal relationship between PND and extraesophageal
      reflux (EER). In a case control study of patients with and without esophagitis El-Serag et al
      reported a significant association (odds ratio 1.6, 95%CI 1.4-1.8) between sinusitis and
      GERD. A later study by Ulualp et al in 11 CT confirmed cases of chronic sinusitis resistant
      to therapy with conventional sinus therapies they found a significantly higher prevalence of
      hypopharyngeal acid exposure in the sinusitis group than controls. Recently, in an open label
      prospective pilot trial, DiBaise et al treated 11 patients with sinusitis and 19 GERD
      patients with omeprazole 20mg bid for 3-months. 9/11 sinusitis patients were found to have
      GERD by pH monitoring and there was moderate (25-89%) improvement in the sinus symptoms in
      the omeprazole treated group. However, there are currently no placebo-controlled trials
      assessing efficacy of PPI's in patients with PND.
