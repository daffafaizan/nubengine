      discharge on pain treatment for their child. The investigators plan to investigate the effect
      of the video on knowledge because educational modules in the form of videotapes have been
      shown to be an effective method to improve a parent's knowledge about pain management prior
      to surgical procedures. Because parental anxiety has a significant impact on a child's
      experience of pain and video education has been shown to reduce parent anxiety before a
      procedure, the investigators will also evaluate if parental anxiety is reduced. Whether or
      not a short video will change the behavior of parents or their satisfaction with the outcome
      at home has not been investigated and will be an exploratory hypothesis for this study. This
      research will be a first step towards optimizing the outpatient care for common diagnoses in
      the Emergency Department.
