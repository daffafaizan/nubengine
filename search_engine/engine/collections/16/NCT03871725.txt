      patients with carotid plaque include lifestyle changes, medical management(such as control of
      hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes) and carotid revascularization(carotid
      endarterectomy or carotid artery stenting). Studies have suggested that plaque morphology and
      composition are important determinants of plaque stability, using serial MR imaging of the
      carotid artery allowed observation of changes in plaque composition. Contrast enhanced
      ultrasound (CEUS) is a well accepted technique for detection of intraplaque
      neovascularization(IPN) in carotid atherosclerotic disease. The purpose of this trial is to
      evaluate the safety and initial effectiveness of SDT. The SDT can induce macrophage
      elimination and inhibit matrix degradation, which will promote plaque lipid depletion,
      inflammation level decrease and changes in other plaque tissue components, leading to plaque
      stabilization and reduction.
