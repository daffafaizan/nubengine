    
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) ranks as the third most common cancer worldwide. Metastasis is the
      main reason of death in CRC patients. The current drugs used to treat colorectal cancer
      provide important treatment options for patients, their limitations including drug
      resistance, poor efficacy and severe side effects. Development of new therapeutic strategies
      for KRAS mutant as well as BRAF mutant tumors are therefore highly needed in order to offer a
      new category of drug (immunotherapy). This study targets the population of mCRC patients that
      have progressed after two lines of chemotherapy and are not eligible for targeted therapies.
      The study will assess six different dosing schedules. A standard 3 plus 3 study design will
      be used. The starting frequency for each dosing schedule will be escalated in subsequent
      groups of patients. The study will evaluate safety of increased frequency of AlloStimÂ® dosing
      and anti-tumor effect of the new proposed dose and frequency schedule.
