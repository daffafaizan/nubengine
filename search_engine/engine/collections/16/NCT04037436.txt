      (RCT) to evaluate the feasibility of implementation of the MoveStrong program. This program
      includes a functional exercise and nutrition program that teaches older adults with chronic
      diseases how to perform functional resistance and balance exercises and promote adequate
      protein intake and nutrition. Four sites (1 Northern and 3 Southern Ontario sites) will be
      cluster-randomized to implement MoveStrong at one of four start times, each three weeks
      apart. The primary outcome will be to determine the feasibility of recruitment and referral
      from diverse settings (i.e., retirement homes, community centers, and family health teams)
      and establish the retention and adherence to the program. Secondary objectives will determine
      the following: What are the participant's and provider's experience with the MoveStrong
      program? What is the short-term responsiveness (i.e., ability to detect change) of frailty
      indicators (Fried Frailty Index components), protein intake, or quality of life? Who agrees
      to participate? What adaptations need to be made to MoveStrong, or study methods in each
      setting? What is the cost relative to the benefit? Is behaviour change maintained in the
      maintenance period? Our long term goal is to use the information from this project to
      develop, implement, and evaluate a sustainable, scalable and pragmatic model to deliver
      strength and balance training and promote adequate protein intake among older adults with
      chronic diseases.
