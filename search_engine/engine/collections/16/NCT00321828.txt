      Primary

        -  Determine the rate of major morbidity in patients with unresectable stage IV colon
           cancer and a synchronous asymptomatic primary tumor treated with fluorouracil,
           leucovorin calcium, and oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) in combination with bevacizumab without
           resection of the primary tumor.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the rate of specific events related to the intact primary tumor requiring
           hospitalization or a major intervention but not requiring surgery.

        -  Determine the rate of â‰¥ grade 3 toxicity as defined by the Common Terminology Criteria
           for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE v3.0) that is related to study therapy prior to
           disease progression.

        -  Determine overall survival of patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes, oxaliplatin IV given concurrently with
      leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46 hours on
      days 1 and 2. Courses repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years after
      study entry.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 90 patients will be accrued for this study.
