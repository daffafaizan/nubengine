      tumor necrosis is seen after the start of the treatment. It is unknown after how many days
      this effect starts. In patients with renal cell cancer with metastases, who will be treated
      with Sutent, 3 MRIs will be made. Kep, R2*, b-coefficient (perfusion, hypoxia, blood volume
      and necrosis) will be measured.
