      a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, clinical trial to evaluate the safety and
      efficacy of the EsteemÂ® System. For this trial the subject acts as his or her own control.

      This trial has been designed to meet the United States' regulatory requirements.

      The subjects included in this study include the 57 subjects implanted under the original
      Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) study and the five (5) subjects implanted under the
      continued access expansion approved by the FDA. Of these 62 subjects, all but one (explant)
      were available for continued follow-up. These subjects were re-consented for the 5 year Post
      Approval Study. No new subjects were enrolled and implanted in this study. The goal was to
      monitor a minimum of 45 subjects through their five (5) year follow-up. Ultimately, 51
      subjects completed the study.

      The following questions are to be answered:

        -  Is the Esteem effective through 5 year follow-up?

        -  Is the Esteem safe through 5 year follow-up?
