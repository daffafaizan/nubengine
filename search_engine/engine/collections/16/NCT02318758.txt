    
      This study will compare the effects of ethanol on the PKs of a 1 mg dose of UT-15C in healthy
      volunteers to determine the in vivo effects of ethanol, including the timing of ethanol
      consumption in relation to UT-15C ingestion.

      This is an open-label, randomized, single-center, four-way (period), crossover study in which
      28 healthy volunteers will receive a single 1 mg oral dose of UT-15C and/or ethanol. Eligible
      subjects will be randomly assigned to one of four treatment sequences such that all subjects
      will receive all four sequences in a pre-specified order.
