      Little information is available regarding changes in brain processing areas and change in
      central sensitization to noxious input during the chronic phase of whiplash. Metabolite
      concentrations in the anterior cingulate cortex and periaqueductal gray matter may be
      predictors of neuropathic pain and these changes may explain the development of central
      sensitization in people with chronic whiplash.

      Until now, there is not any study that show this approach.
