      an FDA approved treatment to decrease cancer risk in Barrett's esophagus mucosa. This is
      being performed in our Barrett's Esophagus Unit on a regular basis. However, the longterm
      outcomes of this therapy is not established and there are patients who have been treated who
      later re-develop Barrett's mucosa. This study will allow us store tissue samples that can
      later be used to assess the effect of ablative therapy on Barrett's esophagus.
