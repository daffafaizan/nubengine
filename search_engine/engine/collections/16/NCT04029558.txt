      Traditionally, protection against infections and improvement of the immune response has been
      addressed by natural means through the use of plant extracts. This activity has been
      attributed to phenolic compounds.

      The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of the combination of plant extracts
      (BSL_EP024) on immunological response parameters.
