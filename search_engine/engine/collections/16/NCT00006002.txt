        -  Compare the time to progression in patients with hormone refractory prostate cancer
           treated with dexamethasone with or without SU5416.

        -  Determine the differences in PSA kinetics and PSA hazard score between these two
           regimens in this patient population.

        -  Determine the objective response rate and time to development of new lesions in these
           patients treated with SU5416.

        -  Determine the toxicity of SU5416 in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral dexamethasone once a day 6 days a week. Treatment continues
           until disease progression, at which time patients cross over to arm II.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral dexamethasone as in arm I followed by SU5416 IV over 60
           minutes twice weekly for 4 weeks. A smaller dose of dexamethasone is administered the
           day after SU5416. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of
           unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      16 months.
