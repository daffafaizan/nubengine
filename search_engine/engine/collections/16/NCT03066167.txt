      patients with dysphagia due to malignancy, and secondly, to validate them in the Swedish
      language. The 3 scales were: The Watson dysphagia scale, which was developed in studies on
      surgical treatment of reflux disease. It consists of questions about food with 9 different
      viscosity and solidity and the patient answer if they have problems with a specific food:
      never, sometimes or always when ingesting this. The scores are added and provides a range of
      0-45 where 45 is the worst possible dysphagia. The Ogilvie score is a 5-graded scale 0-4
      where 4 is total inability to swallow. The Goldschmid score is graded from 0-5 where 0 is
      inability to swallow and 5 is normal function. QoL was measured with validated instruments
      originating from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC),
      which has a generic instrument that measures global QoL in patients with cancer (QLQ-C30) and
      a more symptom-specific instrument that is developed for cancer in the oesophagus and stomach
      (QLQ-OG25). These are well known, validated instruments that also have normal reference
      values for the healthy population. The symptom specific instrument QLQ-OG25 includes a
      dysphagia module consisting of 3 questions which is validated to malignant disease and food
      intake with the help of expert groups and deep interviews with patients.
