      socioeconomically disadvantaged mothers, who are disproportionately impacted by obesity,
      during the first 6 months postpartum.

      Prior to the clinical trial portion of this project, quantitative interviews (Aim 1) were
      held to explore how digital health tools can be use to improve the dietary patterns of
      mothers and caregivers during the early postpartum period. 13 individuals who receive WIC
      benefits from Piedmont Health Services will be asked to participate in a one-time interview
      with research staff.

      Following quantitative interviews, the proposed trial (Aims 2 and 3) will test the
      feasibility of mothers receiving WIC benefits to participate in a pilot digital behavioral
      intervention to increase diet quality, which will deliver nutrition guidance for meeting
      recommendations outlined in the Dietary Guidelines for Americans using interactive
      self-monitoring and feedback, and tailored skills training. I will also explore acceptability
      of participating in Healthy Roots among both mothers receiving WIC benefits and WIC
      clinicians who are delivering counseling. This will help determine the potential for this
      intervention to be implemented into the existing clinical WIC encounter.
