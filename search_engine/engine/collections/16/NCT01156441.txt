      portends a poor prognosis on long term follow up. This pilot prospective randomized trial is
      a safety and feasibility trial to evaluate mitral valve repair versus surgical management in
      patients with residual MR after primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Patients
      will be screened for possible inclusion to identify those that have first MI treated with
      primary PCI. Patients with moderate MR at 6 or more weeks following first primary PCI will be
      randomized to continued medical management versus surgical mitral valve repair. Patients with
      previous or subsequent coronary artery bypass surgery and patients with severe ventricular
      dysfunction will be excluded. Patients will be followed for one year from the time of
      randomization. The safety and feasibility data will be used to design a large trial powered
      to detect a difference in mortality between treatment arms.

      Results of this study could lead to a radical change in the treatment paradigm for patients
      with ischemic MR following PCI for acute MI. In addition, insight gained from this study
      could advance our understanding of the interrelationship between LV remodeling and MR and
      shed some light into the mechanism of ventricular function deterioration following MI.
      Moreover, it may provide a framework for the development of further recommendations with
      respect to the indications for surgical intervention in this patient population.
