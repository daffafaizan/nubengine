      consequence of acute myocardial infarction (AMI)). Presently, timely and effective
      reperfusion with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) remains the most effective
      treatment strategy for limiting infarct size, preserving left ventricular ejection fraction
      (LVEF), and improving the clinical outcomes in such patients. However, substantial mortality
      and morbidity rates still persist with respect to longer term outcome. One of the main
      determinants of prognosis after AMI is the size of the infarct. Thus, identification of
      additional strategies that might decrease infarct size is desirable.

      Evidence from pre-clinical studies suggests that inorganic nitrite administration reduces
      infarct size in animal models of AMI. In this study we aim to translate these findings into
      man. We will test the hypothesis that in patients with STEMI undergoing PPCI, an
      intra-coronary injection of nitrite, initiated prior to establishment of full reperfusion
      reduces infarct size through prevention of ischemia-reperfusion injury.
