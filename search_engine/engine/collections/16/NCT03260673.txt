      diabetes and 30 control patients without diabetes scheduled to undergo cataract surgery. The
      corneal endothelial cell density, variation in endothelial cell size (CV), percentage of
      hexagonal cells, and central corneal thickness(CCT) were recorded at baseline and at 3 months
      postoperatively.Then, the investigators compared the two sets of data. At last observing the
      change of the corneal endothelial cells in patients with type 2 diabetes after
      phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation.
