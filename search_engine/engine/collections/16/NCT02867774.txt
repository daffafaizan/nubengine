      activity on pelvic pain in women with chronic pelvic pain. We will develop a
      moderate-intensity physical activity program for patients with chronic pelvic pain in
      conjunction with exercise physiologists and physical medicine and rehabilitation (PM&R)
      physicians. Based on prior research in fibromyalgia and other centralized pain disorders, we
      hypothesize that eight weeks of moderate-intensity physical activity will reduce pain
      intensity and pain interference in women with chronic pelvic pain. We will also evaluate the
      impact of moderate-intensity physical activity on physical function, fatigue, sexual
      function, sleep, anxiety, depression, catastrophization and patient global impression of
      change in women with chronic pelvic pain. We hypothesize that eight weeks of
      moderate-intensity physical activity will result in improvements in these measures of
      function and quality of life.
