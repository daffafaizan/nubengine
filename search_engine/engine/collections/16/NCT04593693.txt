      in expected wound response and outcomes when using the Medela Invia Motion Endure NPWT system
      during 4-week study duration.

      * Goal of therapy will be defined by the physician according to initial assessment:

      Endpoints (dependent on goal of therapy):

        -  Decrease in wound volume

        -  Decrease in size of the tunneling area

        -  Decrease in size of undermining

        -  Decrease in amount of slough

        -  Increase in granulation tissue

        -  Decrease in edema/periwound swelling

        -  The wound bed is progressing acceptably towards a transition to another treatment
           modality such as Moist Wound Healing (MWH), surgical closure, or a flap or graft.

      **Study endpoint will be determined by physician at the time of enrollment, when the goal of
      therapy is documented**
