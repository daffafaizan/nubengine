    
      A multi-center sample collection study in patients presenting with pigmented lesion(s)
      suspicious for melanoma. All suspicious lesions should meet at least one of the "ABCDE"
      (asymmetry, border, color, diameter, evolving) criteria. Patients will be consented for the
      study and screened against the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Once the patient is
      determined to be acceptable for the study they will be assigned a unique patient number and
      tissue collection will begin. Tissue from the lesion will be collected using DermTech's
      non-invasive adhesive patch kit according to the instructions for use followed by surgical
      biopsy. Digital dermoscopy of the lesion is preferred but not required.
