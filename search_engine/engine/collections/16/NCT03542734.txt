      with stroke or neurodegenerative disease. Features seen on neuroimaging include recent small
      subcortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, perivascular spaces,
      microbleeds, and brain atrophy. Previous studies indicated that SVD was associated with an
      increased risk of stroke and stroke recurrence, cognitive deficits, physical disabilities,
      and mortality. However the pathogenesis of SVD is largely unknown. Little is known about how
      SVD lesions contribute to neurological or cognitive symptoms, and the association with risk
      factors. Recent data sugessted concomitant SVDs and retinopathy is associated with a profile
      of vascular cognitive impairment. In this study, the investigators try to explore the new
      pathological mechanism of SVD, the new predictors for SVD progression, and the association
      with cognitive Impairment, based on digital retinal images and brain multimodal imaging
      technique.
