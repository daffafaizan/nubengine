      and prevent exacerbations. It covers a disease self-management approach, educational topics,
      lifestyle coaching and physical activity advice.

      Future implications should aim to make the intervention easily accessible for a broad
      spectrum of patients at scalable costs. Patients need an engaging communication platform
      which can inform, coach and even listen in between medical visits. The inclusion of a chatbot
      agent may provide this tailored feedback. The investogator's aim is to investigate the
      effects of a telemonitoring and chatbot-based application of "Living well with COPD" on
      health-related quality-of-life in patients with COPD.
