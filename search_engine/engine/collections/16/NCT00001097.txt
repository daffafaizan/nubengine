      (PI), have demonstrated improvements in somatic immune system functioning. [AS PER AMENDMENT
      2/27/01: More recently, similar success has been demonstrated with a PI-sparing regimen,
      zidovudine, lamivudine, and efavirenz.] Not all individuals, however, experience the same
      level of immune reconstitution, and oftentimes any improvement is short-lived. Adolescent
      patients may have a greater potential for immune restoration because of residual thymic
      tissue and therefore may experience greater long-term virus-free states as compared to adult
      patients. This study examines the duration of virologic efficacy HAART has on the adolescent
      HIV-positive population.

      Patients begin study by initiating a HAART regimen of a minimum of 3 drugs, at least 1 of
      which must be a PI [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01: or efavirenz (EFV)]. A variety of drug
      combinations are used; therefore, patients are grouped according to the classes of drugs in
      their respective regimen (e.g., 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors [NRTIs] plus 1
      PI; 2 NRTIs plus 2 PIs; 1 or 2 NRTIs plus 1 PI plus 1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase
      inhibitor [NNRTI] [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01: ; and 2 NRTIs plus EFV]). At the time of HAART
      initiation, patients undergo immunologic and virologic assessments in order to determine
      baseline values. Then, to determine the virologic success or failure of HAART, HIV-1 RNA
      measurements are taken and compared to initial baseline values. Virologic success equals
      undetectable HIV-1 RNA at Week 12 [AS PER AMENDMENT 2/27/01: and confirmed at Week 16] or a
      significant (greater than 1 log) decrease in HIV-1 RNA from baseline to Week 12 [AS PER
      AMENDMENT 2/27/01: and confirmed undetectable HIV-1 RNA before the next scheduled visit (Week
      24)]. Patients are followed for a minimum of 3 years of maintained viral suppression or until
      they have demonstrated virologic failure. From these values, any correlation that may exist
      between HIV-1 RNA values and HAART can be deduced. Patients with virologic failure on the
      initial HAART regimen may be allowed to change to a second HAART regimen. [AS PER AMENDMENT
      2/27/01: Patients with virologic success on the second HAART regimen are followed for a
      minimum of 3 years.] Patients with virologic failure on the second HAART regimen or who
      voluntarily discontinue HAART are followed using an abbreviated schedule for 3 years.
