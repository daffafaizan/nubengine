      weight loss among adults who are overweight or obese. Engagement in self-monitoring often
      declines over time, which is then associated with suboptimal weight loss. Finding ways to
      improve self-monitoring engagement, particularly in the first month of treatment, is needed.
      Promoting mastery, self-efficacy, and self-regulatory skills may help with maintaining high
      engagement.

      The investigators aim to enroll 105 participants. All groups are asked to self-monitor daily
      on their smartphone using the free commercial mobile application MyFitnessPal over the course
      of the 12-week intervention.

      Specifically, the study aims to...

        1. Determine the effect of a Sequential self-monitoring intervention, compared to a
           Simultaneous self-monitoring intervention on weight change, caloric intake change, and
           proportion of individuals achieving 5% weight loss.

        2. Determine the effect of the Sequential self-monitoring intervention, compared to the
           Control, on the same variables.

        3. Compare self-monitoring engagement by intervention arm.

        4. Examine the relation between self-monitoring engagement and weight loss.

        5. Investigate theoretical mediators (self-efficacy, mastery, and self-regulation) on the
           relation between treatment arm and weight change.
