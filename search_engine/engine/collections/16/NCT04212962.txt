    
      The Transitional Care Model (TCM) is an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) led,
      team-based, care management strategy designed to improve the care and outcomes of high-risk
      older adults transitioning from hospital to home. Eligible patients who agree to participate
      in the study will be randomly assigned to either the intervention group, which receives the
      TCM intervention, or the control group, which receives usual care (standard hospital
      discharge planning and post-hospital follow up services). The target sample size for the
      study is 1600, evenly divided into intervention and control groups, with 400 patients
      recruited from each of the 4 partnering health systems (Swedish, Trinity Health, University
      of California, San Francisco, and Veterans Health Administration (VHA) - St Louis and
      Cleveland). Data will be collected at intake, prior to randomization, by enrollment
      coordinators at each of the participating hospitals. Followup data will be collected in a
      survey of patients conducted 90 days after discharge, and from claims data obtained from
      Medicare, Medicare Advantage plans, and the VHA.
