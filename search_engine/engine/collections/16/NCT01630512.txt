    
      Depression is a common co-morbidity of diabetes, negatively affecting physical performance,
      glycemic control, adherence to medication, and dietary, and exercise recommendations.
      Modalities of psychotherapy like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based
      cognitive therapy (MBCT) can reduce depressive symptoms in patients with medical conditions.
      However, proper designed randomized trials assessing and comparing effectiveness of these
      psychological interventions are rare.

      This longitudinal study aims to investigate the effectiveness of CBT and MBCT in reducing
      depressive symptoms in diabetes patients. Furthermore, potential moderators and mediators of
      treatment effect will be explored, as well as the role of common factors and treatment
      integrity.
