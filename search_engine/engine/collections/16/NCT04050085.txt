    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of intratumoral cytidine-phospho-guanosine
      oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG) in combination with nivolumab and radiotherapy (RT) in
      chemotherapy-refractory metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma using Common Terminology
      Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)5.0 criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary data on disease control rate (DCR), duration of response (DOR),
      progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) of intratumoral CpG in combination
      with nivolumab and RT in chemotherapy refractory pancreatic adenocarcinoma.
