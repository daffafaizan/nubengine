    
      This study is a double-blind randomized intervention study. In total 42 healthy volunteers
      (men and women) between 18 and 45 years will be recruited among the Maastricht University
      community (coworkers/students) and randomized into one of the following groups:

      Placebo, 10 mcg MK7, 20 mcg MK7, 45 mcg MK7, 90 mcg MK7, 180 mcg MK7, 360 mcg MK7.

      Each group will consist of 6 volunteers with approximately equal numbers of men and women (3
      men / 3 women). A double-blind design of the study is chosen to avoid the occurrence of bias
      during the study. The randomization procedure will be performed by an investigator who is not
      involved in the coordination of the study and will generate specific randomization codes for
      each subject. After randomization, the volunteers consume the indicated amount of capsules
      once daily with either breakfast of dinner during a period of 12 weeks.

      During the first week, blood samples of the volunteers will be collected at day 0, 1, 3 and 7
      to study immediate effects on carboxylation of OC and MGP. After the first week, blood
      samples will be drawn every first day of week 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.
