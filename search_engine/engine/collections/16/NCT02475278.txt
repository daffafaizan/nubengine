      Particle Vaccine (NoV Vaccine). The purpose of this study is to collect serum samples to
      evaluate serologic assays and to establish proficiency panels for serologic assays used for
      assessment of post vaccination immune response after intramuscular (IM) vaccination with the
      NoV vaccine. The validation and proficiency testing of the immunogenicity assays is required
      to support the NoV Vaccine development program. This study also looked at side effects in
      people who were administered a single dose of the NoV vaccine.

      The study enrolled 50 patients. All participants received one dose of the NoV vaccine via
      intramuscular injection.

      Participants were asked to record any symptoms that may be related to the vaccine or the
      injection site in a diary card for 7 days after receiving the vaccination.

      This single-centre trial was conducted in the United States. The overall time to participate
      in this study was 183 days. Participants made 4 visits to the clinic, and were contacted by
      telephone 183 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.
