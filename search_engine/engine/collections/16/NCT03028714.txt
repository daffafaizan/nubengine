      beginning and one at the end of the study. The study will include healthy students from two
      UK Universities, who they will be randomly assigned either to the intervention or to the
      control group. Participants in both groups will be asked to undertake measurements and
      complete questionnaires before and after the study. Measurements include the assessment of
      BMI, body fat, lean mass, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure and blood
      glucose. In addition, nutrition knowledge and dietary habits will be estimated using online
      questionnaires as well as the level of physical activity using the IPAQ questionnaire and
      pedometers. Participants in the intervention group will receive access to an educational
      website including information about fruit and vegetables, fat, sugars, fast-food, meat, salt,
      meals and snacks, food labels, exercise, and alcohol. Each category will be linked to an
      online quiz-game that will include questions related to the topic. Students will be asked to
      play the games as much as they want to improve their knowledge scores. Access to the website
      and the games will be available for 10 weeks. Participants in the control group will receive
      no intervention. After 10 weeks, participants will be asked to undertake the same
      measurements and complete the same questionnaires as they did in the beginning of the study.
      The study aims to investigate the effectiveness of an online educational intervention, using
      game elements, on the level of nutrition knowledge of students, as well as, whether any
      changes in knowledge impact changes in dietary habits, physical activity and weight-related
      factors.
