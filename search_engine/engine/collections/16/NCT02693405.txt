    
      First, the investigators will calculate the prevalence of cognitive and socio-cognitive
      deficits, by comparing the performances of patients (children/adolescents and adults) to
      normative data available for each tasks and to performances of healthy controls matched on
      socio-demographic criteria.

      Second, the investigators will compare the neuropsychological scores for cognitive and
      socio-cognitive tasks to health related quality of life (HRQOL) data (composite scores and by
      domains). Comparisons of neuropsychological and HRQOL scores will be performed between the
      two populations (children / adolescents and adults).

      Third, the investigators will compare the data from the two age groups for the aforementioned
      variables (cognitive and behavioral executive assessments, cognitive and affective TOM). The
      proximity of the tasks should provide valid elements of comparison. The investigators will
      compare the questionnaires in auto-and hetero-evaluation for each HRQOL scales, and also for
      executive behavioral questionnaires.

      Finally, to evaluate the investigators will compare the HRQOL patients/relatives' data to
      measure the potential impact of the disease on HRQOL of relatives of PBT survivors and the
      potential link between these data.
