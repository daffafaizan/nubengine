      the liberal sector. A total of 91 cardiologists participate in the selection of patients as
      investigators. The study is a longitudinal non-interventional registry of atrial
      fibrillation. The data collected are managed by the DACIMA Clinical Suite® platform, which
      complies with international standards: FDA 21 CFR part 11 (Food and Drug Administration 21
      Code of Federal Regulations part 11), HIPPA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
      Act), ICH (International Conference on Harmonisation), MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for
      Regulatory Activities). The DACIMA Clinical Suite® platform allows to track the data entered,
      check for inconsistencies and missing data, and schedule monitoring visits. A Steering
      Committee is set up to monitor patient inclusions, verify data sources, perform audit trails
      and prepare the statistical analysis plan for the study.
