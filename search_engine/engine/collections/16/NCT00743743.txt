      occurring polyphenol found in red wine, can increase cognition, reduce neural degeneration,
      promote clearance of amyloid-beta peptides, and alter aging mechanisms. Therefore,
      resveratrol may reduce the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and possibly its pathology.
      Objective: A pilot study to determine the effects of resveratrol on cognitive, behavioral and
      global functioning in patients with mild-to-moderate AD on standard therapy. Design:
      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Participants: 50 patients with
      mild-moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD) defined as a Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) between
      10-27 will be enrolled in the study. Patients must have an established diagnosis of AD by
      NINCDS diagnostic criteria, be on stable dose of cognitive enhancing medications
      (cholinesterase inhibitor and/or NMDA receptor antagonist) Screening/Enrollment:
      Institutional Review Board approval will be obtained. The chart review and the enrollment
      discussion will be carried out by a non-physician member of the research team. Participants
      will be screened and randomized until a total of 50 eligible patients, 25 in each arm are
      obtained.
