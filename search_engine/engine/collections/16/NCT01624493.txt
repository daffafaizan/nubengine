      BNC105P is a novel vascular disrupting agent (VDA) with promising preclinical activity
      combined with platinum or gemcitabine. The results of standard chemotherapy with carboplatin
      and gemcitabine for ovarian cancer relapsing within 12 months of an initial platinum-based
      regimen require improvement. This trial will determine the recommended dose and activity of
      BNC105P administered with carboplatin and gemcitabine.

      PHASE I:

      This trial uses a standard 3+3 design for allocating participants to a starting dose level in
      Phase I.

      If dose level 1 is deemed to have acceptable toxicity then dose levels 2a and 2b can be
      opened at the same time. Dose level 3 will only open if both dose levels 2a and 2b are deemed
      to have acceptable toxicity.

      The underlying assumptions for determining the recommended doses for the triple combination
      of carboplatin, gemcitabine and BNC105P are that the likely minimum doses required of each
      agent are carboplatin AUC 4, gemcitabine 800 mg/m2 and BNC105P 12 mg/m2. This corresponds to
      dose level 1.

      PHASE II 1:1 RANDOMIZATION:

      Carboplatin AUC 4 on day 1, gemcitabine 800 or 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and 8 of a 21 day cycle
      for a maximum of 6 cycles.

      OR

      Carboplatin AUC 4 on day 1, gemcitabine 800 or 1000 mg/m2 on days 1 and day 8 with dose of
      BNC105P as determined in phase I, on days 2 and 9 of a 21 day cycle for a maximum of 6
      cycles, followed by single agent maintenance BNC105P 16 mg/m2 for a maximum of 6 additional
      cycles

      Minimum follow up for 12 months

      ECOG Performance Status for Phase I: 0-1; ECOG Performance Status for Phase II: 0-2

      Life Expectancy: Less than 12 weeks

      Hematopoietic (both phases):

        -  Platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/L

        -  ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L

        -  Haemoglobin > 9g/dl (can be post transfusion)

        -  INR ≤ 1.5 x ULN

      Hepatic (both phases):

        -  Total Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN)

        -  ALT ≤ 2.5 x ULN

      Renal (both phases):

        -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 55 mL/min according to Cockcroft Gault formula

        -  If Calculated GFR is 50 - 54 mL/min an isotopic GFR may be performed. If the isotopic
           GFR is > 55ml/min, the patient will be eligible for the study but the calculated GFR
           will be used for dose calculation.

      Cardiovascular (both phases):

        -  Normal left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), i.e. ≥ 50% on Gated Heart Pool Scan,
           or fractional shortening on echocardiogram ≥ institutional LLN performed within 2 months
           prior to randomisation

        -  Corrected QTc < 470 msec on ECG performed within 4 weeks prior to randomisation.
