      regular practice of physical activity, in opposition to a sedentary life, is associated with
      a reduced risk of developing neurodegenerative diseases such as AD. These results have been
      strengthened by cross-sectional and interventional studies, which have shown that physical
      activity slows down the decline of cognitive functions typically observed in normal and
      pathological aging and retards the onset of dementia. The positive effects of chronic
      exercise on cerebral and cognitive ageing are now recognised by scientists and clinicians;
      however, the mechanisms underlying these effects in humans are poorly understood and there is
      a real need for randomised controlled trial (RCT) on this topic. The objective of this
      research project is to understand the compensatory mechanisms that may account for the
      positive effects of regular physical activity on pathological and non-pathological cerebral
      ageing in human and in particular in people presenting prodromal AD. All participants will be
      separated into six groups corresponding to the combination of two independent variables: the
      population type (aged people without any neurological disease vs. prodromal Alzheimer's
      disease participants) and the type of physical activity program they will follow during six
      months (aerobic and strength exercise program, stretching and balance program, or maintaining
      sedentary life style). Cognitive performance, cardiovascular health, brain integrity and
      cerebral functioning will be assessed at two or three different times: before the onset of
      the training program (pre-test), at the end of the training period (post-test 1) and six
      months after the end of the training program (post-test 2).
