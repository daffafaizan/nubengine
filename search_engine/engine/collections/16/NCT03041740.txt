    
      The primary study objective is to assess the safety and feasibility of perfluorooctylbromide
      (PFOB) partial liquid ventilation for up to ten days in infants with severe BPD as evaluated
      by: (1) no sustained oxygen desaturations (SpO2 â‰¤ 80%) for greater than ten minutes without
      response to increased oxygen therapy, (2) no persistent hypotension without response to
      volume expansion and/or inotropic therapy, (3) no major mucus plugging events (defined as
      events that are unresolved after two bronchoscopes), (4) no pneumothoraces or pleural
      effusion with PFOB, (5) and no evidence of increased carbon dioxide (CO2) retention, renal
      insufficiency, hyperkalemia, or metabolic acidosis.
