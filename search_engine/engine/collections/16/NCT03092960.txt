    
      This study is a comparative effectiveness trial where obese Latino men will receive, by
      random assignment, the HOMBRE intervention or a minimal intensity intervention.

      The study is designed to test whether a flexible lifestyle program with choices for program
      engagement will lead to better health outcomes, compared to a minimal intensity self-directed
      lifestyle program. If proven successful, this study has the potential to significantly impact
      health outcomes that matter to Latino men through the innovative design of lifestyle
      interventions to prevent chronic disease.
