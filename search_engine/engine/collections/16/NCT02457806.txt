      to sequences of four randomly ordered study periods with inter-treatment "washout" periods of
      3 to 14 days. The four study regimens, which will be applied in random order will be:

        -  Regimen1. Three sprays of Kovacaine Mist in each nostril (bilateral dosing);

        -  Regimen 2. Three sprays of Kovacaine Mist in the right nostril and three sprays of
           placebo in the left nostril (right-sided unilateral dosing);

        -  Regimen 3. Three sprays of Kovacaine Mist in the left nostril and three sprays of
           placebo in the right nostril (left-sided unilateral dosing);

        -  Regimen 4. Three sprays of placebo in each nostril (placebo dosing).

      During each testing period, eight representative maxillary teeth (#s 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13
      and 14) will be assessed for anesthesia using standard EPT testing. EPT testing will be
      conducted on the eight representative teeth at the following time points (minutes relative to
      the first spray of study drug): T-5, T3, T7, T11, T16, T21, T26T31, T41, T51, T61, T76, T91,
      T121, T151, and T181. If EPT testing of a target tooth is not possible (e.g., missing or does
      not meet inclusion criterion #2) tooth substitution is permissible. For molar teeth, #2 may
      replace #3 and #15 may replace #14. For premolar teeth, #5 may replace #4 and #12 may replace
      #13. The same replacements will be made for all testing sessions, and the actual teeth tested
      will be documented in the CRF.
