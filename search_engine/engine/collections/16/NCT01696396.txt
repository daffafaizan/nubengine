      treatment period, and a 2-year safety follow-up period.

      Participants who did not reach minimal improvement, or experienced disease worsening after
      initial response, had the option to receive open-label abrilumab 210 mg every 3 months (Q3M)
      beginning at double-blind period week 12 or after. Not reaching minimal improvement was
      defined as not having an improvement in CDAI score of ≥ 70 points from baseline on 2
      consecutive visits (at or after week 8) at least 2 weeks apart. Disease worsening after week
      8 (or week 12) response was defined as having an increase in CDAI score of ≥ 70 points from
      the week 8 (or week 12) CDAI score on 2 consecutive visits at least 2 weeks apart, and a CDAI
      score of > 150.

      Participants were planned to be randomized in a 2:1:2:1 ratio to SC placebo or abrilumab at
      21 mg, 70 mg (on day 1, week 2, week 4, and every 4 weeks thereafter until week 24), or 210
      mg (on day 1 followed by placebo in weeks 2 and 4 and every 4 weeks thereafter until week
      24), respectively. Due to a consistent discrepancy between the investigational product (IP)
      instruction manual (IPIM) description of vial positions and the actual vial positions in the
      IP package participants were initially randomized to 3 arms (placebo, 70 mg, and 210 mg) with
      a randomization ratio of 3:2:1. The study was temporarily paused while this issue was
      investigated. Once the discrepancy was corrected, Protocol Amendment 3 implemented, and
      affected participants completed their double-blind treatment period, the study resumed
      enrollment and randomization per protocol. Neither the randomization nor study blind was
      compromised and therefore the intent-to-treat principle was maintained.
