        -  Evaluate time to progression of disease in patients with unresectable hepatocellular
           carcinoma or neuroendocrine hepatic metastases undergoing chemoembolization.

        -  Evaluate tumor response achievable with chemoembolization in this patient population.

        -  Evaluate the toxicities of this treatment in these patients.

        -  Evaluate survival of these patients following this treatment.

        -  Evaluate extrahepatic patterns of failure following chemoembolization, to determine
           whether intrahepatic progression may be forestalled and survival affected in these
           patients.

        -  Validate a consistent method of performing chemoembolization in a multicenter setting.

      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease (hepatocellular carcinoma vs
      neuroendocrine hepatic metastases).

      Patients undergo placement of a visceral arterial catheter. Patients receive doxorubicin,
      mitomycin, and cisplatin as a chemoemulsion via the arterial catheter into 1 hepatic lobe
      only. Immediately following delivery of the chemoemulsion, particulate embolization is
      performed. The opposite lobe, if involved, is treated within 3-5 weeks of treatment of the
      initial lobe.

      In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, each involved lobe is treated separately a second
      time, in the same sequence, beginning 8 weeks after the last lobular chemoembolization. After
      completion of all protocol therapy, retreatment on study of either lobe is allowed for
      regrowth, recurrence, or new disease, provided at least 3 months have elapsed since the
      initial treatment of that lobe.

      Patients are followed for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year.
