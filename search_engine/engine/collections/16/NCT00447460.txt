    
      This is a multicenter, single dose study of allogenic mesenchymal stem cell (1-2 x 10^6
      MSC/Kg recipient´s bodyweight).

      MSC will be infused, by a central venous catheter, to patients diagnosed with GVHD refractory
      to first-line or subsequent treatment.

      All patients will receive the same treatment. MSC suspension will be obtained from the bone
      marrow aspiration of a family donor and expanded in-vitro in a specific culture medium with
      autologous donor´s serum and with no animal-derived products.
