    
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy, tolerability, and toxicity of
      bendamustine, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (BBD) as first-line treatment of multiple myeloma
      (MM) patients who are transplant ineligible or who are not candidates for high dose
      chemotherapy. Eligible patients will receive protocol treatment for up to 34 weeks plus the
      screening period (up to 2 weeks). Response assessments will occur every 4 weeks and confirmed
      using the International Myeloma Working Group Uniform Response Criteria. Patients having an
      objective response or stable disease will continue to maintenance therapy until disease
      progression or intolerable toxicity.
