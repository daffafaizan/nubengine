      ALVAC-HIV vaccine + Bivalent Subtype C gp120 protein adjuvanted with MF59 in HIV-seronegative
      South African adults over 24 months from enrollment.

      Participants will be randomized to receive ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438), or placebo, by intramuscular
      injection at weeks 0 and 4; they will receive ALVAC-HIV (vCP2438) + Bivalent Subtype C
      gp120/MF59, or placebo, by IM injection at weeks 12, 24, and 52.

      In addition to the vaccination visits, participants will attend study visits at weeks 26, 39,
      54, 65, 78, 91, 104, 117, 130, 142, and 156. All study visits, including vaccination visits,
      will include HIV risk reduction counseling, a physical exam, and an interview/questionnaire.
      and pregnancy testing for participants capable of becoming pregnant. Select study visits will
      include a medical history review, physical exam, blood collection, urine collection, HIV
      testing, and pregnancy testing for participants capable of becoming pregnant.

      As of February 3, 2020, vaccinations for this study were suspended. Participants have been
      asked to continue attending follow-up visits for 12 months after the last vaccination they
      received. Participants who become HIV infected will be followed for 6 months after diagnosis.
