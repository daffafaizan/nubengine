      an uneventful outcome in the posttraumatic phase. One of the main functions of the
      inflammatory response is the recognition and elimination of damaged tissues and
      microorganisms. In polytraumatized patients, a huge amount of damaged cells occurs which has
      to be eliminated by programmed cell death (apoptosis)without damaging surrounding tissues. It
      remains unclear whether, when and how an interplay of complement system, NF-kB, danger and
      pattern recognition receptors, apoptosis, mesenchymal stem cells and their regulation may be
      beneficial and harmful. Differing activation of the complement system, pro-inflammatory
      biomarkers and predisposing polymorphisms of response and receptor genes are expected to lead
      to varying outcome. Therefore, this prospective observational study will enroll n=60
      polytraumatized patients with an ISS>18 to monitor longitudinally their inflammatory response
      after trauma and to find out whether there is a discriminating pattern of the cross talk
      between complement system, biomarkers and apoptosis in patients with beneficial or harmful
      outcome.
