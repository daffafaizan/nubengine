      due to vulnerable heart state electrically and hemodynamically. Especially if patients who
      had experienced shockable rhythms such as ventricular fibrillation or pulseless ventricular
      tachycardia during CPR, then they are at high risk of developing shockable re-arrest.

      However until now there has not been any evidence of prophylactic anti arrhythmic drug effect
      during post cardiac arrest care.

      Amiodarone is class III anti arrhythmic drug which has been used for conversion of
      ventricular arrhythmia during CPR.

      In this study we want to determine whether the prophylactic amiodarone can prevent re-arrest
      with ventricular shockable rhythm or not.
