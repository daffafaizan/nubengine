      of children with cerebral palsy (CP) by quantitatively synthesizing the existing literature,
      and to further determine the impact of VR game intervention (the duration of each
      intervention, intervention frequency, intervention cycle, and total intervention time) on the
      balance recovery of children with CP.

      A high-intensity task-oriented training programme designed to improve hemiplegic gait and
      physical fitness was feasible in the present study and the effectiveness exceeds a low
      intensity physiotherapy-programme in terms of gait speed and walking capacity in hemiplegic
      cp. In a future study, seems appropriate to additionally use measures to evaluate physical
      fitness and energy expenditure while walking.
