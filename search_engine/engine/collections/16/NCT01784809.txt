      immunodeficiency virus/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS), the effective
      development of prevention interventions for this high-risk group require an understanding of
      HIV risk context, sexual behaviors and attitudes for women while they are still in the
      community and before they become heavily involved in the criminal justice system. HIV
      prevention interventions must focus on women at early points of entry into the criminal
      justice system, when they are still in the community and at higher risk of engaging in unsafe
      sex and drug behaviors. This study focuses on a population of drug-involved women who have
      been arrested and given a court sanction, but are still living in the community.
