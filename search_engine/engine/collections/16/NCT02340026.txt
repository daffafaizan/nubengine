    
      This study is a single-blind, randomized exploratory clinical trial with repeated assessments
      during a 24-week treatment phase and at three follow-up points over 12 months after treatment
      to track the developmental trajectory of participants' motor function. Gross motor ability
      will be compared to published percentile scores of motor function development in cerebral
      palsy (CP) to determine if the trajectory of predicted motor development is altered, and to
      outcomes of intensity-matched conventional treatment to determine if continued Phase III
      investigation is warranted.
