      symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test with measures of cardiac output, autonomic
      function testing, blood volume measurement, and QOL questionnaires at baseline and following
      3-months of treatment. Thirty participants will be randomized to continue with the standard
      of care which can include lower body and core strengthening, fluids, salt, medications and
      sometimes exercise. The other thirty participants will be asked to complete at least three
      exercise training sessions a week (progressing to 3hrs/wk of aerobic and 1hr/wk of strength
      training) and receive eight supervised training sessions over the 3-month treatment period.
      All participants will be provided with a polar heart rate monitor which will be linked to a
      connected health application to allow patients to track any aerobic workout, ensure during a
      session they are in the correct training zone, and allow the study team to remotely monitor
      adherence.
