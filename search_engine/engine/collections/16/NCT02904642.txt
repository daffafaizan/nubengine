      without unconditionally provided incentives, can increase the proportion of children who
      receive measles vaccination by 15% at age ten months as compared to control arm children.

      Secondary Objectives

        1. To conduct a secondary analysis of the primary outcome using survival analysis and
           time-to-immunization curves.

        2. To determine if there is a differential effect on measles vaccine coverage based on
           mobile phone ownership and distance to the clinic.

        3. To examine the effect of the interventions on measles coverage measured at twelve months
           of age.

        4. To examine the completeness and costs of identifying children through a CHW approach
           versus the standard HDSS approach.

        5. To evaluate the effect of the interventions on coverage of second dose of measles
           vaccine at 24 months. This secondary objective is contingent on receiving additional
           funding.
