      Primary

        -  Determine the response rate (complete response and partial response) in patients with
           metastatic, locally advanced, or locally recurrent non-gastrointestinal stromal tumor
           sarcomas treated with sunitinib malate.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the 16- and 24-week progression-free survival rate (complete response, partial
           response, and stable disease) in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the overall survival in patients treated with this drug.

        -  Correlate clinical response with changes in soluble angiogenesis mediator levels in
           patients treated with this drug.

        -  Determine the tumor maximum standardized uptake values by fludeoxyglucose F 18-PET scan
           in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by neoplastic subtype (vascular
      connective tissue neoplasms, leiomyosarcoma, dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, chordoma, or
      desmoid tumors vs high-grade undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma [i.e., malignant fibrous
      histiocytoma (including myxofibrosarcoma)], or other nongastrointestinal connective tissue
      tumors [including carcinosarcomas]).

      Patients receive oral sunitinib malate once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 4 weeks
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.
