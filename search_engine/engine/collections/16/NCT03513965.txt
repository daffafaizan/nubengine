    
      Participants: The investigators will recruit participants who will receive treatment for
      peanut allergies through oral immunotherapy at the Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy & Asthma
      Research.

      Procedures: The investigators will divide recruited participants into two groups (random
      assignment). Each group will receive different messages about oral immunotherapy, one defined
      as "Symptoms as Side Effects Mindset" (in which symptoms are described as an unfortunate side
      effect of treatment). The other group will receive messages that help foster a "Symptoms as
      Positive Signals Mindset" (in which symptoms are described as a sign of increasing
      desensitization). These messages will be conveyed verbally and through activities by the
      study staff and participants will also receive pamphlets emphasizing these messages.

      The investigators expect that adopting a "Symptoms as Positive Signals" mindset will improve
      OIT outcomes in five ways:

        1. Decrease anxiety about symptoms,

        2. Increase treatment completion,

        3. Decrease the likelihood of participants reducing dose size or skipping a dose because of
           anxiety about symptoms,

        4. Reduce the experience of non-life-threatening symptoms during the study, and

        5. Improve physiological treatment outcomes at the conclusion of the study, as measured
           through peanut blood IgG4 and IgE levels.
