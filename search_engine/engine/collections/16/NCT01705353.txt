      of permanent disability. The acute pathophysiology of stroke depends on the innate immune
      response, which arises from mostly pro-inflammatory cascades. The chronic pathophysiology of
      stroke is less clear as the innate inflammatory response fades and matures into an adaptive
      immune response. HMGB-1 is a serum cytokine that has been found with persistent elevated
      levels for weeks to months after neurological insult in preclinical experiments, and may
      retard functional recovery. Elucidation of the relationship between HMGB-1 levels and the
      rate of functional recovery after stroke could lead to a better understanding of the systemic
      inflammatory response and more targeted therapeutic interventions.
