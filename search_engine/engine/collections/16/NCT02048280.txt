      level will be set at a starting value of 0.1 cm H2O/mcV and systematically increased by 0.5
      cm H2O/mcV every three minutes to a maximum of 3 cmH2O/mcV. Once the NAVA titration study has
      been completed, the patient will be extubated. There will be a stabilization period following
      extubation (15-30 minutes), and then the NAVA titration study will be repeated.
