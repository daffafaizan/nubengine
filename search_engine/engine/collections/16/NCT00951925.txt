      expression by analyzing the function of cell signaling pathways and the expression of other
      related genes and their protein products in the bone marrow cells of people without blood
      diseases. This includes the effects of drugs and other in vitro manipulations of the cells
      once they are removed from donors. These assays will include, but are not limited to,
      determinations of DNA methylation status, histone acetylation profiles, DNAse sensitivity,
      transcription factor binding to DNA, levels of various proteins, messenger RNAs and miRNAs in
      the cells of the marrow samples. By understanding how this process occurs in people without
      blood diseases, we hope to to design future treatments for people with diseases such as
      sickle cell disease and B-thalassemia.
