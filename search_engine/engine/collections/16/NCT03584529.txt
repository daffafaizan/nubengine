    
      180 patients with vitamin D deficiency (12 ng/ml ≤ serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 < 20 ng/ml) and
      uterine fibroids will be randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to two groups: intervention
      group A and control group B. 180 patients with vitamin D insufficiency (20 ng/ml ≤ serum
      25-hydroxyvitamin D3 < 30 ng/ml) and uterine fibroids will be also randomly assigned in a
      ratio of 1:1 to two groups: intervention group C and control group D. The intervention group
      A will receive 1600 IU/d of vitamin D3; The intervention group C will receive 800 IU/d of
      vitamin D3; the control group B and the control group D will receive regular follow-up.
      Patients will be followed up at the same time points for 24 months. The outcome measure is
      the growth of uterine fibroids in different groups.
