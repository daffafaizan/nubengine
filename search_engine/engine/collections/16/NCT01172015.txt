      autoimmune diseases, express CD16 and display antibody dependent cytotoxicty. Moreover NK
      cells are present in human spleen. However their role in ITP has not been studied so far. NK
      could represent a new target for treatments in ITP. We propose thus to conduct a study to
      characterizes NK cells changes in patients with ITP.
