    
      This is a single center, open labeled (all people know the identity of intervention),
      randomized (study drug assigned by chance), parallel group (a medical research study
      comparing the response in two or more groups of participants receiving different
      interventions (treatments) trial to compare the effectiveness (pain relief) and safety of
      tramadol 37.5 mg and acetaminophen 325 mg with diclofenac in participants with ankylosing
      spondylitis receiving stable treatment of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
      Participants who meet the eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of the two treatment
      groups (tramadol/acetaminophen and Diclofenac). One group will be treated with tramadol 37.5
      mg/acetaminophen 325 mg combination tablet and another group will be treated with diclofenac
      50 mg tablet. Participants randomized into this study will be instructed to take one tablet
      Ultracet or diclofenac 50 mg orally, twice a day for 8 weeks. Evaluations will be performed
      as outlined: at Screening, at Baseline, and at Weeks 2, 4, and 8. The primary efficacy
      parameter is to compare the mean change from Baseline in visual analogue scale (VAS) pain
      score between the two treatment groups (tramadol/acetaminophen versus diclofenac).
      Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
