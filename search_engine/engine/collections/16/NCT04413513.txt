      for dementia prevention. However, the condition is found to be associated with profound
      negative subsequent decline on both functioning and cognition. While epidemiological studies
      reported high prevalence in older population, its symptoms are often overlooked in the
      presence of other age-related diseases in the community as well as among the health
      professionals. It is expected that cognitive and functional disabilities secondary to this
      condition will pose a significant burden to the existing healthcare system. Therefore,
      targeting anxious older adults for early intervention may help to cut healthcare costs and to
      ensure proactive dementia prevention in the long run. The current proposed intervention
      intends to attenuate the trajectory of cognitive decline at a very early stage and enhance
      existing cognitive function to delay the onset of dementia.

      This study aims to explore whether the use of integrated attention training program (IATP)
      could improve cognitive performance and functioning in older adults with anxiety symptoms. In
      particulars, we aim

        1. To examine the cognitive effect of 4 week integrated attention training program (I) and
           health education (C) in older adults with anxiety symptoms.

        2. To examine the 4 week integrated attention training program (I) and health education (C)
           in alleviating mood symptoms in older adults with anxiety symptoms.

        3. To examine the acceptability and adherence of the proposed intervention.
