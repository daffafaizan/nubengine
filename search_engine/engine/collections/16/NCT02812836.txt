      be investigated by anorectal manometry and after the procedure BET will be performed at the
      same day.

      During anorectal manometry conventional manometric parameters will be recorded, such as
      resting pressure, squeeze pressure, bear down manoeuver, thresholds of sensation and
      threshold of recto anal inhibitory reflex. 3D picture of anal canal will be recorded.

      After the manometry standard BET will be performed. The balloon will be inserted into the
      rectum and patient will be asked to expel it in private during 1 min.

      Data from manometry will be correlated with the success rate of BET.
