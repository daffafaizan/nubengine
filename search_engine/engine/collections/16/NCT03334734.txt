    
      This phase 2a study is aimed to evaluate the early bactericidal activity of a new
      anti-tuberculosis drug PBTZ169 (capsules 80 mg), and its results will allow preliminary
      evaluate antimycobacterial properties of PBTZ169 and confirm a potentially more effective
      dose for subsequent studies. This study is an open, randomized comparative efficacy (on the
      parameter of early bactericidal activity), safety and pharmacokinetics study of PBTZ169 in
      patients with first-diagnosed lung tuberculosis and preserved sensitivity to base
      antimycobacterial drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid.

      Within the framework of the study, it is planned to use the studied drugs (PBTZ169 and
      isoniazid) as monotherapy within 14 days. Isoniazid is used as a "positive control", that is,
      in order to determine whether the method of assessing efficacy on the parameter of early
      bactericidal activity is working.
