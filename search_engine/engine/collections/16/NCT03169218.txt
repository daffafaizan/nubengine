      were included. Through this study, a statistically significant effect on the variables
      analyzed was demonstrated. Therefore, it was determined to duplicate the initial sample to
      confirm the effect previously studied, assuming losses of 20%. Thus, the value of n for the
      clinical trial is 20 subjects.
