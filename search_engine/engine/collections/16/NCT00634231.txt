      AdV-tk into the tumor or tumor bed during the surgical procedure followed by 14 days of
      anti-herpetic prodrug, valacyclovir, starting 1-3 days after vector injection. Standard
      radiotherapy will begin 3-7 days after AdV-tK injection. Standard chemotherapy may begin
      after completion of valacyclovir at the discretion of the treating physician and family. Two
      dose levels of AdV-tk will be evaluated with a fixed dose of valacyclovir.
