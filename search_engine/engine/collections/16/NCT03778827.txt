    
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of pivotal response training (PRT)
      in an intensive center-based preschool environment to treat social communication deficits in
      children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study will compare Pivotal Response
      Treatment (PRT) to a delayed treatment group (DTG). PRT is a naturalistic behavioral
      intervention based on the principles of applied behavior analysis which has shown to be
      effective in treating the core deficits in children with ASD. The study will compare the
      combination of parent training with intensive center-based PRT (PRT-C) to a DTG and will
      include 44 children ages 2 to 3.11 years with ASD and social communication deficits.
