      three-arm, multi-center, dose-titration study.

      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NL in patients with
      IC. The primary efficacy analysis will be the percent change from baseline in Peak Walking
      Time (PWT) and Claudication Onset Time (COT), calculated as the logarithm of the quotient of
      the time walked on treadmill at a visit divided by the time walked at baseline. Other
      efficacy measures will include Ankle Brachial Index (ABI), QoL measurements, composite of
      cardiovascular events (MI, stroke, vascular death, and lower limb amputations), and coronary
      and peripheral artery revascularization procedures. Safety variables will include serum
      transaminases, routine chemistry parameters, hematology, and AEs. Pharmacokinetic analyses
      will be conducted as well.
