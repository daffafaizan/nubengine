      analysed by using HLA-tetramers to identify and purify CD4+ gluten-specific T cells by flow
      cytometry. T cells will undergo transcriptome analysis to get an insight in signalling of
      antigen-specific cells. Other cell populations like CD8+ T cells and γδ T cells will also be
      analyzed by flow cytometry.
