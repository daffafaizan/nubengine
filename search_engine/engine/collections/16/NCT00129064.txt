      care physicians (PCPs) from 2 community-based clinics will be recruited for enrollment. The
      control group will initiate referrals using the pre-existing paper forms;
      physician-to-physician communication can occur by e-mail, phone, or mail at the discretion of
      the referring physician as is currently the standard. Physicians randomized to the
      intervention arm will be asked to use the electronic application for every referral during
      the study period. For 6 months, every new referral initiated within the study groups will be
      assessed for the completeness of patient information and timing of feedback to the referring
      physician via physician surveys. In addition, a subgroup of patients in the control and
      intervention arms will be surveyed to assess the impact of the intervention on patient
      satisfaction with the referral process.
