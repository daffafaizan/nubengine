    
      BP-C1, solution for injection 0.05%, is currently being developed for treatment of patients
      with metastatic breast cancer with palliative intent.

      Active substance of the product, which is a novel platinum-containing anticancer agent
      developed for intramuscular administration, is Ð° cis-diammineplatinum(II) complexed with a
      polymer containing benzene polycarboxylic acids derived from lignin.

      The amphiphilic characteristics of the polymer have resulted in a product with clear and
      significantly altered and improved properties compared to other platinum analogues, e.g.
      cisplatin, carboplatin and oxaliplatin.

      BP-C1 preserves antitumour activity of its predecessors (e.g. cisplatin and carboplatin),
      additionally offering the following advantages that ensure favourable outcome of treatment of
      metastatic breast cancer patients:

        -  injectable solution (intramuscular) does not cause injection site reactions; can be
           administered at home by a nurse or a patient;

        -  has an improved pharmacokinetic profile;

        -  demonstrates efficacy comparable to cisplatin and much higher than carboplatin
           (in-vitro; in-vivo data);

        -  exerts an additional immunomodulatory activity.

      This study is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, phase IIb study in
      Thai patients with metastatic breast cancer. The eligible patients will be allocated (1:1) to
      either BP-C1 arm or Placebo arm and treated once daily for 32 days. The patients allocated to
      Placebo arm will cross over to BP-C1 treatment for 32 days when progression of the cancer
      will be documented and latest after 32-day treatment with Placebo. After 32-day treatment
      with BP-C1 the patients are invited to continue open-label treatment under protocol
      BMC2011-02.
