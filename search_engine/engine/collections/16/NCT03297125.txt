      glioblastoma. This therapy demonstrated comparable outcomes for patients with recurrent GBM,
      in comparison to standard therapies, but better quality of life. More recently, in an interim
      analysis of 315 patients with GBM, adding Tumor Treating Fields (TTFields) to maintenance
      temozolomide chemotherapy significantly prolonged progression-free and overall survival. It
      also has demonstrated promise in other cancers such as pancreas, mesothelioma, ovarian and
      lung. However, in order to optimize the treatment regimen, and potentially predict which
      patients are most likely to respond, reliable ways of evaluation are necessary. Advanced
      perfusion and diffusion MRI methods have shown utility with other treatments such as
      bevacizumab. Preliminary data suggests the same might be true for the evaluation of Optune
      therapy. The team therefore proposes to determine the utility of these methods to predict
      response to Optune therapy. A successful result will have wide-ranging implications not only
      for the optimization of Optune treatment of brain cancer but also other cancers shown to
      benefit from this novel therapy.

      Objective: To compare standard and advanced MRI for their ability to predict response to
      Optune therapy. The team's approach will be to obtain both standard and advanced MRI in
      patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy plus Optune
      therapy. The ability of standard and advanced MRI to predict response will be assessed. The
      hypothesis is that perfusion and/or diffusion imaging metrics can be used to predict response
      to and elucidate mechanisms of action for Optune treatment.
