      within 48 hours after hospital admission. Blood pressure and clinical outcome will be
      monitored throughout ICU treatment and hospital stay, respectively. Diagnosis of sleep apnea
      will be confirmed on follow-up 3-6 month after SAH by sleep apnea screening (portable
      cardiorespiratory monitoring and out-of-center polysomnography, respectively).
