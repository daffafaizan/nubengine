      assigned to receive GP (gemcitabine and cisplatin) or PF (cisplatin and fluorouracil)
      induction chemotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Patients in both arms
      receive radical radiotherapy, and cisplatin (100mg/m²) every three weeks for two cycles
      during radiotherapy. Patients in the investigational arm receive gemcitabine (1000 mg/m²
      d1,8) and cisplatin (80mg/m² d1) every 3 weeks for three cycles. Patients in the control arm
      receive fluorouracil (800mg/m² d1-5) and cisplatin (80mg/m² d1) every 3 weeks for three
      cycles. Our primary endpoint is progress-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points include
      distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), overall survival (OS), locoregional relapse-free
      survival (LRRFS), initial response rates after treatments, toxic effects and quality of life
      (QoL).
