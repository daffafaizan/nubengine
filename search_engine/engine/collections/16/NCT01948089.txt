      with attention, working memory and executive functions (e.g., monitoring, planning, and
      organization).

      These deficits are common - 32-73%, and chronic, and interfere with a patients response to
      rehabilitation, independence in activities of daily living, community re-integration, and
      overall quality of life after stroke. Attention, memory and executive function impairments
      can adversely affect the ability to relearn various skills.

      Cognitive impairments and their impacts on other components of functioning not only impact on
      the individual, but can also adversely affect the family via increases in caregiver distress
      and burden. Thus, the presence of cognitive impairment has wide-reaching impact and deserves
      effective and consistent intervention similar to the attention devoted to improving function
      in physical domains.

      Cognitive training can improve cognitive function, particularly in those areas known to
      involved in vascular cognitive impairment, i.e., attentional and executive function.
      Accumulating evidence indicates that computer-based training can improve cognitive skills in
      healthy older adults as well as in clinical populations. Attention and working memory
      training has also been shown to be effective in patients in the chronic phase post stroke.

      The investigators propose that specific cognitive training to improve working memory could
      provide direct benefit to chronic stroke patients. Promising interventions focused on
      intensive and direct working memory training are emerging and have been shown to generalize
      to other cognitive domains, such as fluid intelligence.
