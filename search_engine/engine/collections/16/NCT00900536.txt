        -  Examine the relationship between tumor genotype, expression, and patient outcome.

        -  Examine the relationship between constitutional genotype and patient outcome.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients undergo blood and/or tissue sample collection for laboratory studies. Laboratory
      studies include generation of tissue microarrays; analysis of protein expression by
      immunohistochemistry; tumor DNA extraction and whole genome amplification; detection of VHL
      or other relevant gene mutations by direct sequencing; and constitutional (lymphocyte DNA)
      genotyping by single nucleotide polymorphism analysis.
