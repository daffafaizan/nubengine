      and homogenously to inhibit excessive neointima proliferation and is associated with rapid
      healing of endothelium. As a result, DCB therapy reduces the risk of coronary thrombosis.
      Since only 1 to 3 months duration of dual anti-platelet therapy is required, the bleeding
      risk associated with prolonged dual anti-platelet therapy (DAPT) is reduced by DCB.
      Furthermore, there is no permanent residue of foreign bodies in the blood vessels after DCB
      procedure and this advantage completely eliminates adverse events associated with allergic
      reactions to metal, polymer and stent fracture. For side branch(SB) with a relatively small
      lumen in bifurcation lesions, DCB may neglect the lumen loss due to stent scaffolds and cause
      much less late lumen loss (LLL) than stent therapy does. For main branch(MB), no jailed SBs
      by the stent and the rate of SB stenosis or even occlusion will be greatly reduced.
