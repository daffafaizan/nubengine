      impaired in obese patients and will help to enhance cardiovascular risk prediction. Carotid
      intima-media thickness (cIMT) will be captured as a means of assessing early vascular changes
      associated with low HDL levels in obesity. A novel measurement for clinical correlation has
      also been introduced called carotid extra-medial thickness (cEMT) which will be compared to
      cIMT in this obese population.
