      undergoing LAA closure with the WATCHMAN device (possibly with WATCHMAN FLX when approved)
      utilizing an intra-procedural ICE probe under moderate sedation. The primary feasibility
      endpoint will be ability to successfully implant the WATCHMAN device. Implant success is
      defined as confirmation of the device-specified release PASS (Position, Anchor, Size, Seal)
      criteria, successful device release, and adequate seal (defined as a residual leak <5 mm) as
      assessed by a core lab interpretation of the TEE 45 days post-implant. The primary safety
      endpoint will be a composite of major complications (major bleeding [intracranial bleeding,
      or bleeding requiring blood transfusion], pericardial effusion requiring pericardiocentesis
      or surgery, device embolization, procedural-related stroke, or procedural related death).
      Additional measured end points will be: freedom from conversion to general anesthesia and/or
      standard TEE during implant, the incidence and the size of iatrogenic atrial septal defect on
      45 day TEE. The ICE procedural images will also be collected and analyzed by an independent
      committee composed of non-implanting interventionalist, and an imaging specialist. The images
      will be graded in quality as optimal (TEE equivalent), acceptable (adequate but not as
      detailed as TEE), and inadequate. This prospective study, along with its endpoints will be
      registered in clinicaltrials.gov.
