      After screening, eligible participants will undergo a 3 to 4-week run-in period to ensure
      washout of prior medications. At the end of the run-in period, eligible participants will be
      randomly assigned with a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive once daily administration of one of the
      following study treatments group for 12 weeks:

        1. AZD9977 Dose A + dapagliflozin 10 mg

        2. AZD9977 Dose B + dapagliflozin 10 mg

        3. AZD9977 Dose C + dapagliflozin 10 mg

        4. AZD9977 Dose C

        5. Dapagliflozin 10 mg

        6. Placebo

      Participants will be randomized to one of the above treatment group, according to T2DM
      (yes/no) and eGFR (<30 mL/min / ≥ 30 to ≤ 45 mL/min / >45 mL/min).

      The total duration of participation will be approximately 19 to 21 weeks.
