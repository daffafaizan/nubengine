      Fitbit and MapTrek, and a control group that will receive a Fitbit only. This study has 3
      specific aims.

      Aim 1- To determine if patients randomized to MapTrek walk more than the control patients.

      Aim 2- To determine if patients randomized to MapTrek generally walk at a faster pace during
      the day than control patients.

      Aim 3- To determine if patients randomized to MapTrek have less sedentary time during the day
      than the control patients.

      We expect to collect sufficient data to demonstrate the effectiveness of MapTrek, our
      prototype m-health tool, as an intervention to increase physical activity, heighten intensity
      of activity, and reduce sedentary behavior among a cohort of patients at risk for type 2
      diabetes.
