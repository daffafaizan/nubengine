      intraoperative hypotension is related with postoperative morbidity and mortality. however,
      with the change of hypotension criteria, the duration threshold also change. the relationship
      of different hypotension criteria and its duration is unclear. This study is to explore the
      relationship between continous difference mean blood pressure criteria and its duration
      thresholds for postoperative major adverse events, which include acute cardiac infarction,
      heart failure, cardiac death, stroke and acute kidney injury.
