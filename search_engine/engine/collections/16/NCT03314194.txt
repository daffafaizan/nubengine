    
      To characterize the human gut microbiome under highly controlled dietary intake in healthy
      normal weight adult participants who differ by ethnicity: White non-Hispanic and Black
      non-Hispanic adults. Samples will be collected to determine human genetic variation, fecal
      and oral microbial communities, and metabolome products. Several evolutionary and ecological
      diversity metrics will be distilled to test: a) if microbiome variation within each ethnicity
      is less than that between ethnicities; b) if microbiome variation is finely structured
      according to genetic relatedness; and c) if dietary variation impacts human genome x
      microbiome associations.
