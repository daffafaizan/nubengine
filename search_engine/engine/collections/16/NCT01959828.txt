    
      This is a multi-center, open-label, clinical study of the safety and efficacy of IK-3001 in
      16 subjects with peri- and post-operative pulmonary hypertension associated with cardiac
      surgery. Two primary sub-sets of this patient population will be evaluated in this study:

        1. Adults with severe congestive heart failure having LVAD implant

        2. Children requiring surgery for congenital heart disease with corresponding PH or having
           Glenn surgery or Fontan surgery for single-ventricle physiology. Children with severe
           pulmonary hypertension due to congenital heart disease who require inhaled nitric oxide
           (iNO) pre-operatively may also be enrolled.
