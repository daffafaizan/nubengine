    
      This is a single-center, randomized trial designed to examine the hypothesis that a
      lifestyle-based mHealth peripheral artery disease (PAD) prevention program will improve
      physical activity, fitness, important PAD risk factors and quality of life (QOL).

      The investigators may enroll up to 55 men and women being evaluated for leg pain from Duke
      PAD cardiovascular clinics or after lower extremity angioplasty in the Duke catheterization
      laboratory. Of the 55 men and women volunteers who may be initially consented, the
      investigators anticipate a portion (potentially 20%) may drop out during the study timeline,
      and approximately 45 are expected to complete this study. Following informed consent and
      baseline testing, the participants will be randomized (1.25:1.00) into either a mHealth
      (N=25) or usual care group (N=20) [for comparison] for a 12-week period. All patients will be
      evaluated for walking ability on a treadmill test, quality of life questionnaires, health
      literacy related to PAD and the most important risk factors specific to PAD (blood glucose if
      diabetic, daily physical activity and blood pressure).
