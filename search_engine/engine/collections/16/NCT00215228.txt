      autonomic dysfunction associated with depression and with cardiac disease. Low HRV is a
      marker of increased risk of cardiac mortality, and is observed in depressed coronary artery
      disease patients and in anxious patients post-MI. Treatment with sympathomimetic
      antidepressants, such as MAO inhibitors and tricyclics, reduce HRV further, and have been
      associated with elevated heart rate, orthostatic hypotension, and with adverse cardiac
      events. Although there is increasing evidence that the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor
      (SSRI) class of antidepressants have minimal effects on the cardiovascular system, the case
      is less clear with the SNRI antidepressants which block the reuptake of both serotonin and
      norepinephrine. It is possible that measures of the extent of norepinephrine transporter
      blockade or inhibition may relate to the HRV reduction seen with noradrenergic drugs. Given
      these considerations, we propose a study to compare the cardiovascular profile of the SSRI
      escitalopram (Lexapro), with the most recently available SNRI, duloxetine, in outpatients
      with depression. Using HRV methodology, we will test the hypothesis that greater reduction in
      HRV will be associated with duloxetine than escitalopram. In addition, we will measure the
      magnitude of serotonin and norepinephrine transporter occupancy produced by each drug. This
      will allow us to examine the relationship between changes in HRV to the magnitude of
      transporter inhibiting effects of each drug.
