      Among cryptogenic stroke patients, patients who was identified as high risk PFO which might
      be defined as high-risk of recurrence (PFO size ≥ 2 mm or atrial septal aneurysm or
      hypermobility by TEE) will be randomized 1:1 to :a) Device closure using Amplatzer device vs.
      b) standard medical therapy alone. All patients will be followed for at least 2 years.

      Echocardiography Findings for high-risk PFO Digitally, stored transesophageal
      echocardiographic images were reviewed and analyzed by an investigator. Using calipers, the
      PFO size was measured as the maximum separation of the septum primum from the septum
      secundum. ASA or hypermobility was defined as ≥ 10 mm of phasic septal excursion either into
      the atrium or a sum total excursion of ≥ 15 mm during the cardiorespiratory cycle, with a
      base of ≥ 15 mm.
