    
      Between September, 2007 and January 31, 2014, all consecutive patients who undergo EBUS-TBNA
      at the University Hospital Zurich for selective assessment of enlarged (â‰¥ 1 cm by CT or
      ultrasound) or suspected (enhanced fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) activity in PET/CT) lymph nodes
      were enrolled. Demographic and clinical data, procedural reports and cytological findings
      were collected from medical records. Computed tomography (CT) or PET/CT scans were
      prospectively reviewed to gather the size and standardized uptake value (SUV) of FDG of each
      sampled lymph node. The cytological findings obtained with EBUS-TBNA were verified by
      histological examination, if a surgical biopsy (mediastinoscopy, thoracoscopy, or
      thoracotomy) was carried out following EBUS-TBNA, or alternatively by clinical and
      radiological follow-up data.
