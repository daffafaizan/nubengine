    
      A multi-center, open label, randomized clinical trial evaluating the effectiveness and safety
      of etanercept and celecoxib alone/combined treatment will be conducted on active ankylosing
      spondylitis (AS) patients. Disease activity is defined as fulfilling three aspects below:
      BASDAI ≥ 4 or ASDAS≥ 2.1；CRP>6 mg/L or ESR 28 mm/1st hour；more than 2 and less than 16
      syndesmophyts between cervical spine and lumber spine detected by X-ray. All patients were
      randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment groups：celecoxib 200mg
      bid，etanercept 50mg qw and combined therapy for 52 weeks. Primary endpoints are the magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) score of
      sacroiliac(SI) joint and spine, as well as the Assessment of SpondyloArthritis International
      Society (ASAS) 20 response rate at 52 weeks. Key secondary Endpoints include the modified
      Stoke Ankylosing Spondylitis Spine Score (mSASSS), Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of
      Canada (SPRACC) SI joint structural score (SSS), BASDAI, ASDAS, ASAS40, ASAS70 and ASAS5/6
      response rate at 52 weeks.
