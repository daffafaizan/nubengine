    
      This study is a prospective, multicenter, observational study to assess the safety and
      efficacy of RETINA-AI Galaxy in screening for diabetic retinopathy in the primary care
      setting. The study design conforms to an Intent to Screen (ITS) paradigm [1]. The Galaxy is a
      software medical device designed to analyze digital color fundus photographs and rapidly
      screen for the presence of more than mild diabetic retinopathy or vision-threatening diabetic
      retinopathy in the primary care setting.

      The study will enroll 360 subjects after exclusions. Subjects who meet eligibility criteria
      will be recruited from three sites staffed by primary care providers. Eligibility will be
      assessed and informed consent obtained, after which digital color fundus photographs will be
      taken using U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cleared non-mydriatic fundus cameras, by
      an operator using the Galaxy photography manual.

      There will be a total of 5 non-mydriatic robotic screening cameras used in the AI system
      protocol part of the study. There will be a dedicated validation camera used in the
      Validation Reading Center Protocol part of the study. Primary care clinical staff (e.g.
      medical assistant) with no prior professional ophthalmic photography experience and only a 4
      hour training will operate the RETINA-AI Galaxy device and the screening cameras. The Retina
      Reading Center - certified professional ophthalmic photographers will operate the validation
      fundus cameras according the the 4W-D stereo protocol.
