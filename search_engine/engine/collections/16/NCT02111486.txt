      every day for 1 month. The order of the breakfast products is random. During each phase
      participants will come to the research clinic for 4 visits (1 per week) for assessment of
      appetite-related sensations. Gastric emptying will be assessed at 1 visit per phase and post
      prandial glucose response will be measured at 1 visit per phase (Asper site only).
