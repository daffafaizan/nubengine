      of appearance of cholesterol (Ra in mg/kg/hr), cholesterol excretion (%/day), RCT efflux
      (mg/kg/day) and de novo cholesterol synthesis (%) during a baseline period (7 days) and
      during a treatment period (94 days).

      The goal of using RCT to reverse atherosclerosis is to increase the rate of cholesterol
      export or "efflux" from the tissues and plaques. An increase in this cholesterol efflux rate
      should shrink arterial plaques by decreasing their static accumulation of cholesterol. While
      some currently marketed drugs have a positive impact on RCT by increasing the rate of
      cholesterol excretion from the body, no drug has yet been approved to increase the rate of
      cholesterol efflux from the tissues
