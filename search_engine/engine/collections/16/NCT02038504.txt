      about 70% of hospitalized patients, with or without acute systemic illnesses. Mechanisms in
      the pathogenesis of NTIS are not yet well understood. Our previous study demonstrated that
      NTIS occurred frequently with a prevalence of 57.5% in gastrointestinal fistulas patients. In
      recent study, it has been shown that early enteral nutrition decreases the duration of
      hospitalization and mortality in the burn population, indicating a potential role of enteral
      nutrition in NTIS.In addition, the management of fistula patients requires bundle therapy
      including Nutrition therapy, especially enteral nutrition.The purpose of this study is to
      investigate whether enteral nutrition are effective in the treatment of nonthyroidal illness
      syndrome among fistula patients.
