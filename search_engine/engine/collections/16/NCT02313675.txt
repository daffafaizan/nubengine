      as well as surgical treatment of distal radius fracture. Patients will be treated
      intra-operatively with either IV tylenol, IV toradol, both, or neither. All patients will
      receive the standard post-operative prescriptions for pain management. Daily pain surveys
      scoring pain from 0-10 will be distributed to the subjects to be filled out over the course
      of 10 days prior to first post-operative visit, usually 10-14 days later. Number of pain
      pills used before the first post-operative visit will also be measured.

      We hypothesize that the effects of intra-operative administration of IV tylenol and/or IV
      toradol will have a significant effect on decreasing post-operative pain in the first 10 days
      following distal radius fracture surgeries, with a significant difference in pain described
      as at least a 2 points on a 0-10 pain scale.

      We also hypothesize that intra-operative administration of IV tylenol and/or IV toradol will
      not have such significant effect on decreasing post-operative pain for carpal tunnel release
      surgery.

      A secondary aim is to evaluate the post-operative opioid consumption of patients within these
      treatment groups. We hypothesize that opioid consumption will be decreased in the groups
      receiving IV tylenol and/or toradol for distal radius fracture surgery compared to the
      placebo group. We do not expect such a difference for the carpal tunnel release surgery
      group.
