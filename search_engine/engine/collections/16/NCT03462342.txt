    
      Women 18 years or older, who have recurrent ovarian cancer will be enrolled in this study.
      After consenting to participate in this trial, they will undergo screening process which will
      involve medical exam and blood work. If found eligible to participate in the trial, they will
      be given olaparib to be taken on all 28 days of the cycle and investigational AZD 6738 from
      days 1-7. For the first cycle, the subject will need to come in every week for lab tests and
      physical exam - this will help the treating physician determine an adverse event as soon as
      it happens. After that, patients are expected to come in every month at the end of each cycle
      (each cycle is 28 days).

      Patients will undergo scans for tumor assessments every 2 cycles and if stable disease or
      response to therapy is documented after cycle 4, imaging will continue every 3 cycles
      thereafter.
