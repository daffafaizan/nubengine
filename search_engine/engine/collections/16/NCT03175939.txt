      concomitant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. A subset of these patients has very low
      risk for distant metastasis that adjuvant chemotherapy is probably unnecessary. The
      investigators would like to know if same therapeutic effect and survival rate can be achieved
      without adjuvant chemotherapy, (i.e. less chemotherapy, same effect)
