    
      This clinical study adopts an open, randomized study methods to carry out Recombinant EC
      Allergen on small sample of healthy adults.

      24 healthy adults were included as study objects, they were randomly divided into four groups
      of different Recombinant EC Allergen dose (1, 5, 10μg/mL, maximum tolerated dose 20μg/mL, 6
      person/dose) for single arm intradermal injection, and set up two people as replacement for
      each group (one male and one female).

      Intradermal injection into one third site of healthy subjects' left or right forearm palmaris
      with 0.1ml Recombinant EC Allergen for only one time.

      The main examination items :vital signs (breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, body
      temperature ) of each volunteer at 15min, 30min, 1h, 2h, 4h, 8h, 24h, 48h, 72h, 96h after
      injection, skin reactivity (redness and/or induration) diameter of injection sites,local
      reaction ( rash, pain, itching, and skin and mucous membranes ) ,a variety of adverse
      events,routine blood,routine urine, liver and kidney function, ECG and chest X-ray films
      before and 7 days after intradermal injection .

      In phaseⅠclinical study, each person can accept only one dose, After injection of the same
      dose of a volunteer group, be sure the next injection of a volunteer at 40 minutes interval.
      Different dose groups: the next dose test should be carried on in the case of no serious
      adverse events appear in 7days after the last one volunteer's injection in a former lower
      dose group.

      Statistical analysis is performed using SAS9.3 software, and all analytic process is
      routinization.
