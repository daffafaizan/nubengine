      Primary

        -  Determine the antitumor activity of ABI-007 and gemcitabine, in terms of response rate
           in women with metastatic breast cancer.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this regimen, in terms of incidence and severity of
           observed toxic effects, in these patients.

      Secondary

      * Determine the time to disease progression and survival of patients treated with this
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ABI-007 IV over 30 minutes and
      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 43 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months.
