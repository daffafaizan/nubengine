    
      Randomized, double-blind, 2-period, placebo- controlled, crossover proof of concept study.

      Ten patients with increased bowel frequency defined as bowel frequency > 8 bowel movements in
      24 hours on at least 4 of 7 days/week and presence of high bowel frequency > 4 weeks despite
      adequate therapy for acute pouchitis or Crohn's like disease of the pouch will be randomized
      to either liraglutide or placebo treatment for 6 weeks (Period 1). Subjects will be
      randomized 1:1 to 1 of 2 treatment sequences, liraglutide-placebo or placebo-liraglutide, and
      receive either liraglutide or volume-matched placebo. After a wash-out period of at least 5
      days (the half-life of liraglutide is 11-12 hours, thus the minimal washout period of 5 days
      is equal to 10 half-life's) patients will be crossed over to the other treatment arm (Period
      2). Since high bowel frequency can result in significant malaise and dehydration, patients
      not responding to the respective therapies in period 1 may be crossed over after 4 weeks of
      therapy or in period 2 can be terminated early at week 4. The rationale behind the early
      termination is based on 2 open-label cohorts reporting the efficacy of liraglutide or
      exenatide in patients with high output ileostomies (the patient group the most comparable to
      the pouch patient population). GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy even at the lowest dose showed
      an almost immediate effect reducing the ostomy output after 1-3 days in most patients.Thus,
      patients not responding to a 4-week therapy with a GLP-1receptor agonist are highly unlikely
      to respond if the therapy would be continued.
