      resection remains the most effective method for this malignancy. As to the middle and lower
      thoracic esophageal cancer patients without upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis, the
      rational transthoracic approach either through right or left chest has not been clarified to
      date due to lack of large scale multicenter randomized trials. Although some randomized
      trials had been finished in single-center, there is no enough evidences that all lower and
      middle thoracic esophageal cancer patients should be surgically treated throuhg right chest
      approch. It is widely recognized that left thoracotomy approach(Sweet procedure) is not
      appropriate in the patients with upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis, because patients
      can benefit from the right thoracotomy approach, through which upper mediastinal lymph node
      can be dissected completely and may get a better long-term survival.Therefore,in this study,
      the enrolled patients are the middle and lower thoracic esophageal cancer patients without
      preoperative upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis by CT and/or ultrasound, and 10
      hospitals will participate this study. Through comparison in postoperative complications and
      long term outcomes as well as locoregional recurrence between the left and right apppoach,
      hopefully we can answer the question whether the right or left transthoracic procedure is the
      optimal approach for treating middle and lower thoracic esophageal cancer patients without
      preoperative upper mediastinal lymph node metastasis.
