      Peri-implant fractures of the upper and lower limb. This is a multi-center collaborative
      study seeking to obtain a big number of patients. Data collection includes previous health
      status and quality of life, which is the clinical management and treatment, as well as the
      outcome after one month, six months and one year. The investigators will be able to define
      risk factors and clinical attitudes, which influence on the patient outcome. And therefore,
      be able to establish treatment protocols and give management recommendations based on the
      observed clinical evidence to improve healing indexes, morbidity and mortality, function,
      grade of autonomy and quality of live.

      Main questions to be answered are: 1. which is the epidemiology of Periprosthetic and
      Peri-implant fractures and how are they treated in Spain, 2. Identify risk factors for
      complications and worse outcomes, 3. which is the morbidity and mortality, 4. influence of
      the fracture type and implants already placed on management and outcome, 5. influence of the
      treatment on patients' grade of independency, and 6. identified which are the risk factors
      for treatment failure.
