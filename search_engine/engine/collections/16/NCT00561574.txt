      population in the industrial countries reports difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep,
      resulting in a non-refreshing or non-restorative sleep. The majority of the insomniacs suffer
      chronically from their complaints.

      The maleic acid salt of Org 4420, code name Org 50081 (esmirtazapine), was selected for
      development in the treatment of insomnia. The first clinical trial with esmirtazapine was a
      proof-of-concept trial with a four-way cross-over design. All 3 esmirtazapine dose groups
      showed a statistically significant positive effect on Total Sleep Time (TST) (objective and
      subjective) and Wake Time After Sleep Onset (WASO), as compared to placebo.

      The current study is a 52-week safety study in elderly outpatients with chronic primary
      insomnia randomized to treatment with 1.5 mg or 3.0 mg of esmirtazapine to investigate the
      safety and tolerability of long-term treatment with esmirtazapine in elderly patients.
