    
      1. The aim of the study is to assess energy supply of bicycle ergometric load in athletes
           and untrained persons who have suffered diseases of the bronchopulmonary system
           (community-acquired pneumonia, bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and
           acute respiratory viral infections, to justify the timing of the resumption of training,
           as well as determining the volume and the intensity of physical activity in the training
           and competitive processes.

        2. In addition to a comprehensive general clinical, radiological (for community-acquired
           pneumonia) and laboratory examination, all the subjects under study will undergo special
           studies: spirography and spiroergometry, electrocardiography (ECG), and bicycle
           ergometry.

        3. The main indicators of the functional state of the cardio-respiratory system of the
           study participants are indicators of the function of external respiration and gas
           exchange, recorded in the initial state, after load and in the recovery period of 10 and
           30 minutes.

      Patients with diseases of the bronchopulmonary system will receive treatment according to
      generally accepted standards of drug treatment.
