    
      The study evaluate the effect of a membrane in polysulfone covered with vitamin E (ViE15-A,
      ASAHI Kasey, Tokyo, Japan) on the levels of oxidative stress, pro and anti-inflammatory
      cytokines and the mode and amount of death of monocytic cell lines in critically ill patients
      admitted to intensive care undergoing continuous extracorporeal dialysis (CRRT).

      This membrane will be compared with a non-vitamin E polysulfone membrane (REXEED-15A, ASAHI
      Kasey, Tokyo, Japan) and already intended for use in continuous renal support therapy.

      The current randomized study is designed to assess the effect on the levels of oxidative
      stress, pro and anti-inflammatory cytokines and the mode and amount of death of monocytic
      cell lines using ViE 15-A in comparison withe REXEED-15A.

      Precisely, will be evaluated

        1. the effect of the filter on the reduction of the plasma levels of two pro-inflammatory
           cytokines (IL-1β and IL-6) and of two anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10, IL-8);

        2. the analysis of the life modality of the monocytic cells: the patient's plasma will be
           used, incubated for 24 hours with U937 cells (monocyte precursor cells), necrosis cells
           and the percentage of apoptotic cells. The apoptotic cells will also evaluate the
           apoptotic pathway (evaluation of activated caspases) that led to cell death. The
           differences that are highlighted in the two different sampling moments become expressed
           Δ% with respect to the initial value Secondary outcomes will be to evaluate the clinical
           outcomes (haemodynamic and hematochemical parameters) in the short and long term
           deriving from the application of a membrane with vitamin E; for this reason, for the
           whole duration of the extracorporeal dialysis therapy, the same filter assigned to the
           patient at the time of enrollment will be used.

      All the other parameters of the extracorporeal treatment that can influence the results will
      be standardized; in particular, the flows will be fixed according to the dialysis dose
      criteria and re-infusion methods according to the table in the paragraph "treatment
      characteristics".
