      Dose-intensified immunochemotherapy might improve the outcome. But for patients who could not
      achieve CR after the dose-intensified induction therapy, the prognosis is poor. The DLCL002
      protocol is a total therapy which including induction therapy, rescue therapy and autologous
      stem cell transplantation. Patients eligible for the study will receive R-DA-EDOCH as the
      induction therapy and be evaluated by PET CT after the fourth cycle. Patients achieve CR at
      interim-PET(Deauville score 1-3) will receive either ASCT or the remaining 4 cycles of
      R-DA-EDOCH, while those achieve PR(Deauville score 4-5) will be rescued by two courses of
      R(2)-DHAP and then be revaluated by the second interim-PET. Patients who achieved CR+good
      PR(Deauville score 4) after the rescue therapy will be consolidated with ASCT,and those
      remain in PR(Deauville score 5) will receive other rescue treatments(including ASCT+CAR T).
