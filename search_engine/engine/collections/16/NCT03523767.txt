      saline injection or typhoid vaccine injection at the first study visit, and will then receive
      the other injection at the second study visit. All participants will undergo study procedures
      (clinical and imaging) in two separate sessions after each injection given at least 7 days
      apart (within 10-14 days).

      Baseline blood samples will be taken and vital signs will be measured. Participants will be
      asked to complete the mood questionnaires and computerized reward tasks. Then, injections of
      normal saline will be administered intramuscularly in the deltoid muscle. At 1.5h, 3h, 4h and
      6h after the injection, the subjects will complete the mood questionnaires and vital signs
      will be assessed. The computer based task will be repeated at 3h.

      Between3h and 6h after the injection blood samples will be collected for cytokines
      measurement. At 4h, a structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and Functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) will be done.

      Follow up visits/calls with the patients will be set to check their physical and mood status.
