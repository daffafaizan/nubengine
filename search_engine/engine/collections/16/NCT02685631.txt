      I. The principal objective of the RESIN registry is to evaluate response to therapy using
      objective response criteria such as modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (mRECIST) or European Association for Study of the Liver (EASL). The response criteria used
      will depend on tumor type treated and local policies as this is a registry and not a formal
      research study. Secondary criteria include overall survival, time to progression (TTP) and
      toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receiving Yttrium Y90 resin microspheres treatment as part of their overall
      oncologic management are added in the RESIN registry database to collect and document
      information including: patient demographics (gender/age), previous oncologic treatments,
      details of Yttrium Y90 resin microspheres treatment, and to track outcomes and complications.
