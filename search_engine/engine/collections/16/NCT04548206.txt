    
      Patients with MS between 0-5,5 score according to the Extended Disability Status Scale (EDSS)
      will be included in the study. The balance, gait, position sense, and muscle strength will be
      evaluated. The study was designed as a prospective, randomized controlled study. The patients
      will be randomly assigned to two groups, the "Pilates training" group, and the control group.
      Pilates training will be performed by the Pilates training group 2 times for 8 weeks under
      supervision in the outpatient clinic. The control group will be taught relaxation exercises
      and will be asked to perform the exercises 2 times for 8 weeks at home. Statistical analyses
      will be performed using the SPSS software version 15 (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA). The
      pre-training and post-training measurements of groups will be compared with the paired sample
      t-test.
