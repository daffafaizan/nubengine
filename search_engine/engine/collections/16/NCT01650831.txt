      Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection by the organism's urease activity. In the presence
      of H. pylori, the ingestion of urea, labeled with the non-radioactive isotope 13C, results in
      production of labeled 13CO2, which can be quantified in expired breath. Each test is
      performed using a test kit consisting of a 13C-urea tablet and citrica powder to be dissolved
      in tap water ("13C-urea solution"). Before and after ingestion of the 13C-urea solution,
      samples of exhaled breath can be collected using a nasal cannula for real-time analysis and
      comparison to baseline concentrations. The patient's exhaled breath is analyzed and the ratio
      between 13CO2 and 12CO2 is computed. The patient is considered H. pylori positive when the
      difference between the ratios exceeds a predefined threshold (5 delta over baseline (DOB)).
      The current device marketed by Exalenz is large and costly. Exalenz has built a smaller,
      cheaper and more reliable new generation device for this application. Equivalence is being
      demonstrated in this study.
