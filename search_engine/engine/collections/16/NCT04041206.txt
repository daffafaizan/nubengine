      40 healthy volunteers. Laser doppler examination will be adopted to assess the
      microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung meridians in the
      physiology/pathological state. In addition, by comparing microcirculation in the acupoints
      along the Heart and Lung meridians, the relative specificity of the two meridians will also
      be investigated. Primary outcomes will be blood flow curve and blood perfusion units(PU).
      Furthermore, this study will build standardized techniques and schemes for detecting the
      microcirculatory characteristics of meridian phenomenon for Heart and Lung. The results of
      this study could also provide scientific foundation for traditional meridian theories.
