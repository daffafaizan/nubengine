    
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower
      respiratory illness (LRI) in infants and children under 5 years of age worldwide. This study
      evaluated the safety, infectivity, and immunogenicity of a single dose of RSV LID cp ΔM2-2, a
      recombinant live-attenuated RSV vaccine, in RSV-seronegative infants 6 to 24 months of age.

      Participants were randomly assigned to receive a single dose of the RSV LID cp ΔM2-2 vaccine
      or placebo at study entry (Day 0).

      Participants were enrolled in the study between April 1 and October 14 (outside of RSV
      season) and remained on study until they completed the post-RSV season visit between April 1
      and April 30 in the calendar year following enrollment. Participants' total study duration
      was between 6 and 10 months, depending on when they enrolled in the study. Participants
      attended several study visits throughout the study, which may include physical examinations,
      blood collection, and nasal washes. Participants' parents or guardians were contacted by
      study staff at various times during the study to monitor participants' health.

      The study was closed to accrual early after interim data were reviewed by a subset of
      protocol team members and it was concluded that this vaccine candidate will not meet the
      criteria listed in the protocol for a good vaccine candidate. This recommendation was shared
      with the (blinded) protocol chair and the Medical Officers, as well as the Data Safety and
      Monitoring Board (DSMB), who agreed with the unblinded protocol team members' assessment. The
      targeted sample size was 33 (22 in the vaccine arm and 11 in the placebo arm). Participants
      already on study at the time of the early closing decision remained on study and completed
      the follow-up per protocol.
