      that is growing despite medical or surgical therapies are not curative. Existing treatments,
      such as the docetaxel used as part of this study, may work temporarily, but unfortunately the
      cancer continues to grow. This test drug, 177Lu-J591, is designed to seek out prostate cancer
      cells and deliver a lethal dose of radiation to the areas of cancer, but not to normal areas.
      Some of the normal organs (liver, kidney and bone marrow) do receive some radiation dose that
      is within the acceptable limits.
