      Using computerized blocks of 2 weeks, days of the week will be randomly allocated so that
      each day of the week receives one intervention (CDU) and one control day for the study
      period. The CDU involves transforming an ED bed location to a 6-chair internal waiting room
      with 2 adjacent beds assigned to act as assessment and treatment locations. Patients will
      transition between the chair and stretcher to optimize the use of ED space.
