    
      This is an observational study (in which participants identified as belonging to study groups
      are assessed for biomedical or health outcomes) to evaluate the utility of Janssen Autism
      Knowledge Engine (JAKE) in measuring clinical symptoms of ASD in children and adults with
      ASD. The study will consist of 3 cohorts of participants. For Cohort 1 and 2, there will be
      14-day Screening phase and 8-week (Cohort 1) or 10 week (Cohort 2) data collection phase
      extending from Day 0 (Baseline) to Day 56 or Day 70, respectively. For Cohort 3, the study
      will consist of a screening visit and a single testing visit, which may be combined.
      Primarily, the usability of JAKE as a system to monitor clinical outcomes in ASD will be
      assessed. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study.
