    
      Older adults aged â‰¥65 years with multisite pain who reported falling in the past year or
      current use of an assistive device were recruited from Boston area communities. Participants
      were randomized to either a Tai Chi (N=28) or a light physical exercise (N=26) program,
      offered twice weekly for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes were feasibility and acceptability of
      the 12-week Tai Chi/light exercise program. Secondary outcomes included pain characteristics
      (pain severity and pain interference), cognition (attention and executive function), physical
      function (walking speed, strength, and balance), gait mobility (singe-task and dual-task
      gait), levels of pain-related markers (C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, tumor necrosis
      factor alpha, and beta endorphin), fear of falling, and rate of falls.
