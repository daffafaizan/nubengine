      (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) exhibited severe vitamin C deficiency. Vitamin C is an
      essential co-factor for ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes, which initiate DNA
      demethylation through oxidation of 5-methylcytosine (mC) to 5-hydroxy-methylcytosine (hmC).
      In-vitro studies show that vitamin C at physiological doses added to DNA methyltransferase
      inhibitors (DNMTis), induce a synergistic inhibition of cell proliferation and enhanced
      apoptosis. These effects are mediated via a viral mimicry response recently associated with
      cancer stem-like cell death and enhanced immune signals including increased expression of
      bi-directionally transcribed endogenous retrovirus (ERV) transcripts, increased presence of
      cytosolic double stranded RNAs, and activation of an interferon inducing cellular response to
      these transcripts. Data suggest that correction of vitamin C deficiency may improve responses
      to epigenetic therapy with DNMTis. In the EVITA pilot study, the investigators include
      MDS/AML patients and explore the potential role of restoring vitamin C within the normal
      physiological range in treatment of hematological cancer with DNMTis.
