      vestibular schwannoma) is surgical resection. Complete removal of such tumor is associated
      with significant risks of hearing loss and facial paralysis whereas incomplete removal of the
      tumor is associated with significant risks of regrowth. Stereotactic radiation is a well
      accepted therapy aiming at stopping the growth of smaller acoustic neuromas before their
      sizes become large enough to cause problems. The purpose of our study is to determine whether
      the combination of subtotal resection followed by stereotactic radiation of the remnant can
      control large acoustic neuromas without the significant risks associated with complete
      resection.
