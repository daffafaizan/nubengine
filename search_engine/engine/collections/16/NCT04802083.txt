      Soliris for participants diagnosed with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-COV-2) infection with a clinical presentation consistent with COVID-19 associated organ
      injury, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome, stroke, or acute renal failure.
      Participants who qualify for emergency treatment (whether in an inpatient or outpatient
      setting) will be offered the opportunity to receive up to 7 infusions of Soliris over
      approximately 4 weeks.
