    
      This is a open-label, phase 2, single-arm, multi-center study of bevacizumab combined with
      gemcitabine and carboplatin. This treatment is for newly-diagnosed advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer (NSCLC), excluding squamous cell carcinoma. All subjects will receive 15 mg/kg
      bevacizumab every 3 weeks cycle, 1000 mg/mÂ² of gemcitabine on day 1 and 8 every 3 weeks cycle
      and carboplatin (AUC= 5 ) every 3 weeks. Carboplasm will be administered 1 hour prior to the
      gemcitabine infusion, bevacizumab will be administered 1 hour following chemotherapy
      infusion.

      Subjects will receive a maximum of 6 cycles of chemotherapy, but treatment with bevacizumab
      may continue as long as patients have no evidence of progressive disease and no significant
      treatment-related toxicities.
