    
      Subjects meeting the eligibility criteria at screening will remain in the clinic from the
      evening preceding the first day of dosing (Day - 1) of the investigational medical product
      (IMP) and check out from the clinic 24 hours after the first dose administration of the IMP
      (in the morning of Day 2). Dose administration of the IMP in the evening of Day 2 and morning
      and evening dose for Days 3 and 4 will be performed at home. The subjects will check-in again
      in the morning of Day 5 and receive the last dose administration of the IMP and stay in the
      clinic 12 hours post dose. All subjects within the same cohort will receive the same dose of
      the IMP.

      There will be 3 cohorts (dose-levels) with 8 subjects in each cohort corresponding to 24
      subjects in total. Within a cohort the subjects will be dosed in groups of 4. There will be
      24 hours between the dosing of the groups and 15 minutes between the dosing of the subjects
      in a group.

      There will be an interval of approximately at least 1-week interval between the cohorts to
      allow time for compilation and evaluation of data for the Internal Safety Review Committee
      meeting.

      Subsequent cohorts will be administered increasing doses until either the maximum tolerated
      dose (MTD) or the study maximum dose (SMD) has been reached.
