      6 months assessed by optical coherence tomography (OCT). Patients with symptomatic coronary
      artery disease without cardiogenic shock who will undergo coronary angiography and willing to
      participate in the trial will receive before the procedure a loading dose of P2Y12
      antagonists (clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor). Eligible patients who do not meet the
      exclusion criteria and for whom PCI will be considered as the appropriate form of
      revascularization will be randomly assigned to the ORSIRO or the XIENCE PRIME DES in the
      relation 1 x ORSIRO: 1 x XIENCE PRIME. All patients will receive periprocedural intravenous
      aspirin and heparin or bivalirudin. After the intervention patients will receive aspirin
      indefinitely and P2Y12 antagonists for at least 6 months. The intravascular imaging by OCT
      will be performed at the 6-8 months follow-up angiography.
