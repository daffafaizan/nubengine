      fentanyl but there is no agreement among anesthesiologists as to the best combination of
      drugs.

      The main problem with bupivacaine is that it causes hypotension (low blood pressure). When
      fentanyl is added to bupivacaine, a lower dose of bupivacaine can be used so that there is
      less of a fall in blood pressure. The main problem with fentanyl is itchiness and sleepiness.
      In the case of an emergency Cesarean section, the extra time needed to draw-up and administer
      a second medication may make a difference to the health of the baby.

      Our goal is to determine whether high dose bupivacaine (15mg) alone will produce spinal
      anaesthesia for cesarean delivery equivalent to 12mg of intrathecal hyperbaric bupivacaine in
      combination with 15ug of intrathecal fentanyl.
