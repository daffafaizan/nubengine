      patients with locally recurrent or advanced transitional cell carcinoma of the urothelial
      tract. II. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the
      disease-free and overall survival of this patient population treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior chemotherapy
      (yes vs no). Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and docetaxel IV
      over 1 hour on day 8. Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning
      on day 9 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who respond
      to treatment may undergo surgery and 6-8 weeks later receive 2 more courses of chemotherapy.
      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-40 patients who have not received prior chemotherapy and 23
      patients who have received prior chemotherapy will be accrued for this study within 2 years.
