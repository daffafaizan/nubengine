      rejection, and infections. Right now, researchers are focusing on improving immune
      suppression therapy and achieving better long-term survival of kidney transplants. One of the
      ways to try to understand what causes loss of function after many years is to find out if
      there is a genetic factor involved.

      There are a number of differences in specific genes that have been identified and are thought
      to affect transplant outcomes. Studying these gene variations (differences between people or
      differences between populations) is important in determining whether these variations are
      related to transplant outcomes and how this information can help patients achieve better
      long-term transplant survival.
