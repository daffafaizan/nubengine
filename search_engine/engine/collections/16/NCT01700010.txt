      (methotrexate, vinblastine, adriamycin and cisplatin) and GC (gemcitabine, cisplatin)
      combination chemotherapy demonstrate comparable efficacy with response rates of 45%- 50%.
      Despite the reasonable initial response to platinum based chemotherapy, median time to
      progression on first line therapy is only 7 months and median survival approximately 15
      months. There is no standard second line therapy after platinum based chemotherapy in the US
      and no survival benefit has been noted with any agent. Median progression free survival (PFS)
      is around 2 months in platinum refractory urothelial cancer (PRUC) and overall survival (OS)
      is 6 - 8 months with single agent second line therapy. Combination chemotherapy does not
      prolong overall survival. Given the dire prognosis in PRUC and the lack of efficacy of
      conventional chemotherapy, preclinical investigations and clinical research have focused on
      identification of novel molecular targets.

      Lapatnib is approved by the FDA for the treatment of breast cancer. Paclitaxel is approved by
      the FDA for the treatment of sarcoma, breast and lung cancers. Lapatinib and paclitaxel are
      not approved for advanced urothelial cancer; however, the FDA allows the use of these drugs
      in this study for research purposes.
