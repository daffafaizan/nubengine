      integrated intervention to prevent adolescent behavioral risk for human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV) and perpetration of intimate partner violence (IPV). Safe South Africa is a
      theory-driven, developmentally-tailored and gender-specific intervention designed for male
      adolescents 15-17 years of age. The research will be conducted in South Africa, a country
      with the largest HIV epidemic and some of the highest rates of IPV perpetration in the world.
      Preventive interventions are urgently needed during adolescence when risk for human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and intimate partner violence (IPV) increases exponentially.
      Yet, few behavioral interventions integrate HIV-IPV prevention and are tailored for the
      unique age and developmental needs of adolescents. We will investigate the acceptability and
      feasibility of Safe South Africa with three study aims: (1) a development aim - this aim will
      result in the creation of Safe South Africa, an integrated male adolescent preventive
      intervention for HIV risk behavior and IPV perpetration; (2) an acceptability aim - this aim
      will consist of an evaluation of the social ecology of HIV and IPV risk with a survey of
      N=100 of adolescents, and a test of the acceptability of Safe South Africa through an open
      pilot trial with N=20 male adolescents; and (3) a feasibility aim - this aim will consist of
      a randomized controlled pilot trial with 1- and 6-month follow-up in a sample of N=60 male
      adolescents to assess the feasibility and acceptability for a future fully powered randomized
      controlled trial to evaluate efficacy of the intervention.
