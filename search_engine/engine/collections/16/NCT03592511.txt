      about the study and invited to participate. Initially, 34 male workers meeting all criteria
      agreed to partake, however 27 workers completed the study. Seven volunteers quit the study
      because three disliked the blood sampling procedure, two were sent to work abroad, one left
      the workplace, and one presented gastrointestinal symptoms associated with WGPF-burger
      consumption.

      The volunteers entered a longitudinal trial consisting of two treatment periods of 4 weeks,
      separated by a third four-week wash-out period. For the first 4 weeks, they consumed one
      WGPF-burger daily, then they were washed-out and finally they consumed one control-burger
      daily during 4 weeks. They were asked to maintain their regular eating habits and lifestyle
      during the study, except for the daily intake of burgers during the treatment periods. The
      burgers were eaten in replacement of red or processed meat consumption, or in addition to
      their regular meal when it did not contain meat products. During the washout period, all
      subjects consumed their usual diet. Burger intake was supervised every day at lunch at the
      canteens of the workplaces. On weekends, participants were asked to consume burgers at home
      with their regular meals. In addition, compliance with burger consumption was carefully
      monitored by frequent calls from the dietitian.

      Blood samples were obtained at weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12 for analysis. Participants had clinical,
      nutritional, and anthropometric evaluations at the beginning and the end of the study.
