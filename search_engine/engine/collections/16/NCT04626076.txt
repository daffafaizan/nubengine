      recurrent close contact with confirmed or clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients. Recruitment
      for the registry will aim to enrol a representative distribution of HCWs on the front lines
      of diagnosing and caring for COVID-19 patients in both hospitals and community settings, as
      well as a balanced sample of HCWs receiving the most commonly administered putatively
      prophylactic drug regimens.

      The registry will collect information on a weekly basis from HCWs across a 12-week period
      following their first known exposure to confirmed or clinically diagnosed COVID-19 patients
      prior to or within 30 days after enrollment. Data collection will include the drug regimens
      being taken by the HCWs, information about their level of exposure to COVID-19 patients,
      their personal health status, and other factors such as the use of PPE which would likely
      impact their risk of developing a SARS-CoV-2 infection.

      A standard pharmaco-epidemiological inferential analysis will be conducted treating the
      registry data as a cohort with dynamic exposure to both prophylactic treatment and to
      COVID-19 infected patients and adjusting for potential confounding. Crude and adjusted
      hazards ratios will be estimated for each of the prophylactic regimens of interest and any
      observed impact on the risk of infection among HCWs based on all statistical inferential
      models will be reported
