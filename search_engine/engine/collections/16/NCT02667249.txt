      collected over two different periods: a clinical pathway in form of a paper based check-list
      (check-list group, n=118, or in form of a clinical pathway integrated into the paper based
      medical treatment and nursing documentation (integrated clinical pathway group, n=123. A
      standardized clinical pathway for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy in form of a check
      list was initially established in 2008 and evaluated during a 6-month period (August 2011
      until January 2012) at the University of Tuebingen. The integrated clinical pathway was
      evaluated during a 6-month period after an introduction phase of 2 months (November 2012
      until April 2013). The contents of both clinical pathways were identical, especially
      concerning the standardization of perioperative fluid management, perioperative monitoring,
      nutrition, analgesia, reserve medications, preoperative and postoperative examinations,
      detailed laboratory blood testing, nursing standards and planned discharge.

      Primary outcome measure was the compliance to the clinical pathway defined as an adherence of
      more than 80% to the presetted pathway items.
