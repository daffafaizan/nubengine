      and contracted position, GAITRite for spatial and temporal gait characteristics, the Ankle
      Lunge Test (ALT) to assess range of motion, and calf strength using a dynamometer. Subjects
      will then receive treatment according to which group they are randomized. Muscle stiffness,
      gait, motion and strength will be reassessed immediately following treatment at the first
      session. Four to10 days later, participants will complete the same tests and measures prior
      to treatment being administered a second time. Another 4-10 days after the second session,
      participants will complete the tests and measures one final time.
