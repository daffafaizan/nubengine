    
      This is a multi-centered, open-labeled, randomized, two parallel-arm study designed to
      compare quantitative radiation dosimetry assessments obtained during thyroid hormone
      suppression therapy with recombinant human TSH (Thyrogen速 (Registered Trademark)) and
      hypothyroidism in thyroid cancer patients preparing for post-surgical radioiodine ablation.
      The primary endpoint of this study is to identify the ratio of administered activity of
      radioiodine (131I) to deliver a targeted dose of 30,000 rad to the thyroid remnant when
      patients are euthyroid on Thyrogen速 (Registered Trademark) and hypothyroid after hormone
      withdrawal. Secondary endpoints are to identify and compare effective 131I clearance and
      cumulated activity in the whole body and blood during euthyroid and hypothyroid states.

      All adult patients with differentiated non-medullary thyroid cancer who are preparing for
      ablation therapy are eligible for participation. Patients will be randomized to one of two
      different dosing regimens of Thyrogen速 (Registered Trademark). Participants will undergo two
      131I whole body scans: one after Thyrogen速 (Registered Trademark) while taking thyroid
      hormone suppressive therapy and the second after withdrawal from thyroid hormone. 131I
      ablative therapy will be given under hypothyroid conditions at the completion of the
      dosimetry study.
