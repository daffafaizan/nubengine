      Resuscitation have made new recommendations about management of cardiac arrest. The
      intraosseous infusion was described as an alternative to the peripheral venous access, before
      the intra tracheal way for adrenaline administration. But this work doesn't specify the delay
      and the circumstance for this use: time to obtain a vascular access, number of failure,
      difficulty to obtain a venous access. Furthermore the recent improvements in intraosseous
      devices may make it relevant to compare intra osseous infusion and venous access in first
      intention in adult's cardiac arrest in view of the significant number of venous failures and
      of the subsequent delay of adrenaline administration.

      The goal of this preliminary study is to inform the delay to obtain a vascular access by
      evaluation of a current care (using intravenous infusion after one peripheral venous access
      failure) and to determine the potential failure's risk factors of venous access.

      Main objective: estimate the delay to obtain an effective vascular access (peripheral venous
      access, intra osseous infusion, central venous access) in resuscitation of adult's cardiac
      arrest by out of hospital care unit according to the international recommendations.

      Study design: monocentric prospective cohort of consecutive patients presenting with
      out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.
