      epidemic or pandemic worldwide. It spreads easily among high school students and from them to
      the rest of the community; therefore the prevention of influenza is very important.

      Experimental studies have revealed that some components of green tea can prevent influenza
      infection in vitro. In clinically, gargling with green tea catechins has been reported to
      have possibilities to preventing influenza infection in adults; however, little clinical
      evidence in teenagers has so far been existed. Based on this background, the investigators
      designed a randomized study to evaluate the clinical efficacy of gargling with green tea in
      preventing influenza infection among high school students.
