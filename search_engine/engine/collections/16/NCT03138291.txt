      Population: 32 pregnant women with sleep apnea with an apnea - hypopnea index ( AHI ) â‰¥ 10
      events / hr .

      Methodology: The mandibular advancement appliance will be used with the chip DentiTracs to
      measure adhesion. Participation in this project requires five visits to the research team,
      including 3 visits at home. Participants will be recruited and granted in obstetrics MUHC.
      The questionnaires will be filled (Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Pittsburgh sleep quality and
      functional (FOSQ)). A sleep recording (PSG type II) will be done at home to confirm the
      diagnosis. The recording equipment will be returned to the research team by mail. During the
      second visit (clinical orthodontics), dental impressions in alginate will be made. At the 3rd
      visit (clinical orthodontics), the mandibular advancement appliance will be adjusted and
      instructions will be given. A weekly phone call follow-up will be ensured during this period
      of adjustment of the appliance. The fourth visit (at home) will consist of a sleep recording
      to evaluate the effect of treatment. A questionnaire comfort / secondary effects will be
      administered. For patients who have started their participation during their second
      trimester, a sleep recording at home (4a visit) will be realized in Q3 to assess whether it
      is necessary to change the titration of the appliance. The 5th visit (orthodontic clinic)
      will be 3-6 months after delivery. Participants will fulfill all the mentioned questionnaires
      and make a sleep recording at home without the appliance. Replace the appliance in place if
      AHI> 10. During the 4th and 5th visits, anthropometric data (ie, weight), and objective
      adhesion will be taken
