      orthodontic treatment because it appears as a result of different etiological factors such as
      genetic, dental, skeletal, functional, soft tissue, and habits that play roles in its
      development. Different treatment modalities used for the treatment of an anterior open bite.
      Multiloop edgewise archwires, miniscrews, high-pull headgear, and bite blocks have been used
      for anterior open bite patients, most open bite patients characterized by increased facial
      height, class II skeletal pattern, and vertical excess in maxillary posterior teeth.

      Functional appliances, magnets, posterior bite blocks, and high pull headgear are used for
      posterior teeth intrusion. It is possible to generate intrusive force by using high pull
      headgear. Furthermore, direction of force can be changed according to the center of
      resistance of the dental units to achieve a better tooth movement control. The intrusion of
      posterior teeth will lead to decreased lower facial height by a counterclockwise rotation of
      the mandible; and improve class II skeletal relationship.

      This study was the first clinical trial, that compare the effect of high pull headgear for
      molar intrusion with the control group in adolescent patients.
