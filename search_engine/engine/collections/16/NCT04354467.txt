    
      Nephrotoxic medication-induced acute kidney injury (NTM-AKI) is a relevant yet underdiagnosed
      morbidity in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).

      Up to 87% of very low birth weight infants are exposed to at least one nephrotoxic medication
      (NTM). NTM-AKI is associated with poor short and long-term outcomes.

      Presently, no treatments exist for AKI beyond supportive care.
