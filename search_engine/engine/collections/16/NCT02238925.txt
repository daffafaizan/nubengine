    
      This study is an open-label, single-arm, Phase II, PK and pharmacodynamic (PD) trial of
      CPX-351 in patients with documented acute leukemia (AML or ALL) or MDS (IPSS score â‰¥ 1.5) and
      suitable for treatment with intensive chemotherapy. Each patient will be screened for hepatic
      impairment. Hepatic impairment will be assessed using the Child-Pugh system and only patients
      with a Child-Pugh score <7 points will be eligible for this study. Patients will receive up
      to two inductions and four consolidation courses. Patients will be monitored for safety
      (early deaths, adverse events, metabolic changes, etc.) and efficacy (response for AML, ALL,
      and MDS) while on the study.
