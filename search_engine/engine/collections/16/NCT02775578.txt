      types of coronary revascularization therapies in patients with severe coronary artery disease
      combining heart failure. We will collect the data at baseline before the therapy, as well as
      30 days, 6 months and 12 months after surgery. Using follow-up visits along with effective
      exams such as echocardiography, cardiopulmonary function mensuration and tests of serum
      markers, we will principally make a comparison of both primary and secondary outcomes, also
      quality of life among patients in these three groups.

      STUDY POPULATION About 525 patients who are diagnosed with severe CAD and HF will be
      enrolled. Severe CAD is defined as at least 2 vessel disease with each ≥50% narrowing of the
      luminal diameter shown by coronary angiography, including LAD. Those enrolled also has
      reduced cardiac systolic function (LVEF≤50%).

      STUDY DURATION It will take about 2 years to finish all follow-up visits with each patient at
      least 12 months after surgery.

      STUDY PROCESS The statistical analysis will include all the materials of each patient in
      every follow-up visit. We will describe basic characteristics and test parameters of every
      visit, comparing those in PCI, CABG and HCR group, to further investigate the prognostic
      influence of each therapeutic method.

      Data analysis will be processed by SPSS. All the analysis will be used by the 2-side test
      with 95% confidence interval, showing statistical significance if 2-side p value is less than
      0.05. The study will finally report primary and secondary outcomes, as well as changes of
      several important parameters.
