      volume nebulizers in the treatment of acute pediatric asthma exacerbations. There is also
      supporting data that the breath actuated nebulizers are also more effective than small volume
      nebulizers. The effectiveness of breath actuated nebulization compared to MDI for treating
      asthma exacerbations is less well defined.

      Metered dose inhalers with spacers are more readily available to the general population, are
      easily transportable and do not require a power source. Demonstrating equal effectiveness of
      albuterol delivery systems for treatment of acute pediatric asthma exacerbations would enable
      physicians to confidently utilize clinical encounters as opportunities to educate families on
      management of asthma exacerbations using their home appliance.
