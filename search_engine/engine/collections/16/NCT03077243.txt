      that de-intensification is efficacious in these two phase II studies. A major question is
      whether the investigators can de-intensify in patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal
      cancer who have smoking histories. The investigators' hypothesis is that genomic profiling of
      patients' tumors (specifically for p53 mutations) will help in triaging patients to
      de-intensification versus standard of care. Patients with HPV-associated OPSCC will be
      enrolled regardless of smoking history and p53 mutational status will be assessed in patients
      with a smoking history. The investigators will use the same de-intensification
      chemoradiotherapy regimen already evaluated in LCCC 1120 and 1413 in patients with
      HPV-associated OPSCC who have a minimal smoking history and in patients with a smoking
      history but with wild-type p53. Patients with a smoking history who have mutated p53 will not
      receive de-intensified chemoradiotherapy, but instead will receive standard doses. The
      hypothesis is that by using genomics in the patients with a significant smoking history, the
      investigators will better select those who can be safely de-intensified. Circulating free HPV
      DNA (cf-HPV-DNA) will also be prospectively assessed from blood samples.
