    
      The primary objective: Intense aerobic exercise (24/8 weeks) improves CVR > 20% measured by
      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) in patients with hemodynamic relevant intra- or extracranial
      stenoses by enhanced cerebral arterio- and angiogenesis.

      Secondary objectives:

      Intense aerobic exercise (24/8 weeks) leads to:

        -  an increase of Endothelial progenitor cell counts (EPCs)

        -  qualitative and quantitative changes of endothelial markers and cytokines representing
           the inflammatory activity of atherosclerosis and neovascularisation

        -  an improvement in cognitive performance and quality of life (QoL)

        -  changes of the mean vessel size and of cerebral perfusion
