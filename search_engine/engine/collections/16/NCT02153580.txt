    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety of adoptive therapy using ex vivo expanded autologous memory T cells
      (central memory T cells [Tcm] or naive and memory T-cells [Tn/mem]) that are enriched and
      genetically modified to express a cluster of differentiation (CD)19-specific, hinged
      optimized, CD28-costimulatory chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) as well as a truncated human
      epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) (CD19R[EQ]28zeta/truncated EGFR [EGFRt]+ Tcm or
      CD19R[EQ]28zeta/EGFRt+ Tn/mem) shortly following lymphodepletion for adults with
      recurrent/progressive/residual CD19 + B-cell lymphoproliferative neoplasms (non-Hodgkin
      lymphoma [NHL], chronic lymphocytic leukemia [CLL]/prolymphocytic leukemia [PLL]) and who are
      not eligible for or decline City of Hope (COH) Institutional Review Board (IRB) Protocol
      Number (No.) 13277.

      II. To determine the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) in the two Tn/mem strata (NHL;
      CLL/PLL).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To study antitumor activity of CD19R(EQ)CD28zeta/EGFRt+Tcm or CD19R[EQ]28zeta/EGFRt+
      Tn/mem (e.g., detection of CAR+ T cells, B cells, and tumor burden).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing
      enriched T cells (T-cell infusion). Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 groups based on
      disease status.

      GROUP I (NON-HODGKIN LYMPHOMA [NHL]):

      LYMPHODEPLETING REGIMEN: Patients receive a chemotherapy regimen based on disease type and
      extent of disease comprising of cyclophosphamide, bendamustine hydrochloride, fludarabine
      phosphate, etoposide.

      CELLULAR IMMUNOTHERAPY: Beginning 3-10 days later after lymphodepletion, patients receive
      autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched T-lymphocytes IV over 10-15
      minutes on day 0. Patients with relapsed, residual or progressive disease may receive an
      optional second infusion of autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched
      T-lymphocytes >= 28 days post T cell infusion.

      GROUP II (CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA [CLL] AND/OR PROLYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA [PLL]):

      LYMPHODEPLETING REGIMEN: Patients receive a chemotherapy regimen based on disease type and
      extent of disease comprising of cyclophosphamide, bendamustine hydrochloride, fludarabine
      phosphate, etoposide.

      CELLULAR IMMUNOTHERAPY: Beginning 3-10 days later after lymphodepletion, patients receive
      autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched T-lymphocytes IV over 10-15
      minutes on day 0. Patients with relapsed, residual or progressive disease may receive an
      optional second infusion of autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tn/mem-enriched
      T-lymphocytes >= 28 days post T cell infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at every 2 days for 14 days,
      weekly for 1 month, monthly for 1 year, and then yearly for at least 15 years.
