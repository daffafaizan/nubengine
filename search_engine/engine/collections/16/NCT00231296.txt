      benefits of the CryoCor(TM) Cardiac Cryoablation System for treating symptomatic paroxysmal
      atrial fibrillation (PAF) in comparison to treatment with anti-arrhythmic medications alone.
      This study also evaluates the safety profile of the CryoCor(TM) Cardiac Cryoablation System
      when used in this same setting.
