      the senior author has shifted from selected application of ADM in certain cases to routine
      use of ADM in all cleft palate cases. This study is an observational study comparing a
      prospective cohort group receiving ADM routinely to a retrospective historical cohort group
      without routine use of ADM.

      Objectives of the study:

      Primary objectives:

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether routine use of ADM would lower
      the incidence of palatal fistula in patients undergoing primary cleft palate repair.

      Secondary objectives:

        1. Incidence of wound dehiscence

        2. Incidence of wound infection

        3. Hospital length of stay
