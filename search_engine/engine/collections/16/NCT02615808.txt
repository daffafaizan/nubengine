      displays in the clinical care of patients admitted to Cincinnati Children's Hospital with
      respiratory illnesses in two clinical settings.

      In the general pediatric floor the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of
      user-centered designed data displays in the safe and efficient weaning of oxygen in general
      pediatric patients hospitalized with bronchiolitis.

      In the NICU the investigators will evaluate the effectiveness of user-centered designed data
      displays in the accurate targeting of oxygen saturation levels among premature infants.

      The investigators will address these aims by conducting parallel studies on the Cincinnati
      Children's Hospital hospital medicine (HM) unit and in the NICU comparing the data
      visualization application to standard of care. The investigators will examine intervention
      effectiveness using an adaptation of a quasi-experimental, equivalent time series design with
      randomization of intervention and control periods. The data visualization will be applied at
      the unit level and directly affect all the nurses and patients cared for in those units.
