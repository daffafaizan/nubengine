      painful ulceration recurring with varying frequency. The pathophysiology of aphthous ulcers
      remains partly understood. The primary disorder appears to be the result of activation of the
      cell-mediated immune system. Aphthous ulcers may have abnormalities in cell communication and
      epithelial integrity. The diagnosis of aphthous ulcers is primarily clinical. Aphthous ulcers
      occur on areas of nonkeratinized mucosa of the mouth particularly the buccal mucosa, the
      labial mucosa, the floor of the mouth, the ventral surface of the tongue, and the soft
      palate. The treatment of recurrent aphthous stomatitis (RAS) still remains unclear and is
      based mainly on experimental data. The purpose of therapy include the management of pain and
      functional injury by suppressing inflammatory responses, in addition to reducing the
      frequency of recurrences or keeping away from the onset of new ulcers .Zinc has been
      identified as an important factor in repair of tissue.After considerable searching zinc was
      recognized as the beneficial impurity and a effective factor in healing .The goal of this
      study is to present the efficiency of dietary zinc supplements in the rate of Recurrent
      aphthous stomatitis healing.
