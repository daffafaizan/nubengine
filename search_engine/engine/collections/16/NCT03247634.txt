      with primary care patients living in poverty, will improve cancer prevention and early
      detection activities, mediated by a shift in future orientation gained through the program.

      This pilot study aims to adapt, apply, and evaluate the established Getting Ahead program in
      a health care setting and assess its effect on cancer prevention and early detection
      activities for vulnerable populations. By generating process and outcome data on a novel
      intervention to help people advance out of poverty, this research will set the stage for
      larger intervention studies, and also will advance understanding of the mechanisms by which
      growing a future orientation can improve cancer preventive service delivery among vulnerable
      populations.

      Specifically, this study aims to:

        1. Implement Getting Ahead among cohorts of patients at a network of safety net practices.

        2. Assess the paradigm shift in developing a future orientation associated with
           participation in the Getting Ahead program.

        3. Evaluate the effect of the Getting Ahead program and its associated paradigm shift on
           graduates' cancer prevention and early detection activities.
