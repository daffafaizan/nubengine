      with CKD. This proposal will provide translational data on the role of intravenous iron to
      progression of kidney disease in patients with CKD. Comparison of IV iron with oral iron will
      allow testing the hypothesis that IVIR will generate an inflammatory response and albuminuria
      in the short-term, that will directly lead to a greater rate of fall in GFR, in the
      long-term, compared to oral iron. We hypothesize that after administration of one gram of IV
      iron over a course of 8 weeks, renal injury as documented by albuminuria (and fall in GFR)
      will be increased with IV iron sucrose therapy compared to those randomized to oral iron
      therapy. A randomized, parallel group, controlled trial will be performed. GFR will be
      measures every 6 months for two years in 200 participants by iothalamate clearances.
