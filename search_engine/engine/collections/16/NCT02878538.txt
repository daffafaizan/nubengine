      Potential MOA include reversal of aluminum (AL) toxicity, the prevention of a-beta
      aggregation, β-amyloid disaggregation, and the obstruction of microbacterial and viral
      parasitism. The latter mechanism involves augmentation of innate immunity, and disruption of
      microbacterial iron metabolism. Infectious models of AD's pathophysiology have been recently
      proposed. Iron blocks toll-like receptor (TLR) initiated anti-microbial actions mediated via
      gamma-interferon (IFN-γ) tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and
      interleukin-10 (IL-10). These biomarkers are of interest because they have also been
      associated with our novel latent dementia phenotype (i.e., "d" for "dementia") in the Texas
      Alzheimer's Research and Care Consortium (TARCC). "d" is a continuous measure of dementia
      severity that can be constructed from any cognitive battery that also includes a measure of
      Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL). Serum biomarkers might "trigger" dementing
      processes without participating in their later stages. Thus, the investigators have
      indications as to who might benefit from iron-chelation and when the intervention might be
      best applied. This knowledge may help them detect an effect of deferiprone on prospective
      change in "d" and even on MCI conversion in TARCC NHW (Non Hispanic White) subjects.
