    
      In total 300 patients with the need of platelet transfusion for whatever reason will be
      included when meeting the inclusion- and exclusion criteria.

      For all patients three visits are planned, where blood samples will be taken. The first blood
      samples will be taken directly before the start of platelet transfusion, the second 1 hour
      after the end of the platelet transfusion and the third after 24 hours.

      Untreated citrate and EDTA blood samples from Visit 1 will be serving as baseline for the
      coagulation testing. Further citrate blood samples from the first visit will be spiked with
      different concentrations of fibrinogen in vitro. Untreated citrate and EDTA blood samples
      will be taken 1 hour and 24 hours after platelet transfusion for comparison. Further citrate
      blood samples will be spiked with different concentrations of fibrinogen in vitro again 1
      hour after platelet transfusion. In addition, randomly chosen samples will be analyzed using
      confocal microscopy. Routine coagulation analysis include activated partial thromboplastin
      time (aPTT), prothrombin time(PT), fibrinogen, blood coagulation factor thirteen (FXIII),
      thromboelastometry (ExTEM & FibTEM) before and after platelet transfusion.
