      population. Adverse drug reactions (ADR) are common in this population. In elderly subject,
      prevalence of ADRs ranged from 4.3% to 63.0%. Age itself is not a risk factor for ADRs but is
      a factor of severity of ADR. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than half
      of all ADRs are considered to be preventable in elderly subjects. They are most often the
      result of a mistake during the prescription phase, or the monitoring phase, or may be due to
      poor compliance or inappropriate self-medication. Drug prescription is based on guidelines
      derived from clinical trial that have not included elderly subject with multiple
      comorbidities. Data regarding drug safety from clinical trials alone are insufficient, hence
      the need to continue the monitoring of ADR after drug marketing.

      Aim: To describe the serious ADR in elderly subjects aged over 65 years and assess their
      preventability.

      Methods: A retrospective study was conducted at the Regional Pharmacovigilance Center of
      Champagne-Ardenne (northeast of France) between January and May 2013. Patients aged over 65
      years who presented a serious ADR notified to the Regional Pharmacovigilance Center were
      included in the study.
