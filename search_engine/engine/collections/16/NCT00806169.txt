      2008. Patients were included because of DME and signs of pre- and early proliferation because
      of diabetic retinopathy.73 eyes of 56 patients were included, all of which had signed an
      informed consent to perform a pharmacosurgical procedure consisting of a 23 gauge core Pars
      Plana Vitrectomy (sutureless single stitch sclerotomy, cutter with 300 cuts/minute) with
      removement of 1.5ml vitreous and substitution with 1ml BSS, 8mg triamcinolone, and 1.25 mg
      bevacizumab. At baseline and follow-up, the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA; 6 m Snellen),
      and intraocular pressure (IOP; Goldmann tonometry), and central macular thickness (optical
      coherence tomography) were determined. In addition, the need for further treatment and
      adverse events were monitored.
