      fibrillation (AF) and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) devices are of low scientific
      evidence. The efficacy of CRT in AF patients is limited by the percentage of the effective
      biventricular paced beats (BiVp%), which should exceed 95%-98% - a goal which is seldom
      obtained by means of pharmacological rate control strategy. The only treatment strategy which
      effect is scientifically established is an atrioventricular junction ablation (AVJA) but the
      use of this method is limited.

      On the other hand, about 10% of patients with persistent forms of AF experience a spontaneous
      sinus rhythm (SR) resumption after CRT implantation. Moreover, SR resumption and it's
      maintenance by means of single external electrical cardioversion in AF patients has been
      proven feasible. A strategy of rhythm control in AF patients on CRT could provide high BiVp%
      and improve the efficacy of CRT in this group of patients.

      To show superiority of the rhythm control strategy over the rate control strategy a sample
      size of 60 patients was calculated based on following assumptions: two-tailed test, a type I
      error of 0.05, a power of 80%, efficacy (mean BiVp%) of rate control strategy 90%, efficacy
      (mean BiVp%)of rhythm control strategy 98% and 8% drop-out rate to fulfill the criteria of
      intention-to-treat analysis. Due to presumed lack of statistical power the secondary end
      points and safety endpoints will be considered exploratory.
