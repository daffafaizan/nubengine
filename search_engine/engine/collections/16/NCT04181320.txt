    
      The current study is designed to verify previous clinical findings and to pinpoint clinically
      relevant efficacy, associated to intended use of Granulox® as a therapy added to a defined
      standard of care in the management of chronic VLUs. The most relevant outcome is considered
      to be an increase in healing of chronic VLUs over a period of 20 weeks.

      This is a multi-centre European open label randomised 2-arm parallel group study. The study
      will include multiple European counties (e.g. France, Germany, UK, Poland, Croatia and Czech
      Republic), with approximately 2-7 clinics per country.

      The study will run with a two-phase set-up, with a 14 days run-in period and a an up to 20
      weeks treatment period starting with randomization and allocation of treatment. Confirmation
      of wound closure is further assessed after a 15 day followup period.

      The primary objective of the study is to compare wound healing between management of chronic
      VLUs with or without added Granulox®. The main efficacy criterion is Confirmed Complete wound
      Closure (CCC).

      Secondary objectives include comparisons of management of chronic VLUs with or without added
      Granulox® with regards to:

        -  Wound healing by means of Possible Complete wound Closure (PCC), Wound Area Regression
           (WAR), time to healing, trajectories, pressure ulcer scale for healing (PUSH) score, and
           clinical assessment.

        -  Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) for health-related quality of life (HRQoL)/quality of
           life (QoL), pain and pain intensity, and impression of change.

        -  Acceptability of and compliance to therapy.

        -  Cost-effectiveness.

        -  Safety by means of Adverse Events (AE) and Serious Adverse Events (SAE) reporting.
