      carcinomas usually undergo re-irradiation. However prognosis of these patients is
      unfavourable, especially for non-human papilloma virus associated cancers. Moderate whole
      body hyperthermia will be performed by water-filtered IR-A-radiation using a Heckel-HT3000
      device.

      Preclinical data have indicated that moderate whole body hyperthermia decreases intratumoral
      interstitial fluid pressure and leads to increased perfusion of the tumor. The study
      investigates if this holds also true in patients and leads to a marked decrease of tumor
      hypoxia, measured by 18F-Fluoromisonidazole PET.

      The Primary aim of the study is feasibility, defined as 80% of patients completing at least
      four applications of hyperthermia.

      Secondary endpoints include an increase of Tumor Perfusion by the use of hyperthermia,
      measured by magnetic resonance Imaging during week two of Treatment and reduction of Tumor
      hypoxia, measured by hypoxia specific Positron emission tomography.
