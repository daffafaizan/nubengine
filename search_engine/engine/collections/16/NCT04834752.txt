      prevention of COVID-19 have reported inconsistent findings. This study aimed to evaluate the
      effect of H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors on the clinical outcomes and
      positivity rates of COVID-19 using the Korean National Health Insurance (NHI) data. This is a
      retrospective cohort study using the NHI COVID-19 dataset, which includes health insurance
      data of individuals who underwent COVID-19 PCR test in South Korea. This study aims to
      evaluate the effect of the use of PPI and H2RA on the positivity rates and clinical outcomes
      of COVID-19.
