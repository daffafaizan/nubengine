      excluding third molars were included in this study. Subjects were divided into normal birth
      (NB) and PLBW groups on the basis of their pregnancy outcome. Women who delivered an infant
      with a birth weight of more than 2500 g after 37 weeks of gestation were placed in the NB
      group. Women who delivered infants whose birth weight was below 2500 g or before 37 weeks of
      gestation were placed in the PLBW group. Current/past tobacco user, alcohol abuse, history of
      high-risk gestation, hypertension, gestational diabetes, any systemic disease and placenta
      previa were the exclusion criteria for this study. Maternal, obstetric, and demographic
      factors such as maternal age, maternal education, regular prenatal care, genitourinary tract
      infections during pregnancy, total number of births, previous PLBW, and antibiotic use during
      the pregnancy period were also recorded.
