      intermittent claudication (IC) and is documented to be effective, especially when supervised.
      However, wide scale introduction of supervised ET in the Netherlands would lead to a
      substantial increase of health care costs compared to current practice, while the
      cost-effectiveness of supervised ET is uncertain. ET follows a pattern of short walking
      periods that induce discomfort of moderate intensity and short rest periods. The
      psychological, metabolic, and mechanical alterations that occur during exercise stimulate an
      adaptive response that ultimately reduces the symptoms. The optimal therapy regimen depends
      to a large extent on home-based exercises, which require discipline from the patient.
      Currently, the main prescription for ET for patients with IC in the Netherlands is a single
      'go home and walk' advice, without supervision or follow-up. There is no evidence to support
      the effectiveness of this advice and compliance is low. In studies comparing the 'go home and
      walk' advice to supervised ET, a large advantage for supervised ET was present. The
      inadequate use of the main conservative treatment for peripheral arterial disease (PAD)
      contributes to a gradual progression of this condition, a decrease in quality of life, and an
      increasing number of vascular interventions. Furthermore, with adequate ET, hypertension,
      hypercholesterolemia, overweight, and diabetes, if present, is better regulated.
