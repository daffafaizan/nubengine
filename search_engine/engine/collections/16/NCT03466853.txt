    
      Within the 1st 48 hours of birth, all live born, singleton neonates with gestational ages
      between 28-40 weeks will be included in the study after obtaining an informed consent from
      their legal guardians.

      Assessment of malnutrition within 48 hours of birth:

        1. Anthropometric indices:

           Weight (using the infant weighing scale). Length (using the infant measuring board).
           Head circumference (using non-metallic non-stretchable tape).

        2. Proportionality indices:

           MAC/HC ratio (Calculation for each infant and value will be plotted on and compared with
           a standard curve). Ponderal index Body mass index

        3. Clinical assessment of nutritional status (CANS) score:

      A total score <25 is considered as fetal malnutrition. 3. Detection of early neonatal
      morbidities within the first week of life (for those who will require NICU admission):

        1. Hypoglycemia (Random blood sugar)

        2. Polycythemia (Hematocrit level)

        3. Respiratory Distress Syndrome

        4. Neonatal sepsis (Clinically, Laboratory: CBC with diff., CRP, C/S)

        5. Hyperbilirubinemia (Serum bilirubin level, Need of phototherapy or exchange transfusion)

        6. Feeding intolerance (Abdominal distension with prominent intestinal loops, Gastric
           residue more than 3ml/kg before feeding at least 2 times/ day)
