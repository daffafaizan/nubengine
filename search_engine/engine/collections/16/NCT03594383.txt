      point-of-care. The true potential of these novel diagnostics to improve global pediatric
      pneumonia outcomes will only be realized if they can be employed by CHWs in community
      settings in LMICs. No work has yet focused on the performance of POCUS by
      non-medically-trained CHWs in LMICs. Demonstrating that accurate POCUS performance and
      interpretation can be achieved by non-medically-trained CHWs after focused and succinct
      training is the first step towards developing a novel pediatric pneumonia diagnosis and
      management algorithm for LMICs. Feedback from these ultrasound-na√Øve users about their lung
      POCUS learning experience is also needed to clarify which POCUS findings would be best suited
      to this algorithm.

      The research team in AKUH will recruit and consent interested CHWs from AKU field sites in
      Karachi. The target is to recruit a convenience sample of 3 CHWs, who will be as
      representative as possible of the experience and skill sets as the average CHW in a
      government program. Study participants will be identified and approached by clinical team
      members in the AKUH emergency department, outpatient clinic and pediatric ward.

      Triaging children with ARI into accurate treatment categories will lead to increased
      paediatric pneumonia survival, improved antibiotic stewardship, and more appropriate resource
      use, all of which are clinically and programmatically significant in highest disease burden
      settings. This project also lays the foundation for future projects that harness the
      trans-formative potential of POCUS for global child health.
