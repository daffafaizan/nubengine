      gamma-aminobutyrate (GABA) and glutamate systems. Nitric oxide donors which increase NO
      levels at the cellular level could improve N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor dysfunction.
      Using L-arginine could bypass the blocked NMDA receptors and improve the therapeutic efficacy
      by reversing the dysfunction.

      The investigators proposed that using L-Arginine, a dietary supplement in most cultures,
      might constitute a safe option as an add-on treatment which may display beneficial effects on
      positive, negative, cognitive and affective symptoms associated with schizophrenia.
