      progressively with time as compared with those in the supine position. Excessive fluid
      infusion may further increase intraocular pressure and optic nerve sheath diameter. Pulse
      pressure variation (PPV) is a dynamic index which can effectively assess fluid responsiveness
      during general anesthesia.Therefore,the investigators have designed a study to compare the
      effect of different fluid volume infusion guided by low and high PPV indices on intraocular
      pressure and optic nerve sheath of patients undergoing prone spine surgery with general
      anesthesia. One group of the patients will receive relatively loose fluid infusion (target
      value of PPV: 6%-9%),while the other group of the patients will receive limited fluid
      infusion (target value of PPV: 13%-16%).
