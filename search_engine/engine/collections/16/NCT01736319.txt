      falciparum malaria worldwide. In Western Cambodia,artemisinin resistance has been defined as
      a long half-life of parasite clearance (T1/2) in response to an artemisinin, given orally for
      uncomplicated malaria. We hypothesize that this artemisinin resistance phenotype compromises
      the efficacy of ACTs. The primary objective of this study is to compare P. falciparum
      recrudescence rates in Western, Northern and Eastern Cambodia, following
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) treatment. The secondary objective of this study is
      to determine whether parasite recrudescence is associated with long T1/2. In the Parasite
      Recrudescence Study, patients with uncomplicated malaria will receive directly-observed
      treatment with DHA-PPQ over 3 days. We will follow these patients weekly for 9 weeks to
      identify those with recurrent parasitemia and use genotyping methods to distinguish
      recrudescences from reinfections. We will enroll a subset of these patients who have an
      initial parasite density greater than or equal to 10,000/microL in the Parasite Clearance
      Rate Study and follow their parasite densities more intensively by examining 6-hourly finger
      prick blood samples until parasites are undetectable by microscopy. With these data we will
      calculate and compare T1/2 values from patients with and without recrudescent parasitemia.
      Using various laboratory assays, we will also explore the contribution of host factors to
      T1/2 variation, and whether naturally-acquired immunity reduces the risk of drug-resistant
      parasite recrudescence.
