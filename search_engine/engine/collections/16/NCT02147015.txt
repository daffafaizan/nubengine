      clinical outcomes. However, the optimal doses of glucocorticoid for each individual patient
      has not been determined. According to GOLD Report 2014, a dose of 40 mg prednisone per day
      for 5 days is recommended (Evidence B), although there are insufficient data to provide firm
      conclusions concerning the optimal duration of corticosteroid therapy of acute exacerbations
      of COPD. The purpose of the current study is to compare clinical outcomes of personalized or
      fixed dose of glucocorticoid in patients with acute exacerbations of COPD.
