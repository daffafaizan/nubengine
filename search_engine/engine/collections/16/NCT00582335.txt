      the United States. In 1997, approximately 130,000 men and woman were diagnosed with
      colorectal cancer (fourth most common cancer site) and approximately 55,000 died of this
      disease (second most common cause of cancer deaths); (Cancer Facts & Figures, 1997).

      Genetic factors clearly contribute to the etiology of colorectal cancer. Because there is
      evidence to suggest genetically determined susceptibility to colorectal cancer exists in a
      proportion of newly diagnosed cases each year, we are conducting a study to identify new
      genes that are associated with an increased susceptibility to familial colorectal cancer by
      analysis of families with a clustering of colorectal cancers.
