      strategy is to reduce the complications of embolic stroke and heart failure. Among these
      patients, a group of them will choose to have "rate control" based on the heart conditions
      and the preference of the patients. The strategy is to control the ventricular rate by drugs
      to prevent the heart from failure. However, when the physicians attempt to do so, they
      encounter two questions: how much is the optimal drug dose? And what is the best marker we
      are looking to? To answer these questions, the investigators design a prospective, cross-over
      study to explore this issue. The participants will do cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET)
      before and after treatment. They will receive another CPET if drug dose is titrated up. With
      the study, the investigators will understand whether a resting heart rate can be a good
      marker for optimal drug dosage, and what is the optimal range of heart rate the physicians
      should target.
