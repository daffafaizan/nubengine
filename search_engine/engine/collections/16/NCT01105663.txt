      project will use sophisticated modeling and simulation techniques to evaluate the impact of
      genetics and other variables such as degree of illness, age, weight and organ dysfunction on
      the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of morphine and midazolam in children who are
      mechanically ventilated for respiratory failure, and require sedation. This proposed work
      will allow the design of a pharmacologic model that can be used to individualize therapy in
      children requiring mechanical ventilation with the goal of optimizing sedation while
      minimizing the duration of mechanical ventilation. This study will provide data that may
      allow for improved dosing recommendations in this critically ill population of children.
