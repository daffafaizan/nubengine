    
      This is a 16-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of Folate 2mg plus B12
      400mcg, as an adjunctive therapy in approximately 240 consecutive outpatients with
      schizophrenia from Amanuel Hospital, which is based at Addis Ababa, Ethiopia will be enrolled
      and screened for eligibility. The goal is to randomize and complete 200 subjects from the 240
      enrolled. A Sequential Parallel Design for Double-Blind Phase will be utilized. During the
      first phase of double-blind adjunctive treatment, eligible patients (n=200) are randomized to
      adjunctive treatment with either folate and vitamin B12 (n=60) or placebo (n=150), with a
      2:3:3 ratio for random assignment to the treatment sequences drug/drug (DD; n=70),
      placebo/placebo (PP; n=70), and placebo/drug (PD; n=75), while all continue to receive their
      antipsychotic agent for the entire duration of the study. Assuming a 10% drop-out rate during
      the first phase, 126 patients on placebo will complete the first 56-day phase, and 54
      patients on folate and vitamin B12 will complete the first 56-day phase.
