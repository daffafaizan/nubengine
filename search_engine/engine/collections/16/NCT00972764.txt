      self-limited disorder. It is the most common cause of stridor in newborns and infants. It
      results from an abnormal prolapse of supraglottic structures during inspiration. Despite its
      widespread prevalence, the etiology of laryngomalacia is unclear. Most infants will squeaky
      but otherwise well. Although affected patients do not exhibit much in the way of other
      physical symptoms, the unusual voice is worrisome to their parents.
