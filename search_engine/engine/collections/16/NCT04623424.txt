      relapse. There is increasing evidence that use of antibiotics may have a detrimental impact
      on intestinal microbiota composition and, consequently, the outcome of SCT.However, effect on
      different antibiotic prophylaxis regimens and broad-spectrum antibiotics used during
      transplant and the intestinal microbiota composition and hence adverse outcomes are not
      known. Stool samples will be collected from patients who are undergoing SCT at:

        1. preconditioning

        2. at day 0 (stem cell infusion)

        3. once in the period of day + 7-10 post SCT

        4. once first day or second day of BMT OPD clinic visit

        5. once if they develop >=grade I GVHD

        6. once at time of recovery from GVHD
