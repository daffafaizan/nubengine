      a woman's body and its effect on ending preterm (early) labor contractions and delaying
      delivery by at least 48 hours. The study will also look at the effects of genes (materials
      passed from parent to child that determine the make-up of the body) and other characteristics
      (for example mother's age, baby's age, race, and other diseases or drugs) on the ability of
      nifedipine to end the contractions. We will use this information to decide what amount of
      nifedipine women need to best treat preterm contractions. This study will also examine the
      effect of pregnancy on how fast nifedipine is removed from the woman's body.

      This study will be conducted on two phases. The first will study women who are starting
      nifedipine for treatment of preterm labor. Nifedipine dose will be determined by the
      patient's physician. Blood samples will be obtained from the mother to determine the
      concentration of nifedipine and its metabolite, oxidized nifedipine, during one dosing
      interval. A blood sample will also be obtained for DNA isolation to examine variants in genes
      involved in the nifedipine pathway. We will also collect data on uterine contractions and
      blood pressure through clinical monitoring. After delivery, maternal and umbilical cord blood
      samples will be obtained, along with a piece of placenta. Women who take part in the first
      phase will be asked to return 6-10 weeks after delivery. At that time, she will take a single
      dose of 10 mg immediate release nifedipine by mouth and blood samples will be collected for
      up to 6 hours. Blood pressure will also be monitored prior to collection of each blood sample
