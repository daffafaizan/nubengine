      (UTB and TB) with the guidance of virtual bronchoscopic navigation (VBN) combined with
      endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) for peripheral pulmonary lesions (PPLs) without X-ray
      fluoroscopy. The study is designed as a prospective, multicenter, randomized controlled
      clinical trial. The participating centers are The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou
      Medical University, Cancer Hospital Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, West China Hospital,
      Sichuan University, and Henan Provincial People's Hospital. Patients are divided into three
      groups: UTB-VBN-EBUS group, TB-VBN-EBUS-GS group and TB-VBN-EBUS-non-GS group. Each subject
      will be randomized to each group. The study is expected to enroll a total of 577 patients
      with 193, 192 and 192 in UTB-VBN-EBUS group, TB-VBN-EBUS-GS group and TB-VBN-EBUS-non-GS
      group, respectively.
