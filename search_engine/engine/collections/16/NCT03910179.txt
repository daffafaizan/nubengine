      hypotension after induction of general anesthesia is a common event and may contribute to an
      adverse outcome. Dynamic arterial elastance has been proposed as a functional parameter of
      arterial tone and studies showed that it was able to predict pressure response to fluid
      administration in fluid-responsive patients and the amount of mean arterial pressure
      riduction as a conseguence of noradrenaline dose reduction in critically ill patients.
