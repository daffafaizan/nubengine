    
      This is a prospective study. Patients will be evaluated for the presence of external
      anogenital warts in our clinic. Biopsy will be performed if patients have genital lesions
      consistent with genital warts of the external genitalia or perianal area. All patients will
      be provided with an informed consent for the excision biopsy procedure, before performing the
      biopsy of the lesion. Biopsy specimens will be held in a formol 10% solution and will be sent
      to the pathologist. A portion of each sample will be processed for histological analysis,
      which will be performed by one pathologist. The remainder of each specimen will be saved to
      extract DNA for PCR analysis. All biopsies will be analyzed by the same pathologist who will
      confirm the histology of the lesion. A part of the specimen will be kept frozen and if the
      biopsy confirm genital warts by histology; then the specimen will be analyzed by PCR for the
      presence of DNA HPV 6 and 11. The PCR analysis will be done by microarrays. Detection is
      performed in a subtype of array platform system which detects the different types of virus.
      The reports will be as undetectable / detectable and type.

      The study will be conducted in the Institute of Gynecology and Fertility (Institute
      affiliated with the School of Medicine - University of Buenos Aires).
