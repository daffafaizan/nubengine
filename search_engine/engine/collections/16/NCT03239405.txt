      callibrated system in laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy. We will be looking at OR time and
      staple usage. This study is not affecting the treatment of the patients in any way. The
      surgeons would be using the devices regardless of the study. We are simply looking at
      procedure information after the fact.
