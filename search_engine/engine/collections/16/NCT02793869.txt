      treatable childhood blindness worldwide1. CC patients have a wide range of presentations of
      lens opacities and are generally categorized into several groups based on the etiologies,
      anatomical positions, or shapes of lens opacities. Cataractous eyes of CC patients are also
      frequently complicated with other anterior segment abnormalities due to their close
      anatomical relationships and similar developmental origins. Lens opacities in different
      positions may be related to specific anterior segment abnormalities; for example, anterior
      polar cataracts are associated with greater corneal astigmatism (CA). However, no studies
      have systematically related the position of lens opacities to specific anterior segment
      abnormities, mainly due to the small number of CC patients, a lack of proper equipment, and a
      lack of awareness of these important relationships.

      Using the largest CC database in the Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center (ZOC), the current study
      compared the anterior segment characteristics of CC patients with lens opacities in different
      positions and further proposed a modified CC category system based on the specific
      relationships between the position of lens opacities and anterior segment characteristics.
      Knowledge of these relationships is beneficial for further understanding of CC occurrence and
      development and has clinical significance for CC diagnosis and treatment.
