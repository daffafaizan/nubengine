      falls. Fall screening, performed with the Norwegian version of the risk assessment tool for
      falls in elderly "STRATIFY (score 0 - 5), is the main tool. In patients with a score of 2 or
      more, a comprehensive individual plan for fall prevention has been worked out for each
      patient with risk of fall, documented in the medical records, and communicated to the staff
      responsible for the patient. The plan includes practical initiatives like adjusting the beds,
      proper illumination, instructions not to leave the bed unaided, and appropriate shoes. There
      are also long-term measures like the treatment of underlying diseases, changes in medication
      associated with risk of fall, physical training, and healthier dietary habits. During the
      intervention, the process is measured and reported to the national campaign. The national
      intervention was designed for use in hospitals, care facilities and patients living at home.
      Most of the proposed activities aim at preventing falls in a long time perspective.
