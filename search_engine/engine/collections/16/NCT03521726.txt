      (5mg/1ml/amp), the vital signs will be closely monitored by physiological monitor (PHILIPS
      SureSigns VM6). The treatment will be terminated immediately if unstable vital sign detected
      or if patient asks for termination. Patients will receive test for UFT300 to evaluate H.
      pylori colonization in the gastric cardia. With endoscope apparatus, the gastric mucous is
      irrigated with acetylcysteine solution and the pH value of gastric juice will be measured
      with the pH test strips before irrigation and after irrigation. The investigators dispense
      medicaments containing Amoxicillin powder in the capsule (3 gm) on the surface of gastric
      mucosa and duodenal mucosa of duodenal bulb as evenly as possible. After the intraluminal
      therapy, patients will rest for 30 to 60 minutes and go home if the effect of sedation
      subsided. Patients can take meal if no abdominal discomfort. C13-Urea breath test (UBT) will
      be used to assess the existence of H. pylori 6 weeks after the intraluminal therapy. Patients
      fail to achieve intraluminal eradication of H. pylori will be assigned to the oral antibiotic
      rescue therapies with High-dose PPI-amoxicillin dual therapy (rabeprazole 20 mg and
      amoxicillin 750 mg 4 times/day) for 14 days. C13-UBT will be used to assess the existence of
      H. pylori 6 weeks after the rescue therapy. Overall eradication rates after the first line
      intraluminal therapy and the oral antibiotics rescue therapies will be evaluated.
