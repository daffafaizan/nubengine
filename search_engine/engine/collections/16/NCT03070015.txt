    
      A randomized, controlled, parallel study design with two parts (Part A and Part B). Study
      visits include Screening, Randomization, and Weeks 1, 2, 3 and 4. Week 4 serves also as the
      closeout study visit for Part A. Subjects randomized to the intervention group (i.e.,
      Nutrisystem group) will continue the program for an additional 8 weeks, and include
      additional study visits at week 8 and 12.

      Eighty-four (N=84) healthy men and women, matched paired for BMI, will be randomized into one
      of two groups for 28 days (4 weeks): Nutrisystem program or a self-directed Dietary
      Approaches to Stop Hypertension ("DASH"). All subjects in the Nutrisystem group who complete
      Part A will continue on the Nutrisystem program for an additional 8 weeks (Part B).

      Daily energy intake targets for each group will include a 1000 kcal/day diet for both women
      and men during the first week. After the first week women will follow a 1200 kcal/day diet
      and men will follow a 1500 kcal/day diet. Subjects with BMI > 40 will add approximately 200
      additional calories to their diet each day.

      Body weight and body circumference (Waist, Hip, Chest, Arm & Thigh and Sum of the 5) measures
      were obtained at baseline and weeks 1, 2, 3, 4 (Part A). And at weeks 8 and 12 for the
      Nutrisystem group (Part B).
