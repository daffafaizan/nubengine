      negatively affects the potential for proper healing. Without adequate sleep, the production
      of anabolic steroids and inflammatory cytokines are diminished. These anabolic steroids and
      inflammatory cytokines play a key role in postoperative healing, resulting in adequate pain
      regulation and increased patient satisfaction. Therefore adequate sleep quality is important
      not only for quality of life, but for postoperative healing. A recent systematic review
      revealed that some studies reported varying degrees in both the time and magnitude of change
      in return to adequate sleep quality following rotator cuff repair. This study hopes to
      address this gap in the literature by investigating a novel sleep aid, SlumberCurve, and its
      effect on sleep quality and night-time pain relief. SlumberCurve is a Class I Medical Device
      and is currently advocated to relieve tension and diminish pain in patients undergoing
      rotator cuff repair surgery. The device provides adjustable elevation of the torso as well as
      concave positioning, placing the shoulder in a more forward position. This novel sleep aid
      has the potential to increase sleep quality, and therefore enhance both patient satisfaction
      and postoperative recovery from rotator cuff repair surgery.
