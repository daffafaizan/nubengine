      different focus points. One early experimental study found that stone disintegration is
      better with small focusing points than larger focusing points. Nevertheless, these findings,
      in terms of the efficacy of stone disintegration, need to be validated in-vivo. Furthermore,
      the effect of focal size on renal injury during SWL need to be studied as well. Therefore,
      the objectives of this study are to compare the effect of using the narrow focus of 2mm (F1)
      versus the wide focus of 8 mm (F3) on the Stone Free Rate (SFR) following SWL for renal
      stones 1-2cm and estimating renal injury effect of F1 vs. F3 by urinary renal injury markers
      such as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) for assessment of proximal and
      distal renal tubules injury & Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM-1) for assessment of proximal
      renal tubules injury).
