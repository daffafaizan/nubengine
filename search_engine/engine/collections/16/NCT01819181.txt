      of this study is to collect 'real-world' data regarding the clinical utility of all
      commercially available Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) devices for
      percutaneous aortic valve implantation in female patients with severe Aortic Stenosis (AS)
      requiring treatment. Data collected in this study will provide additional information on the
      understanding of the safety and device performance in a 'real-world' setting and how to best
      treat patients with severe AS. This will include Quality of Life questionnaires (KCCQ).
