      studies of choroidal melanoma to improve the screening of biopsy samples of choroidal
      melanoma through cytogenetic analysis. Our goal is to identify molecular probes that
      specifically target regions of chromosomes that undergo changes characteristic of metastatic
      choroidal melanoma.
