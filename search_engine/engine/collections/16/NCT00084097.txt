    
      Eosinophilic gastroenteritis (EG) is characterized by eosinophilic infiltration of the bowel
      wall, gastrointestinal symptoms, and in more than 50% of patients, peripheral eosinophilia.
      Approximately one half of EG patients have multiple food allergies and/or elevated
      immunoglobulin E (IgE), suggesting an allergic etiology. The purpose of this study is to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of humanized monoclonal anti-IgE antibody, omalizumab
      (Xolair (Registered Trademark)), in eosinophilic gastroenteritis. Omalizumab is approved for
      use in asthma and is dosed subcutaneously based on serum total IgE level and body weight,
      with a maximum dose of 375 mg every 2 weeks. Subjects with EG, and either food
      hypersensitivity or environmental allergies will be admitted to the Clinical Center. All
      subjects will undergo a thorough clinical evaluation, including endoscopy. The primary
      endpoints will be the evaluation of safety of omalizumab and its efficacy in reducing
      peripheral blood absolute eosinophil count. In addition, the following secondary endpoints
      will be studied: symptom scores, study drug pharmacodynamics, and tissue eosinophilia. Blood
      cells and serum will be collected and evaluated in the laboratory to address issues related
      to the immunopathogenesis and treatment of EG. This study will provide a better understanding
      of inflammatory and allergy mediators in the pathogenesis of EG and may provide a potential
      therapy for EG. Following subcutaneous administration of the initial dose of omalizumab
      (maximum 375 mg), subjects will be followed as inpatients for a minimum of 24 hours to
      monitor for adverse effects. Subsequent doses will be administered biweekly for a total of 8
      doses.
