      pre-treatment (4 per group). The initial cohort will receive pre-treatment with cromolyn
      sodium. Subjects will be followed for 2 weeks for safety and tolerability, undergo a 2 week
      washout period and then be assigned to the alternative treatment (i.e., subjects who received
      cromolyn sodium prior to PUL-042 inhalation solution will not receive pretreatment) and then
      followed for an additional 2 weeks.

      Subsequent cohort will receive pre-treatment with albuterol sulfate in a like manner.
