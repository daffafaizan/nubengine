      transseptal approach, and is intended to reduce mortality and adverse event rates in selected
      patients for whom surgical options are not feasible.

      Innovation: A truly trans femoral, trans venous delivery of the prosthetic mitral valve which
      minimizes procedural risk. The Cardiovalve Implant features a dual nitinol frame for robust
      radial strength with decoupling of the atrial flange and ventricular portion which contains
      24 grasping legs designed for atraumatic anchoring of the device to the native mitral
      annulus. Valve leaflets are made of bovine pericardium. The Cardiovalve implant has a very
      low left ventricle (LV) protrusion footprint thus reducing the risk of LV outflow tract
      obstruction and/or interference with the LV. The Cardiovalve delivery system (DS) is designed
      for transfemoral delivery of the Implant with transseptal access to the left atrium. The
      catheter assembly is used to center the implant relative to the native mitral valve plane and
      align it with the left ventricual apex-to-base axis. After valve implantation, the delivery
      system is withdrawn.
