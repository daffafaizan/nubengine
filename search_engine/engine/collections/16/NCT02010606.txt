    
      This phase I study for patients with either newly diagnosed or recurrent glioblastoma with
      minimal residual tumor utilizes a dendritic cell vaccine consisting of autologous dendritic
      cells that have been pulsed with a lysate derived from an allogeneic glioblastoma stem-like
      cell line cultured under neurosphere-forming conditions.

      Patients will receive a series of four vaccines given weekly during the Induction phase,
      followed by vaccinations every 8 weeks during the Maintenance phase for as long as patients
      remain on the study or until the vaccine supply is depleted. In addition to the investigative
      treatment, patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will receive standard temozolomide
      chemotherapy and radiation treatment, with the Induction phase beginning at the conclusion of
      radiation. Patients with recurrent glioblastoma will not receive treatment other than the
      investigative treatment, unless they were previously treated with bevacizumab, in which case
      they will be allowed to continue receiving bevacizumab.
