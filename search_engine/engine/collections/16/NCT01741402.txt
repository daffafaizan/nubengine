      Nintendo Wii Fit-based and the other traditionally-based without the use of a gaming system,
      on balance, gait, functionality and cognition ability in older adults. It is a prospective,
      single blinded, randomized clinical trial performed at Center of Research of the courses of
      Speech Therapy, Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy of SÃ£o Paulo University. Thirty-two
      older adults are randomly in control and experimental group, 16 each one. Both groups
      performed 14 training sessions, twice a week, for seven weeks. Each session is composed of a
      30 minute-global-exercise series including stretching, muscle strength and axial mobility
      exercises. After this, both groups performed more 30 minutes of balance training: the control
      group performed balance exercises without external cues, visual or auditory feedbacks or
      cognitive stimulations; the experimental group performed the balance training with 10 Wii Fit
      games which stimulated motor and cognitive functions. The main outcome measures are: (1)
      Mini-BESTest of Dynamic Balance Evaluation; (2) Dynamic Gait Index (DGI); (3) Montreal
      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA); and (4) Falls Efficacy Scale - International (FES-I).
