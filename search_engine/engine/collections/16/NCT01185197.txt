    
      This is a prospective, open-label, randomized study in which patients who present for the
      first time with a clinical diagnosis of idiopathic MCNS proven on renal biopsy will be
      assigned to either conventional standard-dose prednisolone monotherapy or myfortic combined
      with low-dose prednisolone treatment for 6 months. Clinical response and relapse rates within
      6 months of treatment cessation will be the main outcome parameters.
