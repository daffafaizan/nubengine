      infusions, in combination with radiotherapy, to patients with advanced malignancies.

      II. Characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics of LErafAON after IV infusion.

      III. Assess in vivo inhibition of Raf-1 protein by LErafAON.

      IV. Determine efficacy in radiated and non-radiated tumors.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This study is a traditional Phase I MTD study. Cohorts of at least three
      patients will be entered at escalating dose-levels. Patients will receive daily IV infusions
      of LErafAON for 2 weeks (total of 10 doses). Each cohort will be observed for at least two
      weeks post treatment with study medication to allow for observation of toxicity before the
      next cohort is enrolled. Dose escalation will proceed until the MTD is identified. Dose
      escalation within a patient will not be allowed.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 27 patients; at least 3 per dose level, expanded to 6 if
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) occurs.
