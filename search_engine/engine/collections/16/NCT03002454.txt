    
      This clinical trial will be a comparison of diagnostic and imaging equivalency of 99mTc
      Pertechnetate intravenous injection (labeled with commercial MDP kits) produced by a
      non-fission sourced/solvent generator and a nuclear reactor/column sourced generator. Each
      oncologic participant acts as their own control to reduce error variance.

      Condition Intervention Phase Oncologic indication for which a bone scan would normally be
      indicated. Participant having recently had a bone scan using Technetium (99mTc) Medronate
      Injection USP labeled with 99mTc derived from fission-sourced 99Mo. Drug: Technetium (99mTc)
      Medronate Injection USP labeled with 99mTc derived from neutron-activation-produced 99Mo.
