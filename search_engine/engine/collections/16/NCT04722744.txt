      randomly assigned into two parallel groups. both groups will receive two posterior implants
      based on planned implant positions and then one group will receive screw retained CAD CAM
      restoration with conventional impression technique while the second group will receive
      screw-mented CAD CAM restoration based on planned implant positions.
