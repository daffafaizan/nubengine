      treatment of lower extremities. Osteoarthritis, also called joint failure, is a common
      rheumatic joint disease often affecting the hipjoint, contributing to pain, decreased
      mobility and loss of function. Individuals with osteoarthritis can also be affected in many
      other ways, e.g. economically, socially and emotionally.

      Chiropractic care may be considered as a complement to the conventional allopathic treatment
      of hip osteoarthritis. Joint manipulation is a well-established treatment technique to
      restore optimal joint function of the locomotor system. The aim of the study is to explore
      the effects of chiropractic vs. continued conventional care (waiting list controls) on pain
      and function during a three week trail period among patients with hip osteoarthritis waiting
      for arthroplasty.
