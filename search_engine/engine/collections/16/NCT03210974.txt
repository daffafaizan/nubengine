      study in which the clinical decisions concerning the optimal strategy in the treatment of the
      disease for each patient have been taken independently and prior to the physician's decision
      to include patient data in this registry, in keeping with the drug information, local
      treatment guidelines and/or standard clinical practice.

      The study target population are all patients (men and women) who have been newly diagnosed
      with invasive breast cancer between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2005 and treated in the
      medical oncology departments of participating sites, ensuring an approximate follow-up of 10
      years.
