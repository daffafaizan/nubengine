      is surgical (hysterectomy or myomectomy), and depends of many variables. If these tumors are
      large, preoperative assessment with clinical treatment may be useful in order to decrease its
      volume, improve hematologic patterns and modify surgical approach (vaginal or abdominal). It
      is well know that GnRH analogs can cause these goals; however, aromatase inhibitors are new
      promising drugs which are being used for reducing uterine leiomyoma's volume and few
      observational studies have shown this fact. The investigators are aiming to compare both
      treatments in a randomized controlled trial and see if it both treatments are similar or not
      in decreasing uterine leiomyoma's volume, influencing operative time, blood loss during
      surgery.
