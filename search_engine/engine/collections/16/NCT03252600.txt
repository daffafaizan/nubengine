      I. To assess the rate of hematologic response of very good partial response (VGPR) or better
      according to the International Society of Amyloidosis (ISA) hematologic response criteria.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess duration of hematologic response. II. To assess time to hematologic progression.
      III. To assess overall hematologic response rate. IV. To assess complete hematologic response
      rate. V. To assess organ response (according to ISA organ response criteria). VI. To assess
      overall survival (OS).

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive lenalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 and dexamethasone intravenously
      (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also receive elotuzumab IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8,
      15, and 22 of courses 1 and 2 and days 1 and 15 of subsequent courses. Treatment repeats
      every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive lenalidomide, dexamethasone, and elotuzumab as in Arm I. Patients
      also receive cyclophosphamide IV on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up
      to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: All patients receive lenalidomide PO on days 1-21 and dexamethasone IV
      on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients also receive elotuzumab IV over 1 hour on day 1. Courses
      repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 24 months.
