    
      This was an open-label, single-period study that intended to include subjects with EB
      consisting of infants/ children (ages 6 months to 11 years, inclusive) and adolescents/
      adults (ages 12 years and older). The study included 2 cohorts.

      Cohort 1 was to include adolescent/adult subjects with EB (ages 12 years and older);

      Cohort 2 was to include infants/children with EB (ages 4 to 11 years, inclusive).

      For both cohorts, the study intended to enroll subjects with epidermolysis bullosa simplex
      (EBS), dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB), and junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB)
      with lesions encompassing >/=2% BSA. The diacerein application area was >/=5% BSA and
      included lesioned and non-lesioned skin (if lesions accounted for <5% BSA); however, topical
      administration was </=30% BSA. On Days 1 and 10, the topical dose of study drug was applied
      by study staff, and blood was sampled for PK analyses of diacerein and rhein pre-dose and
      through 8 hours post-application. On Days 2 to 9, study drug was applied to the application
      area(s) at home. For Cohort 1, trough PK samples were collected on any 2 available days from
      Days 3 through 9, and study drug was applied after blood draw, while for Cohort 2 trough PK
      analyses were not performed.
