      risk of surgical wound infection.

      Objective: We tested the hypothesis that supplemental oxygen reduces infection risk following
      colorectal surgery.

      Design: Randomized, controlled trial. Setting: Fourteen Spanish hospitals. Patients: Three
      hundred patients undergoing elective colorectal surgery. Interventions: Patients were
      randomly assigned to either 30% or 80% FiO2 intraoperatively and for 6 hours after surgery.
      Anesthetic management and antibiotic administration were standardized.

      Main outcome measures: Wound infections were diagnosed by blinded investigators using Centers
      for Disease Control criteria. Baseline patient characteristics, anesthetic management, and
      potential confounding factors were recorded. The wound infection rate in the 30% and 80%
      oxygen groups was compared with chi-square analysis. A logistic regression was used to
      identify the contribution of potential confounding factors.
