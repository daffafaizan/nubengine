    
      This is a randomized two arm phase II study to further evaluate the efficacy of fulvestrant
      plus enza compared to single agent fulvestrant in postmenopausal women with locally advanced
      AR+/ER+/Her2- BC who will have local surgery after ~4 months on treatment. After consent, all
      patients will get a tissue biopsy, and than half the patients will get fulvestrant alone
      (standard dosing) and the other half of the patients will get fulvestrant plus enzalutamide.
      At ~4 weeks, a biopsy will be done and therapy will be continued. Hormone therapy will
      continue for ~4 months at which point the patients will undergo surgical resection.
