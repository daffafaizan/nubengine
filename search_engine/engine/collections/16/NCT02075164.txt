    
      To achieve these goals we will address the following specific hypotheses that

        -  Fructose-induced changes in lipid composition of hepatocellular stores determine
           lipotoxicity which may be associated with abnormalities in mitochondrial function,
           energy homeostasis, inflammasome activation and cellular injury in progression to NASH,
           effects which will be compared to glucose

        -  Non-invasive characterization of fructose (compared to glucose)-induced lipotoxic
           hepatic and extrahepatic metabolic risk profiles (lipid composition and energy
           metabolism) obtained by magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will identify patients
           with NASH

        -  Severity of fructose (compared to glucose)-induced lipotoxic lipid and adenosine
           triphosphate (ATP) derangements (identified by MRS) critically determines the degree of
           insulin resistance and abnormalities in hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism

        -  Compensatory hyperinsulinemia, secondary to skeletal muscle insulin resistance, may be a
           primary mechanism of hepatic lipotoxicity and progression to NASH

        -  Gender differences in the hepatic and systemic metabolic response to fructose are
           mediated by the impact of female sex hormones and their nuclear receptors on hepatic
           lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function and inflammasome activation.

        -  Age differences in the hepatic and systemic metabolic response to fructose are mediated
           by the impact of age related alterations on hepatic lipid metabolism and mitochondrial
           function.

      These key hypotheses will be addressed by a translational research consortium including
      hepatologists, radiologists, physicists, endocrinologists and specialist in gender medicine
      allowing an integrated mechanistic approach to NAFLD. The strength of the current proposal
      comes directly from bridging basic science and clinical perspectives of different disciplines
      involved in the management of NAFLD, including cutting edge non-invasive technologies such as
      high field MRS metabolic profiling ('virtual metabolic liver biopsy') and mechanistic in
      vitro experiments. This project will provide novel mechanistic insights in the role of
      fructose as emerging hepatic 'toxin' in the pathogenesis and progression of NASH, as
      increasing health problem in Western society. Moreover, this study will clarify the impact of
      sex and gender on fructose-induced alterations in hepatic and systemic metabolism, providing
      a rational and scientific basis for future dietary interventions and regulatory actions.
