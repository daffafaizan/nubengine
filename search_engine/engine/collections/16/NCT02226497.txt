      I. To determine the feasibility of home telemonitoring for adult patients following intensive
      induction, re-induction/salvage, or consolidation chemotherapy for myelodysplastic syndrome
      (MDS) or non-acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) acute myeloid leukemia (AML).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the impact of the telemonitoring intervention on mortality, duration of
      hospital stay, use of emergency services, visits to primary care physicians and to
      specialists, home visits, and telephone calls ("health care resource utilization").

      II. To evaluate the telemonitoring procedure in economic terms compared to usual care through
      a cost-effectiveness analysis.

      III. To estimate the impact on the quality of life of study participating.

      IV. To assess the degree of satisfaction of the patients/caregivers and health care
      professionals with the telemonitoring intervention.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (CONTROL): Patients receive standard outpatient supportive care after completion of
      chemotherapy.

      ARM II (INTERVENTION): Patients receive standard outpatient supportive care as in Arm I and
      use the home telemonitoring device for the duration of chemotherapy-induced cytopenia (up to
      3-4 weeks).
