    
      ERADAL-HF is a double blinded, multi-centre, prospective, randomized, three arm study,
      enrolled ambulatory patients with chronic heart failure [New York Heart Association (NYHA)
      class II/III], with iron deficiency [defined as ferritin <100 ng/mL, or ferritin 100-300
      ng/mL if transferrin saturation (TSAT) <20%] and haemoglobin (Hb) < 15 g/dL. Patients were
      randomized 1:1:1 to treatment into three arms: a first group treated with intravenous iron
      supplementation, a second treated by intramuscular iron supplementation and the third one
      which have received placebo. These patients were followed-up during a period of 04 weeks.

      The aim of this study is to assess the short term effect of parenteral iron supplementation
      on exercise tolerance and oxidative stress in patients with stable chronic heart failure and
      iron deficiency in a sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, it will also try to evaluate its
      effectiveness using the intramuscular route and this with a simplified administration scheme.
