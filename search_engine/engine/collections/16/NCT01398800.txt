      damage to constraining mechanisms often require revision TKA. Mobile bearing revision TKA
      components have been developed in hopes of lessening these failure mechanisms. Our purpose is
      to evaluate the use of mobile bearings in revision TKA.

      Retrospective clinical and radiographic evaluation of 340 revision mobile bearing TKAs using
      the PFC Sigma and LCS posterior stabilized rotating platform implants (Depuy, Warsaw, IN)
      will be performed. Indications for revision include instability, loosening, arthrofibrosis,
      chronic hemarthrosis, failed patellofemoral replacement, failed unicompartmental knee
      replacement, infection reimplantation, and supracondylar fracture nonunion.
