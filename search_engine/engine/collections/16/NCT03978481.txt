      cancer specific mortality rate, and the incidence rate of metachronous cancer in patients who
      received subtotal gastrectomy, with or without Helicobacter pylori eradication. In addition,
      we will analyze the correlation between the incidence and survival rate of this type of
      stomach cancer by comparing smoking, gastric cancer direct family history, disease stage (TNM
      staging), the histologic type of stomach cancer (intestinal, diffuse, mixed), and the
      surgical method (Billoth I, Billoth II) as well as the infection and eradication status of H.
      pylori.
