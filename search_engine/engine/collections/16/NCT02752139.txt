      relationship between sleep disorders and vascular risk factors and stroke has been
      well-documented but not fully understood. The investigators hypothesize hemodynamics
      impairment to be its potential mechanism. It has been reported that sleep-related breathing
      disorder, a type of sleep disorders, contributed as a risk factor for stroke through
      hemodynamic and hematologic changes. The purpose of this study is to determine the
      relationship between different kind of sleep disorders and cerebral hemodynamics, including
      OSHAS, RLS, RBD, narcolepsy, etc. The dynamic cerebral auto-regulation (dCA) and Transcranial
      Doppler (TCD) will be used to evaluate cerebral hemodynamics.
