      comparing the findings of ultrasound scans to MRI measurements, which is the standard imaging
      technique for the depiction of the spine. Pre-puncture US assessment may contribute to the
      safety and efficacy of the thoracic epidural technique. The purpose of this study is to
      compare the ultrasound-guided thoracic epidural insertion technique with the conventional
      anatomic landmarking technique of contacting bone and walking-off the lamina
