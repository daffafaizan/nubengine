    
      This randomized clinical trial, single-blind, aims to compare the effect of the supragingival
      biofilm control with the effect of supra- and subgingival biofilm control, performed by the
      patient-professional binomial, in periodontal patients treated, above the restoration and
      progression of periodontitis during the preventive periodic maintenance (PPM). Seventy
      patients with moderate-to-severe periodontitis, aged from 35 years, will be included.
      Participants will be periodontally treated according to their needs. After 30 days of the end
      of treatment, participants will be randomized (stratified for smoking) in two groups: Group 1
      (G1)- Supragingival biofilm control; Group 2 (G2)- Supra and subgingival biofilm control. MPP
      consultation will take place every 3 months, for 24 months, in which the G1 will only receive
      procedures of supragingival biofilm control, and G2 will receive, beyond the supragingival
      control, subgingival interventions.
