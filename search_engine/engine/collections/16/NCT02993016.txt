      groups at minimum 2 year postoperatively. The investigators hypothesized that PSI would lead
      to a neutral mechanical axis on average more frequently than conventional instrumentation.

      The study design is a double-blind randomized controlled trial. Randomly, fifty patients
      planed to undergo total knee arthroplasty using conventional instruments and other fifty
      patients undergo total knee arthroplasty using patient-specific instruments. The clinical
      outcome is comparative preoperative, postoperative 6weeks, 3months, 6months and 1years. And
      clinical score consists of Range of Motion (ROM), WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster
      University Arthritis Index) pain scale (preoperative and postoperative 6, 12, 24 months),
      Knee Society Score (preoperative and postoperative 6, 12, 24 months), Anterior and posterior
      stress view on X-ray (preoperative and postoperative 6, 12, 24 months).
