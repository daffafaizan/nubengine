      of soft-tissue involvement and general health- and functional status of the patients.
      Historically most fractures, undisplaced as well as displaced, were treated non-operatively
      with acceptable results but in recent years there is an increasing trend towards operative
      management of unstable fractures. Techniques for operative management of ankle fractures are
      varied and assessment of instability is mainly based on classic x-ray classification systems
      such as Lauge-Hansen or the AO that are difficult to reproduce[6].

      We hypothesize that a standardized and evidence based approach to ankle fracture management
      will lead to a decrease in re-operation rate.

      The aim of this study is to standardize the management of ankle fractures in our department,
      by introducing an algorithm based on best evidence present. We want to investigate:

        1. The effect of this algorithm on the re-operation rate of surgically treated ankle
           fractures in a two-year prospective observational setup with a minimum of one-year of
           follow-up.

        2. The need for surgery and functional outcome of patients with isolated lateral malleolus
           fractures in which the treatment is dictated by ankle stability assessed on weight
           bearing radiographs.
