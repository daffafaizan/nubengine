      effective as, or possibly more effective than, preventive drug treatment for migraine
      prophylaxis with fewer side effects compared with conventional treatments . Cochrane reviews
      of tension-type headache conclude that acupuncture could be a valuable non-pharmacological
      tool in patients with frequent, episodic, and chronic tension-type headache.

      An observational, cross-sectional study, according to the STROBE guide, was conducted. The
      study was carried out in the Pain Service Unit of the Son Ll√†tzer University Hospital of
      Palma de Mallorca, Spain.

      Between January 2010 and December 2015, data from patients with chronic refractory headache,
      which did not respond to conventional treatment for at least 6 months, referred to the Pain
      Service Unit were examined to ascertain their eligibility.
