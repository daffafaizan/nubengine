      This study is a factorial randomized, placebo-control trial, including 2 groups: 'sertraline
      only' (sertraline + sham tDCS), and 'combined treatment' (sertraline + active tDCS). It is
      planned to recruit 20 subjects for each group, which results in all together 40 participants.
      Patients will take 12 tDCS sessions (30min for each session): first 10 consecutive sessions
      for two weeks (Monday to Friday), and then 2 follow-up sessions scheduled 2 and 4 weeks after
      the consecutive treatment. Both pharmacological and tDCS intervention will be started
      simultaneously on the first day of the treatment.
