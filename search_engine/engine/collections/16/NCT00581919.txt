      Secondary objectives include: evaluating and describing the incidence of chemotherapy-induced
      peripheral neuropathy using the FACT/GOG-Ntx assessment tool; evaluating the utility of
      adding ALCAR to the chemotherapy to reduce the incidence of peripheral neuropathy; and
      evaluating the utility of the Grooved Pegboard Completion Time as a longitudinal measure of
      peripheral neuropathy.
