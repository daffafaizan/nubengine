      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are the currently accepted drugs for the
      management of this disorder. The capacity for synthesizing vitamin D and the presence of
      vitamin D receptor in human cycling endometrium have also been demonstrated. Because vitamin
      D reduces the synthesis of prostaglandins, a beneficial effect of vitamin D for the uterus is
      possible.Vitamin E inhibits the release of arachidonic acid and the conversion of arachidonic
      acid to prostaglandin via an action on the enzymes phospholipase A2 and cyclooxygenase.
