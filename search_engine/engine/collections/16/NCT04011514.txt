      secondary questionnaire based quantitative evaluation . The intervention study includes a
      3-month baseline observational period followed by a 7-month baseline data collection period,
      a 2-month intervention implementation phase, and a 3-month intervention observational period
      followed by 7-month intervention data collection period.

      An intervention, where dedicated stroke nurses handle acute care of stroke and TIA patient in
      the ED prior to admission to a dedicated stroke unit will take place in the timeframe of
      11-19:00 hrs, 7 days a week. Notably, the intervention is set to be integrated into clinical
      practice on a permanent basis after end of study.

      Data for all stroke patients admitted to the ED at HGH are collected during the 3-month
      baseline and intervention observational periods. Fulfilment of Danish Stroke Quality Program
      (DAP) quality indicators is monitored as follows - use of dysphagia screen (GUSS),
      mobilization within day of ED admission and transfer to SU. Additional nursing interventions
      monitored in the ED are: Use of nasogastric catheter, use of bladder scan and intermittent
      catheterization, frequency of temperature monitoring and use of anti-pyretics, acute phase
      monitoring of blood-pressure every 2 hours, use of Scandinavian Stroke Scale (SSS) score.

      Outcomes are monitored in hospital and at visits to the out patient clinic, as well as by
