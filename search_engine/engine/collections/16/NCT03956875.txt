      aromatic catalyzer has relationship with biosynthesis of estrogen, therefore, aromatic
      inhibitors became as a standard therapy of breast cancer in post-menopausal women. Arthralgia
      and joint stiffness are most common side effect in aromatic inhibitor treatment. Yoga is
      benefit for the patients with chronic pain improvement, and also can improve quality of life.
      Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to investigate the therapeutic effect of Yoga
      on aromatic inhibitor-induced chronic knee pain in patients with breast cancer.The
      investigators designed a crossover study, a total of 60 patients divided equally to control
      group (massage for 6 weeks in home care) and treatment group (Yoga treatment for 12 times/6
      weeks). There is two weeks wash out period after finishing 6 weeks treatment, and then the
      patients in control group changed to treatment, in contrast, the patients in the treatment
      changed to control group. The assessment time was pre-treatment (vision 1), finishing 6 weeks
      treatment (vision), finishing 6 weeks treatment after crossover (vision 3). The major
      assessment was brief pain inventory scores changed The results in the present study predict
      Yoga treatment for 6 weeks can improve aromatic inhibitor-induced knee pain and also can
      improve quality of life in patients with breast cancer.
