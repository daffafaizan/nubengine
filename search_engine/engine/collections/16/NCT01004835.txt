      recurrent pain. Migraine is highly heritable and the majority of juveniles who suffer from
      the disorder have a mother or father who also have the disease. The blood or saliva samples
      will go through DNA analysis and be sequenced for candidate genes or subjected to
      whole-genome sequencing. By creating a MAPS GeneBank from these patients' blood/saliva
      donations we will ultimately be able to define genes for migraine and pain diseases.
