      nephrotoxicity are potential problems for the patient. Approximately ninety percent of the
      protocol biopsies of renal allografts, performed at 18 months post transplantation, show
      histological lesions of chronic calcineurin nephrotoxicity. Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) has
      been shown to have immunosuppressive and repairing properties. Some patient in this study
      will also receive two infusions of expanded MSC. This study will evaluate the safety and
      effectiveness of MSC infusions in patients .

      This study will last 2 years. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the
      full immunosuppressive therapy and MSC infusions (Group 1) or immunosuppressive therapy alone
      (Group 2). Patients will undergo MSC infusions at the start of the study on Day 0. One year
      post- infusions, patients will be evaluated. At Months 12 participants will undergo kidney
      biopsies. Blood collection will occur at regular intervals, Serum creatinine and the
      estimated creatinine clearance will be monthly recorded. The transplanted kidney function
      will be evaluated.
