      Primary objective :

      • Determine that there is no difference between the subcutaneously compared to intravenous
      administration in terms of dosage and serum PK / PD objectives Beta lactam in a geriatric
      population.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Clinical evaluation at J14 and J90 (healing, death)

        -  Clinical tolerance of subcutaneously by self-assessment or hetero-evaluation of the
           existence of cognitive disorders

      Monitoring of antibiotic dosages:

        -  Making systematic assay serum concentrations of residual antibiotics in the range of 30
           min prior to reinjection H24 after starting treatment and then weekly monitoring.

        -  Realization of the assays according to the method of Liquid Chromatography-Mass
           Spectrometry (LC-MS)

      Patient monitoring of J1-J14:

      • Clinical monitoring and biological usual
