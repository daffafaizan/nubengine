      profile analysis by the use of cDNA microarray in our previous studies. We have determined
      the HLA-A*2402 restricted epitope peptides derived from CDCA1, CDCA1-A24-56. This epitope
      showed strong IFN-g production when stimulated with the appropriate targets expressed the
      appropriate protein and HLA-A*2402. Furthermore, when vaccinated this peptide, specific CTL
      was determined after the vaccination. Therefore we focused on the safety and efficacy of
      novel vaccination for the advanced prostate cancer patients who already showed resistance to
      standard hormonal therapy and chemotherapy.
