      are associated with genetic factors. 300 patients will be evaluated in postoperative
      oncological surgeries. The peripheral leukocyte DNA will be extracted by the Salting Out
      Procedure method and processed to genotyping for 48 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      from 15 candidate genes by real-time PCR by the Taqman method. The possible associations with
      demographic data and factors related to surgery will be analyzed by univariate and
      multivariate analysis.
