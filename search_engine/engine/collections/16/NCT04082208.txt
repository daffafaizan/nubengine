      Sat02%, hypercapnia and airway obstruction with consequences ranging from interruption or
      suspension of the technique to complications that may put the patient's life at risk .

      High flow devices (HF) due to the pressurization capacity of the airway and the reduction of
      anatomical dead space will favor a better gas exchange compared to low flow devices (LF),
      which will manifest clinically with a reduction in episodes of decrease of Sat02% and a
      decrease in carbon dioxide levels.

      The main objective of the study is to demonstrate that the use of high flow devices (HF)
      decreases the episodes of desaturation (defined as Sat02 â‰¤ 90% measured through pulse
      oximetry) that occur during the performance of ERCP under deep sedation compared to Low flow
      devices (LF) with equal Inspiratory oxygen fraction (Fi02) in both cases.

      The expected results with this study are that high flow devices (LAF) provide adequate
      respiratory support during the performance of ERCP under deep sedation, reducing episodes of
      desaturation, hypoventilation and airway obstruction compared to low flow devices ( nasal
      glasses).
