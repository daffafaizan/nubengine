    
      An observational survey based study, for 3 consecutive week days, chosen by the local
      investigating team during a two-week period across multiple centres.

        -  Local investigators will complete the survey with each patient who has received
           anaesthetic intervention from an anaesthetist, 1 day, around 24hrs after delivery in
           line with their routine anaesthetic follow up.

        -  At 30 days, a telephone survey will be conducted with each patient to repeat the ObsQoR
           survey and ask key questions regarding functional recovery and activities of daily
           living post delivery.

      In addition for a small number of sites, elective caesarean delivery patients will have blood
      taken at the point of anaesthesia and 24 hours post delivery to assess the immune function
      and any changes which may predict poorer outcome in these women.
