      Primary

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients undergoing surgery for locally advanced
           pancreatic cancer treated with stereotactic radiotherapy, gemcitabine hydrochloride, and
           oxaliplatin.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the time to death in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine perioperative morbidity and mortality in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the rate of R0 resections in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the histologic response rate in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Neoadjuvant therapy: Patients undergo hypofractionated, stereotactic radiotherapy on
           days 1-5. Patients also receive gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 100 minutes on day 1
           and oxaliplatin IV over 120 minutes on day 2. Treatment with gemcitabine hydrocloride
           and oxaliplatin repeats every 2 weeks for 3 courses.

        -  Surgery: Patients with resectable disease undergo tumor resection. Patients with
           unresectable disease undergo a second course of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed
           by resection.

        -  Adjuvant therapy: Beginning 3-4 weeks after surgery, patients receive 3 more courses of
           chemotherapy as in neoadjuvant therapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months for up to 2 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 29 patients will be accrued for this study.
