      arthropathy. Follow-up has historically focused on the glenoid component because of problems
      with fixation and scapular notching leading to functional failure. Fixation of the humeral
      component has evolved from cemented to mostly uncemented with diaphyseal of metaphyseal
      press-fit stems. Bony changes around the stem reflect the bone-implant interface; research to
      evaluate and interpret these changes is insufficient at this moment. Since several patients
      have shown cortical thinning of the proximal lateral humeral cortex during follow-up, further
      research is recommended to evaluate the cause and clinical impact of these radiographic
      changes. The goal of this study is to collect long-term radiographic and clinical data in
      order to facilitate the identification of risk factors.
