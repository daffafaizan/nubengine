      HIV-infected patients initiate ART much earlier. As a result, these patients have prolonged
      life spans and, hence, longer HIV and ART exposure. Emerging data from developed countries
      suggest that HIV-infected patients have a higher risk than HIV-uninfected people of
      developing diabetes mellitus (DM) and other non-communicable diseases. The excess diabetes
      risk is probably related to multiple factors including HIV-associated inflammation, the use
      of some antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimens, and body composition changes associated with
      HIV and ART. As a result, HIV-infected populations may develop DM at a younger age and may
      have a higher mortality if management is not optimal as may be the case in resource-limited
      countries of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).

      Most of the data to-date on HIV and DM are from high-income countries, and data in SSA are
      few and inconsistent. Because of differences in genetic composition as well as environmental
      factors including high burden of infectious diseases in resource-limited settings, data from
      high-income countries cannot be extrapolated and reliably used to improve quality of DM care
      among HIV patients in SSA. The objective of this study is to investigate if HIV, ART, and
      body composition changes occurring during ART use are associated with higher risk of DM as
      well as other risk factors for cardiovascular diseases in Tanzanian patients, and examine if
      HIV increases the risk of DM associated complications. This study is funded by the Danish
      Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 2016 to 2021.
