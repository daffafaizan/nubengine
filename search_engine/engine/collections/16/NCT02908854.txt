      Maryland. In this two-phase intervention, the research team will work in Phase I with
      stakeholders throughout the high school community to identify the barriers to vegetable
      intake in the NSLP in this student population and to determine how spices and herbs might
      help overcome these barriers. The stakeholders with whom we will collaborate will include
      students, school administration, and cafeteria staff.

      Phase II will focus on the direct measurement of vegetable intake among students both before
      and after spices and herbs are added to the vegetables in the NSLP. The spiced vegetable
      recipes that received the most favorable student rankings in the taste tests of Phase I will
      be offered.

      The vegetable recipes flavored with spices and herbs will meet all NSLP requirements for fat,
      sugar, total calories, and all other guidelines.

      Student vegetable intake will be assessed through two outcomes: 1.) plate waste, and 2.)
      production waste.
