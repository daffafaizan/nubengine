      media intervention that engages young adults with a history of tanning to practice sun safety
      behaviors. We will incentivize young adults who have a history of tanning to create social
      media posts that encourage their peers to engage in sun safety. Focus groups of tanners
      guided the development of the intervention. Investigators will conduct a pilot feasibility
      trial where participants will be randomized to a condition in which they are incentivized to
      create sun safety social media messages to be posted on a sun safety social media account or
      a condition in which they are incentivized to create social media messages about how to use
      technology to support healthy lifestyle behaviors to be posted on a health technology social
      media account. The intervention will last 4 weeks. Feasibility outcomes include recruitment,
      retention, acceptability, participation, social media message engagement (likes, comments,
      shares), persuasive impact of messages, unprotected sun exposure, sun protection, and tanning
      behavior. This work will inform a fully powered randomized trial testing the efficacy of this
      intervention.
