      changes are not tracked frequently enough. Most people with Parkinson disease see a clinician
      only once or twice a year. This study measures changes in Parkinson disease symptoms in real
      time using an app. The app remotely monitors Parkinson disease symptoms using surveys and the
      sensors on mobile devices. This study may contribute to increasing our understanding of the
      variability in Parkinson disease symptoms. This knowledge could be used to improve quality of
      life for people living with Parkinson disease.
