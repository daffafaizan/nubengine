      in animals and postmenopausal women. This study aims to see whether the addition of fiber in
      the form of GOS to a calcium-containing yogurt drink will increase calcium absorption
      compared to placebo in a group of girls near menarche. Secondary outcomes are to assess
      physical fitness and determine the relationship between physical fitness and calcium
      absorption in adolescent girls as well as assess changes in gut microbiota. During this three
      phase, randomized, controlled crossover study, participants will consume yogurt drinks
      supplemented with 0, 2.5 or 5 grams of GOS twice daily for three weeks. Following each three
      week period, participants will complete a weekend clinical visit to measure calcium
      absorption. Height, weight, bone density and geometry, calcium absorption, gut microbiota and
      physical fitness will be measured. Effects of this GOS fiber intervention may help elucidate
      a mechanism of action for improving bone health with fiber supplementation.
