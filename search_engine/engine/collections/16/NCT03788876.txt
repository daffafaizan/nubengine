      to functional aspects. It is observed that the decrease in muscle mass and pulmonary changes
      are some complications that can be found in the post-transplant patient due to immobility.
      Thus, NMES rehabilitation is of paramount importance for the recovery of the individual, both
      in the functional aspects, and in the minimization in the time of hospitalization.The
      objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of NMES on the thickness and strength of
      the quadriceps femoris muscle, pulmonary function, endothelial function, functional capacity,
      muscle biochemical markers, arterial blood gas analysis and water balance of patients after
      lung transplantation through a randomized clinical trial. Patients will be randomized into
      two groups: EENM group: will receive the application of NMES associated with physiotherapy
      and control group: who will receive only the physiotherapy protocol of the HCPA. The NMES
      training will be applied once a day (30 minutes of application per session, increasing one
      minute every two days and reducing the OFF time), until the discharge of the Intensive Care
      Unit (ICU). The patient will continue with the application also in the Hospitalization Units
      of the HCPA and Irmandade da Santa Casa de Miseric√≥rdia de Porto Alegre until the hospital
      discharge. The following outcomes will be evaluated: thickness and strength of the quadriceps
      muscle, pulmonary function, endothelial function, functional capacity, mobility, muscle
      biochemical markers, arterial blood gas analysis, water balance and length of stay in the
      ICU, time and success of weaning from invasive mechanical ventilation and survival rate
      through medical records analysis.
