      study designed to evaluate the early safety and performance of the Shockwave Lithoplasty®
      System in subjects with moderate to heavily calcified peripheral arteries with 2.5mm to 3.5mm
      reference vessel diameter at the target site. The Shockwave Lithoplasty® System is indicated
      for lithotripsy-enhanced, low-pressure balloon dilation of calcified, stenotic peripheral
      arteries in patients who are candidates for percutaneous therapy. Up to twenty subjects will
      be enrolled and treated with Lithoplasty® System.
