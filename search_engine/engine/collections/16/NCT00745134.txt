      I. To evaluate the efficacy of a combination of capecitabine and radiation therapy with or
      without curcumin in locally advanced rectal cancer as assessed by pathological complete
      response rate.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine downstaging, local control, disease-free survival and overall survival rates.

      II. To determine serum and rectal tumor tissue pharmacology of curcumin and its metabolites
      in the above patients and its correlation with clinical response.

      III. To identify surrogate molecular markers for curcumin effects. IV. To correlate serum
      cytokine levels with quality of life in patients receiving this therapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for a total of 28 fractions. Patients
      also receive capecitabine orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on the days of radiation therapy and
      curcumin PO BID in weeks 1-11.5.

      ARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy and receive capecitabine as in Arm I. Patients
      also receive placebo PO BID in weeks 1-11.5.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1 month.
