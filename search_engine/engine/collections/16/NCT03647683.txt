      Empirical evidence shows the relevance of self-compassion in the context of negative emotions
      such as depression, anxiety and anger. Research on chronic pain is promising yet limited.
      Self-compassion is associated with better pain-coping, pain-acceptance and quality of life,
      as well as reduced pain-related disability and burdening emotions. Experimental
      investigations on induced pain are missing. The aim of the current study is to evaluate a
      short self-compassion intervention for pain.

      First, a heat stimulus is induced to all participants which is to be tolerated as long as
      possible and evaluated in intensity and unpleasantness. Next, participants receive a
      coping-strategy which they are randomly assigned to. Three different strategies are
      evaluated: (1) self-compassion, treating oneself with kindness while being mindfully aware of
      the painful stimulus, (2) acceptance, accepting the painful stimulus as well as pain-related
      thoughts, not trying to change, (3) distraction, distracting oneself from the painful
      stimulus and trying not to perceive the pain or painful thoughts. Participants practice the
      strategy with the painful heat stimulus three times. Then, they receive another heat stimulus
      which is to be tolerated as long as possible and evaluated. During the next week,
      participants obtain daily practices via e-mail for further fostering of the learned strategy.
      Finally, participants receive, tolerate and evaluate pain again in the laboratory.
