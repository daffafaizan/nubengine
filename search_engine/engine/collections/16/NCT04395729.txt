      Although the primary lesion is non-evolutionary, the secondary consequences are evolutive,
      with neuro-orthopaedic degradation leading to soft tissue retraction and osteo-articular
      deformities. Hemiplegia occurs in approximately 30% of cases of Cerebral Palsy, and tone
      disorders (spasticity, dyskinesia) affecting the upper limb generally impact function, both
      in unilateral capacities (range of motion, dexterity, and fluidity of movement), and in
      bimanual performance. The focal treatment of spasticity by botulinum toxin injections, in
      combination with specific occupational therapy training, has proven to be effective in
      improving targeted functional goals. However, there is little evidence today of the
      effectiveness of treatment for the management of upper limb retraction and deformity, whether
      by stretching, orthosis/plaster or even surgery. And apart from its effectiveness on body
      structure, the functional effects of upper limb surgery in Cerebral Palsy have been little
      explored. The aim of the study is to investigate the impact of individualized multisite
      neuro-orthopedic surgery of the upper limb in children with Cerebral Palsy on unilateral
      functional capacities and bimanual performance, by using such tools as the Melbourne
      Assessment (Version 2) and the Assisting Hand Assessment (Version 5.0).
