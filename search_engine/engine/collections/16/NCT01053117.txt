      access can be either via a central venous catheter (CVC) or a surgically created
      arteriovenous fistula (AVF) or graft (AVG). This is a pilot randomized control trial of
      prevalent hemodialysis patients with a central venous catheter (CVC), to determine if a
      systematic approach using an algorithm protocol to convert the CVC to an AVF (arteriovenous
      fistula) will improve rates of functioning AVF and decrease CVC use. The algorithm
      (intervention group) will be compared to current practice (control group), a non-standardized
      approach at the discretion of the caring nephrologist and/or surgeon.
