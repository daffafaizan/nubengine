      (RFA) is the micro-metastatic lesion that has not been ablated and inactivated in the
      transitional area.Oncolytic virus H101 is a genetically engineered adenovirus that lacks Elb
      55ku protein.Some clinical trials have confirmed that H101 has selective oncolysis in a
      variety of solid tumors.Furthermore,research shows that the directly dissolving tumor
      activity of H101 enhanced obviously and activate the body's anti-tumor immune to induce the
      distal antitumor effect under the condition of mild high temperature (40 ℃ and 42 ℃).The
      transition zone of RFA can provide the appropriate mild high temperature.However, there are
      no reports that H101 which is injected during surgery can improve the efficacy of RFA in
      liver cancer at present.Therefore,We used a multicenter prospective randomized controlled
      study as the main method to prospectively compare the short-term and long-term efficacy of
      RFA combined with H101 group and traditional RFA group in the treatment of small liver cancer
      (single lesion , diameter less than or equal to 3cm，to evaluate the value of RFA combined
      with H101 injection in reducing the postoperative recurrence rate of small hepatocellular
      carcinoma, and to provide a reliable evidence-based medical basis for the selection of
      treatment methods for small hepatocellular carcinoma.
