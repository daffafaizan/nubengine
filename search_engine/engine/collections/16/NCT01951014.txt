      (e.g. text messages and Facebook posts) during pregnancy changes how pregnant teens think
      about their prenatal health and if fetal and maternal health outcomes can be improved. This
      study aims to:

        1. Assess the impact of providing health information to pregnant adolescents (through
           Facebook and text messages) on fetal and maternal health outcomes across pregnancy.

        2. Assess maternal nutrition knowledge using a brief questionnaire before and after the
           social media intervention.

        3. Evaluate adolescent beliefs, attitudes and influences on dietary, physical activity, and
           life choices by asking teens to participate in interviews and focus groups.

        4. Evaluate adolescent beliefs, attitudes and influences on dietary, physical activity and
           life choices through the perspective of healthcare providers by interviewing allied
           health workers at the adolescent pregnancy clinic.
