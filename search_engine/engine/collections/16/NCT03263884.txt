      duration of experimentally induced muscle pain when a 5-day course of treatment is given
      immediately following an initial nerve growth factor (NGF) injection; ii) the analgesic
      effects of left DLPFC rTMS will be related to an improved cognitive network function as
      assessed by electroencephalography (EEG).
