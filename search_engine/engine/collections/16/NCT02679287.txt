      algorithms to automatically manage blood glucose levels for people with Type 1 Diabetes. The
      system modulates insulin to keep blood glucose in a targeted range. The CLC will be deployed
      with different functionalities at different stages of the trial, resulting in variation in
      what the subject will be responsible for and what the system will drive.These functionalities
      occur in a randomized cross-over design, each occurring for 8 weeks. These modalities are:

        1. SAP=sensor-augmented pump only

        2. USS+SAP (d)= Evening and Overnight Closed-Loop Control=SAP during day and CLC starting
           at dinner and continuing overnight

        3. USS+CLC (d)= 24/7 Closed-Loop Control=24-hour Day and Night Closed Loop Control
