      In our recent neuroimaging study with fMRI, we found that multimodal areas such as the right
      superior temporal cortex and right dorsal premotor cortex were activated during sensory
      instructed movements. These regions might contribute to extract common features or concepts
      from sensory stimuli, but we do not have firm experimental evidence yet. In order to
      investigate the functional roles of multimodal brain regions further, we propose to apply a
      transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) technique. TMS can create transient brain lesions
      allowing functional mapping of cortical regions. In this protocol, by stimulating the
      multimodal areas using TMS, we will determine the functional role of these areas.
