    
      Overall Goal:

      Our primary goal is to assess the impact on quality of life, quality of care, and other
      outcomes of two programs designed to support patients newly diagnosed with breast,
      colorectal, and lung cancer patients. The Oncology Nurse Care Management (ONCM) and Enhanced
      Usual Care (EUC) interventions will be implemented and evaluated among enrollees of Group
      Health.

      Specific Aims:

      A.1. To develop a robust early cancer notification system based on automated data to
      facilitate intervention shortly after cancer diagnosis.

      A.2. To implement an Oncology Nurse Care Management program that addresses patient questions,
      symptoms, psychosocial needs, and facilitates timely, coordinated care.

      A.3. To compare the impact of the Oncology Nurse Care Manager Program with Enhanced Usual
      Care in Group Health cancer patients using a randomized clinical trial design. Our two
      primary outcomes are quality of life and patients' perspectives of quality of care. As
      secondary outcomes, we will evaluate the impact of the intervention on psychosocial distress
      and depression.
