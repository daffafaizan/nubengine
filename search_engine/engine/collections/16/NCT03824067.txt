    
      This study seeks to evaluate the impact of point of care (POC) early infant HIV diagnosis
      (EID) on turn-around time from sample collection until notification of parents/caregivers of
      test result, linkage to care, and time to initiation of treatment, and early retention in HIV
      care (3-6 months) for those infected.

      The study will take place in two countries, Zimbabwe and Kenya, with high HIV prevalence, and
      where EGPAF-supported POC EID platforms are being implemented as part of a Unitaid-funded POC
      EID project. As part of POC program implementation activities, in each country up to 50
      EGPAF-supported sites will implement POC EID platforms. These sites may be prevention of
      mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV clinics, HIV clinics or multidisciplinary health
      facilities. Project sites have been selected as part of the program implementation. In each
      country, 18 sites will be randomly selected as study sites for the impact evaluation.

      Using a stepped wedge design, the intervention (the POC EID platforms) will be rolled out
      sequentially to the study facilities over three randomly-assigned time periods. Quantitative
      data will be derived from routine medical and laboratory charts and longitudinal tracking and
      follow-up of HIV-infected infants.

      Qualitative data on feasibility and acceptability of POC will be derived from in-depth
      interviews with mothers/caregivers of HIV-exposed infants at the beginning and end of the
      study and community focus group discussions at the end of the study.
