      conducted over an 8 week intervention phase, plus a pre-intervention registration and
      preparation period. Participants will be randomly assigned to either the pomegranate extract
      or placebo groups. One capsule of Pomegranate or placebo will be taken after the same time
      daily meal with water for 8 weeks.

      Participants will be asked to visit the clinical lab three times. The first visit will be for
      baseline measurements and a 24 hour urine sample before the intervention begins; the second
      in week 4 for measurements only and the final visit in week 8 for measurements and the last
      urine collection. Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements will be taken at each visit.
      Urine will only be collected pre and post intervention.

      The health related Quality of Life Questionnaire (Rand 36) will be administered at both the
      initial and final visits. This series of questions covers eight spheres of health and has
      been proven to be scientifically robust having been used in over 200 health related
      scientific trials.

      Three day diet diaries will be used for recording energy intake and to determine any
      fluctuations in dietary intake over the study period. These will be completed by participants
      in the pre-intervention week and then at week 4 of the intervention. Participants complete 2
      diet diaries in total.
