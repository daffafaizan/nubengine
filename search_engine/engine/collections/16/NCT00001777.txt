      The associated loss of serotonin transmission may contribute to the frontal lobe dysfunction
      associated with this disorder. FLD patients will undergo a controlled clinical trial of an
      orally administered serotonergic agent (Sertraline) which acts centrally to selectively block
      serotonin uptake to treat patients' cognitive and behavioral frontal dysfunction. Study
      subjects will be evaluated at regular intervals with a battery of neuropsychological and
      behavioral tests designed to assess frontal and other cognitive functions. In addition,
      compliance and levels of the medication will be measured in the blood and when possible in
      the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).
