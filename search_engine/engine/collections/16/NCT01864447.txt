      the cornerstone of secondary prevention for heart disease. Implementation of CR early after
      an acute myocardial infarction (MI) is associated with improved cardiac function and
      survival. As such, CR is now standard of care for a majority of hospital-based discharge
      programs following coronary events. In stark contrast, no similar program exists following an
      acute venous thromboembolism (VTE or blood clot), despite a high rate of limb and respiratory
      disability after VTE, shared risk factors with heart disease, and known beneficial impact of
      exercise training on VTE complications (e.g. post-thrombotic syndrome, PTS).

      Body weight is a key modifiable risk factor driving risk of incident and recurrent VTE. Obese
      patients with prior VTE have a 2-fold higher risk of a second VTE compared to normal weight
      patients.(1) Importantly, VTE recurrence risk escalates if weight control is not established.
      Weight gain after acute DVT is common, with a mean 7% increase over 6 months.(2) To date,
      however, there is limited evidence regarding whether early initiation of exercise training
      following acute DVT is safe and feasible and mitigates weight gain associated with a VTE
      diagnosis. Previously, a significant decrease in body weight and fat mass loss was
      demonstrated utilizing high-caloric expenditure exercise in the CR setting.(3) Delineating
      the impact of high-caloric expenditure exercise to induce weight loss and reduce VTE
      complications and recurrence is a critical first step toward evaluating the role of early
      post-VTE rehabilitation in the clinical setting.
