    
      Ethanol administration has an effect on vestibular function, measurable with video head
      impulse test (vHIT)- and vestibulo-oculography (VOG)-methods.

      The purpose of the study is to create a vHIT- and VOG-model for bilateral vestibular
      neuronitis, a disease with difficult diagnostics, via ethanol administration in healthy human
      subjects.

      As subjects are consuming ethanol via oral route, vHIT-measurements and VOG-measurements
      (slow and rapid eye movement recordings) are being recorded in order to measure the change in
      vestibular function.

      During approx. 5 hours, 4 vHIT measurements will take place, while subjects ingest ethanol
      towards 1 per mille levels, measured via alcoholmeter.

      Necessary precautions include strict exclusion criteria regarding health of the subjects and
      also comprehensive preparedness for management of allergic reactions and other unusual
      phenomena related to alcohol consumption.
