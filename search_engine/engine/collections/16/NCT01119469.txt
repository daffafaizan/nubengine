    
      Hypochondriasis is defined as a preoccupation with the fear of having a serious disease based
      on the person's misinterpretation of bodily symptoms (APA). For a long time hypochondriasis
      was seen as difficult to treat. Meanwhile effective psychological treatment for
      hypochondriasis exists. Psychotherapies using cognitive therapy (CT), cognitive behavioral
      therapy (CBT), exposure therapy (ET) or behavioral stress management approaches are effective
      in reducing symptoms of hypochondriasis. However, few studies compare different types of
      psychotherapy. In addition, in these studies numbers of participants were small, no
      differences between different treatments were found, and one third of the participants showed
      no satisfactory change. This study will compare the efficacy of CT and ET in a larger sample
      of 84 participants.

      Participants in this randomized controlled trial (RCT) will first undergo baseline
      assessment. Then they will be randomly assigned to either CT, ET or a waiting list (WL), all
      conditions are for the duration of 12 weeks. CT includes psychoeducation, attention training,
      cognitive restructuring, behavioral experiments, imagery rescripting and relapse prevention.
      ET includes change of safety behavior, exposition (in sensu and in vivo), and relapse
      prevention. Both treatment trials contain the identical number of sessions. Treatment
      response will be assessed at week 12 and additionally one and three years after treatment.
      Participants of the WL will be assigned to CT or ET after the waiting period.
