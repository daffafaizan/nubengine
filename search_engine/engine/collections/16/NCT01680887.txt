      It is a partial agonist at α2β4 nicotinic acetyl choline receptors and a full agonist at α7
      nicotinic acetyl choline receptors. By its effects on cholinergic activity at α7 and α2β4
      receptors, varenicline may reduce dopaminergic and glutamatergic activity in the midbrain,
      and reduce symptoms of Cocaine Use Disorder. A preliminary trial of varenicline in human
      cocaine users suggested that varenicline treatment was associated with reductions in cocaine
      use. The current trial was intended to confirm these promising preliminary results.

      Methods: This was a 12-week, double blind, placebo controlled parallel group clinical trial
      involving 156 DSM IV cocaine dependent subjects. Subjects received 2 mg of varenicline or
      identical placebo each day along with weekly individual cognitive behavioral relapse
      prevention psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure was cocaine use measured by by thrice
      weekly urine drug screens. Additional outcome measures included cocaine withdrawal symptoms
      measured by the Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment (CSSA) End of study cocaine abstinence
      was analyzed using a Chi-square test.
