      acute and 24 to 48 hour post dose effects (discontinuation syndrome) of MDMA on sleep
      architecture, water homeostasis and neurocognitive function. We will define the signs and
      symptoms of sleep disruption and time course of alterations in ADH levels and neurocognitive
      function occurring after administration of a single dose of MDMA in experienced users. The
      immediate effects of MDMA include euphoria and intoxication; at 24 hours after MDMA these
      positive effects are replaced by lowered mood and lethargy - we refer to these effects as a
      discontinuation syndrome. The pleasurable effects of MDMA are thought to be due to elevations
      of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine; the mechanisms of post-MDMA depression are unknown
      but may be due to relative serotonin depletion. Among its many functions serotonin maintains
      normal sleep architecture. The effects of MDMA discontinuation on sleep architecture will be
      assessed using comprehensive polysomnography and wrist actigraphy with measures obtained ~36
      hours after a single dose of MDMA. Cognitive measurements will explore the acute effects of
      MDMA. MDMA can produce hyponatremia. In this study we will evaluate the effects of MDMA on
      ADH release, urine sodium excretion, and the relationship of gender to these effects.
