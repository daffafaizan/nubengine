      condition in comparison to the auditory administration. Data will be collected from younger
      individuals with normal hearing. Each younger individual is tested using both visual and
      auditory condition and the scores are compared across the two conditions. It is anticipated
      that the scores will not be significantly different between the two conditions.

      Aim 2 is to examine the test condition effect on cognitive testing results in older
      individuals with hearing loss. The three test conditions include auditory unamplified,
      auditory amplified, and visual. Each older individual will be tested using two different test
      conditions. It is predicted the auditory amplified and visual administrations will alleviate
      the cognitive load associated with hearing difficulty and lead to improved performance on the
      test.
