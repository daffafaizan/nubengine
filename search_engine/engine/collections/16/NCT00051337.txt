      hyperkinetic movement disorders. Paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders have been
      clinically recognized for a long time, although the exact neurophysiological mechanism
      leading to paroxysms of hyperkinetic movement attacks is not well understood. Paroxysmal
      hyperkinetic movement disorders are heterogenous, and the exact mechanism may differ in each
      subcategory. In paroxysmal dyskinesias, the idiopathic forms of paroxysmal hyperkinetic
      movement disorders, it is speculated that transient functional abnormality at the cellular
      level occurs in the basal ganglia without organic irreversible damage. Ion channel
      dysfunction is an attractive hypothesis to explain such transient dysfunction. Some patients
      with paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders have a psychogenic etiology.

      A promising technique to evaluate physiological changes in the brain during an attack is
      ictal single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scanning. Ictal SPECT is a reliable
      method to detect a seizure focus during an epileptic seizure. We will utilize ictal SPECT
      scanning techniques during, and between attacks, and while they are simulating such attacks.
      The differential activation between the attacks of hyperkinetic movements and the voluntary
      movements may shed light on the regions of the brain and neurophysiological mechanisms
      responsible for generation of paroxysmal hyperkinetic movement disorders.
