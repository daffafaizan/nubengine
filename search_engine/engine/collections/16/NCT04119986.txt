      evaluate the safety and efficacy of drug balloon therapy for ISR in patients with CHD under
      the guidance of QFR compared with DES implantation. Based on previous study reported, the
      incidence rate of target lesion failure is about 3% in patients with ISR undergoing DES
      implantation. And the design of non-inferiority study was performed in our study. Moreover,
      the investigators estimated 10% loss follow-up of these patients in each arm. As a result, a
      total of 220 patients with ISR were required, and with 110 patients per group as a ratio of
      1:1 randomization.
