      that encodes an enzyme in the biosynthetic process of aceneuramic acid (typical sialic acid).
      It is an extremely rare progressive muscle disease, often occurring in the late teens to 30s,
      usually affecting the distal lower leg, especially the extensor muscles such as the tibialis
      anterior muscle, first, and weakness in both upper and lower limbs. However, the weakness of
      the quadriceps femoris is usually gradual. Although there are large individual differences,
      health management and deterioration of QOL will eventually become a problem, and in severe
      cases, constant assistance is required in daily life.

      A double-blind comparative study conducted in Japan provided results suggesting efficacy, but
      the efficacy could not be confirmed in a large-scale international clinical trial, so this
      study is decided to be conducted. Oral administration of aceneuramic acid tablets 500 mg
      (SA-ER tablets) or placebo tablets of the same appearance, 4 tablets at a time, 3 times a day
      for 48 weeks will be examined for differences in efficacy. The target was a total of 10
      cases, 7 cases in the active drug group, and 3 in the placebo group. The amount of change in
      upper extremity composite score (the sum of the average of the right and left HHD scores for
      grip, shoulder abductors, elbow flexors and elbow extensors) was used, and the secondary
      endpoints were the doctor's comprehensive evaluation and the GNE myopathy functional activity
      scale.
