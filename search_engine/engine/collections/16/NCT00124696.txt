      Cocaethylene is an active metabolite of cocaine and has a similar chemical structure to
      cocaine. The purpose of this study is to determine whether substitution therapy with
      cocaethylene is a safe and effective treatment for cocaine dependence.

      This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial will occur in 3 parts. In Part 1, the individual
      pharmacokinetics of an intravenous dose of cocaethylene will be determined in order to
      estimate individualized cocaethylene infusion rates and pharmacokinetic parameters. This will
      provide important information on how cocaethylene is processed by the body. In Part 2, an
      infusion of cocaethylene, producing a venous plasma concentration of 200 ng/ml, will be
      administered over an 8-hour period. Clinical monitoring and blood sampling will occur in
      order to determine the safety profile of cocaethylene. During Part 3, the ability of
      cocaethylene to modify the acute effects of intravenous cocaine will be determined.
      Cocaethylene will be administered in plasma concentrations of 0 ng/ml, 50 ng/ml, or 200 ng/ml
      over an 8-hour period. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive a challenge
      intravenous dose of cocaine (0.5 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg) or placebo at the 4-hour mark of
      cocaethylene infusion. Following the initial 8-hour period, cocaethylene infusion will be
      continued for an additional 5 hours. Behavioral and physiological measures will be collected
      throughout the study sessions at predetermined times to evaluate whether tolerance to
      cocaethylene develops. These measures will also help to determine whether cocaethylene
      modifies or produces tolerance to the effects of an acute dose of cocaine.
