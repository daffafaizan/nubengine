      enhancing the overall immune response, a result that may not occur with a single type of
      vaccine. This trial will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an HIV multi-epitope
      peptide cytotoxic T lymphocyte (HIV CTL MEP) vaccine developed as part of a prime-boost
      strategy and designed to be administered in combination with an HIV DNA vaccine.

      The HIV CTL MEP vaccine is a mixture of four synthetic peptides, each containing one of three
      different HIV CTL epitopes derived from env or gag. The use of multiple conserved CTL
      epitopes will address the extraordinary diversity found among HIV strains. The vaccine is
      administered with RC529-SE, an analogue of monophosphoryl lipid A. The vaccine/adjuvant
      combination will be evaluated with or without coadministration of granulocyte-macrophage
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF).

      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine with the RC529-SE
      adjuvant, the vaccine with both adjuvants (RC529-SE and GM-CSF), or a placebo. The vaccine,
      adjuvants, and placebo will all be given as an injection into the upper arm. Participants
      will have 11 study visits. Study visits will include a physical exam, medical interview, and
      blood and urine tests. Participants will receive an injection at three of these visits: study
      entry and Months 1 and 3. Participants will be followed for 1 year after the last injection.
