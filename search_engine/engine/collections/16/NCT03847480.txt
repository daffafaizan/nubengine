      fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) making one experimental "dose-painting by
      contours" SIB (simultaneous integrated boost) plan with a maximum point dose of 83 Gy. The
      participants will be given 73 Gy and 78 Gy minimum doses to two GTVs (gross tumor volumes
      inside the conventional GTV (68 Gy). GTV_73Gy and GTV_78Gy are determined from the SUV
      (standardized uptake values) from the 18F-FDG PET/CT according to the formula proposed by the
      Ghent group (Van der Straeten et al, R&O -06). It is expected to keep the level of normal
      tissue side-effects within or slightly above the level of conventional radiotherapy (i.e.
      maximum dose of 68 Gy).

      In addition to the routine follow-up, the participants will be examined with 18F-FDG PET/CT
      (3 months after treatment and toxicity scoring at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1 year, 1.5 years and 3
      years after radiotherapy (in addition to the routine follow-up).
