    
      Objectives: the aim of this protocol is to identify biomarker and clinical correlates of
      changes in the barrier function of skeletal muscle membrane (i.e. cell membrane permeability)
      before and after routine motor function testing in patients with one of the Fragile
      Sarcolemmal Muscular Dystrophies (FSMD).

      Study population: patients with early adulthood or later onset of a FSMD (LGMD2B-F, I, L, MM,
      BMD, and MMD3).

      Design: pilot study.

      Outcome measures: increased change in baseline levels of proteins that are released into the
      blood from damaged skeletal muscle, such as creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase
      (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), troponins, and
      myoglobin in serum, changes in inflammation markers, circulating microRNAs and imaging
      studies to identify effective biomarkers for use in future clinical trials.
