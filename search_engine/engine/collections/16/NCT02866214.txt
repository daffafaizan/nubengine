    
      Aim of The Work:

      1- Evaluation of the effect of febuxostat on endothelial dysfunction in hemodialysis
      patients, through detection of:

        1. Primary endpoint:

           â€¢ Reduction in Asymmetrical Dimethylarginine (ADMA)

        2. Secondary endpoints:

             -  Assessing the change in serum High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP)

             -  Assessing the change in serum Uric acid - The criteria for inclusion:

                  1. Outpatients on maintenance hemodialysis.

                  2. Age from 18-70 years old.

                  3. Serum UA level 7.0 mg/dL or more.

                  4. Stable clinical condition (no hospitalization in the previous 3 months)

      The exclusion criteria:

        1. Current urate-lowering therapy. (allopurinol, probenecid, bucolome, febuxostat)

        2. History of hypersensitivity to febuxostat.

        3. Current treatment with mercaptopurine, azathioprine, pyrazinamide, or ethambutol.

        4. Participant in an another clinical trial within the past 4 weeks.

        5. Judged to be unsuitable as a subject by the attending physician.

      After two months , the patient will be reassessed regarding:

      A. ADMA serum level. B. Change in serum hsCRP. C. Change in serum Uric acid level.
