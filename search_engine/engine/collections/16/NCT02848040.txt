      acid malabsorption (BAM).

      SeHCAT (seleno-tauro-homocholic acid) testing is the gold standard for BAM, and involves the
      ingestion of seleno-tauro-homocholic acid, which is limited to a small number of UK centres.
      NICE reported that although SeHCAT might benefits patients, there was a need to explore
      alternative technologies.

      With limited access to and cost of SeHCAT, many centres use an empirical trial of bile acid
      sequestrants, without a diagnosis. This may not be effective as many patients are
      non-adherent.

      This pilot study will evaluate a cheaper and simpler laboratory test, which quantitates
      faecal bile acids. This assay is safer, easier to use, and potentially gives a rapid
      diagnosis in BAM. The aim is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of this new assay.
      In the longitudinal phase of this study, further evaluate of faecal bile acids following bile
      salt sequestrant therapy, will evaluate its role in dose titration.

      The following patients will be recruited (i) post-cholecystectomy; (ii) post-terminal ileal
      resection; or (iii) primary BAM. Patients will have SeHCAT testing and the faecal bile acid
      concentration will be determined.

      Outcomes: The results of faecal bile acid measurement in these patients will be compared with
      SeHCAT to determine its sensitivity and specificity. Longitudinal follow up will determine
      the effect of bile salt sequestration on faecal bile acids. These results would inform the
      design of larger studies, allowing the evaluation of this new test in the NHS.
