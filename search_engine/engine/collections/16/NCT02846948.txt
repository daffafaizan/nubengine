      surgical pathology in perioperative period. This results in unacceptably high mortality. The
      investigators hypothesize that extended hemodynamic monitoring by focused transthoracic
      echocardiography will personalize early fluid resuscitation which will improve patient's
      outcome.

      The goals of the investigators study are:

        -  To conduct two-group randomized controlled clinical trial to compare patient management
           based on standard monitoring and extended hemodynamic monitoring by focused
           transthoracic echocardiography in patients undergoing urgent abdominal surgery due to
           peritonitis.

        -  To demonstrate that patient management based on extended hemodynamic monitoring by
           focused echocardiography results in improved survival, reduced incidence of hemodynamic
           instability during perioperative period.

        -  To compare an amount of administrated of intravenous fluids in both groups.

      The investigators hypothesize that focused echocardiography monitoring will result in more
      administrated intravenous fluids during perioperative period.
