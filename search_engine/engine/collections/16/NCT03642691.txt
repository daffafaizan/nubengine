    
      US adult and pediatric subjects with hypoplasminogenemia requiring plasminogen replacement
      therapy who completed the End of Study visit in the following Prometic-sponsored clinical
      studies: 2002C011G, 2002C013G, 2002C016G, 2002C017G and 2002C019G will continue to receive
      their repeat-dose study of Plasminogen (Human) under a treatment protocol. Approximately, 15
      subjects will be enrolled in the treatment protocol under an expanded access to continue to
      receive Plasminogen (Human) at a dose of 6.6 mg/kg as a 10 to 30-minute intravenous (IV)
      infusion at site visits or at home by either the subject or caregiver at the same frequency
      as in their prior Prometic-sponsored clinical study. Subjects or caregivers may be trained
      for study drug administration as deemed appropriate by the Investigator. Dosing frequency
      will be adjusted by the Investigator based on clinical response and plasminogen activity
      trough levels.

      Subjects who completed the End of Study visit in studies 2002C011G, 2002C013G, 2002C016G,
      2002C017G and 2002C019G and signed informed consent (and assent, if applicable) for the
      present study will be enrolled in this study; this visit will be designated as Day 1 of the
      present study. Subjects will return to their study site every 26 weeks, or more often as
      determined by the Investigator, for safety assessments and measurements of plasminogen
      activity trough levels at the Investigator's discretion.

      Treatment with Plasminogen (Human) will continue until the product has been approved and is
      commercially available or discontinued at any time by the Sponsor or at the discretion of the
      Investigator.
