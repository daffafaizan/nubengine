      outcomes in toddlers with autism. The intervention model (a) targets the foundations of
      social-communication (joint attention, imitation, play), (b) uses naturalistic strategies to
      increase the rate and complexity of social-communication and (c) includes parents as
      implementers of the intervention to promote generalization across settings and activities and
      to ensure maintenance over time.

      In addition to testing the primary effects of this early intervention on the developmental
      outcomes of children with signs of autism, we will examine whether this method is superior to
      an early intervention focused on global infant development. Because brain development occurs
      rapidly in infants and toddlers, we will use high density EEG to investigate (1) biomarkers
      of change in these infants as a result of intervention and (2) biomarkers predicting response
      to treatment, with focus on the neural correlates of social attention and learning from joint
      engagement.

      Study Aims:

      AIM 1: To examine the effects of the experimental intervention (Baby JASPER) on primary
      (joint attention) and secondary outcomes (receptive language, play, symbol-infused joint
      engagement and parent use of social communication support strategies).

      AIM 2: To examine maintenance and generalization of the effects of the experimental
      intervention on children and their parents.

      AIM 3: To examine electrophysiological biomarkers of change with treatment as well as
      predictors of social communication outcomes in children after intervention.

      AIM 4 (exploratory): To examine the effect of potential child level and parent level
      moderators on the primary and secondary outcomes of the study across the two conditions.
