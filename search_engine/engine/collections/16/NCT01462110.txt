      parallel-designed clinical study is to determine the efficacy of an experimental mouth rinse
      on whole-mouth mean plaque and gingivitis scores as an adjunct to brushing after four weeks
      of use.

      The secondary objectives will be to determine the efficacy of the an experimental mouth rinse
      as an adjunct to brushing on whole-mouth mean plaque and gingivitis measured at 2 weeks as
      well as a bleeding assessment according to the Bleeding Index at 2 and 4 weeks. A
      microbiological assessment will be performed to identify and quantify specific oral microbes
      to assess any change in population.
