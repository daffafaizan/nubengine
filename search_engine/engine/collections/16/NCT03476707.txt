      0.39; low blood counts) and hospital total costs from elective colorectal surgery. Total
      costs will be defined as the combination of direct and indirect costs ascertained using
      standardized patient-level costing algorithms (i.e. the standard way that hospital measure
      their costs). Adjustment will be made for factors that are likely to influence both the
      presence of anemia and costs of care.
