      both supply effective analgesia in the first 24 hours after mastectomy. But they do so by
      different mechanishms.

      This study is to survey that ESP and PECs may supply acute and chronic analgesia by reducing
      pain scores in the first 24 hours and 3 months after the surgery, also the comparison of the
      analgesic activity among themselves for acute and chronic pain will be searched.

      In this study patients are divided into three groups. Group A - Patients in group A will have
      COMBIPECs block (PECs2 -> PECs1) in a separate section from the operating rooms (PNB practice
      room). In addition, patient controlled analgesia (PCA) will be used in the first 24 hours
      postoperatively.

      Group B - Patients in group B will have ESP block in a separate section from the operating
      rooms (PNB practice room). In addition, patient controlled analgesia (PCA) will be used in
      the first 24 hours postoperatively.

      Group C - Patients in group C will not be performed planar nerve block. Only general
      anesthesia (GA) will be performed in the operation room. In addition, patient controlled
      analgesia (PCA) will be used in the first 24 hours postoperatively.
