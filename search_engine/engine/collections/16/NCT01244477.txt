      therapeutic response in individuals with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) such that
      interpersonal difficulties and mistrust significantly and negatively impact treatment
      efficacy (Forbes et al., 2003; Forbes et al., 2005; Forbes et al., 2008). In addition, ample
      evidence suggests that psychotherapy improves the social and interpersonal lives of
      psychotherapy clients through improving clients' abilities to regulate their emotions and
      reduce social isolation (Yalom & Leszcz, 2005; Foy et al., 2000). While considerable research
      has been dedicated to exploring the neurobiology of emotional dysregulation associated with
      PTSD (Rauch, Shin, & Phelps, 2006; Etkin & Wager, 2007), and increasing data suggest that
      diverse psychotherapies affect neural functioning (Beauregard 2007), very little is
      understood about the neurobehavioral pathology underlying the debilitating interpersonal
      difficulties in PTSD, or the neurobiological mechanisms accompanying the improvements in
      social functioning that occur with efficacious therapy.

      Thus, the broad goals of this project are two-fold. First, the investigators seek to examine
      the neural substrates associated with interpersonal dysfunction in PTSD using a social
      exchange game previously developed to assess interpersonal trust and cooperation in healthy
      (King-Casas et al., 2005) and psychiatric groups (Chiu et al., 2008; King-Casas et al.,
      2008). Second, the investigators seek to examine changes in neurobehavioral substrates of
      social functioning following treatment for Veterans with PTSD. Specifically, the
      investigators propose to use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavior within
      a well-characterized Trust Game to examine the neural substrates associated with
      interpersonal trust and cooperation in Veterans with PTSD prior to and following empirically
      supported psychotherapy cognitive processing therapy (CPT) for PTSD.
