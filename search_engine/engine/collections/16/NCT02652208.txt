      decision aid and an online, interactive patient decision aid for treatment of Stable Chest
      Discomfort. The study will randomly assign eligible participants to receive either the online
      decision aid or the video decision aid. Participants will complete a survey after reviewing
      the decision aid that will examine decision quality, use of the intervention, and
      satisfaction with the intervention.
