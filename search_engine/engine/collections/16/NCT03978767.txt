      recommended that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be withheld from
      patients with hypertension that persists for more than one day postpartum (1). This
      recommendation is based in data from the general medicine literature, which suggests a role
      of NSAIDs in precipitating hypertension in non-pregnant adults (2,3). It may also draw from
      previously published case reports of post-partum hypertension that were thought to be NSAID
      induced (4). There has been a paucity of data from the obstetric literature to support or
      rebuff this recommendation. As the opioid crisis worsens in the United States, additional
      attention and resources have focused on limiting the use of narcotic medications. The
      effective employment of non-opioid analgesics has been shown to reduce narcotic use (5).
      Ibuprofen and other NSAIDs are the most effective and most commonly prescribed analgesics for
      postpartum pain, but clinicians now find themselves stuck between these recommendations and
      their efforts to limit unnecessary opioid prescriptions.

      The investigators propose a randomized controlled non-inferiority trial of women with
      preeclampsia comparing a postpartum analgesic protocol that includes NSAIDs, to one that
      excludes them. The central hypothesis is that NSAID use does not worsen hypertensive diseases
      of pregnancy.
