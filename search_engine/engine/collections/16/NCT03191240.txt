      support according to the 2015 AHA guideline, including chest compression, intubation,
      ventilation, defibrillation, drug administration, including epinephrine and antiarrhythmic
      drugs if indicated, in the emergency department.

      A research associate generates a random sequence using Excel software, and assignment of
      participants to their respective groups will be undertaken by the principal investigator.

      Arterial line insertion is performed within 6 minutes after randomization and diastolic blood
      pressure will be monitored.

      If diastolic blood pressure is < 20 mmHg, drugs (vasopressin 40 IU or normal saline) will be
      administered for two times during CPR.

      Arterial blood gas analysis will be analyzed for 5, 10, 15, and 20 minutes after arterial
      line insertion or termination of CPR.

      End-tidal carbon dioxide concentrations is monitored in real time during CPR and recorded
      every minute.

      The resuscitated patients receive standard post cardiac arrest care according to the 2015 AHA
      guideline.
