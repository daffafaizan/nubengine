      targeted asthma therapies, which can bring about a real improvement in symptoms and quality
      of life. No data are available on the proportion of this patient population since the advent
      of biotherapies, as well as the impact on quality of life and pathway by phenotype.

      The survey will be conducted using a collection of data on a dedicated questionnaire
      including validated questionnaires on the quality of life and the control of the asthmatic
      disease as well as the therapeutic observance.

      The objectives of the survey are to estimate the phenotypic profile distribution of severe
      asthmatic patients and the proportion currently treated by biotherapies as well as the impact
      of the pathology on the clinical profile and quality of life of patients with severe asthma.

      Investigative pulmonologists selected from university or general hospitals or from private
      practice will propose to their eligible patients to participate in the study. Patients
      informed and not opposed to participating will complete, at the end of the consultation, the
      dedicated questionnaire pre-filled by the pulmonologist (for the medical data required for
      phenotypic stratification). The questionnaires will be collected from the centers and the
      data centralized to establish the database. Analyzes will be done in order to stratify the
      populations according to their phenotype and to analyze the data globally and by subgroup.
