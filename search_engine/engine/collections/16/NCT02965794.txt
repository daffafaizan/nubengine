      with a prospective multicenter design to evaluate the current state of the care process for
      adult colorectal cancer patients who are admitted for surgery. This study will give attention
      to evidence based key interventions, follow-up and interprofessional teamwork necessary to
      provide appropriate care. In 4 countries (Belgium, Germany, France and The Netherlands) 3
      hospitals will participate (total number of hospitals is 12). They will perform a clinical
      audit of the actual organization of the care process, and a team audit on the level of
      interprofessional teamwork. Each team will develop and implement a quality improvement
      initiative based on the concept of care pathways, the findings from the audit and the
      available evidence, and will measure the effect of their improvement strategy.
