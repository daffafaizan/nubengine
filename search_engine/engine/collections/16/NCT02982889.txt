      closure provides temporary analgesia, typically lasting up to 6 hours, and is one aspect of
      the multimodal approach to postsurgical analgesia or fast-track surgery. However, the limited
      duration of action of local anesthetics, even longer acting agents such as bupivacaine,
      result in patients who are likely to experience end of duration breakthrough pain before they
      are able to take or tolerate oral analgesics, thus necessitating the use of strong parenteral
      analgesics in the immediate postsurgical period. LIQ865A and LIQ865B are two distinct
      formulations of bupivacaine manufactured via Liquidia Technologies PRINT (Particle
      Replication In Non-wetting Templates), which Liquidia intends to pursue for product approval.
      Both formulations being tested have the potential for producing long-lasting control of
      post-surgical incisional pain.
