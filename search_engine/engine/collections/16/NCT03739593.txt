      back of the eye. It is designed to dissolve slowly over time, continuously releasing a
      consistent low dose of steroid to treat the symptoms of RVO and associated inflammation with
      a goal of halting further visual disturbance and damage, and also possibly restoring some
      vision as symptoms are controlled. In this study, 2 different formulations are being tested
      to find the optimum combination of efficacy, safety and durability that will offer patients a
      potential treatment option that is as safe and effective as the treatments currently
      available, but which requires less frequent injections and potentially has a lower risk for
      certain side-effects.
