      for patients with (NSTEMI).

      Patients with a GRACE score > 140 belong to the high risk group and the coronary angiography
      has to be performed within 24h.

      Until today for patients with a GRACE score > 140 and an acute or chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) the best approach is not known even though up to 40% of all NESTMI patients belong to
      this population. CKD in connection with an NSTEMI is one predictor for short and long term
      mortality and serious bleeding as a complication of coronary angiography. Additionally
      patient with CKD are at risk to experience a contrast agent induced aggravation of the CKD
      right up to a kidney failure. The pre- and post treatment of the kidneys seem to reduce this
      risk. The irrigation of the kidneys up to 48h prior coronary angiography optimises the kidney
      function and buffers the aggravation of kidney function caused by fluid loss or abstention at
      home.

      Additionally the influence of ischemic precondition on one arm of the patient will be
      evaluated in this setting. First studies give a hint that the kidneys may be protected
      against the contrast agent of the following catheter examination by ischemic precondition.
