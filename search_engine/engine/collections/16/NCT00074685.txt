      ichthyoses and treating them more effectively. The Registry offers blinded information about
      well-characterized groups of individuals with specific diagnoses for study by skin
      biologists, pharmacologists, and others. The Registry also provides information about
      research projects to those that have enrolled in the Registry and expressed an interest in
      participating in studies.

      Participants enrolled in the Registry by contacting the registry officials. All participants
      participated in a phone interview with the study research nurse. Participants were asked
      about diagnostic testing, treatments, birth history, medical history, degree and type of
      involvement, current physical condition, and other family members with skin disorders. A
      quality of life index was embedded in the interview. Participants also indicated whether they
      would like to be contacted about participating in clinical research. This information was
      complemented by an enrollment form from the enrollee's caregiver.

      Diagnosis was confirmed by specific criteria based on clinical involvement, review of
      histology, and where appropriate, serum cholesterol sulfate determination or DNA analysis.
