      researchers in organizing a larger study. The objective of the study is to determine if
      treatment with over the counter nutrients (Vitamin E and Selenium) may improve recovery in
      patients with remote traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). The investigators will enroll 10
      adults with remote traumatic spinal cord injury. The participant will have experienced their
      injury at least one year prior to enrollment, are currently living in the community.
      Participants may not have any other neurological cause of weakness (i.e. stroke or traumatic
      brain injury), must be able to undergo MRI scanning, and be able to take the oral medications
      as prescribed. At the beginning of the study, baseline strength will be measured by a
      standardized (American Spinal Injury Association) exam. This exam will be repeated one year
      after taking the treatment. Furthermore specialized radiological imaging (MRI tractography)
      of the spinal cord will be completed prior to taking the medications, and one year
      subsequently. MRI tractography is advanced imaging technology that is able to generate
      quantitive images of the nerve fiber tracts in the spinal cord that control limb movement. We
      anticipate that treatment with Vitamin E and selenium for a one period year will increase the
      ASIA motor score and/or increase the nerve density of the nerve tracts in the spinal cord
      that control limb movement
