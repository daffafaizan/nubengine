        -  Assess T-cell activation in blood samples of patients receiving trastuzumab (Herceptin®)
           and/or chemotherapy for HER2-positive solid tumors.

      OUTLINE: Blood samples are collected from patients at baseline and on days 21, 42, and 84 of
      trastuzumab (Herceptin®)/chemotherapy. Patients may be contacted 3-6 months after completion
      of trastuzumab/chemotherapy to donate another blood specimen.

      Blood samples are examined for T-cell proliferation and intracellular cytokine production.
      CD8 T-cell response, HER2/neu-specific antibody titers, and skin hypersensitivity test
      responses are also measured.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
