      (LVH), diastolic dysfunction, preserved ejection fraction, and no planned aortic valve
      replacement over the next 6 months will be eligible for this randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, pilot study. There will be a diabetic cohort (n=32) and non-diabetic
      cohort (n=24); each cohort will be randomized 1:1 to tadalafil vs. placebo. During a baseline
      study visit, the following will be obtained: clinical data, 6 minute walk, quality of life
      questionnaire, blood draw, and an echocardiogram. A 3-day run-in will occur to initially
      assess tolerability and compliance. If the drug is tolerated during this run-in period,
      participants will be randomized. An MRI will also be performed during this randomization
      visit. Follow-up study visits and testing will occur at 6 and 12 weeks and 6 months.
