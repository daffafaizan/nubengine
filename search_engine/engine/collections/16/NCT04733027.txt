    
      PEP-010 will be administered on days 1, 2 and 3 every week. Treatment will be administered
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death or withdrawal of consent, whichever
      occurs first. Each cycle will be of 21 days duration.

      The initial starting dose of PEP-010, DL1 is selected based on pre-clinical data at 0.15
      mg/kg. The other doses per injection from DL2 to DL7 are 0.3, 0.6; 1.2; 2.5; 5 and 10 mg/kg.

      For patients in Arm B, PEP-010 will be combined with Paclitaxel, at a dose of 80 mg/mÂ²,
      weekly until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Paclitaxel will be administered
      according to local guidelines.

      Main objective for Dose escalation cohorts is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of PEP-010 when administered as single agent
      (MTD1/RP2D1), and in combination with paclitaxel (MTD2/RP2D2) by recording the dose-limiting
      toxicities (DLTs).

      Main objective for Expansion cohorts is to confirm the RP2Ds of PEP-010 as a single agent
      and/or in combination in patients with metastatic and/or recurrent cancer.

      Secondary objectives are

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of PEP-010 when administered as single agent,
           and in combination with paclitaxel.

        -  To assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of PEP-010 as single agent, and in combination with
           paclitaxel in Dose escalation cohorts.

        -  To assess the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of PEP-010 as single agent, and in
           combination with paclitaxel.

        -  To evaluate the preliminary antitumor activity of PEP-010 alone and in combination with
           paclitaxel, using Objective Response Rate (ORR), Progression-Free Survival (PFS)
           according to RECIST1.1, duration of response, and Overall Survival (OS).

        -  To assess the immunogenicity of PEP-010 as single agent, and in combination with
           paclitaxel in Dose escalation cohorts.
