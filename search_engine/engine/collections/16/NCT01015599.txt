      to obesity prevention becoming a major national health priority. Although schools offer a
      logical choice for a setting to reach a great number of youth, these disappointing findings
      may be due in part to the difficulties of implementing interventions in school settings where
      competing demands for time have made it difficult to add anything other than academics to the
      school day. After-school programs may provide promise for preventing child obesity because
      there are fewer bureaucratic obstacles and curricular inflexibilities. A three-year
      group-randomized controlled trial will be conducted with random assignment at the school
      level . The study will use a nested cross section design with a baseline year, and two
      subsequent intervention years.
