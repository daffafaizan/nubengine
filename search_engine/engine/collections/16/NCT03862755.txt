      unit (ICU) ward right after surgery from August 8 to September 12 of 2017 and those patients
      stayed in ICU for at least 24 hours. Excluded non-lung surgery there were 581 lung surgery
      cases. Investigators adopted the Caprini VTE risk assessment model from Boston Medical Center
      (BMC) in United States of America (USA). According to different risk level, participants
      received different thromboprophylaxis strategies. Early ambulation alone was for patients at
      low risk (Caprini 0-4), early chemoprophylaxis plus early ambulation was for patients at
      moderate (Caprini 5-8) or high risk (Caprini â‰¥9). Early chemoprophylaxis means low-molecular
      weight heparin (LMWH) 3075 IU (WHO Units) injection subcutaneously QD no later than 24 hours
      after surgery. Early ambulation means activity out of bed no later than 24 hours after
      surgery. Thromboprophylaxis contraindication included chest tube drainage more than 500 ml or
      major bleeding during operation or surgeons refusing to use thromboprophylaxis because they
      thought that patients would benefit more from not performing early ambulation or
      chemoprophylaxis. Some patients received chemoprophylaxis after they moved back to regular
      ward out of ICU which was called late chemoprophylaxis which means more than 24 hours after
      surgery. All chemoprophylaxis were used only during hospitalization. When participants were
      discharged, no extended treatment prescribed. However, they were followed up twice on 30 days
      and 60 days after surgery by phone call.
