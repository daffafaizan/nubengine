      prognosis than other rectal cancers, both regarding local recurrence and cancer specific
      survival. With a view to improve local recurrence rates a more extensive perineal operation
      (excision of the levator muscle) has been suggested. In our university hospital thie
      technique was introduced for all surgeons January 2007. A population of all patients operated
      from 1 January 2007 to 31 December 2009 was compared to all patients operated from 1 January
      2004 to 31 December 2006 using the traditional, less extensive method, in all a six year
      period and 158 patients.

      A specific questionnaire was developed after in depth interviews, and was face-validated by
      patients who had undergone an APR. This questionnaire will be sent out to all patients in our
      population who are still alive.

      The patients will be contacted first by a letter of invitation, later called by telephone to
      be given more information and asked for permission to send the questionnaire.

      The send out of invitation letters will start March 2011.
