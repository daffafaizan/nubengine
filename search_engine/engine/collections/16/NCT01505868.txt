    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) of cabazitaxel-carboplatin in the phase I
      portion of the study.

      II. To evaluate progression free survival achieved with cabazitaxel-carboplatin versus
      cabazitaxel alone in men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in the
      phase II portion of the study.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate (percentage of patients with > 50
      % decline).

      II. To correlate changes in bone specific alkaline phosphatase and urine n-telopeptides with
      response.

      III. To evaluate overall survival. IV. To evaluate safety and toxicity. V. To evaluate
      influence of the anaplastic phenotype on response to therapy. VI. To collect and archive
      serum, plasma, and urine samples in study patients for later hypothesis generating
      associations.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a randomized phase II study.

      PHASE I: Patients receive cabazitaxel intravenously (IV) over 60-90 minutes and carboplatin
      IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 10 courses in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PHASE II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive cabazitaxel IV over 60-90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every
      21 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive cabazitaxel IV over 60-90 minutes and carboplatin IV over 60-90
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
