      (CTRL) with a traditional meal pattern. The TRE group consumed 100% of its estimated daily
      energy needs in an 8-hour time window: from 10:00 AM (ante meridiem) to 6:00 PM (post
      meridiem) whilst the CTRL group consumed 100% of its estimated daily energy needs in 3 meals
      between 7:00 AM and 9:00 PM. During the experimental period, training loads were similar in
      the two groups. Athletes were tested before and after 4 weeks of the intervention. Body
      composition , basal metabolism, performances indexes and blood parameters were measured.
