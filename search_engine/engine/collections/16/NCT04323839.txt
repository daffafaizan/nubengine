      confirmed COVID-19 at any clinical state across the United States. Eligible participants will
      be identified through voluntary physician referrals.

      When an eligible patient is referred to the PRIORITY Coordinating Center at UCSF, a UCSF
      study coordinator will follow-up by phone with the patient and consent verbally. The
      participant will be asked to complete an approval to release medical information. The
      investigators will use patient questionnaires to assess symptoms, maternal clinical course,
      pregnancy outcomes, and neonatal outcomes from initial investigation of COVID-19 to 12
      months. The investigators will also obtain all medical records for the participant to data
      abstract key clinical and pregnancy outcomes.
