      Chinese medicine. So we follow the worldly trend to do the research of integrative Chinese
      medicine and western medicine since WHO launched the first global strategy on traditional and
      complementary/alternative medicine (TM/CAM) to assist countries to create a stronger evidence
      base on the safety, efficacy and quality of the TM/CAM products and practices.

      The purpose of our study is to create the evidence of effect on dysmenorrhea by acupuncture.
      The study will be performed under randomized, open, controlled design. The effect of
      acupuncture and control group will be compared including the following outcomes: pain score
      (Visual Analogue Scale), quality of life (SF-36, Taiwan version), overall improvement in
      dysmenorrhea, adverse effects from treatment, requirements for additional medication,
      restriction of daily life activities, absence from work or school.
