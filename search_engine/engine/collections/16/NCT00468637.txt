    
      Association of cardiovascular risk factors and ED is likely due to an impairment of
      endothelial function resulting in a decreased activity of endothelial NO-synthase, which
      plays a major role in physiology of erection. Heart failure is also known to further
      contribute to endothelial dysfunction and hence, this could lead to erectile dysfunction.

      Study Objectives

        1. Evaluation of the influence of cardiovascular risk factors and concomitant medication on
           erectile function in cardiovascular high-risk patients.

        2. Evaluation of the role of heart failure on prevalence and severity of erectile
           dysfunction in men.

        3. Long-term effects of cardiovascular drug therapy and cardiovascular diseases on erectile
           function.

      Study Design Male patients across Europe with cardiovascular diseases (CHD, PAD and heart
      failure) will be evaluated with a standardized questionnaire. Grade of erectile dysfunction
      will be assessed using an ED-score, generated from two different questionnaires.

        1. IIEF-5 - (International Index of Erectile Function)

        2. KEED - (Cologne Evaluation of Erectile Dysfunction)

      Primary Endpoint The primary endpoint is the sum score of the ED rating scale of the KEED
      (KÃ¶lner Erhebungsbogen zur Erektilen Dysfunktion, see Appendix 1). Erectile dysfunction is
      defined as reaching more than 17 points in the sum score.

      Secondary Endpoint The first secondary endpoint is the frequency of sexual activity and
      sexual desire. Another secondary endpoint contains satisfaction with sex life and general
      well-being. Men are defined as dissatisfied by answering "mixed" or "worse".

      Follow-Up: after 1 year, after 2 years.
