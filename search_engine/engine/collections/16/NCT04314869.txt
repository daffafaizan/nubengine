      The laparoscopic procedure increases safety and provides the benefits of minimally invasive
      surgery to the grafting technique already described by laparotomy. The objective of the
      present study is to develop a pilot program in the transplant of a living donor. We include 5
      pairs of uterine donor-transplant recipients indicated for sterility by absolute uterine
      factor due to Mayer Rokitansky Syndrome. Patients will undergo surgery for this transplant
      and after 6 months of it with correct function of the graft, embryos will be transferred in
      order to achieve pregnancy. C-section will be performed for delivery. The attempt of two
      gestations (if there are sufficient cryopreserved embryos for a second gestation) and
      withdrawing the graft (hysterectomy) and, therefore, immunosuppression is agreed.
