    
      Prospective, multicenter, cluster randomized controlled, usual care conditions, open,
      blinded-endpoint trial of acute stroke patients with suspected acute large vessel occlusion
      (LVO) identified by EMS at first assistance on the field, in which two strategies will be
      compared: transfer to the closest local stroke center (Local-SC) Vs. direct transfer to an
      endovascular stroke center (EVT-SC).

      The RACE scale (Rapid Arterial oCclusion Evaluation) will be used as a prehospital screening
      tool to identify acute stroke patients with suspicion of LVO. Upon candidate identification,
      EMS will contact a stroke neurologist on call using a prehospital telestroke system who will
      confirm inclusion criteria and will allocate the subjects to a specific intervention
      according to a pre-established temporal sequence. Allocation will account for 3 strata: time
      band (two groups of 12 hours), territory (metropolitan versus provincial area) and week day
      (working versus weekend day).

      Subjects will be followed up to 90 days post-randomization.
