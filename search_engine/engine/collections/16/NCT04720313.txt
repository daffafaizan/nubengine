      approach, as for approved products, but target the B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) rather
      than the CD19 antigen targeted by KYMRIAHTM (tisagenlecleucel) and YESCARTATM (axicabtagene
      ciloleucel).

      Importantly, successful results from at least three clinical trials of a BCMA targeted CAR T
      therapy were published (Zhao 2018, Brundo 2018, Raje 2019), with excellent results obtained
      for relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (MM) patients, that validate the approach. The
      CAR vector employed for HBI0101 CART is almost identical to the vector employed for the
      clinical study reported by Raje 2019, therefore, a strong therapeutic response is expected
      also for HBI0101 CART together with a similar manageable safety profile
