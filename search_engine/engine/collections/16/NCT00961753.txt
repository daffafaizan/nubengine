      over-circulation and systemic under-circulation. The PDA often fails to close using currently
      approved Ibuprofen dosing regimens, and surgical closure becomes necessary. Ibuprofen
      clearance in premature neonates is significantly correlated with postnatal age, increasing
      rapidly over time. Hirt et al. published and optimized dosing scheme for preterm neonates
      based on pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data. We aim to use this dosing regimen in the
      clinical setting to determine if increased rates of pharmacologic PDA closure can be
      achieved.
