    
      This is an open-label study. Each subject's visit schedule will allow assessments after
      defined periods of exposure to UT-15C SR (3, 6, 12, 24 and 36 months total exposure). The
      study will continue with yearly visits beyond 36 months until either UT-15C SR is approved by
      the appropriate regulatory authorities or the study is discontinued by the sponsor.
      Therefore, the actual date of each visit will be determined by the date on which the subject
      first received UT-15C SR (e.g., the date of study drug initiation in TDE-PH- 301, TDE-PH-302,
      or TDE-PH-308 for subjects who were randomized to active therapy in those trials,and the date
      of UT-15C SR initiation in this study for subjects who were randomized to placebo in the
      previous controlled trial). Note that the TDE-PH-202, TDE-PH-203, TDE-PH-205 studies are
      open-label design and therefore will follow the regimen for subjects receiving UT-15C SR.
