      of infectious diseases. In this context, the optimization of the management of septic
      patients from their reception in the emergency services must be a priority. However there are
      no predictors of progression or severity in patients admitted to emergencies despite the
      recommendations emphasizing the need for screening and early therapeutic management. Many
      scores have been proposed for intensive care unit but they remain difficult to extrapolate to
      other services because they are very comprehensive and require information that is difficult
      to obtain for emergency physicians.
