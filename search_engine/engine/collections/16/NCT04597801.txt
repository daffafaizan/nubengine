      offers a crucial tool for the rapid assessment of tumor entity and dignity and the creation
      of tumor-free resection margins. The method, however, remains unreliable and time-consuming,
      sometimes prolonging surgical times and demonstrating diagnostic accuracy for frozen section
      in glioma ranging from 78.4% to 95% in comparison to the final histopathology, depending on
      the technique used.2,3 To combat these shortcomings, another promising adjunct was developed
      in the form of intraoperative dye-dependent in-vivo microscopy, for which there has been
      little scientific evidence so far, with only a few recent studies exploring its utility,
      safety and general applicability. The theoretical idea of the technique in principle is to
      allow for histopathological assessment of tumor tissue in-vivo without the need for
      time-consuming fixation and transport of resected tissue biopsies, aiming for a so-called
      in-situ digital biopsy and thereby substantially improving operative precision and surgical
      times. It stands to reason that the benefit in visualization provided by fluorescein staining
      may further be driven through in-vivo microscopy. Altogether, with the use of fluorescein
      sodium in in-vivo microscopy, the operating surgeon may in the future inspect supposedly
      malignant fluorescent tissue first-hand, evaluate it for tumorous cells in real-time and
      adjust their resection strategy in a far more immediate fashion.
