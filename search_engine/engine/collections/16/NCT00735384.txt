      a new stimulator system and leg support system. This new, small, light and portable
      measurement system accurately measures patients' muscle forces. The system produces
      repeatable results. Over a long-time time period, this system will be applied to ICU patients
      and patients with primary myopathies, e.g. muscular dystrophy Duchenne or myotonias, and
      their ankle dorsiflexor isometric torques measured after electrical peroneal nerve
      stimulation. Torques will be amplified and converted into electrical signals by a Whetstone
      bridge, and data will be stored on a computer (LabView system). Stimulated torque responses
      will be obtained regularly, and subsequently the individualized curves will be determined.
      Electromyogram will be performed at each recording session. For all subjects possible, the
      investigators will continue to monitor their stimulated muscle forces during their recovery
      periods or disease progression. Type of data: Variables of isometric skeletal muscle
      contractions, such as peak torques, contraction and relaxation times and torque latencies. To
      find an assumed difference of 50% in strength, at least 30 individuals (power 0.9) are
      required.

      Values will be compared to patients voluntary forces, determined by Muscle Research Council
      (MRC) and Manual Muscle Test (MMT) scores.

      Additionally, skin resistances of edema patients will by determined employing a twitch
      stimulator and an oscilloscope. We are interested whether edema (fluid) changes tissue
      resistance. Data are required to redesign the new stimulation unit of the muscle force
      measuring system.
