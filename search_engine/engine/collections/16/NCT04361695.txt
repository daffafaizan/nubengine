      III-IV hemorrhoidal disease. However it is associated with intense postoperative pain that
      requires the use of multimodal analgesia. Inadequate pain control leads to the prolongation
      of admission, increasing the consumption of opioid analgesics, patients dissatisfaction with
      treatment.

      According to international guidelines of pain management the target level of postoperative
      pain should be 3-4 or less Visual Analogue Score (VAS) points. The multimodal analgesia
      including Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs), acetaminophen and local anaesthetics
      are used to reach this aim.

      However, there are data on effectiveness of preemptive analgesia in anorectal surgery.
      Preemptive analgesia allows decreasing pain in postoperative period after hemorrhoidectomy.

      Ketoprophenum is used as an preemptive analgetic agent 1 hour prior to procedure.

      The aim of this prospective, randomized, double-blind study is to assess the effectiveness of
      the use of preemptive analgesia with Ketoprophenum 10 mg 2 hours before procedure per os with
      spinal anaesthesia to decrease postoperative pain and the amount of used analgesics.
