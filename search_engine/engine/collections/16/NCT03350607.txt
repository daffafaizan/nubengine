      distortions, central scotoma, and diplopia. No medical treatment is yet available.

      ERM surgery requires separation of normal retina and epiretinal membrane. After epiretinal
      peeling, if internal limiting membrane (ILM) is not spontaneously peeled with ERM, surgeon
      peels ILM from retina (also named active peeling). Initiation of peeling is very accurate and
      delicate. Either microscopic forceps or sweeper are used to initiate peeling. Sweeper is a
      microscopic tool with a soft silicon tip covered with diamond dust which allows peeling
      initiation without retina prehension. It may reduce retinal trauma and visual sequelae.

      ILM active peeling reduces recurrence of ERM and rate of repeat surgery. No visual acuity
      loss has been found. But 2 studies show increase of micro scotoma at micro-perimetry after
      active ILM peeling with forceps.

      Purpose of our study is to evaluate use of sweeper during 20 ERM surgeries. The investigator
      will compare microperimetry before surgery versus those after 1 month (M1) and 3 months (M3),
      and measure difference of number and depths of micro scotoma.

      The investigator will note: number of forceps uses if sweeper is inefficient, all areas of
      sweeper use to correlate them with micro scotoma.

      The investigator will evaluate visual and optical coherence tomography improvement after
      surgery.

      Our study doesn't include any intervention while surgeries would be realized with or without
      study participation. Examinations are non-invasive, usual, and done during usual medical
      visit without additional visit.
