      Primary

        -  Compare time to prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression in patients with
           margin-positive tumors after undergoing radical prostatectomy for high-grade prostate
           cancer treated with docetaxel versus observation.

      Secondary

        -  Compare PSA doubling time in patients treated with these regimens.

        -  Compare quality of life of these patients.

        -  Compare overall and metastasis-free survival of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a prospective, open-label, randomized, multicenter study. Patients are
      stratified according to participating center and tumor stage (pT2 vs pT3). Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21
           days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, directly after and 6 months after completing study
      treatment, and then annually thereafter.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo observation until PSA progression (defined as PSA â‰¥ 0.5 ng/mL)
           Quality of life is assessed at baseline, week 19, and annually thereafter.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 396 patients will be accrued for this study.
