      external beam radiotherapy (median dose 68 Gy). All patients received neoadjuvant
      antiandrogen therapy. The primary endpoint was disease progression at 36 months based on a
      trifecta definition of failure: (a) radiological evidence of metastatic disease or b)
      initiation of further antineoplastic therapy or c) biochemical failure). Two definitions of
      biochemical failure were used: 1) rising PSA with a final value >1.0 ng/mL and 2) rise above
      PSA nadir + 2 ng/mL. Secondary endpoints were overall survival, disease-specific survival,
      and positive prostate biopsy at 36 months.
