      assessed for lateral neck flexor endurance and compared to age and gender matched controls.
      Basic demographic information will be collected, and all individuals will report Neck
      Disability Index (NDI) and Numeric Pain Rating Scales (NPRS) for their neck, as well duration
      of any neck pain. All participants will then undergo testing of lateral neck flexor muscle
      endurance, repeated twice on each side. Average hold times will be compared for individuals
      with hyperlaxity (5 or greater on Beighton scale) and the healthy age and gender matched
      controls. Analysis will also include covariates of NDI scores, pain scores, and chronicity of
      symptoms.
