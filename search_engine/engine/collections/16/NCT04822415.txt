      2% mepivacaine hydrochloride with 1:100,000 epinephrine compared to 3.4 mL 4% articaine
      hydrochloride with 1:100,000 epinephrine on the success of the inferior alveolar nerve block
      for patients with symptomatic irreversible pulpitis in mandibular molars. Patients were
      clinically and radiographically examined and their eligibility assessed and preoperative pain
      was measured using the numerical rating scale (NRS). Patients were randomly assigned to one
      of 2 groups: experimental group (2% mepivacaine) and the control group (4% articaine). After
      15 minutes of the inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB), patients reporting lip numbness had
      their molars accessed. No-to-mild pain response was considered success during root canal
      preparation.
