      of Terazosin (TZ) in a single cohort of 6 healthy adult participants (3 men and 3 women.)
      During the study participants will undergo PET/CT scans, 7-Tesla MRI scans, blood draws, and
      an optional lumbar puncture (LP.) Participants will have their baseline ATP levels measured
      (at 0mg TZ.) They will then take doses of TZ at 1mg and will increase their dose on a weekly
      basis by 1mg until they reach a total dose of 5mg. ATP levels will be assessed on study days
      8 and 36. Participants interested in voluntarily donating a sample of cerebral spinal fluid
      will undergo an optional lumbar puncture on study day 37.

      The purpose of the study is to gain a better understanding of the mechanisms in which TZ acts
      in the brain. TZ was recently discovered to increase energy levels (in the form of ATP
      molecules) in the brain by enhancing glycolysis. By using different brain imaging techniques,
      blood assays and cerebral spinal fluid assays, the study will attempt to: 1) quantify the
      rate of glycolysis in the brain at different dosages of TZ, 2) quantify ATP levels in the
      brain at different dosages of TZ, 3) quantify ATP levels in blood at different dosages of TZ,
      and 4) assess the brain permeability of TZ. It is hoped that knowledge gained from the study
      will help guide future clinical trials using TZ for the treatment of various
      neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's Disease.
