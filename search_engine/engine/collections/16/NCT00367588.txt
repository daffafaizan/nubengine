      period of cytopenia, during which there is an increased risk of infection. Mucositis can also
      develop in these patients, enabling micro-organisms, belonging to the endogenous intestinal
      flora, to translocate from the intestine to the lymphoid tissue and blood. Therefore, when
      mucositis and cytopenia develop simultaneously, the risk of infection increases further. In
      this regard bloodstream infection by Gram negative rods and yeasts are an important cause of
      serious infections causing considerable morbidity.

      In order to reduce the risk of infection several preventive measures have been adopted.
      Fundamentally, all of these measures were designed to prevent either acquisition of Gram
      negative rods or fungal pathogens from the environment, or the translocation of these
      potential pathogens across the mucosal barrier of the gut. These measures include protective
      (or reverse) isolation, antibiotic prophylaxis with antibiotics which selectively eradicate
      the aerobic Gram negative rods and yeasts from the gut flora, and finally the use of
      low-bacterial diets.

      In this prospective, randomized study on the efficacy of low bacterial diet, in comparison to
      normal hospital diet, gut colonization by aerobic Gram negative rods and yeasts, the
      occurrence of infections and the total costs of hospital care were chosen as study endpoints.
