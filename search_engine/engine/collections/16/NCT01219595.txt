      infections (E. coli strains) that are present in the intestine. The bacteria will be
      collected and analyzed before and after eating either sweetened, dried cranberries or
      strawberry fruit pieces. This study will help us learn more about whether or not the
      components of consumed sweetened, dried cranberries or strawberry fruit pieces reduce the
      numbers of harmful E. coli bacteria in the vaginal and intestinal tracts, thereby reducing
      the number of urinary tract infections among women.
