        -  Characterize five established Los Angeles (LA)-based, peer-led African American Breast
           Cancer Survivor (AABCS) support groups by identifying and evaluating the successful
           elements of structure and process that distinguish these groups: the purpose and goals;
           theories and techniques that are utilized; the structure of the group and implementation
           of specific goals; the cultural aspects that are incorporated to enhance the efficacy;
           and similarities and differences among these AABCS support groups.

        -  Develop a preliminary "Culturally Informed Breast Cancer Support Group Guide" on how to
           organize and maintain support groups, modeled on the "best model" experiences of the
           five established LA-based support groups for AABCS.

        -  Conduct three needs-assessment focus groups and 5 key informant interviews in the Inland
           Empire to evaluate the psychosocial needs and resources of AABCS in that region.

      OUTLINE: At least 10 support group leaders (2 from each support group) undergo
      semi-structured interviews to elicit information about the needs of breast cancer survivors
      in their community and the cultural modes of support that are given. Eight to twelve African
      American Breast Cancer Survivors (AABCS) participate in 5 focus group discussions and
      complete a questionnaire about their breast cancer and experience with support groups for
      qualitative and quantitative analysis.

      At least 5 Inland Empire community leaders undergo semi-structured interviews to elicit
      information about the needs of breast cancer survivors in their community. Eight to twelve
      AABCS from the Inland Empire participate in 3 focus group discussions and complete a
      questionnaire about their breast cancer and experience with support groups for qualitative
      and quantitative analysis.
