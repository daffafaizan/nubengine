      intraepithelial lesions (SIL) in a population sample of the State of Mexico.

      Patients:

      The inclusion criteria were women submitted to a colposcopy study at the Clinic 221 of the
      Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS), Maternal-Perinatal Hospital "Monica Pretelini"
      (HMPMP), State of Mexico Health Institute (ISEM) and the Medical Research Center (CICMED),
      Autonomous University of State of México (UAEMex). Women with previous conization were not
      considered into the study and those whose clinical follow up was lost were excluded.

      Sociodemographic factors:

      Patients were given a questionnaire to measure the following potential risk factors: age,
      area of residence, education level, sexual partners, participation in anal sex, age at first
      intercourse, smoking, use of hormonal contraception, use of condoms, number of pregnancies
      and vaginal deliveries.

      Cervical samples:

      Samples were collected by cervical scraping and were preserved in ThinPrep® PreservCyt®
      Solution (HologicTM Marlborough, Massachusetts, USA).

      HPV genotyping:

      DNA extraction from the cervical swab samples was performed using the Amplicor kit (Roche®,
      Mannheim, Germany), isolating simultaneously the β-globin gene along with HPV. HPV positive
      specimens were subsequently genotyped using the Linear Array HPV Genotyping assay (Roche®,
      Mannheim, Germany). This test is a qualitative in vitro test for the detection of HPV
      utilizing amplification of target DNA by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and nucleic acid
      hybridization able to detect 37 anogenital HPV DNA genotypes (6, 11, 16, 18, 26, 31, 33, 35,
      39, 40, 42, 45, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 58, 59, 61, 62, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73
      (MM9), 81, 82 (MM4), 83 (MM7), 84 (MM8), IS39 and CP6108). This technique can detect multiple
      HPV genotypes in the same sample.

      Ethical concerns:

      We followed the Declaration of Helsinki and all patients were asked to sign the written
      informed consent. This study was accepted by the Research and Ethical Committee of the
      CICMED.

      Statistical analysis:

      First, descriptive analyzes were performed, secondly, Odds Ratios (OR) and their associated
      95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated as well as Chi-square tests and conditional
      regression model for SIL using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 17.0
      software. Difference was considered significant at p ≤ 0.05.
