      ISF35 treatment is well tolerated and patients did not experience any significant or
      unexpected adverse events. Patients reported flu-like symptoms from ISF35, which disappeared
      within one to three days.

      The trials also showed that ISF35 stimulates the immune system to act against CLL cells and
      sensitize leukemic cells to subsequent treatment. Repeat infusions of ISF35 administered as a
      single agent to subjects with CLL resulted in durable reductions in circulating and
      lymph-node bound leukemic cells. Furthermore, CLL patients with 17p deletion responded to
      standard courses of FCR after receiving ISF35 and achieved durable remissions.

      ISF35 is an abbreviation for Immune Stimulatory Factor 35, an offspring of technology
      discovered by Dr. Thomas J. Kipps, MD, PhD, Professor, Department of Medicine and Deputy
      Director for Research,UCSD Moores Cancer Center.
