      half of these deaths are due to sudden cardiac death caused by ventricular arrhythmias. HD
      patients have an attenuated heart rate variability (HRV) and a high frequency of ventricular
      arrhythmias, both of which are predictors of sudden cardiac death(SCD). n-3 polyunsaturated
      fatty acids (PUFA) improves HRV and reduces the risk of SCD. n-3 PUFAs are obtained from
      fatty fish and fish oil and are incorporated into cell membranes after long-term ingestion.
      However, it is not known if this incorporation is essential or merely serves as storage for
      n-3 free PUFAs to be release during for instance myocardial ischaemia.

      The study hypothesis is that intravenous infusion of a lipid emulsion with a high content of
      n-3 PUFAs will improve HRV and ventricular repolarization and reduce ventricular arrhythmias
      via an acute increase in free non-esterified n-3 PUFAs in plasma.

      In a randomized, placebo-controlled design a n-3 PUFA rich emulsion (or placebo) will be
      administered during hemodialysis treatment. The two study groups will be compared with
      respect to heart rate variability, ventricular repolarization parameters, ventricular ectopic
      beats and arrhythmias and the content of n-3 PUFA in plasma and cell membranes will be
      compared.
