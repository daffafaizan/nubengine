      be prospectively enrolled. At the 1st visit (before the start of endocrine therapy (tamoxifen
      or aromatase inhibitor)) and at the 2nd visit (at ~3 months after the start of treatment),
      demographical / clinical data and blood samples will be collected. We will evaluate the
      hemostatic biological profiles associated with the use of endocrine therapy by comparing
      hemostatic biomarkers before and during its use.
