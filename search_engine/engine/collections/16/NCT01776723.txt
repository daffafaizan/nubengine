      is completed as planned, no more than 53 subjects are expected to enroll onto this study at a
      rate of approximately 3 subjects every month. For the Phase 2 study the Simon's optimal
      two-stage design will be employed to test the null hypothesis that response rate (RR) equals
      to 10% versus the alternative that RR equals to 30%.

      Demographic and clinical variables for the study patients will be summarized using
      descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, median, inter-quartile range, range, and
      frequency counts and percentages). Safety and efficacy data will be analyzed overall as well
      as separately for each dose cohort when appropriate.
