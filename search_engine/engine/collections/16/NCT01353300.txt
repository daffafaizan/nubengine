        -  To determine if DICER1 mutations contribute to tumor pathogenesis in cystic nephromas
           and cystic partially differentiated nephroblastomas outside of families with
           pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB) syndrome.

      OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples are analyzed for DICER1 mutation by qPCR and directly sequenced
      using BigDye Terminator chemistry. Results are then compared against the single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) database.
