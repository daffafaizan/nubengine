    
      This is a single center, double-blind, placebo controlled, randomized study to assess the
      efficacy of EMW versus placebo in the treatment of premenopausal women (16-49 years of age)
      with endometriosis associated pain. Approximately 40 subjects with endometriosis will be
      enrolled at Madigan Army Medical Center (MAMC). Subjects will be asked to consume EMW (or
      placebo) for three months. Subjects will record daily pain levels and other symptoms
      associated with endometriosis in an electronic diary. In addition to standard of care for
      this condition, the investigator will monitor the subjects at baseline, Month 1, and Month 3
      visits, which will consist of patient questionnaires, blood sampling, and Adverse Events
      monitoring.
