      MOH-diagnosis is based on least 3 months previous detailed history and at least 1 month
      fulfilled headache diary or headache calendar prior to the visit.

      Patients were allocated to either program A or B by a concealed randomization process. The
      patients were randomized in blocks of 10 by use of opaque, sealed envelopes.

      Statistics Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 22 is used for statistical
      calculations. Continuous variables are presented as mean (SD) and median (25-75 percentiles).
      For normal distributed continuous variables the investigators use paired and unpaired
      student's T-test, while for skewed distribution the investigators used Mann-Whitney test.
      Categorical variables is presented as percentage (N), and analyzed by chi-square test. All
      results are shown as intention-to-treat (ITT). The p-value is two-sided and p â‰¤ 0.05 is
      considered as significant.

      The primary outcome is reduction in headache days per month. Clinical relevant difference is
      estimated to 20% between the two groups. The standard deviation based on previous published
      literature was estimated to 35%. Accepting an alfa-error on 5% and 80% power, 80 patients are
      needed. Based on previous studies, it is assumed that the drop-out rate will be approximately
      15-20%. Therefore the investigators aim to include 100 patients corresponding to 50 in each
      group.
