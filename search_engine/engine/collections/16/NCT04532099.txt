      referred to as Part B, to pursue exploratory objectives. The initial study was relabeled as
      Part A.

      Part A of this study is a randomized, double-masked, crossover study comparing 2 contact lens
      products. The expected duration of subject participation in Part A is approximately 8 weeks
      with 5 scheduled visits. Part A completed on February 04, 2021.

      Part B of this study is a single arm, single masked (subject) study with 1 contact lens
      product. The expected duration of subject participation in Part B is approximately 4 weeks
      with 3 scheduled visits.

      A subject may participate in both parts of the study. Each part is anticipated to enroll up
      to 66 subjects, for a total of 132 subjects (Part A and Part B).
