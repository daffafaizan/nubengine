      I. To describe perfusion computed tomography (CT) parameters and their changes in non-small
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tumors prior to, during, 1 month after, and 3 months after
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate tumor perfusion parameters with clinical tumor response on follow up per
      standard of care.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To correlate changes in serum levels of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation and
      circulating tumor cell (CTC) with clinical response rates and perfusion parameters.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo dynamic perfusion computed tomography (DPCT) at baseline, during SBRT (after
      2 of 3 fractions or 3 of 5 fractions), and then at 1 and 3 months post stereotactic body
      radiation therapy.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.
