      of blindness associated with retinal vascular disease. Macular edema is a major cause of
      vision loss in patients presenting with central and hemi vein occlusions. Until recently the
      standard of care for macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion was
      observation. Recent investigations of steroids for this condition has shown greater visual
      benefit but is associated with risks such as cataract formation and increased intraocular
      pressure. In the past laser photocoagulation has been used, but was found to offer no visual
      benefits over the natural history in the treatment of macular edema associated with CRVO.

      Bevacizumab, an anti-VEGF agent, is a potent inhibitor of vascular permeability, with the
      potential to reduce retinal vascular leakage and diminish macular edema. In addition, as an
      anti-VEGF agent, it may also inhibit neovascularization of the iris, a frequent complication
      of ischemic central retinal vein occlusion. Bevacizumab use as an intravitreal agent does
      carry the risk of intraocular infection but probably carries very low risk of glaucoma or
      cataract formation, making it a potentially safer pharmacologic treatment for CRVO associated
      macular edema as compared to steroids.

      Ozurdex (dexamethasone) Intravitreal Implant is a steroid injected into the eye to treat
      swelling that may occur when there is a blockage of certain blood vessels in your eyes.
      Ozurdex is also used to treat non-infectious uveitis affecting the posterior (rear) segment
      of the eye.
