      surgeries. However, the limited duration of these blocks was shown to be the main problem
      encountered intra-operatively. Therefore, additional top-up doses are usually needed to
      continue the operation. Many kinds of research tried to introduce solutions in order to
      prolong the duration of the local anesthetics used. Many researchers tried different volumes,
      doses and adjuvant to local anesthetics, and studied their effects There are many studies
      that evaluated the effect of baricity of local anesthetic on the potency of motor block and
      the duration of motor and sensory blockade.

      However, no properly designed randomized, controlled studies have evaluated the feasibility
      and reliability of baricity local anesthetic agents used for the peribulbar block.

      Aim of the work prospective, randomized study was conducted to evaluate the effects of the
      baricitized bupivacaine used for the peribulbar block in patients undergoing posterior
      segment surgeries.
