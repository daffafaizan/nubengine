      of their child's health care team. They are responsible for managing their child's treatment
      program, and act as advocates for their child to support positive adaptation to JIA and to
      learn self-management skills for the disease. This is in the context of managing the
      financial, logistical, emotional, and social demands of parenting in general. Within
      pediatric tertiary care centres, peer-support programs for parents of children with JIA are
      often limited or difficult to access. The iParent2Parent Program aims to fill this gap in
      services by offering a program of trained parent peer mentors who can provide practical
      coping advice, foster adaptive problem solving, and provide social support via shared lived
      experience.
