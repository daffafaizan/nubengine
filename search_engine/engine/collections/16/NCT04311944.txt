      until they have been in care for 6 to 12 months. Once they have achieved an undetectable
      viral load and/or high adherence, patients qualify for expedited services with fewer clinic
      visits. The problem with this approach is that it's time-intensive early in ART care, when
      attrition rates are highest. A potential solution to this problem is to provide earlier
      fast-track care for patients on dolutegravir-based regimens with viral suppression. This
      strategy is feasible due to the high potency and rapid declines in viral load with
      dolutegravir-based regimens.

      We will compare a strategy of early fast-track care (8 to 12 weeks, for patients with viral
      suppression) versus standard initiation of fast-track care (after 6 months in care, with
      viral suppression). All participants will receive the same ART regimen, the combination
      regimen of Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate-Lamivudine-Dolutegravir.
