      an accurate 3-D picture of the local anatomy. This helps the planners to maximise the
      radiation dose delivered to the prostate, whilst minimising the dose to surrounding normal
      tissue. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanning is an established diagnostic imaging
      technique that provides even clearer images of the local anatomy. However, until recently the
      technology hasn't existed to allow us to perform MRI scans with patients "set-up" in the
      position required to plan and deliver radiotherapy to the prostate. This study is being
      performed to assess methods that may allow us to incorporate MRI scans into the radiotherapy
      planning process, which may further increase the accuracy of the treatment, reducing the
      irradiation of surrounding normal tissue and minimising toxicity.
