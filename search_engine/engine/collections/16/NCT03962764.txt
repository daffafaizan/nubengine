    
      The overall evaluation plan for the Growing Responsible Fathers program (Fatherhood PRIDE)
      will utilize both a process evaluation and an outcomes evaluation, and will include both
      quantitative and qualitative approaches. Pre- and post-test surveys will be used to measure
      short-term outcomes outlined in the logic model including whether or not there has been an
      increase in self-efficacy and knowledge related to personal finance, parent engagement,
      healthy relationships, and education. Pre-test surveys will be administered at intake and/or
      prior to program activity and post-test surveys will be conducted at the conclusion of the
      program activity.

      Intermediate outcomes will be measured using a follow-up survey at six (6) months after
      completing the primary components of the program. The follow-up surveys will be administered
      via a variety of methods in order to increase response rates and will measure outcomes
      identified in the logic model such as knowledge and self-efficacy.

      Additional attempts will be made online through an email invitation as well as with phone
      calls. Center for Community Initiatives staff will be responsible for conducting the
      follow-up surveys with the program participants. Focus groups will be conducted with a
      volunteer sample of participants at the end of their program workshops to assess satisfaction
      with the program, what worked, and what could be improved.
