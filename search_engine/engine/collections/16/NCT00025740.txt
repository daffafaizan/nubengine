    
      Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder (DSM IV) (American Psychiatric
      Association) that follows exposure to an extremely traumatic stressor in which an individual
      experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with actual or threatened death or serious injury
      to self or others. The main goal of treatment in patients with PTSD is to significantly
      reduce symptom severity across reexperiencing, avoidance and hyperarousal symptoms along with
      improvement in function. While numerous approaches have been used to treat PTSD, these
      treatments are limited by variable response rates, up to a 6-week lag period prior to the
      onset of clinical response, and sub-optimal side effect profile, including possible worsening
      of anxiety and insomnia prior to clinical response.

      The proposed double blind study will examine whether combined treatment with a benzodiazepine
      (clonazepam) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) (paroxetine) in patients with
      PTSD will accelerate the onset of clinical response. A second goal is to evaluate whether the
      rapid and clinically meaningful benefits are sustained until the end of the study, despite
      tapering off the benzodiazepine at the midpoint of the study. The safety and tolerability of
      a combination of paroxetine and clonazepam will be compared to paroxetine and placebo in the
      treatment of PTSD.

      We hypothesize that treatment with a combination of clonazepam and paroxetine will result in
      a rapid reduction of PTSD symptoms compared to treatment with placebo and paroxetine. We also
      propose that this accelerated reduction of symptoms will be sustained until the end-point of
      the study, despite tapering off the benzodiazepine at the midpoint of the study.
