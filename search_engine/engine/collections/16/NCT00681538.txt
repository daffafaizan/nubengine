      single-blind four week treatment period to identify subjects with a capacity to respond to
      Sativex; eligible, consenting subjects entered a seven day screening period prior to
      returning to the study centre to begin a four week single-blind course of Sativex treatment.
      At the end of this phase, subjects' response to Sativex was assessed; those with the capacity
      to respond (i.e. at least a 20% reduction in mean 0-10 point numerical rating scale (NRS)
      spasticity score between screening and the end of the four week Phase A treatment) were
      eligible for entry into Phase B while those who did not respond took no further part in the
      study other than a follow up visit 14 days later.

      Phase B was a 12 week double-blind, randomised, placebo controlled, parallel group study with
      visits at 28 day intervals and a final follow up visit 14 days after completion or
      withdrawal.

      The level of spasticity, spasm frequency and sleep disruption were collected each day during
      the entire study via an interactive voice response system (IVRS). In addition, study
      medication dosing data were recorded via IVRS throughout Phases A and B. Assessments of other
      secondary and functional measures of spasticity, safety and tolerability, QOL (quality of
      life) and mood were also gathered throughout the study.
