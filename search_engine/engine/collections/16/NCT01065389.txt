      functional capacity and quality of life due to uremia, steroids, frequent dialysis and
      fatigue. During dialysis, physical inactivity further deteriorates the patient's functional
      capacity. Aerobic or strength training may combat this physical inactivity. It may also
      improve the functional capacity and quality of life. Recent studies have claimed the benefits
      of resistance exercises in improving functional capacity. But they have not documented
      effects on kidney function (electrolyte and urea kinetics) and muscle wasting (protein
      catabolic rate). In our trial, we attempt to study the effects of resistance training in
      improvement of renal function and muscle wasting apart from functional capacity and quality
      of life in dialysis patients
