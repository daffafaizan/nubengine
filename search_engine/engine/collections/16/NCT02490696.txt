      hypoxia in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.

      Two PET scans will be performed with FAZA and F-Miso tracers. The time between these twi PET
      scans will be 24 hours.

      another 24 hours after the late PET scan, the surgery will be done and a piece of tumor will
      be collected.

      Piece of tumor will be analysed by immunohistochemistry for hypoxia markers.

      The results of immunohistochemistry will be correlated with the biodistribution of the two
      tracers.
