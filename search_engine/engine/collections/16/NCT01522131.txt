      of Dentistry. These individuals will have already been diagnosed with chronic periodontitis
      and require surgical intervention to treat the disease process. All patients will have
      received initial periodontal therapy consisting of oral hygiene instructions and scaling and
      root planing. Once enrolled in the study, all subjects will receive surgical therapy
      involving opened flap debridement of the affected furcation defects along with membrane
      isolation of the defect. The test group will have debridement performed with the Er,Cr:YSGG
      laser and ultrasonic cleansing, while the control group will have hand instrumentation along
      with ultrasonic cleansing. This procedure will take approximately 1.5 hours. Postoperative
      appointments at 1,2,4,8 weeks requiring 15-30 minutes per appointment; at 3 months for
      periodontal maintenance and reinforcement of home care requiring 45 minutes; and at 6 months
      for periodontal maintenance, reassessment of the furcation defect and correction of residual
      defects requiring 75 minutes. Patients will be exited from the study 2 weeks after the last
      maintenance appointment and placed on recall with the Department of Periodontics dental
      hygienist. The total time commitment for each patient is 6 months.
