      of stroke in a similar population in comparison with warfarin. The rate of myocardial
      infarction was 9% lower in the rivaroxaban group than in the warfarin group in the Rocket AF
      study and similarly the myocardial infarction rate was 12% lower in the apixaban group in
      Aristotle, but the difference was not significant in either trial. The potential of long term
      benefit by avoiding VKA therapy may be much greater for a CV event reduction. The study
      proposed will evaluate markers of CAC progression and atherosclerosis development, which have
      long term outcome data supporting that slowing these processes will be associated with lower
      CV events.
