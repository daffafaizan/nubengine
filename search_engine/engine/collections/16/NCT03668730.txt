      EBV DNA<4000 copy/ml treated with induction chemotherapy followed by reduced-dose radiation
      and cisplatin. The enrolled patients will receive 2 cycles of TPF regimen induction
      chemotherapy, if radiographic CR/PR and EBV DNA=0 after induction chemotherapy, the patients
      will be delivered by 60 Gy IMRT combined with 3 cycles of cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy.
      If radiographic SD/PD or EBV DNA>0 after induction chemotherapy, the patients will receive a
      total of 70 Gy IMRT combined with 3 cycles of cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy.

      The included patients will be treated with 2 cycles of TPF regimen induction chemotherapy and
      60Gy IMRT combined with cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy. The TPF regimen is consist of
      paclitaxel liposome 135mg/m2 d1, cisplatin 25mg/m2d1-d3 and 5-Fu 3750mg/m2 civ120h, with a
      total of two cycles. Concurrent cisplatin chemotherapy is delivered with dose of 100mg/m2, a
      total of three cycles. The third cycle of cisplatin concurrent chemotherapy is allowed to be
      delivered within one week after IMRT finished.
