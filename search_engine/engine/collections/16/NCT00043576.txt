      Administration (FDA). It is a newly formulated pill that contains high amounts of calcitriol,
      a naturally occurring hormone and the biologically active form of vitamin D. Administration
      of DN-101 results in much higher blood levels of calcitriol than the body can produce from
      dietary vitamin D or vitamin D supplements. These higher levels of calcitriol are associated
      with anti-cancer effects in laboratory models of human cancer. Laboratory models also
      indicate that calcitriol has synergy with many commonly used chemotherapeutic agents used to
      treat cancer.

      Calcitriol, at very low doses, is currently approved for use in patients with chronic kidney
      failure. DN-101 was specifically designed for cancer and contains 30 times the amount of
      calcitriol found in the calcitriol pill commercially available today. In order to take an
      amount of calcitriol equivalent to 1 DN-101 pill, cancer patients would need to swallow 30
      pills of the approved, low dose formulation. DN-101 represents a breakthrough in the use of
      calcitriol in the clinic, because it contains high concentrations of calcitriol and makes it
      more feasible for patients to stay on regimen.
