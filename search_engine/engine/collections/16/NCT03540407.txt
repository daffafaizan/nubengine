      before each cycle of treatment with QTP / RTP, at month, two and three months after the end
      of the treatment with follow-up every three months for 1 year. The self-perceived quality of
      life related to health will be assessed by means of the EORTC questionnaires (QLQ-C30 and the
      specific questionnaire QLQ-CX24) at the beginning and a year after completing the treatment.
      The toxicity to the research product will be described according to Common Criteria of
      Terminology for the Report of Adverse Events (CTCAE version 4) and the tolerance to
      onco-specific treatment. It is expected that with the joint administration of the research
      product, the patients will have a better tolerance to the treatment of QTP / RTP with a
      decrease of the interruptions by toxicity in 25% and will preserve a better quality of life.
