      components are assessed. One of the components is the hip examination which appears to be
      painful. Since painful experiences early in life can cause longterm negative effects it is
      important to treat pain during painful procedures.

      One hundred healthy, fullterm infants were randomized to either glucose or sterile water
      orally before the routine medical examination before discharge from the maternity ward.
