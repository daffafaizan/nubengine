      signs will be assessed to ensure the patient can safely proceed with the session. Vital
      signs, including resting heart rate and blood pressure, will be collected and monitored per
      ExOnc program guidelines. In addition, the planned session will not be initiated if the ExOnc
      staff member observes any concerns that may compromise participant safety and/or the
      integrity of the planned session. Vital sign monitoring guidelines for unsupervised sessions,
      prescribed at lower intensities, will be advised by the exercise physiologist at the time the
      session plan is provided to the patient. Patients will be instructed to not begin an
      unsupervised session if their resting heart rate or blood pressure is outside the recommended
      guidelines.
