      in the highly sensitized patient. We will study the effects of patients treated with IVIG or
      Cytogam in combination with plasmaphoresis to modulate the immune response in highly
      sensitized patients. There are two arms in the study, one in which IVIG is administered to
      patients who have living donors with positive crossmatch results, and another in which
      intravenous immune globulin is administered to patients with no living donor and have a PRA
      greater than 30% for 3 consecutive months and a crossmatch with a cadaveric donor while on
      kidney transplant waiting list. The goal is to convert a positive crossmatch to a compatible
      crossmatch that would allow living related transplant to take place or to shorten time on the
      transplant waiting list.
