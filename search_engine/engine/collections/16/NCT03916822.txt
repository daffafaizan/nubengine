      their subsets which express CD154 are associated with antibody-mediated rejection after first
      time renal transplantation in adult recipients.

      Control groups include adult renal transplant recipients with T-cell-mediated rejection, and
      without rejection of any type.

      Alloantigen-specific B-cells will be measured after stimulation of recipient peripheral blood
      leukocytes with those from corresponding donor and HLA-non-identical reference cells.

      Thirty total subjects will be enrolled after IRB-approved informed consent, 15 at each of two
      sites. These subjects will include ten each with biopsy-proven ABMR and TCMR and ten with no
      rejection.

      Each subject will be sampled twice, before and after treatment rejection, at intervals no
      less than 30 days, and not to exceed 90 days.

      B-cells subsets will include those that also express cytokines, and those that are
      categorized as memory or naive, and their isotope switched or unswitched subsets,
      transitional B-cells or plasmablasts, etc.
