      and internal fixation of pertrochanteric femoral fractures. Despite its' questionable
      necessity and significant economic burden, many medical centers practice a policy of imaging
      internally fixated proximal femurs after the patients bore weight on them. The investigator's
      goal is to assess the added value of the postoperative imaging study described.

      Materials and methods: We will conduct a prospective study. All patients who will be treated
      with closed reduction and internal fixation of AO31A fractures will be enrolled. Two sets of
      imaging studies will be assessed- the intra-operative AP and axial fluoroscopy studies and
      the radiograms that are taken following bearing weight on the operated hip. Three decision
      steps will take place regarding weight bearing limitations and a necessity for re-operation-
      (1) Immediately after the operation; (2) A day after the operation; (3) Following weight
      bearing according to a new radiogram. Objective measurements will be taken for each hip on
      both imaging modalities- neck-shaft angle, neck length and tip-apex distance.
