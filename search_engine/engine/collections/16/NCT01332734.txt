      infusion on the sublingual microcirculation perfusion in fluid resuscitated patients with
      severe sepsis and septic shock within the first 48 hours after ICU admission. Directly prior
      to and after 1 hour of magnesium sulphate (MgS) infusion (2 gram) systemic hemodynamic
      variables, sublingual SDF images and standard laboratory tests, were obtained.
