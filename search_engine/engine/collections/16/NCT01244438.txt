      will be monitored for the occurrence of unacceptable toxicity. Subjects with no evidence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity after 4 doses of FP-1039 may continue to receive
      weekly treatment provided there continues to be no evidence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Dosing will be discontinued if a subject has evidence of disease
      progression. Disease will be assessed approximately every 2 months.
