    
      Prospective, multi-center, randomized, controlled, open, blinded-endpoint trial with a
      sequential design. The randomization employs a 1:1 ratio of mechanical embolectomy with the
      CE MARK approved stentriever Solitaire FRÂ® versus medical management alone. Randomization
      will be done under a minimization process using age, baseline NIHSS, therapeutic window and
      vessel occlusion site. For the primary endpoint, subjects will be followed for 90 days
      post-randomization.

      Interim analysis will be performed as preplanned and interpreted by the Data Safety
      Monitoring Board (DSMB) after the first 174, 346 and 518 patients representing 25%, 50% and
      75% of the planned sample size have completed their 90-day follow-up. The DSMB will advise
      the executive committee (EC) on recommendations to stop the trial early either for reasons of
      safety, efficacy, futility or to adjust the sample size. The latter may be necessary as given
      the paucity of data regarding natural history of the non-treated patients assumptions
      regarding rates of favorable outcomes in this group of patients may be incorrect. Of note,
      sample size adjustment based on different than expected outcomes rates is permitted, but it
      is not permitted to adjust the sample size based on change in the pre-specified treatment
      effect which is set at 10%.

      Subject population: Subjects presenting with acute ischemic stroke within 8 hours from
      symptom onset and whose strokes are attributable to an occlusion of the internal carotid or
      proximal MCA (M1) arteries. Subjects are either ineligible for IV alteplase or have received
      IV alteplase therapy without recanalization.
