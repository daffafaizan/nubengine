      the system of mechanical disintegration in the reconstruction of skin substance loss in the
      limbs.

      The primary endpoint consists in evaluating, through a specific evaluation scale, the Wound
      Bed Score (WBS) for skin substance loss at Time 0 (T0) and 30 days after the procedure (T30)
      and to evaluate the increase of this score in this time frame set at 50%. The evaluation will
      be carried out in double blind.

      The secondary endpoints instead consist in the evaluation of the Wound Surface Area
      Assessment to be carried out at T0 and T30.

      In the evaluation of the quality of the resulting scars, through the Vancouver Scale (VS), 90
      (T90) and 180 days (T180) after treatment and to evaluate the reduction of this score by 15%;
      on the other in the evaluation of the progress of the Visual Analogic Scale (VAS)
      administered to the patient at T0, 30, 90, 180.

      The purpose of this minimally invasive treatment is to improve the quality of life of those
      affected by these injuries, avoiding the use of prolonged advanced medications and / or more
      invasive surgical procedures, thus speeding up healing and favoring the clinical outcome of
      patients.

      No chemical reagents or enzymes are used for the method. There is therefore no tissue
      manipulation, in full compliance with the European directive 23/2004.
