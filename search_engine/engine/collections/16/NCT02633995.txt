      group (A) and a normotensive group (B). All will receive colload (500 ml voluven) as a coload
      via wide bore (16 Gauge ) cannula within 5-10 minutes during induction of spinal anesthesia.
      Standard monitoring with electrocardiography, automated non-invasive arterial pressure (NIAP)
      measurement, and pulse oximetry will be performed. Systolic arterial pressure (SAP), mean
      arterial pressure (MAP) and diastolic arterial pressure (DAP) will be monitored. Baseline
      values will be recorded in the supine position. Central venous line will be inserted in
      severe preeclampsia group and central venous pressure will be measured every 10 minutes.

      Spinal anesthesia will be induced with a total of 10 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine and 25
      Âµg fentanyl (total volume 2.5 ml) at the L3-4 interspace in the sitting position then the
      patient will be returned immediately to the supine position with left lateral tilt.
