      deformities in the hip joint. However some individuals have these deformities but do not
      exhibit symptoms. Using the standard magnetic resonance imaging and clinical tests it is not
      clear which deformities will cause degeneration, requiring surgical intervention. We propose
      to evaluate the deformity and impingement between the femur and acetabulum using dynamic
      ultrasound imaging. Ultrasound does not involve radiation and can acquire video of the hip
      joint and is thus suitable for such diagnostic purposes. In this pilot study we will evaluate
      the feasibility of ultrasound in diagnosing hip impingement.
