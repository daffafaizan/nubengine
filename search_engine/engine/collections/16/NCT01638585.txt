      August-2 are also part of August-1, but there will be patients who are documented in the
      register, but will not take part in August-2. The investigators want to find out to which
      extent the patients in the registry are representative to the overall population suffering
      from this condition and how the therapeutic success of other therapy regimes can be
      described.
