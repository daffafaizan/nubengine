    
      A total of 40 participants (20 non-consecutive adults with a moderate or severe TBI and 20
      volunteers with any history of neurological or psychiatric disease) will be recruited into
      the study. The duration of the protocol is 70 minutes. As regards the assessment, three
      questionnaires will be administered in order to evaluate self-defining memories, apathetic
      manifestations and anxio-depressive symptoms. In addition, four cognitive measures will be
      used to assess verbal episodic memory, working memory, cognitive flexibility and verbal
      fluency.
