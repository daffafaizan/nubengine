      investigating the efficacy of a computerized cognitive training paradigm. The training
      paradigm aims to enhance cognitive control for emotional information-processing and reduce
      the negative affective biases observed among those experiencing mood and anxiety symptoms and
      disorders. This protocol will also investigate whether improvements in cognitive control and
      affective bias are associated with changes in mood and anxiety symptoms. Participants will
      undergo 6 weeks of cognitive training sessions, with three sessions per week.
