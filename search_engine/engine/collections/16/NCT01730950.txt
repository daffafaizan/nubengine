      I. To establish an improvement in overall survival in recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients
      receiving bevacizumab and re-irradiation compared with patients receiving bevacizumab alone.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate and compare the rate of objective response in patients with measurable
      disease.

      II. To estimate and compare the 6-month progression-free survival rate. III. To estimate and
      compare progression-free survival. IV. To estimate and compare the rate of treatment adverse
      events. V. To estimate and compare the rate of grade 3+ acute or delayed central nervous
      system (CNS) toxicity.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      In both arms, courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 1 year,
      every 6 months for 1 year and then annually thereafter.
