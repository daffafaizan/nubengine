      wireless vital signs monitor (Aingeal) that transmits data over Wi-Fi to a central station
      software platform (Surveillance Station). The Aingeal device measures single lead ECG, heart
      rate, respiration waveform and rate, and skin temperature. A snapshot of data is transmitted
      by the devices intermittently to the Surveillance Station, enabling vital signs trends to be
      plotted. If any heart, respiration rate or skin temperature values move outside of
      pre-defined high and low limits (individually set for each patient) an alert is raised. ECG
      arrhythmia detection algorithms automatically record and send ECG data if the patient is
      suspected to be experiencing an arrhythmia event (Asystole, Ventricular Fibrillation,
      Tachycardia or Bradycardia). This proposal describes the evaluation of RENEW's Aingeal device
      within an adult in-patient setting KK Women's and Children's Hospital ("KKH"), the main
      tertiary women and children hospital in Singapore. User acceptance of Aingeal and the
      Surveillance System will be considered within the clinical settings.
