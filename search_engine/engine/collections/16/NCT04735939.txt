    
      The objective of this study is to determine whether the timing of radiotherapy to treat
      glioma has an effect on patient outcomes.

      Primary objective: Determine whether there is a difference in outcomes seen when patients are
      assigned to take their radiotherapy at either a morning time or evening time.

      The Investigator hypothesize that administration time of radiotherapy during the day can
      affect the clinical outcomes in glioma patients.

      Specific Aims Include:

        -  Determine whether morning vs. evening dosing radiotherapy could affect the survival time
           of glioma patients.

        -  Determine whether morning vs. evening dosing radiotherapy could affect the KPS score of
           glioma patients.

        -  Determine whether morning vs. evening dosing radiotherapy could affect the cognitive
           function of glioma patients.
