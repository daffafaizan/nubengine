    
      Moxifloxacin (MFX) is a fluoroquinolone with a high in vitro and in vivo bactericidal
      activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. A daily dose of 600-800 mg MFX should be
      considered for optimal killing of the involved mycobacteria and suppression of drug
      resistance, which is higher than the currently used dose of 400 mg once daily. In general,
      safety data to support switching to the suggested higher dose are limited.

      For this purpose, twenty tuberculosis patients will start on a standard dose of MFX 400 mg
      once daily. After 8 days the dose will be increased to 600 mg once daily and on the 15th day
      of treatment, the dose of MFX will be escalated to 800 mg. In patients who have been treated
      with rifampicin (RIF) in the past three weeks prior to start of MFX treatment an additional
      washout period of 3 weeks to reduce the rifampicin induced enzymatic activity will precede
      the dose escalation.
