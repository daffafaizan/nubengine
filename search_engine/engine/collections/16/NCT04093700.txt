    
      Patient-reported outcomes data have been collected among patients undergoing shoulder labrum
      repair with SureLock all-suture anchors from January 2014 to June 30, 2020. These patients
      have completed clinical and quality-of-life outcome instruments pre-operatively, and have
      been stored securely in the OBERD database. Pre-op scores will be compared to post-op scores
      and analyzed using a one-way ANOVA test with a post-hoc Scheffe procedure.

      Patient identifying information will be removed and de-identified codes will be used. Any new
      prospective data gathered prospectively for the purposes of this study will be entered and
      stored securely as above.

      Data collection forms will consist of the following Patient-Reported Outcome Surveys: WOSI
      Index, ASES Shoulder Score, and the SF-12.
