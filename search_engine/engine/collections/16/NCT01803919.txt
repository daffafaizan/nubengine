      intervention to reduce urinary tract infections; however, research evidence cannot be
      extrapolated to spinal cord injured patients.

      The study is an open, randomized, multicentric, and parallel clinical trial with blinded
      assessment. The study includes spinal cord injured patients who require at least seven days
      of urethral catheterization as a method of bladder voiding. Participants are on-line
      centrally randomized and allocated to one of the two interventions (Antiseptic Urinary
      Catheters or Conventional Catheters). Catheters are used for a maximum period of 30 days or
      removed earlier at the clinician criteria.

      The main outcome is the incidence of urinary tract infections by the time of catheter removal
      or at day 30 after catheterization, the event that occurs first. Intention-to-treat analysis
      will be performed, as well as a primary analysis of all patients.

      The aim of this study is to assess whether silver alloy-coated silicone urinary catheters
      reduce urinary infections in spinal cord injured patients.
