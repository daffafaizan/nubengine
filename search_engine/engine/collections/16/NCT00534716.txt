      consumption (mainly recreational smoking). So far, the target analyte in urine is
      11-nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH), the main metabolite of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC),
      which is excreted up to several days after single use. However, the wide detection window of
      THC-COOH does not allow a conclusion concerning the impact on the physical performance.
      Therefore, the evaluation of other target analytes with shorter elimination half-lives is
      needed and the aim (primary endpoints) of the present study. This pharmacokinetic, open,
      1-session trial on 12 healthy, male, infrequently Cannabis smoking volunteers is focussed on
      the GC/MS profiling of THC and metabolites in urine and plasma after standardized smoking of
      a single 7% THC Cannabis cigarette of the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare & Sport, Office
      of Medicinal Cannabis. Pharmacodynamic measurements (secondary endpoints) include the
      side-effects monitoring by using Visual Analog Scales and checking vital functions.
