      optimize response to treatment and to prevent neurological sequelae, over diagnosis and
      aggressive use of anticonvulsants can contribute to morbidity and mortality.It displays great
      diversity in response to anticonvulsants,therefore treatment in intensive care units is
      required for selected cases .The aetiology and clinical forms are strong predictors for the
      overall prognosis.Treatment is poorly understood and follows the standard regimen for
      convulsive status epilepticus
