      you want to detect a difference of 10 points (δ) in the range with a significance level of 5%
      (Z1-α = 1.96), a power of 80% (Z1-β = 1.96). The result obtained was 25 subjects for each
      group. Information related to variances of control and intervention groups were obtained
      through the pilot study and a correlation of 0.5 was assumed.
