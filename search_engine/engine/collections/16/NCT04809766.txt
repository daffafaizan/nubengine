      This is a dose-escalation study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 cohorts.

      COHORT I:

      LYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cyclophosphamide intravenously (IV) and
      fludarabine IV on days 25-27.

      T-CELL THERAPY: Patients receive FH-TCR-Tᴍsʟɴ IV over 60-120 minutes on days 0, 14, and 28 in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT II:

      LYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and fludarabine IV on days
      11-13.

      T-CELL THERAPY: Patients receive FH-TCR-Tᴍsʟɴ IV over 60-120 minutes on days 0 and 14 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      COHORT III:

      LYMPHODEPLETION CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV and fludarabine IV on days
      -3 to -1.

      T-CELL THERAPY: Patients receive FH-TCR-Tᴍsʟɴ IV over 60-120 minutes on days 0 and 14 in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up to 15 years.
