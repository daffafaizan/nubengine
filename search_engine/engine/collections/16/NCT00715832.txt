      antigen OFA/iLRP. All patients will be immunized with 1 x 107 viable OFA/iLRP-loaded mature,
      autologous monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs). The DC vaccine will be administered
      intradermally into the proximal medial upper extremity, contralateral to the original site of
      breast cancer once every month for 3 months. Changes in the tumor will be documented. The
      patient will remain in the study unless toxicity or adverse side effects require
      discontinuation following RECIST and CTC guidelines, or if the patient withdraws for any
      other reason.
