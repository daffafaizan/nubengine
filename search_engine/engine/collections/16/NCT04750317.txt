      University (Moscow, Russia) in patients with moderately severe COVID-19 pneumonia. A
      diagnosis of COVID-19 associated pneumonia suspected clinically was confirmed by polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) and/or chest CT. In patients with inconclusive or negative results of
      PCR on nasopharyngeal swab, SARS-CoV-2 induced pneumonia was defined as an acute respiratory
      infection with typical CT findings (4 or 5 on CO-RADS scale) and no other obvious aetiology.

      In order to be included in this study, patients must have COVID-19 pneumonia involving at
      least 25% of lung tissue in combination with at least one of the following: (1) oxygen
      saturation at rest ≤93% on ambient air, (2) increased C-reactive protein (CRP ≥50 mg/L)
      and/or (3) fever (≥38.0°C) that persisted for at least two days despite treatment with
      nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs or paracetamol. Exclusion criteria for the administration
      of tofacitinib were coexistent infection other than COVID-19; requirement for invasive
      mechanical ventilation; estimated glomerular filtration rate calculated using CKD-EPI formula
      ≤30 ml/min/1.73 m2; elevated ALT and/or AST levels more than 3 times the upper limit of
      normal; chronic use of glucocorticoids or immunosuppressive agents; and administration of
      interleukin-6 inhibitors and/or high-dose glucocorticoids (≥250 mg prednisone equivalent
      intravenously) for the treatment of COVID-19.

      All patients are divided into four groups depending on nadir levels of oxygen saturation and
      therapy: (1) patients with oxygen saturation ≤93% who received tofacitinib and SoC, (2)
      patients with oxygen saturation ≤93% who received only SoC, (3) patients with oxygen
      saturation >93% who received tofacitinib and SoC, (4) patients with oxygen saturation >93%
      who received only SoC. The aim of the study is to test the hypothesis that administration of
      tofacitinib could influence the risk of mechanical ventilation and/or death.

      All patients provided written, informed consent for the off-label use of experimental
      medications, including tofacitinib, according to the provisional recommendations issued by
      the Russian Ministry of Health during the outbreak of infection.
