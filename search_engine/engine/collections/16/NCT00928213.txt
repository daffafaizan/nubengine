      during the first and the second trimester at GA 10-13 weeks and 21-23 weeks. When possible -
      blood will be drawn at hospital admission for delivery. Measurements of sonography and serum
      markers are done blinded to pregnancy outcome.

        1. All comers attending the prenatal testing at GA 10-13.

        2. Patients with a history of at least 2 pregnancy loss or preterm delivery and treated
           with low molecular weight heparin at 40-80 mg/day from admission to until 12 weeks after
           delivery.
