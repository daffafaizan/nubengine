    
      Patients with unresectable biliary tract cancer (intrahepatic or extrahepatic
      cholangiocarcinoma, or ampullary carcinoma) were enrolled and placed with a stent loaded with
      radioactive seeds (irradiation stent group) or a conventional plastic stent (traditional
      stent group). After stent placement, the outcomes were compared in terms of tumor response,
      progression-free survival, overall survival time, and complications related to the
      procedures.
