      obstructive lung disease (GOLD) criteria. The patients will be at a stable phase of the
      disease, indicated by a lack of change in medical therapy (including oral steroids) or an
      exacerbation of symptoms in the preceding 4 weeks. Patients with other known severe chronic
      diseases, including cardiac, neuromuscular, or orthopedic disorders, will be excluded.
