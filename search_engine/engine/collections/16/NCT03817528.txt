      the first 7 days of starting ITI-007, with some flexibility allowed if clinically indicated.
      No patients will be left unmedicated because of this study.

      Patients will be seen weekly for the first 4 weeks, biweekly for the second month and then
      monthly for six months. Patients will be monitored by clinical and safety rating scales, and
      will be required to show improvement after 3 months to remain in this study. Patients not
      improving at this time will be assessed for the risks/benefits of continuing.
