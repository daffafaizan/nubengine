      cerebral palsy (CP) in the US. Motor relearning is possible for these individual but
      typically requires numerous training sessions with a team of physical therapists and
      assistants to restore coupling between upper- and lower-body segments while assisting spastic
      uncoordinated limb movement to improve gait kinematics. This clinical trial will meet the
      overall objective of testing the feasibility of developing a smart-robotic exoskeleton that
      is effective at providing guided pelvic assistance and support while biofeedback mediated
      training is facilitated under the supervision of a physiotherapist. The project will test a
      novel tethered Pelvic Assist Device (TPAD) with integratable electromyographic (EMG) and
      inertial (IMU) biofeedback that is uniquely capable of delivering precise, adaptable,
      multi-degree-of-freedom pelvic control to promote natural intersegmental coupling, restore
      coordination of upper- and lower-limb movement, and improve normal gait kinematics in
      children with CP. Because of its proximity to the center of mass and critical role in
      coordinating upper- and lower-limb control, the pelvis provides an ideal access point for
      physiotherapists to manually improve gait. The investigators will test the hypothesis that
      accurate sensor-based metrics of gait can be derived from EMG and IMU wearable sensors to
      develop a biofeedback system for motor learning that are integratable with TPAD to develop a
      new mobile mPAD device that is compliant with the target population.
