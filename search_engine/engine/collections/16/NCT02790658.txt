      Atlantic Forest of Brazil rich in phenolic compounds, mainly anthocyanins and ellagitannins.
      The objective of this study is Investigate the bioavailability of the main flavonoid, their
      colonic transformation and untargeted metabolites by an metabolomic approach following acute
      intake of a grumixama juice by humans.

      Fifteen healthy subjects consumed grumixama juice at single dose, and urine and plasma
      samples were collected at different time points over 24 h period. The metabolites were
      analyzed by LC-ESI-MSn, LC-Q-TOF plasma and urine were also analyzed using untargeted
      metabolomic approach for amino acids and organic acids by GCMS.
