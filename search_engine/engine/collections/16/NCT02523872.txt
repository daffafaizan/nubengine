      inflammatory in nature and associated with capillary leak and swelling of tissues. While
      fluid administration may be necessary for the immediate resuscitation of a patient in shock,
      in the long term it may worsen survival and lead to complications. This is especially true in
      acute respiratory failure, where excess fluid can lead to a longer duration of mechanical
      ventilation, longer time in the ICU, and a greater need for dialysis. There is also evidence
      that conservative fluid administration can prevent complications. Fluid overload is
      associated with increased healthcare resource utilization and cost.

      Much of the fluid administered to patients while in the adult ICU in the United States is
      administered as medications via large volume infusion pumps. This is a descriptive study to
      gather data on fluid balance, intravenous medication administration, electrolyte balance, and
      diuretic and dialysis use in patients with acute respiratory failure who might benefit from a
      strategy designed to limit fluid administration. The information will be used to design an
      interventional trial of small volume medication infusion.
