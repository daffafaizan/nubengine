      Atherosclerosis Department with known Lp(a) levels and coronary heart disease (CHD) verified
      by angiography. In accordance with clinical condition and angiography data were assigned them
      into three parallel treatment arms and followed up to 15 years. This study was conducted
      according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Institutional Ethics
