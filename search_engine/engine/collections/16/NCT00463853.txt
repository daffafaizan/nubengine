      Lake City Health Care System presenting with CAD and associated depressed LV function
      requiring myocardial surgical revascularization will be eligible for enrollment. Patients
      enrolled in the study will receive autologous BM-MNC as adjunct to CABG. The primary outcome
      measure will be safety as measured by the incidence of postoperative Serious Adverse Events
      (SAE) and Adverse Events (AE). The secondary outcome measures will be LV function, myocardial
      perfusion, and clinical improvement. The trial will have one experiment with one patient
      group. Group 1 (n=15) will follow standard Phase I dose escalation curve on a magnitude of
      0.5 log increase after every third patient. Dose escalation will continue until a dosage of 1
      x108 cells/pt is reached or maximum tolerated dose equivalent (MTDE) is identified. Cellular
      therapeutic products such as BM-MNCS do not possess the same pharmacologic profile as small
      molecule drugs, and thus, do not possess predictable metabolic activity and metabolite
      production, as do traditional pharmaceuticals. This can make the identity of a maximum
      tolerated dose somewhat difficult. We are therefore using the term MTDE instead of MTD to
      indicate a cell dosage that is consistent with clinical morbidity beyond obvious clinical
      benefit. The characteristics identifying a MTDE could be any adverse event felt to be related
      to the actual cell dosage or its escalation. Although unlikely, MTDE events could include
      microembolic phenomena, hematoma at the injection site, obvious myocardial congestion or
      ischemia at the injection site.
