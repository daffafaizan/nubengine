      participants for assessment. This study will consist of 2 parts: Part A of the study will
      evaluate the effect of repeat-dose administration of brigatinib on the single-dose PK of
      midazolam. Part B of the study is exploratory and will allow participants to continue
      brigatinib until disease progression (PD). All participants will receive study drug via the
      oral route. Participants will be assigned to: Midazolam 3 mg + Brigatinib 90 mg.

      The overall time to participate in this study is 26 months. Participants will have a 28-day
      PK cycle in Part A and a maximum of 23 cycles in Part B, and a 30-day follow-up period after
      end of treatment.
