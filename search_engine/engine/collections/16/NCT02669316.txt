      Mediterranean Diet Score, AMDS), physical activity profile, assessed by the Baecke's physical
      exercise questionnaire, Insulin resistance (assessed by HOMA) were all taken into account for
      their confounding and synergic effect. Multiple regression analysis and Odds ratio will be
      the statistical tools that will be used.Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis will be
      applied in order to find the cut-off, if any, of the considered measures vs. NAFLD and
      significant abnormalities of echocardiography measures.
