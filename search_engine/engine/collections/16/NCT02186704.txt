    
      The SENSE Trial is designed to study the efficacy of the DX System in detection of atrial
      high rate episodes (AHREs) in subjects with no prior history of atrial fibrillation. The DX
      System, or "DX," consists of a Biotronik DX ICD, and the Biotronik Linox Smart S DX lead
      which is an FDA approved ICD system that incorporates use of an implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) lead with dedicated atrial sensing dipoles.

      The SENSE Trial will be conducted at 8-12 U.S. sites. The lead coordinating site will be at
      Weill Cornell Medical College. Subjects will be followed for 1 year to assess for the primary
      endpoints of the trial.
