    
      There are two primary treatment comparisons for this study: 1) the percentage of subjects'
      pain free at 2 hours after treatment with TREXIMET versus placebo across attacks, and 2) the
      percentage of subjects who are sustained pain free at 24 hours after treatment with TREXIMET
      versus placebo across attacks.

      The following alternative hypothesis will be tested to see if there is a difference in the
      proportion of subjects who are pain free at 2 hours with TREXIMET versus placebo at all
      attacks, OR there is a difference in the proportion of subjects who are sustained pain free
      at 24 hours with TREXIMET versus placebo at all attacks.
