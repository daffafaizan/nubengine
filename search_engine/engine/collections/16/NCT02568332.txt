      Hep C is a blood borne viral infection spread through direct contact with the blood of an
      infected person. People with Hep C frequently have no symptoms and infection can lead to
      fibrosis (scarring of the liver), liver failure and cancer. Infection with the Hep C virus
      (HCV) progresses more rapidly to liver damage in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-infected
      individuals.

      Researchers at the University of Oxford have developed a novel candidate vaccine against HCV
      ('NSmut'). This vaccine has been inserted into the carrier viruses Chimpanzee Adenovirus 3
      (AdCh3) and modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), both of which have excellent safety records
      and have been previously tested in people.

      However, the objective of this study is to use exploratory immunological assays to assess
      whether vaccines for Hep C can induce immune responses in HIV positive individuals that are
      similar in strength to those in healthy volunteers.
