      pejorative factor. Patient education can limit in a certain amount the Keratoconus
      progression. Thus, our objective will be to evaluate the therapeutic impact on Keratoconus
      progression of patient's education against eye rubbing according to an eye rubbing
      Questionnaire.

      The validation of a dedicated questionnaire is an important act that will allow the
      scientific evaluation of this factor with both environmental and behavioral traits. It can
      thus be integrated into our care activity for its intrinsic educational and therapeutic
      virtues and for its decision-making aid for certain treatments. It will be useful first of
      all for the refinement of the correct prescription of corneal collagen crosslinking for
      evolving KC or KC with a high risk of progression.
