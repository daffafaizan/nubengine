      obtained from patients undergoing intravitreal injection before and after the application of
      the extra eye drop. Patients will be randomized to undergo additional topical analgesia
      during intravitreal injection vs. the standard amount of topical analgesia. Cultures of the
      eyelid/conjunctiva will be taken to ensure that the additional topical analgesia does not
      interfere with antisepsis.
