    
      This Phase II randomized study is to determine the efficacy of split-course thoracic
      radiotherapy combined with nab-paclitaxel plus nedaplatin for local advanced non-small cell
      lung cancer with severe impairment of baseline pulmonary function.

      Patients received four cycles of weekly nab-paclitaxel(50mg/㎡) and nedaplatin(25mg/㎡), each
      of 1 day's duration, or nab-paclitaxel(30mg/㎡) and nedaplatin(10mg/㎡) twice every week,
      concurrent with split-course thoracic radiotherapy of 30 Gy/6 fractions and 40 Gy/8 fractions
      administered in the first and second courses, respectively, with one-month break. The primary
      end point is progression-free survival, which is the time that passes from the first day of
      radiotherapy to the date at which disease progresses. Progression-free survival will be
      calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method.Toxicities will be graded according to CTCAE v. 4.0.
