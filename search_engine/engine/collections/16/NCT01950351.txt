      I. Estimate the incidence of grade 2 gastrointestinal toxicity following the proposed
      treatment regimens at 2 years post-treatment.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the change in health related quality of life (HRQOL) following the proposed
      treatment regimen compared to pre-treatment assessment as defined by Expanded Prostate Cancer
      Index Composite (EPIC), Utilization of Sexual Medications/Devices, and Medical
      history/conditions questionnaire.

      II. Estimate the rates of acute toxicity of the treatment regimens. III. Estimate the rates
      of late toxicity at 3, 4, and 5 years post-treatment. IV. Assess the efficacy of
      hypo-fractionated proton beam therapy, defined by the incidence of a rising prostate-specific
      antigen (PSA) at 5 years.

      V. Determine the rate of local failure by biopsy of the prostate when objective tests,
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), digital rectal exam (DRE),
      suggest relapse.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy in 15 fractions over 5-6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-12 months for 24 months
      and then annually until month 60.
