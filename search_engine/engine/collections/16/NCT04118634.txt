      accurate diagnosis and risk stratification of these patients is an important unmet clinical
      need. The aim of the study is to evaluate the value of biomarkers, alone or in combination,
      in the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with suspected pulmonary embolism
      presenting to the emergency department.
