      with regard to prevalence and long-term consequences. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has
      proven to be effective as treatment, early intervention and prevention of youth anxiety
      disorders. The majority of youth with anxiety problems, however, is not in contact with
      mental health services and do not receive effective help. This is due to shortage of
      personnel, resources and time among mental health-personal delivering treatment, as well as
      health services not being easily accessable for adolescents. School-based, low-intensity
      early intervention programs (indicated prevention) may improve access to effective treatment
      for youth with internalizing problems, and also promote more effective use of health
      services. The present study is a multi-site randomized controlled study with early
      intervention to be conducted within the primary health care service in three parts of Norway;
      including nine municipalities from west, east and south of Norway. A brief CBT program will
      be compared to a longer CBT program, and a wait-list control group. The effects will be
      evaluated with regard to decrease in youth internalizing symptoms. The CBT interventions are
      given to adolescents with mild to moderate levels of anxiety symptoms. Interventions are
      delivered by trained school-health nurses in collaboration with and/or supervised by
      experienced CBT therapists. The study involves researchers from three research environments
      in Norway, and collaboration with prominent international researchers from USA and
      Australia.The study has potential impact on how to deliver effective low-threshold
      interventions to anxious youth.
