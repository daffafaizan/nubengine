    
      Patients that provide Informed Consent and satisfy the Eligibility Criteria will undergo CT
      or Ultrasound guided percutaneous placement of a single, two, three, or four Light Sources
      depending on their tumor characteristics. No more than 4 Light Sources will be used at a
      single treatment. The Light Sources may be used in a single lesion or in multiple lesions.

      Following radiographic confirmation of Light Source placement, patients will receive an
      intravenous dose of LS11 at 40 mg/m². Fifteen minutes to 1 hour following completion of LS11
      administration, delivery of 200 J/cm at 20 mW/cm light energy will begin. The Light Source
      will then be manually removed and the patients will be observed for acute complication of
      Light Source removal. Precautions for protection from external light exposure should be
      instituted beginning with the LS11 administration and be maintained as defined throughout the
      study period. On day 3 following Litx™ treatment the patient will receive a standard
      chemotherapy with Irinotecan or Oxaliplatin with or without 5FU and /or leucovorin for
      metastatic colorectal cancer. On day 30+5 and day 60+5 the patient will undergo clinical
      assessment and the tumor mass will be imaged using contrast enhanced spiral CT for
      determination of volume and radius of PDT necrosis.
