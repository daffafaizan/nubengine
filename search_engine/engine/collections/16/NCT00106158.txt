      (SEREX), using tumor mRNA and autologous serum from an esophageal cancer patient. Reverse
      transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that NY-ESO-1 displayed the
      typical expression pattern of CT antigens. NY-ESO-1 mRNA was expressed only in testis of
      normal tissues tested and in various types of cancer, including lung cancer, breast cancer,
      malignant melanoma and bladder cancer. LAGE-1 was identified by the representational
      difference analysis and revealed to display 84% amino acid homology with NY-ESO-1. In most
      cases, expression of LAGE-1 parallels the expression of NY-ESO-1. Since testis is an immune
      privileged organ where HLA molecules are not expressed, these antigens can be considered
      tumor-specific.

      Because of frequent NY-ESO-1 mRNA expression and high immunogenicity in advanced cancer,
      NY-ESO-1 is an attractive target molecule for a cancer vaccine. Current therapies against
      advanced cancer have limited effectiveness. The idea of vaccination with NY-ESO-1 protein in
      cancer patients with tumors expressing NY-ESO-1 mRNA is based on two findings: 1) the number
      of CD8+ T cell epitopes identified in NY-ESO-1 molecule are limited to those binding to
      HLA-A0201, A31, Cw3 and Cw6. These HLA subtypes are carried by a minor Japanese population;
      2) CD8+ T cell responses specific to NY-ESO-1 are polyclonal. Protein vaccination may induce
      immune response more effectively against tumors expressing NY-ESO-1 than peptide
      immunization.
