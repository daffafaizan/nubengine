      filtration rate (GFR) are increasingly used to get an impression from renal function in
      recent years. Based on these renal function measurements, clinical decisions are made as well
      as drug dose adjustments. The use of reliable serum creatinine measurements is therefore
      important to get accurate renal function estimates. However, serum creatinine is one of the
      most variable routine laboratory tests.

      The importance of calibration to a traceable reference measurement of serum creatinine has
      been stressed. However, this standardization does not correct for analytical non-specificity
      problems, which occurs in certain techniques to measure creatinine, leading to under- or
      overestimation of the true creatinine concentration.

      The aim of this cross-sectional observational study is to examine the degree of variability
      between diverse methods to measure creatinine in plasma and urine in a heterogenous group of
      Caucasian people with and without renal function loss and the influence hereof on the 24-hour
      creatinine clearance and the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study equation and the
      consequences for chronic kidney disease staging.
