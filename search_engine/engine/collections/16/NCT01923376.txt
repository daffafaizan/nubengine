      cirrhosis and liver failure. Main treatment goal for hepatic encephalopathy is to eliminate
      the precipitating factor and to decrease circulating ammonia level. Current standard for
      treating HE is treatment with Lactulose. Lactulose are metabolized by colonic bacteria to
      byproducts which cause catharsis and reduces pH, thereby inhibiting ammonia absorption.
      However, there is limited evidence available to demonstrate the efficacy. Studies on animal
      model have suggested that polyethylene glycol 3350-electrolyte solution (GOLYTELY) is
      effective in clearing gut bacteria and reducing the ammoniagenesis in colon. Recently
      published study by Robert Rahimi, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center found that
      polyethylene glycol is more effective in improving HE over the first 24 hours compared to
      lactulose and also may reduce duration of hospital stay.
