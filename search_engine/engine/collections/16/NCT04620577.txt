      clinical trial to explore the impact of antibiotics on the incidence of biliary tract
      infections after PTCD with malignant obstructive jaundice. This study will provide
      evidence-based medical evidence for the need for routine use of antibiotics to prevent
      biliary tract infections after PTCD with malignant obstructive jaundice, and provide
      references for clinicians to prevent patients from PTCD infections.
