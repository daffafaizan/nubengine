      studied postprandial lipemia (PPL), lipoprotein, glucose, and insulin increments for eight
      hours in 14 young, lean, healthy students, seven of each gender.

      The six, isocaloric meals contained 55.1 g carbohydrate, 5.8 g protein, 82.3 g fat, and 4177
      kJ. The potatoes, without skin, were boiled in 20 minutes in excess of water with 5 g of salt
      added, were blended in 4 minutes and served hot. The meals were ingested over 10 minutes,
      with 250 ml tap water. The following 8 hours the participants stayed at the clinic to watch
      television, read or take a short walk of 10 minutes.

      Blood samples were drawn at -15, 0, 30, 60, 90,120,180,240,300,360, 420 and 480 minutes after
      the meals and processed after each drawing. After blood collection, plasma was immediately
      separated by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4Â°C.

      The area under the curve (AUC) were determined for TG, HDL, LDL, total cholesterol, FFA,
      insulin, and glucose concentrations by the trapezoid method. Multiple regression was
      performed to adjust for age, gender, meals, and BMI to the variance of postprandial
      responses. The difference between meals were tested with ANOVA. If p<0.05 in ANOVA,
      post-hoc-testing with Student-Newman-Keul's test was performed to identify, which meal was
      significantly different from the other, and to minimize the risk of error by multiple
      testing.
