      quality of life across all degrees of involvement and severity. Phototherapy is a clinically
      indicated treatment for skin lesions. Treatments are usually administered in an outpatient
      setting, typically three times per week. This is a proof-of-concept study as there are few
      well-designed prospective clinical studies showing the efficacy of NB-UVB phototherapy in the
      treatment of vitiligo in terms of repigmentation and quality of life. The following are the
      proposed objectives of this study:

        1. NB-UVB phototherapy improves vitiligo with at least 50% repigmentation compared to no
           treatment on affected areas of the trunk and extremities over 24 weeks.

        2. NB-UVB phototherapy leads to improvement in quality of life as measured by standardized
           quality of life metrics (DLQI and Skindex-29) over 24 weeks.
