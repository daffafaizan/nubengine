      pharynx, and larynx. In Brazil, 11,200 new cases of oral cavity cancer are estimated in men
      and 3,500 in women for each year of the 2018-2019 biennium. The disease causes high mortality
      and morbidity, affecting swallowing and dysphagia, leading to weight loss and cachexia.
      Cancer cachexia is marked by involuntary muscle loss leading to progressive functional
      impairment and can not be reversed by traditional nutritional support. Recent publications
      show that muscle mass can predict certain outcomes such as survival. Methods for assessing
      body composition have been developed and validated for research, and the area of a skeletal
      muscle, which can be measured by cross-sectional images, is a valid marker of total body
      mass. The CT evaluation of the region of the third and fourth lumbar vertebra (L3-L4) are
      accurate and accepted as a method for evaluating body composition. However, given the
      locoregional nature of the dissemination of this SCC, usually the L3-L4 level is not
      available on CT, and this is a limitation for the use of CT to assess cachexia in these
      patients. This study will be divided into three steps. In the first step, 20 patients with
      cross-sectional CT images of patients with head and neck cancer diagnosis will be selected to
      verify the intra-class variation at different evaluation times. The second step aims to
      evaluate the correlation of the muscular area obtained through the L3 region with the area of
      the neck muscles. The third step will evaluate the prognostic role of the neck muscle area of
      HNSCC patients. The area of the neck muscle of the first CT scan obtained prior to the
      beginning of treatment will be evaluated and the ratio of this area with the survival rate
      will be calculated.
