      exercise stress model (rest, peak oxygen consumption oxygen uptake, and 7 follow-up sampling
      points) to measure the mediators of relapse in the context of their interactive homeostatic
      networks. The investigator surveyed the response of genes and blood-borne biomarkers in order
      to interrogate and map regulation of neuro-endocrine-autonomic-immune function in these
      subjects as compared to GW era sedentary healthy controls. The investigator's research team
      applied an integrative systems-based approach rooted in computational biology connecting gene
      expression and biomarkers to pathways and to symptoms in order to identify potential
      therapeutic targets as well as optimal strategies for manipulation of these targets. Using
      this data the investigator's research team has developed a virtual model of the illness,
      which has been used to identify potential therapeutic targets.
