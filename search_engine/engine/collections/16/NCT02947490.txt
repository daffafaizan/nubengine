      for BP control, does BP self-monitoring with or without patient-led management using a
      previously agreed treatment regime result in better BP control and patient satisfaction than
      standard GP based management?

      Planned sample size: 165 eligible participants distributed 1:1:1 between three groups. Group
      1 (control) - treatment as usual (TAU). Group 2 - Self-monitoring only (Se-MO). Group 3 -
      Self-monitoring and self-management (Se-Man).

      Primary outcome: Number reaching target Ambulatory BP levels at follow-up and change in mean
      Ambulatory BP levels between baseline and follow-up at 6 months.

      Secondary outcomes:

      Number of changes in anti-hypertensive treatment during study Side-effects profiles and
      adverse events BP variability Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) changes All cause and cause-specific
      mortality outcome at six month Recurrent TIA or stroke Incident CVD- stroke, TIA and
      myocardial infarction Costs Health related quality of life assessed Quality Adjusted Life
      Years (EQ-5D based) Patient satisfaction and experience of the process (qualitative data)
