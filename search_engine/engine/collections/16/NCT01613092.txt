      conventional vs. incremental antibiotic therapy for 2 months or until eligible 20 patients
      are treated, whichever comes first. At 2 months, centers will have a crossover period of 4
      weeks where the alternate strategy is implemented, followed by the final 2-month/20 patient
      enrolment period. During each treatment period the randomized antibiotic strategy will be
      used on all center patients undergoing a device implant procedure. Prior to the planned
      surgery or at the first follow up visit, patients who meet the study eligibility criteria
      will be approached to obtain consent for data collection purposes. Follow up will be
      according to usual clinical care at the center.
