      old undergoing heart surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The objective of this study is to
      assess the role of TWBC in use of HTK cardioplegia compared with the use of HTK cardioplegia
      alone in open heart surgery of complex congenital heart disease. This study will be conducted
      at the National Cardiac Centre Harapan Kita Hospital Indonesia. Surgery will be performed in
      the operating room of Pediatric and Congenital Cardiac Surgery Unit. This study uses
      non-probability consecutive sampling. The samples are all pediatric patients with complex
      congenital heart disease who meet the inclusion criteria and not excluded by the exclusion
      criteria. Patients will be divided into two groups, the treatment group who received HTK
      cardioplegia and TWBC, and the control group that only received HTK cardioplegia alone.
      Hearts will be arrested with HTK solution during cardiac operation. HTK cardioplegia will be
      given through the aortic root at a dose of 50-60 ml/kg after aortic cross-clamped. For the
      treatment group, TWBC will be given shortly before the aortic cross clamp is removed at a
      dose of 10 to 15 ml/kg with temperature of 34 to 36 oCelcius. TWBC is a mixture of blood and
      HTK kardioplegia with a composition of four to one. The outcomes of this study are
      malondialdehyde as a marker of reperfusion injury due to oxidative stress, caspase-3 as a
      marker of apoptosis, cTn-I as a marker of myocardial cell damage and the incidence of low
      cardiac output syndrome.
