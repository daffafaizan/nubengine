      Children are often given a small dose either by mouth or squirted into the nose. Children
      will often spit out the oral midazolam, making it difficult to know how much medicine, if
      any, they have received. Giving midazolam into the nose is more reliable, but children may
      complain of pain, stinging, and may become upset due to the discomfort. Nosebleeds may also
      occur when midazolam is squirted alone into the nose. The purpose of this study is to see if
      adding a numbing medicine, xylocaine, to the nasal midazolam makes giving the midazolam
      easier and more comfortable without affecting how the midazolam works as a sedative.
