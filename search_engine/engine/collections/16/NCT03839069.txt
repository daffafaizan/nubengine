      Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), mucous membrane pemphigoid (MMP), chemical burn, Sjogren
      syndrome, chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and ocular trauma. Ocular dryness in
      combination with symblepharon and corneal opacity in these patients could lead to the poor
      visual and life quality, and less favorable prognosis of ocular reconstruction.

      This study aims to prospectively evaluate the therapeutic effects of minor salivary gland
      transplantation for cicatrizing conjunctivitis. The investigators evaluate the saliva-tear
      productivity (functional outcome) and the survival of graft (anatomical outcome) every three
      months. The investigators would also validate whether minor salivary gland transplantation is
      beneficial for the participant prior to further ocular reconstruction as limbal
      transplantation and corneal grafting.
