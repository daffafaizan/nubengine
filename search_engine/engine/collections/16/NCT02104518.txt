      will also determine the concordance between point-of-care G6PD tests and the
      spectrophotometric gold standard. This study will also access the sensitivity and specificity
      between the point-of-care G6PD tests. This study will take place in Indonesia, specifically
      in the SW Sumba region. We will enroll 700 volunteers.
