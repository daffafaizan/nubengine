      oral ingestion of glucose. Patients actually respond with pathological high plasmaglucagon
      concentrations to these stimuli. Previous studies have shown that postprandial
      hyperglucagonemia results in increased hepatic glucose production and therefore contributes
      significantly to the hyperglycemia characterizing these patients.

      Recently we have shown that patients with T2DM exhibit a normal suppression of glucagon
      secretion following an adjustable intravenous (iv) glucose challenge mimicking the glucose
      excursion following a 50-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) with the latter resulting in
      lack of glucagon suppression. Why this difference? A possible explanation could be that the
      oral administration stimulates intestinal factors resulting in a differentially glucagon
      response to the two similar glucose excursions. We wish to establish whether GIP, GLP-1
      and/or GLP-2 are responsible for the inappropriate glucagon suppression following OGTT and
      meals in patients with T2DM.
