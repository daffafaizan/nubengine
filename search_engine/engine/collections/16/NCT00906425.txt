    
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the level at which the bone can be
      maintained in relation to the implant shoulder for the P.004 two-stage implant when placed in
      a submerged or a trans-mucosal procedure in single tooth gaps in the anterior region. The
      primary parameter will be measured by radiography 26 weeks after loading of the implant.
