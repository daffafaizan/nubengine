      Primary

        -  To compare the 1-year overall median survival rate in patients with extensive stage
           small cell lung cancer treated with prophylactic cranial irradiation with vs without
           consolidative extracranial radiotherapy following platinum-based chemotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  To compare treatment-related adverse events in these patients.

        -  To evaluate patterns of failure in these patients.

        -  To compare the time to first failure in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the percentage of the planned radiotherapy dose given to each site.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to response to prior
      treatment (complete response vs partial response) and number of metastatic lesions (1 vs
      2-3). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation 5 days per week for 2 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients undergo prophylactic cranial irradiation as in arm I. Patients also
           undergo consolidative extracranial radiotherapy to locoregional and residual metastatic
           disease 5 days per week for 2-3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks; at 1, 2, 6, 9, and
      12 months; every 6 months for 2 years; and then annually thereafter.
