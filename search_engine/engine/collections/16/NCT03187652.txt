      Centre, Ontario, Canada. The investigators will identify 15-30 idiopathic thrombotic
      thrombocytopenic purpura and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome patients who are in remission
      within the last 30 days. They will be followed for 12 months from the time of their
      remission. Study procedures include routine laboratory monitoring, biomarker assessments,
      cardiovascular and neurocognitive functional assessments, and non-invasive imaging studies.
      The long-term follow-up thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and atypical hemolytic uremic
      syndrome study will help to assess the mechanisms of vascular injuries, evaluate
      cardiovascular and cerebrovascular monitoring tools, and generate novel ideas to prevent
      further vascular injuries.
