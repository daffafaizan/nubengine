        -  To assess the overall safety of sorafenib when administered with "the 2DOC regimen"
           capecitabine and oxaliplatin in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreas or biliary
           tract cancers.

        -  To define the dose limiting toxicity and maximally tolerated dose of this combination.

        -  To assess the clinical response rate (stable, partial and complete responses) of the
           combination in patients with advanced or metastatic pancreas or biliary tract cancers.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To define the time to progression and overall survival for patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  To evaluate the congruency of the Adverse Events Self-Report Survey in determining
