    
      Objective: To characterize the process and outcomes of capacity assessments of individuals
      who may be unable to consent to participate in research.

      Study population: all individuals who came to the NIH Clinical Center for possible enrollment
      in research whose capacity to consent or assent was evaluated by the Bioethics Consultation
      Service (BCS), the Human Subjects Protection Unit (HSPU), or the Ability to Consent
      Assessment Team (ACAT), and all surrogate decision makers of individuals who were unable to
      consent and were allowed by protocol to give surrogate consent.

      Design: Retrospective record review

      Outcome measures: The primary outcome measure will be whether prospective research
      participants were judged to be able to consent or not. Secondary measures will include:
      whether the consulting team considered it ethically acceptable to enroll the participant in
      research; how consent was obtained for doing so; and descriptive features of the consults
      such as the Institute that requested the consult, protocols for which consults were
      requested, and diseases that prompted capacity assessments, among other descriptive
      characteristics.
