      for the study subjects will visit the clinical unit on Day l and will have pre-dose blood
      samples taken for humoral (serum) and cellular(peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMCs)
      immunity testing and nasopharyngeal swabs for assessment of mucosa! immunity, and will then
      be given the vaccine.

      Over the next 6 months, I 0-mL blood samples will be collected on Days 4, 8, 15, 29, 91 and
      181 for HAI testing. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected on Day 8 to assess
      cellular responses. A nasopharyngeal swab will also be done on Day 29. Screening assessments
      will include clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry, urinalysis (UA), drug and
