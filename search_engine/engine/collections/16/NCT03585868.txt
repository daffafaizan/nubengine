      between 55-90 yo randomly assigned to consumption of a flavonoid rich mixture (flavonoids;
      F), alkalinized cocoa which eliminates flavonoid content (no flavonoids; NF) or placebo. All
      beverages had similar physical characteristics and flavor. Cocoa beverages were provided in
      individual sachets containing a dry powder that was reconstituted with water just before
      consumption. Subjects were instructed as above to maintain their usual lifestyle, to limit
      intake of high caloric foods and flavonoid-containing foods and beverages, and to walk for 30
      min/day.

      To determine the effect of flavonoids, study evaluates anthropometric measures, metabolic
      parameters as glycemia and a lipid profile (triglycerides, total cholesterol, high-density
      lipoprotein cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). To evaluate oxidative
      stress damage as lipid oxidation is measured with the malondialdehyde (MDA) assay. Protein
      carbonylation is measured using an assay for detection of carbonyl groups that relies on
      2,4-dinitrophenylhydrazine (DNPH) as a substrate. The investigators also evaluate
      interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor levels.

      For physical performance is evaluated the handgrip strength, and mobility assesment with the
      following test: Six-minute walk test, two-minute step, sit-up test and the up & go test.

      The investigators also assessed quality of life using the Health Related QoL (EQ-5D)
      questionnaire.
