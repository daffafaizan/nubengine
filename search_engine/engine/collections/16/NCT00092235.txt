    
      Background:

        -  Chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) is a multi-organ alloimmune and autoimmune
           disorder that occurs following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation
           (alloHSCT). It is characterized by immune dysregulation, immunodeficiency, impaired
           organ function, and decreased survival.

        -  Each year about 8000 patients receive allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant
           (alloHSCT) in North America and about 50% of patients who are transplanted develop
           cGVHD.

        -  Chronic GVHD is also a disorder that simultaneously affects many organ systems in highly
           variable fashion and requires complex and coordinated medical management by multiple
           medical specialties. There is an urgent need for progress in understanding and effective
           treatments for cGVHD as it is one of the most serious complications of cancer therapy
           and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      Objectives:

        -  To establish a multidisciplinary clinic infrastructure for study of the pathogenesis and
           natural history of cGVHD.

        -  To prospectively identify clinical and biological prognostic markers in patients with
           cGVHD

        -  To develop clinically relevant cGVHD grading scales

        -  To identify novel biological characteristics of cGVHD and to describe them in the
           context of clinical history and presentation

        -  To identify potential clinical and biological markers of cGVHD activity

        -  To improve understanding of the biology of cGVHD-associated graft-versus-tumor effects

        -  To identify potential patients for cGVHD treatment protocols at the NCI and NIH

      Eligibility:

      -Patients age 1 and older referred by the primary transplant physician for the evaluation of
      chronic graft-versus-host disease independent of underlying diagnosis.

      Design:

        -  Patient undergoes initial clinical and laboratory multispecialty work-up at the NCI
           cGVHD clinic.

        -  Minimally invasive biopsies and rarely, deep tissue biopsy may be obtained to confirm
           the diagnosis and/or rule-out other pathologic process (in adults only).

        -  Long tem data collection for evaluation of long-term outcomes will be conducted anually
           as feasible
