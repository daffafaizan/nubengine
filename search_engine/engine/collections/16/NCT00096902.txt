    
      Objective: The objective of this protocol is to test the efficacy of non-pharmacologic
      interventions for recurrent neurocardiogenic syncope. Specifically, the interventions tested
      in this study are hypnosis, patient education, hand exercises, and diary-keeping.

      Study Population: Subjects are patients ages 18 years or older with recurrent
      neurocardiogenic syncope or presyncope.

      Design: Patients who have a positive screening tilt table test are assigned to one of four
      groups: hypnosis, patient education, hand exercises, or diary-keeping. Following 6 weeks of
      outpatient intervention, all patients undergo repeat tilt table testing to complete the
      study.

      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome measure is occurrence of syncope or presyncope during
      upright tilt table testing. Secondary measures are hemodynamic and neurochemical parameters
      during upright tilt table testing, and quality of life measures including recurrence of
      outpatient syncopal episodes.
