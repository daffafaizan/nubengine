      outcomes associated with vascular occlusive events in patients treated with Iclusig
      (ponatinib) in real world settings. This registry study will collect information about
      patient demographics, leukemia diagnosis, previous anti-cancer treatments, history of
      cardiovascular disease, risk factors for vascular complications, and concurrent medications
      (including antiplatelet and/or anticoagulant agents).
