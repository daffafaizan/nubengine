      would be non-inferior to aggressive revascularization using criteria of 50% diameter stenosis
      in coronary intermediate lesions, we conducted the Conservative Revascularization versus
      Aggressive Revascularization for Coronary Stenting with Everolimus-Eluting Stents
      (SMART-CASE) trial.
