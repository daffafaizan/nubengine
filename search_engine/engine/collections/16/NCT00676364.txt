      anesthetic medications prior to venipuncture. However, the time for the anesthetic to take
      affect is approximately 60 minutes. Another anesthetic medication besides EMLA is lidocaine
      4% topical anesthetic cream (LMX4), which has a shorter acting time (30 minutes) compared to
      the EMLA, making it a more desirable medication when urgent labs are required. This
      medication is being evaluated to assess the anxiety and pain associated with venipuncture in
      15 minutes versus the approved 30 minutes of pediatric patients treated as an inpatient or
      outpatient in the local Emergency Department, compared to standard care (no prior treatment).
