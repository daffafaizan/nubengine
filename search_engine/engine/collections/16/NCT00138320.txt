      titers in the sera of newborns delivered by HSV-uninfected women vaccinated with either two
      or three doses of GSK candidate vaccine gD2t/alum-MPL and to compare the HSV-2 binding and
      neutralizing antibody titers of the newborns to those of their mothers. Secondary objectives
      are to: 1) evaluate the durability of HSV-2 binding and neutralizing antibody titers in the
      sera of newborns delivered by HSV-uninfected women vaccinated with either two or three doses
      of GSK candidate vaccine gD2t/alum-MPL; and 2) quantitate hepatitis A binding antibody titers
      in the sera of newborns delivered by women vaccinated with either two or three doses of
      HavrixÂ® hepatitis A vaccine (the control vaccine used in the Herpevac Trial for Women),
      compare hepatitis A binding antibody titers of the newborns to those of their mothers, and
      evaluate the durability of hepatitis A binding antibodies in these newborns. The sample size
      for this study cannot be determined but based on experience is not likely to be more than 50
      women. Optional additional blood will be collected from the mother and her infant at 2 mos
      and 6 mos after delivery.
