      threat; however, there are limited representative data on HBV burden, risk factors, clinical
      significance, and interaction with co-infections and co-morbidities that are common in
      Zambia. In collaboration with the Central Statistical Office, MoH, and Centers for Disease
      Control and Prevention, the Zambia Population-Based HIV Impact Assessment (ZAMPHIA) will be
      testing a representative sample of Zambians across all 10 provinces for HBV infection. This
      is an important first step toward understanding the burden of disease and its distribution
      across the country. The goal of this study is to generate further information for consumption
      by local and regional health policymakers. The Investigators will research the epidemiologic
      risk factors for lifetime and current HBV infection, characterize clinical features of
      chronic HIV in Zambia, and describe key virological, serological, and comorbid factors that
      are critical to developing the best policies for HBV control in Zambia.
