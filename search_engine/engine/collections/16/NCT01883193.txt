      environments of commencing a daily comprehensive maternal nutrition supplement (with
      additional balanced calorie/protein supplement for underweight participants) â‰¥ 3 months prior
      to conception versus the benefits of commencing the same supplement at 12 weeks gestation and
      also to compare offspring outcomes with those of a control group which receives no
      supplement.
