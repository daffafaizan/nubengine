    
      Methods:

      It is expected that 30 patients will be randomly assigned to the following groups:
      electroacupuncture group, control group without EA. Two groups of subjects started to
      rehabilitation therapy at a hospital or clinic at the 4th week after surgery.

      Mode of operation:

      Electroacupuncture group: At the 4th week after surgery, electroacupuncture was performed,
      and the activity of wrist joint on the affected side was performed at same time, and at a
      frequency of three times per week for four weeks, for a total of twelve times.

      Control group: At the 4th week after surgery, only the activity of wrist joint on the
      affected side was performed, and at a frequency of three times per week for four weeks, for a
      total of twelve times.

      Acupoint selection: needles were inserted to Kunlun(BL60), Yanglingquan (GB34),
      Sanyinjiao(SP6), Taixi (KI 3) contralateral to the operated leg and deqi sensation elicited
      at acupoints.

      Data collection:

      The evaluator does not know the patient group to achieve a single blind effect.

        1. Use the visual analog scale (VAS) to assess the patient's pain level

        2. Use the Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand(DASH) to assess the patient's pain
           and the inability.

        3. The degrees of wrist mobility were measured.

        4. Three time points were recorded: before the first electroacupuncture (4th week after
           surgery, when removing fixation), after the 6th, 12th (last) electroacupuncture.

        5. Record the time point of the wrist joint recovery function and return to the workplace.
