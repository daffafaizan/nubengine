      develop hypovolemia (too little fluids in the vascular space) due to conditions such as
      hemorrhage, dehydration, or infection with vascular leak. Alternatively, patients may become
      hypervolemic (too much fluids in the vascular space), due to conditions such as heart
      failure, renal failure, or iatragenic over-resuscitation all of which overwhelm the kidney's
      ability to regulate intravascular volume status. In clinical practice, clinicians strive to
      return patients to euvolemia (the "right" volume status) through the administration of
      intravenous fluids or diuretics which remove fluids to achieve homeostasis. While there are a
      number of proposed clinical exam findings (e.g. dry mucous membranes or skin turgor),
      measurements (e.g. central venous pressure), or laboratory tests (e.g. blood urea nitrogen),
      none are precise or universally accepted as reliable methodologies to assess volume status.

      The goal of this study is to perform a prospective observational study on three distinct
      cohorts during ED presentation to assess the variability and performance of PIVA in tracking
      volume status.
