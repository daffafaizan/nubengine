      long-acting stimulant, on multiple dimensions of attention and on working memory.
      Specifically, we will investigate the following two hypotheses: (1) OROS-methylphenidate will
      result in improved performance on measures assessing multiple domains of attention, including
      sustained attention, attentional control, selective attention, and divided attention, and (2)
      OROS-methylphenidate will result in improved performance on measures of working memory. In
      addition we will use the study to collect pilot data on whether the magnitude of the effect
      of OROS-methylphenidate varies across the different components of attention and working
      memory and whether improvement across any of these measures is helpful in predicting parent
      or teacher ratings of improvement.
