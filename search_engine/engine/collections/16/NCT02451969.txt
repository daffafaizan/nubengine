    
      This study is a randomized, double-blind, single-center, controlled phase III clinical trial.
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of an investigational
      23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) manufactured by Sinovac Biotech Co., Ltd.
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that the immunogenicity of the
      investigational vaccine is non-inferior to that of a commercialized 23-valent PPV
      manufactured by Chengdu Institute of Biological products Co., Ltd.; the secondary objective
      is to assess the safety of the investigational and control vaccines. Participants will be
      grouped into three cohorts by age: child cohort (2 - 17 years old), adult cohort (18 - 60
      years old) and elderly cohort (â‰¥ 61 years old). In each cohort, the participants will be
      randomly assigned into experimental group or control group in the ratio 1:1.
