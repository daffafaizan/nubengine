      enrolled in this observational trial to gather data on their outcomes related to BK viremia
      and rejection rates. Two groups of patients were compared.

      Retrospective (historical or control) group of subjects: patients who had received a kidney
      transplant and were inducted with Thymoglobulin prior to study initiation.

      Prospective group of subjects: patients who is scheduled to receive kidney transplant and
      will be inducted with Simulect (Basiliximab).
