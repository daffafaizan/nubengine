      Furthermore, there is evidence that the quality of VC positioning is correlating with the
      risk for proximal shunt obstruction. Ultrasound or neuronavigation are used in order to
      improve to placement. However, they are associated with significant technical efforts and
      increased time.

      In this study a simple instrument assisted by a smart phone application software is used in
      order to achieve precise placement of ventricular catheters. The results are compared with
      the standard free-hand procedure. Patients requiring a ventricular catheter are randomized to
      one of the two treatments. The primary outcome parameter is a qualitative and quantitative
      assessment of the position of the ventricular catheter on a post-operative image. The
      evaluation of the primary criteria is performed by a radiologist blinded to the randomization
      arm.
