      relieve respiratory muscle fatigue for COPD,and arterial blood gas is the gold standard to
      evaluate ventilation status,but the procedure is time consuming,invasive, painful and in some
      patients.

      Sidestream end-tidal CO2 has been found to be closely correlated to PaCO2 especially when
      people have the stable hemodynamics and normal lung function. PETCO2 can basically reflect
      the level of PaCO2, but for patients with COPD, due to the presence of airway obstruction and
      emphysema formation, which cause ventilation-perfusion ratio(V/Q) , result to dead
      space-tidal volume ratio(VD/VT) and right-to-left shunting(Qs/Qt), the time of various lung
      units discharge of carbon dioxide is not synchronous. Some investigators found that PETCO2
      measurements did not reflect PaCO2 in COPD patients. There may be several reasons for this
      discrepancy. Due to airway obstruction and ventilation-perfusion mismatch, there is a delay
      in the maximum alveolar concentration of CO2 reaching the cannula, which may give lower
      PETCO2 values compared with PaCO2. To overcome this disadvantage, we tried to prolong their
      expiratory time (extend to 5-8s) in order to guarantee adequate time for alveolar CO2
      reaching the cannula.

      our study mainly focus on two issues.First, to explore the optimal depth of tube placed when
      patients with COPD breathe spontaneously or receive noninvasive ventilation, and compare the
      differences of two condition at the same time. Secondly, to evaluate the agreement between
      the PaCO2 and sidestream PETCO2（5s）values in COPD patients receiving noninvasive ventilation
      when our extension tube locates in the optimal position, and investigate whether
      PETCO2（5s）can be used to monitor ventilation status dynamically.
