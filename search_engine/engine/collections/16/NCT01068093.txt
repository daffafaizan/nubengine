      disease resulted in significant reduction of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol(LDL-C) and
      regression of coronary plaque volume, and a decrease in the level of LDL-C through statin
      treatment positively correlates with a reduction in the volume of plaques. Administration of
      Ezetimibe in addition to statin has been shown to be more effective at reducing LDL-C levels
      compared with statin monotherapy. However, the effects of Ezetimib on coronary plaque volume
      remain unclear. In this study, the investigators assess the effect of Ezetimibe on coronary
      plaque volume and tissue composition in patients with acute coronary syndrome.
