      achieved in patients treated with total body irradiation before transplant and tacrolimus and
      mycophenolate mofetil after transplant. II. Document the nonhematologic toxicities of this
      regimen. III. Characterize immune reconstitution of patients during this treatment regimen.
      IV. Document the incidence of aplasia and graft-versus-host disease associated with donor
      leukocyte infusions when administered after this regimen.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive total body irradiation in a single fraction on day -1. Tacrolimus
      is given orally twice per day on days -1 to 50. Mycophenolate mofetil is given orally on day
      0 and twice per day on days 1 to 28. Patients receive donor bone marrow infusion on day 0.
      Patients are evaluated on days 56, 180, 292, and 365. If there is donor engraftment, donor
      chimerism is less than 80%, there is no active graft-versus-host disease, no disease
      progression, less than 50% decrease in donor cell chimerism from last measurement, and the
      patient is not taking immunosuppressive agents, then donor leukocyte infusions are
      administered on days 70, 194, and 306. Patients are followed annually for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study.
