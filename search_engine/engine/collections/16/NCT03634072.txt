      to help understand and improve the lives of patients with TOF.

      Some patients diagnosed with TOF will have a procedure called pulmonary valve replacement
      (PVR) and some will not. PVR is done for valves that are too damaged to be repaired. This
      requires a surgeon or an expert in a procedure called cardiac catheterization to replace the
      damaged pulmonary valve with a valve made of tissue or amechanical valve. Multiple studies in
      adult TOF patients have suggested that PVR may lessen many clinical symptoms but no one is
      sure if it truly does. There is little information about PVR in adolescence but it is thought
      that lessening the amount of leakage of the pulmonary valve at a young age may avoid future
      complications such as right heart failure or abnormal beats of your heart. There is no
      agreement among cardiologists, surgeons or other healthcare providers as to whether PVR truly
      helps avoid complications in the future and if it does, when PVR should be done. Using the
      information in this study, we hope to find out if PVR in adolescents is helpful in both the
      short and long term.

      The Investigators believe the results of this study will help provide doctors with enough
      information to support a future large scale research study to further evaluate the outcomes
      PVR. This study will involve randomization to either the PVR or no PVR cohort, medical
      records review, exercise test and Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) , and questionnaires.
