      patients despite advances in cancer treatment. Few effective treatment options exist for
      these symptoms. Integrative medicine is rising in popularity in the United States; however,
      few integrative medicine modalities have been rigorously studied. Ayurveda, a whole system of
      medicine that originated in the Indian subcontinent, has its own system of diagnostics and
      therapeutics, and among its strengths are wellness and prevention. We aim to perform a
      prospective single arm clinical study of a manualized Ayurvedic approach in breast cancer
      survivors with impaired quality of life. Specifically, we aim to develop the manualized
      Ayurvedic intervention; to assess feasibility; and to determine whether clinically meaningful
      effects can be achieved with the intervention.
