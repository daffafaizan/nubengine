    
      This is an open-label, phase 1b, proof-of-concept study to assess the safety and efficacy of
      EBP921, a prenylation inhibitor, in subjects chronically infected with delta hepatitis.
      Subjects will be randomized to receive one of two different doses of EBP921. Dosing will
      occur over 28-days and during that time, evidence of antiviral response will be assessed by
      frequent measurements of HDV-RNA via PCR assay. In addition, safety lab data will also be
      collected along with surveillance monitoring of HBV activity.
