      provide feasibility data on adapting an established empirically-based cognitive intervention
      for homeless youth to help them attain vocational goals. The ultimate purpose is that youth
      will improve in cognitive functioning and have better functional outcomes including jobs to
      sustain independent living.

      The results of this study will inform a larger trial on the efficacy of cognitive remediation
      in homeless youth to improve cognition and vocational outcomes. Hypotheses are that, compared
      to those in an active control group receiving computerized work-skills training, individuals
      who receive cognitive remediation will show greater cognitive benefits on proximal measures
      of neurocognition and evidence better vocational outcome as defined by greater number of
      hours worked. This study will address the service gap in the use of integrated psychosocial
      interventions for homeless populations as the first investigation of cognitive remediation in
      homeless youth.
