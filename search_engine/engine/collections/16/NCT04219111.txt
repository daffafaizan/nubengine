      which may be associated with TKI resistance in order to better stratify CML patients and
      allow a more targeted approach to therapy. The project may also help elucidate the mechanism
      of resistance in those without a discernible TKD mutation. Ultimately it is hoped that this
      would lead to larger studies which could improve the clinical pathway for CML patients
      without TKD mutations.

      Some previous studies have studied the gene expression profile of CML patients demonstrating
      resistance to TKIs, using Affymetrix arrays. However, none of these appear to have
      specifically investigated non-responders with and without a TKD mutation.
