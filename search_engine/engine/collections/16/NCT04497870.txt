      be randomized to receive approximately 10.9 mg路kg-1路d-1 of PMO or to receive approximately
      18.2 mg路kg-1路d-1 (1.67-fold the median dose).

      Following the single-dose PK study, a PD study will be carried out wherein the subjects will
      receive their assigned dose of PMO for 7 days.

      At baseline (before the PK study) and after the PK study (i.e., during the PD study),
      subjects will keep a pain and stooling diary, collect stool for microbiome analysis, and
      swallow a SmartPill to measure gut motility and transit time. At baseline only, anxiety,
      depression, somatization will be measured. During the PD study, any side effects will be
      recorded.
