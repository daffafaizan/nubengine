      tourniquet pressure used of systolic blood pressure + 75 mmHg, systolic blood pressure + 100
      mmHg, and systolic blood pressure + 150 mmHg.

      All patients had spinal anesthesia, the same operative procedure, and postoperative pain
      protocol. A visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain were recorded 24, 48 hours, and 2 weeks
      postoperatively. Quality of bloodless visual field and calculated blood loss were evaluated
      perioperatively. Postoperative ROM, wound complication, deep vein thrombosis (DVT), pulmonary
      embolism (PE) were recorded at 2, 6, and 12 weeks. Furthermore, Knee Society Score (KSS) also
      recorded at 6 weeks, 3 and 6 months. The reviewers were blinded to the treatment group.
