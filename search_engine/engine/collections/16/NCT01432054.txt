      specimens in Subjects with various wound classifications and types for the purpose of a Human
      Tissue Repository to be used as a resource for future tissue repair research at KCI USA, Inc.
      Subjects participating in this study will have a 6mm tissue punch biopsy or equivalent tissue
      specimen harvested from the healthiest margin of the wound. Tissue collection may occur at
      Visits 2, 3, 4 and 5. Visit 2 may be combined with Screening, Visit 1. Subjects will have a
      minimum of one (1) and a maximum of four (4) specimen collection visits. Specimens may be
      collected from one or multiple different tissues (connective tissue, muscle, bone, and
      dermis) at any or all visits. Each specimen will be placed in a separate appropriate vial.
      Necrotic tissue with eschar and bodily fluids such as blood, wound fluid or sputum will not
      be collected. Tissue from healthy, healing wounds will also be accepted. Tissue collection
      visits shall occur at least twenty-four (24) hours apart. Ten (10) to twenty-five (25)
      percent of the sites will be selected to collect all the specimens in cryovials containing a
      pre-aliquoted amount (1.5mL) of RNAlater. Ten (10) to twenty-five (25) percent of the sites
      will be selected to collect all the specimens in cryovials containing a pre-aliquoted amount
      of HypoThermosol. The remaining sites will collect all the specimens in a vial containing no
      diluents. All samples will be coded by the collection site prior to shipment to KCI.
