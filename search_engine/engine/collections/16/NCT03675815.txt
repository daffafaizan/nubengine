      ritonavir-boosted darunavir plus two nucleosides or dolutegravir plus two predetermined
      nucleosides (lamivudine or emtricitabine) or ritonavir-boosted darunavir plus dolutegravir.
      Enrolment into the sub-study is voluntary and not a requirement for enrolment into D2EFT.
      Parameters relevant to this study including demographics, arm of randomised ART, smoking
      status, body habitus and fasting lipid parameters and resting blood pressure at required time
      points will be collected as part of the main D2EFT study. Sub-study specific assessments
      performed at baseline and at weeks 48 and 96 include clinical and laboratory assessments,
      sample collection and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA)-assessed whole-body composition.
      Consenting participants will have blood for storage collected at weeks 0, 48 and 96. The
      specimens will be used for future studies into treatment of HIV infection and immunity.
