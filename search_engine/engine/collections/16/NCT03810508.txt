    
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) diseases are the most common inherited motor and sensory
      neuropathies, composed of a group of pathologically and genetically distinct subtypes ranging
      from slowly to rapidly progressive disease.

      CMT4J is a rare subtype of CMT caused by mutations in the FIG4 gene. Pediatric-onset disease
      can often be characterized by rapid progression of muscle weakness and atrophy, culminating
      in loss of ambulation and respiratory compromise and premature death. Adult-onset CMT4J can
      present with a more variable disease course.

      No prospective natural history study for CMT4J has been reported. This study aims to
      prospectively investigate the natural history of CMT4J, and concurrently to identify
      potential outcome measures that could be used in future clinical trials. No investigational
      product will be provided in the study.
