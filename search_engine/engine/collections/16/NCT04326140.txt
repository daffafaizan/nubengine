      limited their daily function and quality of life, as well as required considerable demands of
      long-term medical care. Robot-assisted training and mirror priming has been advocated as part
      of contemporary approaches. The robotic-assisted therapy mainly emphasized on the proximal
      part of UE, such as shoulder and elbow movement. While mirror priming strategy has been
      increasingly employed in the UE training, one question has been raised: the affected UE of
      stroke patients cannot complete the same movement as the sounded limb synchronously. This
      project will employ the robot-assisted system to assist patients to perform the grasping and
      releasing movement of both hands simultaneously while mirror priming strategy is applied,
      and, then, perform intensive and game-based finger movement training with the robotic
      assistance. This randomized controlled trial is the first study to explore the benefits of
      combined robotic-assisted therapy and mirror priming strategy in stroke patients. This
      proposed combined approach might be a novel combination of enhancing movement performance,
      daily function and quality of life for patients with stroke. This project will further
      explore the possible neuro-muscular mechanism underlying this combined mirror priming with
      robotic training. This project attempts to compare the cortical activation and neuromuscular
      control of patients with stroke and age-matched healthy adults in terms of
      electroencephalography (EEG) and muscle tone measurement. The findings of this study may lay
      an evidence-based foundation for bridging basic science and clinical application.
