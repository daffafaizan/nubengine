    
      Twenty patients with multiple thin actinic keratosis (AK) on the face will be included in the
      study. They will be informed of the procedure in detail and sign a consent form.

      Digital photographs will be done in a standardized way. Prior to treatment, all patients will
      undergo 2 skin biopsies under local anesthesia and with a 2 mm punch biopsy. One biopsy will
      be done over an AK lesion and the other in an area with no apparent AK (field cancerization).

      The patients will be treated with Daylight Photodynamic Therapy, following these steps:

        1. mild curettage of the AK lesions

        2. application of a chemical sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) 30

        3. application of methyl Aminolevulinate cream (Metvix R, Galderma Laboratories)

        4. exposition to daylight, for 120 minutes

        5. cleaning of the face

      Three months after treatment, two new skin biopsies will be collected, 1cm away from the
      initial biopsies. On the same date, new photographs will be made following the same standards
      as pre-treatment photographs.
