    
      Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis who receive standard treatment with Ustekinumab
      (45 mg at week 0, 4, and every 12 weeks) are exposed to UVB-311nm phototherapy on a
      randomized body half (left or right; head exempt) 3 x per week for six weeks and/or until
      complete response (defined as reduction in PASI to < 3). PASI score, patient visual analogue
      score (VAS) for therapeutic response, and patient VAS for severity of skin lesions is
      assessed weekly; and at follow-up visits at month 3, 6, and 12. Paired Wilcoxon testing for
      differences in PASI and patient VAS scores is done; Fischer exact test is applied to
      determine differences in complete remission, PASI reduction > 90%, > 75% and/or 50% between
      body sites.
