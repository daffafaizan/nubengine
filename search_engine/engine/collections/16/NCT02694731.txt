      smartphone app-based intervention that teaches mindful eating skills. The investigators will
      assess psychological and behavioral intervention targets using questionnaires and brief
      mobile assessments. The investigators will also measure BMI and adiposity. Assessments will
      occur at pre-intervention, post-intervention, and 1 and 2 months post intervention. At
      several times during the study, participants will also receive multiple daily text messages
      asking them to complete a brief food craving assessment on their phone. This "experience
      sampling" approach is critical as it allow the investigators to capture experiences and
      behaviors that are often brief and automatic, making them poorly suited to traditional
      retrospective questionnaires. The investigators will also assess acceptability and continued
      use of the app via anonymous usage logs.

      Overall, the aims are to 1) assess feasibility of the protocol, 2) assess changes in food
      cravings and indulgence of cravings, and 3) determine the extent to which participants remain
      engaged with the app after completing the 5-week intervention period and whether this
      predicts maintenance of benefits at 1 month and 2 months post-intervention. An exploratory
      aim is to measure the effects of the intervention on body weight, bodyfat, and bodyfat
      distribution.
