    
      In a 36-week cross-over trial, overweight adults will consume a low-fat vegan diet and a
      Mediterranean diet in two separate 16-week phases. Changes in body weight will be the primary
      dependent variable. In addition, plasma lipid concentrations, insulin sensitivity, and
      postprandial metabolism will also be assessed and changes over time will be compared between
      the two diets.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to start either a low-fat vegan diet or a
      Mediterranean diet for 16 weeks. Both groups will receive weekly classes and support, and
      will be asked to make no changes to their exercise patterns for the study period. After a
      4-week washout period, participants will cross over to the second dietary intervention for
      another 16 weeks.
