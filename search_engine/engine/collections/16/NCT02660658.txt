    
      The aim of this study is to determine the optimal single-dose of intrathecal dexmedetomidine
      that prolongs the analgesic duration with the least possible side effects.

      With the patients in the sitting position and the use of complete aseptic technique, 25G
      Whitacre spinal needles will be introduced through L2-L4 interspaces and after observing free
      flow of the CSF, a 3ml volume including bupivacaine 12.5mg in conjunction with
      dexmedetomidine (3 Âµg) will be injected in the first case, then the patient will be turned
      supine.

      The dose of intrathecal DEX given to the next patient will be guided by modified Dixon's
      up-and-down method using 1.5 mg as a step size, which assumed to be of clinical importance.
