      the effectiveness of vitamin D and zinc supplements as immune-based therapy among COVID-19
      patients in India. The study is also examining the immunological response to COVID-19 and the
      effect of the intervention on specific biomarkers of immune and endothelial activation that
      are independent and quantitative predictors of severity and mortality in other severe
      infections. The primary aims are to determine the effect of vitamin D supplementation versus
      placebo on time to recovery among patients hospitalized with COVID-19; and to determine the
      effect of zinc supplementation versus placebo on time to recovery among patients hospitalized
      with COVID-19. As secondary aims, this study is also investigating the effect of vitamin D or
      zinc supplementation on all-cause mortality. necessity for assisted ventilation, individual
      symptoms duration and biomarkers including vitamin D, Zinc, Interleukin 6 (IL-6),
      Angiopoietin-2, sTREM-1, immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM).

      Eligible individuals are randomly assigned to one of four groups: (1) Vitamin D (180,000 IU
      bolus at enrollment, followed by 2000 IU daily); (2) Zinc (placebo at enrollment followed by
      one daily dose of 40 mg); (3) Vitamin D and Zinc; or (4) Placebo. Daily supplements start at
      the hospital and continue after discharge for a total of 8 weeks. Active data collection
      occurs daily while patients are hospitalized and at least twice per week via telephone after
      discharge. A clinical exam occurs at the hospital at 8 weeks and longer-term symptoms are
      assessed at 3 months.
