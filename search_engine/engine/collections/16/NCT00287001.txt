           Q-switched nd:YAG laser treatment of acquired bilateral nevus of Ota-like macules.

        -  We assumed that epidermal cooling may minimize the non-specific injury to the epidermis
           caused during laser irradiation, leading to the decreased incidence of post inflammatory
           hyperpigmentation.
