    
      This is a prospective, multi-center (Up to 20 sites), single-arm, open-label post marketing
      clinical trial.

      The objectives: To assess the safety and efficacy of shortened DAPT duration (30 days in
      stable patients and up to 90 days in ACS patients) following PCI using the EluNIR stent, in
      patients considered to be at high bleeding risk (HBR).

      Patients will be enrolled to the study prior to the PCI procedure.Once a patient has signed
      an informed consent, met all general and angiographic eligibility criteria, and a guidewire
      has successfully been passed beyond the target lesion and lesion preparation (if indicated)
      completed, the patient will be enrolled into the trial.Data collection commences after the
      subject has signed the informed consent form. Data collection including subject demographic
      information, laboratory tests, and procedural data as well as follow-up visits or telephone
      contacts will be captured by the Investigator or site coordinator who has been trained on the
      CIP and Case Report Forms (CRF).

      After discharge from the hospital, each subject will be followed with an in-clinic follow-up
      visit at 30 days, and follow-up by phone at 6 months and 1year post procedure. Patients with
      recurrent ischemic events within the first 30 days as well as patients in whom the initial
      presentation was ACS and in whom the investigator has decided to continue DAPT beyond 30 days
      will have an additional phone follow-up at 3 months.

      The clinical investigation will last for the expected duration of each subject's
      participation.

      Each subject will remain in the clinical investigation for approximately 1 year from the time
      of the study stent implantation until the last follow-up telephone contact.

      The trial population will consist of approximately 316 male and female subjects undergoing
      PCI for angina (stable or unstable), silent ischemia, non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) considered
      at HBR.
