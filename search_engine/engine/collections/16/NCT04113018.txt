      of evaluating the efficacy of induction therapy comprised of 8 cycles of carfilzomib,
      lenalidomide, dexamethasone and daratumumab (KRd+daratumumab) in terms of complete response
      or better (CR) in subjects with NDMM, and comparing to relevant historical controls. Post
      induction, all subjects will undergo disease evaluation, including assessment of minimal
      residual disease (MRD). Post-induction disease evaluation will be followed by an MRD-based
      treatment algorithm. This trial will allow us to gather preliminary data on use of MRD status
      to direct post-induction therapy.
