      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of ABT-888 (veliparib) and
      intraperitoneal (IP) floxuridine in adult patients with advanced ovarian, primary peritoneal
      or fallopian tube cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the adverse event profile associated with this treatment combination.

      II. To assess for preliminary evidence of efficacy, such as tumor responses, of the treatment
      combination.

      III. To assess progression free survival (PFS) in the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) cohort.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assess the pharmacokinetic profile of ABT-888 and floxuridine when given in combination.

      II. Assess whether the presence of mutations in the homologous recombination pathway or loss
      of expression of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) components correlates with response to
      floxuridine + ABT-888.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of veliparib.

      Patients receive veliparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-10 and floxuridine IP on
      days 3-5. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 3 months.
