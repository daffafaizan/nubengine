           blastocysts (*) biopsied on day 5, analyzed by NGS, and will have one or two euploid
           embryo transferred on day 6, in the am. If more than two euploid blastocysts are
           available the one(s) to be transferred will be selected based on morphology (*). Any
           morulas developing to hatching blastocyst on day-6 will be also analyzed but vitrified
           for use in a future cycle.

        2. Frozen group: All embryos will be hatched on day 3. Patients will have hatching
           blastocysts (*) biopsied on day 5 or day 6, embryos will then be vitrified, analyzed by
           NGS, and will have one or two euploid embryo(s) thawed and transferred on a FET cycle,
           before noon. If more than two euploid blastocysts are available the one(s) to be
           transferred will be selected based on morphology (*).
