      normal tissue from receiving dose above specified tolerance doses. There is evidence of
      improved local control and survival with higher doses of radiation, however, at the same time
      there is the need to spare normal tissues from higher doses of radiation. Technologies that
      allow the delivery of an increased radiation dose to the tumor while sparing normal tissue
      have the potential of improving the therapeutic ratio. However, the development of these
      technologies has been hampered by organ respiratory motion particularly in the case of the
      lungs and liver. Inadequate radiation coverage of a tumor secondary to organ motion can lead
      to delivering a lower dose to a portion of the tumor. Making the field of radiation larger to
      account for organ motion results in unnecessary radiation dose to surrounding healthy
      tissues. It is therefore desirable to document the extent of motion of the organ in question
      prior to carrying out the radiation treatment planning. The organ motion impacts directly on
      the radiation dose distribution in the treatment volume.
