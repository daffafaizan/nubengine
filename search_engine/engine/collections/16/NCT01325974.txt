      service of one health centre of Mbarara municipality (low transmission setting) and one
      health centre in Kazo sub-county (high transmission setting) and for whom the clinical
      diagnosis of malaria is confirmed by smear microscopy and with at least one positive RDT.
      Patients with general signs of danger of severe malaria or who took a full course of
      antimalarial treatment in the previous 2 weeks will be excluded. Written consent will be
      sought from all participants.

      A total of 212 patients will be included in each setting. The sample size was based of a
      minimum accuracy of 8% around a proportion of 50% positive RDTs to which a 15% was added for
      patients who will not be positive for all RDTs or will be secondarily excluded from the
      analysis.

      A three-day artemether-lumefantrine will be given to enrolled cases and treatment intake will
      be supervised. RDTs and a blood smear microscopy will be repeated at day 2, 3, 5, 7, 14, 21,
      28, 35 and 42 after inclusion until all RDTs become negative. Follow-up will not last longer
      than 42 days.

      The proportion and 95% confidence intervals of positive tests among patients with a negative
      thick smear will be calculated for each day of follow-up. Moreover the investigators will
      identify for each test a regression model to estimate the number of days required to obtain a
      50, 25, 10 and 5% probability of having a false positive RDT result.

      Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values will be estimated for each
      RDT independently using the result of microscopy as a reference. The analysis will be
      performed using the day 0 results for all patients enrolled in the study.
