           flow in patients with Fabry's cardiomyopathy using LV 2D strain, diastolic stress
           echocardiography, LV vortex flow and CMR.

        2. Primary/Secondary Endpoint

           A. Primary endpoint:

           - Change of peak exercise E/E' by diastolic stress echocardiography, global longitudinal
           strain and LV vortex flow parameters at 2 year follow up.

           B. Secondary endpoints:

             -  Changes of extracellular volume by CMR (T1 mapping) at 2 year follow up

             -  Evaluation of the degree of the resting LV diastolic function

             -  Evaluation of global and regional LV strain

             -  Other echo-parameters; LV mass index at baseline, 2 year follow up, reduction of
                peak exercise E/E prime at 2 year follow up

             -  Changes of quality of life using questionnaire

             -  Change of peak VO2, exercise time, AT by diastolic stress echocardiography at 2
                year follow up

             -  Change in T1 baseline (myo, ms) & T1 baseline (blood, ms) T1 postcontrast (myo, ms)
                & T1 baseline (blood, ms) by CMR

        3. Study Methods -Study Design: This is an observational study. No treatment or
           intervention will be assigned to the subjects. All patients will receive full standard
           of care concomitant medication for the treatment of their cardiac condition. 20 patients
           with genetically confirmed Anderson-Fabry disease who have a plan to start Migalastat
           will undergo 2D strain, diastolic stress echocardiography, LV vortex flow analysis, and
           CMR at baseline and after 2 year of treatment with Migalastat for follow-up.
