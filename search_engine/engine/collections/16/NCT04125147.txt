    
      Pedicle Subtraction osteotomy (PSO) is a surgical option for treating several spinal
      deformities. It has been utilized in alignment disorders of the fused spine, in the lumbar
      spine to treat large sagittal deformities and in patients with ankylosing spondylitis with
      thoracolumbar kyphotic deformity.

      PSO typically results in substantial loss of blood (as much as 2L) with a significant portion
      of the loss likely occurring at the osteotomy surfaces post-surgically. The control of
      peri-operative blood loss is considered a critical issue by spine surgeons. A variety of
      methods have been proposed for the reduction of blood loss during or immediately after spine
      surgery, including preoperative use of erythropoietin, autologous blood, cell salvage,
      intra-operative controlled hypotension, and the use of anti-fibrinolytic drugs. Bone
      hemostats have traditionally not been part of the standard of care to promote hemostasis
      probably because most traditional options (e.g., bone wax) are nonabsorbable and thus might
      interfere with fusion at the osteotomy site.

      MONTAGE is a settable (hardening) bioabsorbable polymer and hydroxyapatite/beta tricalcium
      phosphate based putty, used in the control of bleeding from bone during spine, orthopedic,
      craniomaxillofacial, thoracic and other surgical procedures, and has been FDA cleared.
