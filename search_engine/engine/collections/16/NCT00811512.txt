      can be associated with abnormalities of anterior and posterior segments. The most common
      anterior characteristics include corneal opacities, angle-closure and a shallow anterior
      chamber and cataract. The main findings of posterior segment are uveal effusion, retinal
      folds, abnormalities of macular capillary vascularization, absence of foveal depression and
      peripheral retinoschisis. We performed on 3 patients with microphthalmos and their OCT
      features of posterior segment.
