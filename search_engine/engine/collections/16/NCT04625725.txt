      2020, has resulted in a high death toll to date. Unlike the majority of coronaviruses that
      cause mild disease in humans and animals, SARS-CoV-2 can replicate in the lower respiratory
      tract to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and fatal pneumonia. Effective
      interventions to prevent or treat COVID-19 remain limited in number and clinical experience
      is limited. Clinical management is limited to supportive care, consequently overwhelming
      resources of healthcare systems around the world. As a response to the ongoing pandemic,
      AstraZeneca is developing mAbs to the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein
      contains the virus's RBD, which enables the virus to bind to receptors on human cells. By
      targeting this region of the virus's spike protein, antibodies can block the virus's
      attachment to human cells, and, therefore, is expected to block infection. Amino acid
      substitutions have been introduced into the antibodies to both extend their half-lives, which
      should prolong their potential prophylactic benefit, and decrease Fc effector function in
      order to decrease the potential risk of antibody-dependent enhancement of disease. AZD7442, a
      combination of 2 of these mAbs (AZD8895 and AZD1061), is being evaluated for administration
      to prevent and/or treat COVID-19. There is currently one ongoing Phase I study with AZD7442.
