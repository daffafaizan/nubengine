      and glycemic control in diabetes patients. Participants will provide demographic and clinical
      information, fill human value questionnaires and quality of life questionnaires and decide on
      personal lifestyle-improvement goals. They will then be randomized to one of two groups: the
      control group gets informational text message and the intervention group gets motivational
      text message. The patients get a weekly text message and after 26 weeks we will check the
      HbA1c and quality of life. The text message will be personalized by including personal
      details acquired by a questionnaire. They will provide demographic and clinical information.

      In addition, the influence of demographic characters and related DM character on the benefit
      of the motivational SMS will be assessed.
