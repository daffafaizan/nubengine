        -  Compare overall survival in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma treated with
           raltitrexed with or without cisplatin.

        -  Assess toxicity, progression free survival, and quality of life with these treatment
           regimens in these patients.

        -  Evaluate objective response and duration of response to these treatment regimens in
           patients with measurable disease.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to
      performance status (0 vs 1-2) and WBC count (less than 8,300/mm3 vs 8,300/mm3 or more).
      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on day 1.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive raltitrexed IV over 15 minutes followed by cisplatin IV over
           1-2 hours on day 1.

      Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      Quality of life is assessed before study, prior to each course, after the last course, and
      then every 6 weeks for 1 year.

      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until death.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients will be accrued for this study over 24 months.
