        -  Compare the overall survival of patients with locally advanced, metastatic, and/or
           relapsed endometrial cancer treated with doxorubicin and cisplatin with or without
           paclitaxel.

        -  Compare the toxicity of these regimens in these patients.

        -  Compare the progression-free survival at 18 months of patients treated with these
           regimens.

        -  Compare quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified
      according to performance status (0 vs 1 vs 2), metastatic disease (M0 vs M1), prior pelvic
      radiotherapy for pelvic recurrence (yes vs no), and participating center. Patients are
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 30 minutes, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, and
           cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses
           in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin and cisplatin as in arm I. Quality of life is
           assessed at baseline, before each course, after courses 3 and 6, every 3 months for 2
           years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter. In the event of
           progressive disease, quality of life is assessed every 3 months.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then
      annually thereafter. In the event of progressive disease, patients are followed every 3
      months.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 140 patients will be accrued for this study.
