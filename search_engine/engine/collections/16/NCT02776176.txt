      designed to reduce morbidity after surgery, resulting in a shorter hospital stay. The present
      study evaluated this approach in the context of radical surgery for pediatric patients with
      Hirschsprung's Disease(HD). Patients undergoing radical surgery for HD will be enrolled in a
      randomized clinical trial comparing ERAS protocol vs a control group that received standard
      care. The primary outcome is median length of postoperative hospital stay. The second
      outcomes include postoperative complications rates，gastrointestinal function recovery
      time，mean cost per patient，readmission rates within postoperative 30 days，and the levels of
      stress and inflammation marker.
