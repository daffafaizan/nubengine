      immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients. Among all renal transplant recipients,
      patients with negative tuberculin skin test and no other indications for latent tuberculosis
      infection will be enrolled in this study. We will exam T-SPOT.TB test in these patients, and
      observe the developement of tuberculosis within 1 to 2 years after the transplantation. The
      results of T-SPOT.TB will be blinded to the investigators.
