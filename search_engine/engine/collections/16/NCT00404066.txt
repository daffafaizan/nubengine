      (Her2/neu) tyrosine kinase activity. EGFR and ErbB2 receptors are frequently over-expressed
      or altered in human cancers including breast cancer. This study plans to determine the
      antitumor activity of this regimen and its effectiveness preventing tumor growth and spread.

      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy which achieves pathologic complete responses (pCR) has been shown to
      predict improved long-term survival and serves as a surrogate for clinical outcome. By using
      this primary endpoint we can obtain statistical data with smaller patient numbers and at a
      lower overall cost. Additionally, we hope to correlate clinical and radiologic outcomes with
      gene expression data.
