    
      The Physiologic Pacing Registry will be conducted to gain a deeper understanding of
      physiologic pacing device implants and follow-up workflows, including device and programmer
      measurements to help inform Abbott's product and clinical data development efforts.
      Additionally, the registry will provide a broader understanding of the clinical utility in
      mapping physiologic pacing structures with the use of Abbott's EnSite Cardiac Mapping System
      with an electrophysiology catheter prior to device implants for those institutions where
      mapping is routine care prior to physiologic pacing device implant.

      The registry will include patients undergoing implantation of an Abbott pacemaker,
      defibrillator, or a cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) pacemaker (CRT-P) or CRT
      defibrillator (CRT-D) according to the clinical site's routine care. Only patients scheduled
      to receive an Abbott device may be enrolled to ensure proper device data collection for
      future software and other physiologic pacing product development. The decision to provide
      physiologic pacing therapy and selection of devices for implant are at the discretion of the
      implanting physician. Abbott will collect data on the use of all commercially available leads
      and associated implant tools based on the physician's discretion as part of routine clinical
      practice within the registry.
