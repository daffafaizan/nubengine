      the treatment of patients with POEMS syndrome. This trial will enroll ten subjects, who will
      complete 12 four-week cycles of DARA, in combination with the IMiD lenalidomide. Objectives
      of this study include improvement in neuropathy and performance status, as well as
      improvement in laboratory values and survival.

      Patients will receive DARA in the outpatient setting, with infusions being administered in
      Infusion 4. Safety and response assessments will occur prior to Cycles 1 through 6, and at
      the end of DARA treatment. Once DARA is completed, response assessments are completed every 6
      months for the first year, then annually until disease progression. Subjects will also be
      followed for overall survival.
