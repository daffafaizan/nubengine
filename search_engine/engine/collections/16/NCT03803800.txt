      First, static(isometric) muscle strength (dynamometry), exercise capacity (maximal graded
      exercise test) and body composition (DEXA) will be evaluated. After 4 days of recovery, m.
      vastus lateralis muscle samples (Bergström procedure) will be taken. Hereafter, MS patients
      will be randomly allocated to one of four intervention groups following either 12 weeks of
      'classical' moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise therapy (n=40) or periodized exercise
      therapy (n=40), with (MSβclassic, n=20; MSβperiod, n=20) or without (MSclassic, n=20;
      MSperiod, n=20) β-alanine supplementation. Groups not receiving β-alanine supplements, will
      receive placebo tablets that will be identical in taste and appearance. To evaluate post
      training fatigue, perceived exertion will be recorded following each training session (6-20
      BORG scale). Following 12 weeks of classic or periodized training POST intervention
      measurements will be performed similar to baseline.
