      age (GA), birth weight (BW), and postmenstrual age (PMA) at time of intravitreal injection.
      The zone and stage of ROP were also recorded. All patients were evaluated for refractive
      errors and cycloplegic refraction was performed using a handheld auto keratorefractometer
      (Righton Retinomax K-plus2), and confirmed by retinoscopy examination. Refractive errors were
      calculated as spherical equivalent and astigmatism in cylinder. The average corneal radius of
      curvature was measured by handheld auto kerato-refractometer (Righton Retinomax K-plus2). The
      biometric optic components, including anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and axial
      length, were measured using A-scan ultrasound (model Echoscan US-4000 / 500; Nidek)
