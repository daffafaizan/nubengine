    
      In this prospective double blinded randomized study,120 parturients undergoing cesarian
      delivery via a Pfannenstiel incision and who agreed to spinal anesthesia were randomly
      scheduled to receive either a SAM (group SAM, n=60) or a Quadratus lumborum block type 3
      (group QLB, n=60).Spinal anesthesia was initiated with hyperbaric Bupivacaïne 0.5% 10 mg,
      0,005 mg SUFENTANIL MEDIS and 0.1 mg morphine in the SAM group and with Bupivacaïne 0.5% 10
      mg, 0,005 mg SUFENTANIL MEDIS and 1 ml normal saline in group QLB.

      After surgery, bilateral QLB block type 3 was performed with the patient in lateral position
      using bupivacaine 0.25% , 20 mL on each side in group QLB and 20 ml normal saline in group
      SAM.

      Postoperative analgesia for the first 24 hours consisted of a patient controlled analgesia
      with IV morphine only. If necessary breakthrough pain was treated by 01 g paracetamol
      intravenously by the same doctor in charge of taking the values of the visual analogue scale.

      Patients were assessed postoperatively in the postanesthesia care unit (time 0 hours) and at
      2, 4, 6, 12 and 24 hours.

      Visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain at rest and during the palpation of the uterine globe
      was noted.

      The primary outcome measure was the total dose of morphine over 24 hours delivered by a
      patient-controlled analgesia system at predetermined intervals.

      Secondary outcomes were visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain at rest and on the palpation of
      the uterine globe ,heart rate, blood pressure, itching, nausea, pruritus, vomiting and
      sedation.
