      orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate cortices. A possible treatment approach for ADHD would
      employ a process designed to promote healthier function of the anterior cingulate region. The
      anterior cingulate in particular appears to be implicated in the activation of cognitive
      control networks, and has been posited as an area of interest for therapeutic research on
      ADHD. The subjects in this research study will be recruited through medical practice and
      enrolled in an 8-week protocol to undergo 8 consecutive weekly ultrasound sessions.
