      onset of clinically detectable inflammatory arthritis (IA). It is now a realistic goal to
      treat individuals in this pre-clinical phase with the possibility of arresting their
      progression to clinical disease.

      Individuals at risk of developing RA can be identified by the presence of CCP antibodies
      alongside other clinical features. In Leeds we have developed a prediction model that
      stratifies these individuals into at-risk vs. low risk. At present there are no treatments in
      this pathway until individuals develop IA.

      T-cells appear to be an appropriate target in at-risk individuals as they play a critical
      role in the generation and maintenance of autoimmunity. Abatacept (Orencia) is a selective
      T-cell modulator that blocks a co-stimulatory signal needed to activate T-cells and has an
      excellent safety profile.
