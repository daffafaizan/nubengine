      with HIV are of reproductive age. There is a growing need to provide effective contraception
      for those women who want or need to be protected against pregnancy. However, there is concern
      for decreased contraceptive efficacy in women on antiretroviral therapy who rely on hormonal
      contraception due to drug-drug interactions. Of particular concern is a possible interaction
      with etonogestrel, the active hormone in a long-acting reversible contraceptive implant. We
      propose a pilot study to evaluate the effect of efavirenz (EFV), a commonly used
      non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor, on the pharmacokinetics of the etonogestrel
      implant. We will recruit 18 healthy women who have had the implant in place for 12 to 24
      months. They will be asked to take a two-week course of efavirenz. During these two weeks and
      for four additional weeks, we will monitor semi-weekly etonogestrel concentrations, and
      serum, ultrasound, and cervical mucus markers of ovulation. We will also assess efavirenz
      concentration at baseline and at the end of the two-week treatment course. We will derive
      pharmacokinetic parameters and compare concentrations across time points. Results will help
      to inform the design of larger studies, and of similar studies with different antiretroviral
      medications. We hypothesize that taking efavirenz while using the etonogestrel contraceptive
      implant will not result in an increased incidence of ovulation.
