      main objective to assess if Cushing's syndrome induces changes in the ECS activity.

      For this purpose:

        1. the investigors will compare plasma levels of ECS between obese controls and patients
           with Cushing's syndrome

        2. the investigors will compare plasma levels of ECS in patients with Cushing's syndrome
           before and immediately after curative surgery

        3. the investigors will compare plasma levels of ECS in patients with hypoadrenalism before
           and after the intake of substitutive doses of hydrocortisone

        4. the investigors will evaluate the plasma levels of ECS during a short synacthen test in
           healthy subjects.
