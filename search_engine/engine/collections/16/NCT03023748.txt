    
      This is a 2-year single-arm intervention study of which intravenous paricalcitol will be
      provided as a second-line treatment to 30 chronic hemodialysis patients with severe SHPT
      (defined as intact parathyroid hormone [iPTH] ≥ 800pg/mL) resistant to existing vitamin D
      analogs treatment (including rocaltrol and alfacalcidol) or with hypercalcemia (defined as
      serum calcium ≥2.56mmol/L) precluding the use of existing vitamin D analogs.

      The study aims to evaluate the control of SHPT, various biochemical parameters of chronic
      kidney disease-mineral bone disease, left ventricular mass and volumes, vascular
      calcification and stiffness parameters, handgrip strength and serum albumin with the use of
      intravenous paricalcitol in patients receiving chronic hemodialysis treatment.
