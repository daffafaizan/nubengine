      I. To determine whether short-term administration of zileuton, a 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO)
      inhibitor, in current smokers will suppress the formation of urinary leukotriene E4 (LTE4)
      and shunt arachidonic acid into the cyclooxygenase (COX) pathway, resulting in elevated
      urinary prostaglandin E-metabolite (PGE-M).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether short-term co-administration of celecoxib, a selective COX-2
      inhibitor, and zileuton suppresses levels of both urinary LTE4 and PGE-M in current smokers.

      II. To evaluate the association between baseline levels of urinary LTE4 and magnitude of the
      arachidonic acid shunt induced by zileuton.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive zileuton orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-6.

      ARM II: Patients receive zileuton as in Arm I and celecoxib PO BID on days 1-6.
