    
      Research Plan: A prospective assessor-blinded randomized controlled which will recruit 130
      pediatric surgical patients aged 4-10 years, undergoing elective operation in KKH. Eligible
      patients will be identified when an operation date has been booked. They will be approached
      by a research coordinator (RC) who will counsel about the study details, and recruited after
      consent.

      Randomisaiton will be performed. The subjects will be randomised into group A and group B.

      Group A will undergo standard workflow for elective surgical admissions.

      Group B, in addition to standard workflow, will also receive the PFO bundle which consists
      of:

      A cartoon video of about 6 minutes duration illustrating the events occuring during
      admission, anaesthesia and surgery. Video will be given out in DVD and/or with a weblink and
      a QR code for scanning. The weblink is password protected and is only given to participant
      and their parents randomised into the video group. Instruction will be given to participants
      and their parents to watch the video 3 days prior to admission

      Sets of activity sheets which have been tailored for different age groups. Families would be
      encouraged to complete activity sheets together.
