    
      In this crossover design trial, patients will be asked to first wear their normal ostomy
      pouching equipment for 28 days followed by 28 days with the OstoRingÂ®. Patients may choose to
      continue using the OstoRing for an additional 19 days. Study visits will occur between each
      section of the trial and will involve a skin assessment and quality of life questionnaires.
      Additionally, over the course of the trial, participants will be asked to fill out a survey
      and take a picture of their stoma with ostomy pouching change.
