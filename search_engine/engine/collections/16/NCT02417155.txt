      the two different breathing techniques in a group of healthy volunteers trained by Hof. Also,
      the investigators investigate whether it is necessary to be trained by Hof and if a
      relatively short instruction instead of the extensive training is sufficient. Additionally,
      the investigators want to evaluate the influence of the training and breathing techniques on
      pain thresholds.
