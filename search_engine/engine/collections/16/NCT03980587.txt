      refractory/resistant disease in order to establish if ctDNA is detectable and then analyse
      the molecular aberrations. Archival diagnostic tissue will be recalled (this is the tissue
      used to make the initial diagnosis of testicular cancer). Excess tissue acquired from
      clinically mandated prospective biopsies will be stored and plasma which has been collected
      at a maximum of 15 time-points per year will be analysed. Clinical data will be accessed to
      make clinically meaningful associations with plasma and tissue molecular aberrations.
