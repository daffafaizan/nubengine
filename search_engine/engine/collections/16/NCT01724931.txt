    
      This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose ranging study that will evaluate
      the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic properties (the absorption, distribution and
      excretion) of aminopterin following oral administration by subjects with active rheumatoid
      arthritis (≥ 6 tender and ≥ 6 swollen joints) who have not been treated with methotrexate
      (MTX). Subjects are randomized to one of three treatments: placebo, 1 mg of LD-aminopterin,
      or 3 mg of LD-aminopterin in a 1:1:1 ratio. The study hypothesis is that the 3 mg
      LD-aminopterin per week is effective at treating rheumatoid arthritis compared to placebo.
