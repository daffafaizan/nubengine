      brief intervals of acute pain can induce long-term neuronal remodeling and sensitization,
      chronic pain and lasting psychological distress. Chronic pain may be caused by intense acute
      PPP, intraoperative nerve injury and/or ongoing inflammation or mesh response with
      subsequence damage to nerve structures. The aim of our study is to analyze analgesic
      efficacy, safety and prevention of persistent postsurgical pain of two different
      pharmacological strategies.
