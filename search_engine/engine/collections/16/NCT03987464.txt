      Board, the researcher will evaluate the intervention using a complimentary mixed methods
      approach. The study will consist of a single-site platform trial examining the intervention
      group. There are many benefits to using a platform trial approach. First, using a platform
      trial allows the 18 participants to explore different arms of the intervention. Second, the
      platform design will allow us to also determine the effects of the interventions on patient
      help-seeking and adherence behavior in real-world care is critical to estimates of
      cost-effectiveness. As one of the specific aims of this study is to determine user feedback
      about modifying behaviors from various interventions, as opposed to determining which
      intervention is most effective, a platform trial will accomplish this.
