      biopsy for non-invasive genomic profiling of urothelial bladder cancers. Voided urine samples
      will be collected prior to cystoscopy. Cell free DNA and cellular DNA will both be extracted
      and analyzed. A blood sample will be taken. In patients with bladder wall findings suspicious
      of cancer, a bladder wall biopsy will be taken and submitted for histopathology examination,
      according to clinical standard practice. Next generation sequencing will be applied and
      hotspots mutations in DNA from urine, blood and tumor. Logistic regression was used to
      analyze the association between predictor variables and bladder cancer. The investigators
      will confirm a couple of common mutations occured in urine-DNA and blood-derived DNA
      simultaneously and verify the specificity and sensitivity of individual variance or mutation
      combinations to establish an predictive model with optimal robustness in diagnosis of bladder
      cancer. Moreover, external consistency test will be performed on subsequent patients
      collection.
