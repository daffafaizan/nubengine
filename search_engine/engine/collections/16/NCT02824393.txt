      Pathogenesis isn't exactly clear, treatment is relatively palliative and results are usually
      suboptimal. 30-40% of the patients have autoimmune origin. Patients are forced to use
      immunosuppressive treatments which have systemic effects. Some of the treatments have effects
      as severe as the disease itself.

      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are the most common used cells in clinical trials. These cells
      can provide efficient immunosuppression in severe conditions like immunosuppressive resistant
      Graft versus Host Disease. With this study at the first time and quite a different approach
      from conventional treatment, it will be tried an experimental treatment that used in the MSCs
      for the chronic autoimmune urticaria patients without of definitive treatment.
