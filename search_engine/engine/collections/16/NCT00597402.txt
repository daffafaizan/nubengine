      followed by 6 months of temozolomide. The majority of patients progress and die of their
      tumor. Many glioma patients are resistant to temozolomide because the tumors have high
      O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT), conferring resistance. Irinotecan is
      synergistic with temozolomide, and the combination may overcome high MGMT. Vascular
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is present on the cell surface and around malignant gliomas.
      It appears that the presence of vascular endothelial growth factor is a prognostic growth
      factor with more VEGF expression correlating with a poor prognosis. Monoclonal antibodies to
      VEGF have inhibited growth of malignant gliomas in a mouse xenograft. Avastin is a humanized
      monoclonal immunoglobulin G (IGG) 1 antibody that binds to and inhibits the biologic activity
      of human vascular endothelial growth factor. The combination of Avastin and irinotecan was
      safe and demonstrated high activity against recurrent malignant gliomas. The combination of
      Avastin, temozolomide, and irinotecan as the initial therapy may maximize the chance for
      long-term survival. There are other studies completed or ongoing for newly diagnosed
      glioblastoma (GBM) patients, including a Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) study that
      added irinotecan to temozolomide following standard radiation therapy and temozolomide, and a
      University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) study that added Avastin to standard radiation
      therapy and temozolomide followed by Avastin and temozolomide.
