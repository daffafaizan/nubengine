      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for entinostat in combination with
      lapatinib (lapatinib ditosylate) in patients whom trastuzumab has failed for human epidermal
      growth factor receptor 2+ (HER2+) metastatic breast cancer (Phase I).

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) for entinostat in combination with
      lapatinib and trastuzumab in patients whom trastuzumab has failed for HER2+ metastatic breast
      cancer (Phase I Trastuzumab Cohort).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the toxicity of combination therapy with entinostat and lapatinib in patients
      whom trastuzumab has failed for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (Phase I).

      II. To determine the toxicity of entinostat in combination with lapatinib and trastuzumab in
      patients whom trastuzumab has failed for HER2+ metastatic breast cancer (Phase I Trastuzumab
      Cohort).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine whether the 2-drug combination modulates the expression of HER2, phosphorylated
      HER2 (pHER), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), phosphorylated EGFR (pEGFR), v-akt
      murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (Akt), and phosphorylated Akt (pAkt) in breast tumors
      and/or circulating tumor cells (CTCs).

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of entinostat.

      Patients receive entinostat orally (PO) on days 1 and 15 and lapatinib tosylate PO on days
      1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Patients in the Phase I trastuzumab cohort also receive maintenance dose of
      trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes every 3 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days or until toxicities
      are resolved.
