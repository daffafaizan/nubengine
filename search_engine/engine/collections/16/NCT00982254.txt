      with type 2 diabetes. Patients received single doses of an oral insulin formulation and
      subcutaneous regular human insulin on separate visits.

      The primary objective of this study was to compare the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      properties of an oral insulin formulation with that of 15 U subcutaneous injected regular
      human insulin.

      Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters including bioavailability and bioefficacy were
      measured during 6-hour glucose clamp experiments.

      Study duration: 2 months
