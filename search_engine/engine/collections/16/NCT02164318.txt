      of arteriovenous fistula (AVF) maturation in end stage renal disease patients requiring
      vascular access for hemodialysis. To enhance NO bioavailability the study team will utilize a
      program of forearm exercise training, application of nitroglycerin ointment or both.

      Following entry into the study, approximately 4 weeks prior to surgery subjects will undergo
      a series of non-invasive tests of vascular function in the arm of fistula creation. Following
      this vascular function testing, subjects will follow the intervention treatment for 4 weeks.
      After 4 weeks of intervention treatment and prior to surgery, the vascular function analysis
      will be repeated to determine if the interventions had an effect on arm vascular function.
      Surgery to create the AVF will follow the second vascular function analysis. A discard sample
      of the vein used to create the AVF and a blood sample will be collected during surgery to
      assess potential biologic differences between intervention groups. The interventions will be
      continued until 4 weeks following surgery. Subjects will be followed to determine if the AVF
      matured and was successfully used for dialysis.
