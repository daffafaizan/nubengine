      limiting toxicity. If patients develop toxicities â‰¥ Grade 2 on 50 mg per day 4 weeks-on / 2
      weeks-off schedule, a modified schedule of 50 mg/day 2 weeks-on / 1 week-off will be offered.
      After disease progression on sunitinib, all eligible patients will receive axitinib 5 mg
      twice a day. The investigators plan to assess, by next generation sequencing, the prevalence
      of mutations in several cancer related genes in baseline archived tissue from the patients
      included in the study, and the potential correlations between these somatic mutations and
      anti-VEGF (Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor) therapy efficacy.
