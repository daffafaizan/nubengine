      intervention among overweight inner city children as compared to normal weight inner city
      children with asthma.

      Specific Aim #1: To determine if overweight inner-city children, compared to lean inner-city
      children, have greater improvement in asthma with an air purifier intervention aimed at
      reducing indoor PM.

      Hypothesis 1: An intervention using HEPA filter air purifiers in the homes of inner-city
      children with asthma will be associated with greater respiratory improvement in overweight
      children than in normal weight children.

      Specific Aim #2a: To investigate mediators of susceptibility among overweight versus normal
      weight children with asthma.

      Hypothesis #2. Candidate mediators, including increases in a) tidal volume and thereby
      increases in doses of inhaled particles, b) inflammatory and oxidative stress responses, c)
      corticosteroid resistance, and d) sleep disordered breathing mediate increased susceptibility
      to indoor PM among overweight versus normal weight children with asthma.

      Children with asthma will be enrolled in the study for about 16 weeks. They will have three
      clinic visits, an overnight sleep study, and two home environmental assessments for one week
      each. They will have a home and clinical assessment before randomization and another home and
      clinical assessment about 12 weeks after randomization. The primary outcome measure is
      maximum number of asthma symptom days.
