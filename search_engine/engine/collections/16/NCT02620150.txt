      disorders in HIV/AIDS, this study aims to determine whether: 1) SSRI treatment significantly
      increases innate immunity and decreases chronic inflammation and immune activation, and 2)
      changes in depressive symptoms correlate with changes in immunity in HIV/AIDS.

      HIV-seropositive, depressed subjects will be randomized to 10 weeks of double blind therapy
      with either escitalopram or placebo. All participants will concurrently begin CCBT
      (Computerized Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) using the program Good Days Ahead.

      Subject visits will occur weekly for the first 6 weeks and then at weeks 8 and 10. The
      treating clinician will assess side effects, review symptomatic progress, and adjust the
      study medication as clinically appropriate. An independent clinical evaluator will assess
      patients at baseline, and weeks 1-6, 8 and 10. Blood samples collected at baseline and weeks
      2, 4, and 10 will be used to assay markers of innate immune suppression (lytic units of NK
      cells, LUNK, and intracellular IFN gamma in NK cells) and markers of inflammation (IL-6 and
      C-Reactive Protein). At the end of the 10-week treatment phase, all participants will be
      referred for appropriate clinical treatment of their depression.
