      role in regulating the T-cell anti tumor response. Blocking this interaction with the anti
      PD-L1 monoclonal antibody avelumab is effective in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
      (NSCLC) resulting in durable disease control rates. Currently, PD-L1 expression as determined
      by immune histochemistry (IHC) is the best available biomarker for treatment response, but
      standardized scoring criteria are lacking and the risk for sampling errors exists. Molecular
      imaging using 89Zr-labeled antibodies may overcome these limitations, enabling the
      visualization of PD-L1 expression in primary and metastatic tumor lesions and providing
      information on the in vivo accessibility of the PD-L1 target following intravenous
      administration.

      This study enables PD-L1 PET-imaging with 89Zr-avelumab in patients with:

        -  early stage NSCLC (stage Ia (â‰¥T1b) -IIIa) followed by 2 cycles of neo-adjuvant avelumab
           treatment and surgical resection of the tumor.

        -  advanced stage NSCLC (Stage IIIb-IV) followed by avelumab treatment until disease
           progression or intolerable toxicity.
