    
      Adults with Learning Disability who have capacity will be recruited to participate in the
      Lycra splinting trial via their local physiotherapist. The eligibility criteria is an adult
      with Learning Disability who has had a fall and who has problems with their balance and/or
      gait as identified by their local physiotherapist.

      The participants will be recruited via participant information sheets. The participants will
      attend the Glasgow Caledonian University (GCU) gait laboratory to undertake three-dimensional
      movement analysis; Gaitrite test (the Gaitrite is a commercially available instrumented
      walkway); and Centre of Pressure testing.

      This will take place before prescription of a Lycra splinting garment and a minimum of 6
      weeks wear after receiving a Lycra splinting garment.

      Analysis of data captured before and after wearing the Lycra splinting garment will take
      place.

      The use-ability of the Lycra splinting garment will also be determined by completion of a
      user and carer questionnaire and by completion of a questionnaire by their local
      physiotherapist.

      The cost effectiveness of Lycra splinting garments will be analysed by a health statistician
      within GCU.
