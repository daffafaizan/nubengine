      combination of sofosbuvir 400 mg/velpatasvir 100 mg (SOF/VEL) orally once daily for 12 weeks
      with or without weight-based ribavirin. Before and after completion of the treatment course
      viral load assessments will be undertaken using low-cost laboratory monitoring for comparison
      to standard HCV viral load measurement. Up to 800 patients enrolled on treatment will be
      followed up at 4, 8, 12 and 24 weeks when Sustained Viral Load ( SVL) will be determined.
      Safety monitoring will be undertaken at applicable visits for those on Ribavirin and all
      adverse events will be reported based on Good Clinical Practice. In addition to assessing to
      assessing cost outcomes, the project will assess HCV treatment efficacy in terms of sustained
      virologic response at 12 weeks after end of HCV treatment (defined as undetected HCV RNA or
      less than lower limit of detection), compare the cost of low cost HCV viral assay platforms
      to standard of care, assess rates of ART initiation and virologic suppression of HIV-infected
      persons within the simplified HCV testing and treatment model and impact of HIV co-infection
      in participants on the HCV treatment outcome of sustained virologic response (SVR12). The
      project will be conducted 3 treatment sites in Yangon, Mandalay, and Kachin state in Myanmar.
