    
      This protocol is designed to develop relationships between parameters determined from imaging
      biomarker studies and ones used for determination of therapeutic response to combined CDK4
      Inhibitor and chemotherapy regimens. Imaging will occur prior to starting therapy on the
      separate therapeutic protocol UPCC 06115. Patients may undergo a second FLT PET/CT scan
      following a 3-day run of ribociclib (LEE011) (day -6 to -4) and a third FLT PET/CT scan on
      cycle 1 day 12 following two treatments of weekly Paclitaxel to compare changes in FLT uptake
      measures.
