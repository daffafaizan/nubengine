    
      This trial is a multi-centric prospective and diagnostic study, comparative, not randomised.
      The main objective is to evaluate the value of Multiparametric MRI (MpMRI) and targeted
      biopsy in detecting recurrence after focal treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). The secondary
      objectives (all energy and according to the energy used) are: to describe the specific
      changes in prostate morphology after focal therapy ( normal presentation and recurrence in
      the treated and in the non-treated zone, all energy and according to the energy used),to
      evaluate the accuracy of MpMRI in the detection of residual PCa, in the treated zone, in the
      whole gland, to evaluate the performance of targeted biopsy and non targeted biopsy for the
      detection of prostate cancer recurrence, to evaluate the combination of targeted biopsy and
      non targeted biopsy for the detection of prostate cancer recurrence, to assess the number and
      amount of unnecessary non targeted biopsies taken during the follow up of men in focal
      therapy, to describe the morbidity of prostate non-targeted and targeted biopsy (number and
      severity of biopsy complications) for the detection of prostate cancer recurrence, to
      evaluate the impact of recurrence detection on patient management (number and type of salvage
      treatment),to evaluate the post treatment PSA levels including density, PSA nadir, and its
      goal in detection recurrence, to examine failures in order to learn potential future
      predictors of failure (all energy and according to the energy used, the initial location of
      the target on MRI and it's Gleason grade).The first objective of ancillary study is a central
      MRI lecture with 3 experts which will allow, performance and inter-observer reproducibility,
      to evaluate the percentage of cases that will be scored with agreement for concordant biopsy
      decision by the central radiology team and the site radiologist, to determine on the
      pre-treatment MRI predictive criteria of success or failure for focal therapy according of
      the energy used and to propose recommendations for MRI interpretation after FT. The second
      objective of ancillary study is a central pathology reading to evaluate the percentage of
      cases that will be scored with agreement on the Gleason score by the central pathologists and
      the site pathologist and to propose recommendations for histology interpretation post focal
      therapy. The study population will consist of men with low and intermediate risk prostate
      cancer (ISUP 1 and 2) who has already chosen to undergo focal treatment, and be willing and
      able to undergo MpMRI with subsequent prostate biopsies, as indicated. Patients will be
      enrolled at baseline by an urologist in one of urology units listed as investigation center.
      The focal treatment should take place no later than 3 months after inclusion visit. The
      follow-up visits will be planned at 3 month,6 month,12 and 13 months after focal treatment,
      consistently with patient usual care. In this study, all patients will have a MpMRI and MpMRI
      targeted biopsy in the presence of a lesion suggestive of recurrence.The statistical analysis
      is to compare the positive biopsy rate between non targeted and targeted in subject as his
      own control (with a 12-month relapse rate of 30%) assuming 18.25% positive with the standard
      method (H0) and 26.25% with the targeted method (H1) and 15% of discordant pairs. By
      simulation with a MacNemar test, with a bilateral alpha risk of 5% and power of 90% we need
      260 subjects.
