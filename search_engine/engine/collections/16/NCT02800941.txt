      indication is strong, in the secondary chronic thrombo-embolism pulmonary hypertension
      (CTE-PHT) prevention, the frequent prescription (50 to 90% of patients) contrasts with their
      low level of proof in the PHT. Last but not least, anticoagulants are known to be the
      principal cause of iatrogenic hospitalization (bleeding).

      The only one study scaling the tolerance of anticoagulants for this population found major
      hemorrhagic levels discording with the clinical practice : really high for connectives
      associated to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAHT), and lower in "simple" pulmonary
      embolism in CTE-PHT. These discoveries could belong to methodological failures of this study:
      a retrospective, monocentric one, without adjudication of events by an independent committee.
      Furthermore, there were no information about the existence of a validated indication for
      anticoagulant treatments.

      Patients are all followed during one year, to determine the annual frequency of major
      bleedings (according to the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH)
      international definition). Each event notified is validated by an independent committee for
      clinical events.
