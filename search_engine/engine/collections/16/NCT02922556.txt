      a mobile-device-deployed cognitive emotional treatment for depression (Moodify) versus an
      active control treatment (commercially available computer games). Moodify is comprised of a
      novel continuous performance task (CPT) to improve cognitive slowing and lethargy often
      present in cases of major depressive disorder. This training method is based on an existing,
      validated cognitive training paradigm (tonic and phasic attention training, TAPAT1; WIRB
      Study No. 1126399). Moodify will also employ two additional cognitive training modules
      previously validated in this and other clinical populations.
