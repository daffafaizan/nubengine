      The first group receives daily nifedipine at a dose adjusted for high blood pressure.
      Cholestyramine or gemfibrozil is administered per National Cholesterol Education Program
      guidelines. Diuretics and doxazosin may be given concurrently.

      The second group receives daily lisinopril at a dose adjusted for high blood pressure.
      Cholestyramine or gemfibrozil is administered per National Cholesterol Education Program

      The third group receives daily nifedipine at a dose adjusted for high blood pressure, and
      simvastatin at a dose adjusted for high low-density lipoproteins. Supplemental cholestyramine
      may be given as needed. If cholestyramine is not tolerated or if triglycerides are high,
      gemfibrozil is substituted for cholestyramine.
