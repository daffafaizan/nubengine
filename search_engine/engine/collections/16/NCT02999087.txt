    
      This open-label, randomized, controlled, multicenter phase III study will include 688
      patients with LA SCCHN (420 fit for HD cisplatin and 268 unfit for HD cisplatin),
      histologically confirmed who had not received previous treatment for this setting. The study
      is designed with the primary objective of demonstrating that treatment with avelumab in
      combination with cetuximab-RT is superior to SOC Cisplatin-RT or cetuximab-RT alone in terms
      of PFS. Randomization will assign the 2 treatment arms of each cohort with a 1:1 ratio. In
      each cohort (fit for cisplatin and unfit for cisplatin), the randomization will be stratified
      for the 2 most established prognostic factors N stage (N0-N1 vs N2-3) and p16 expression (OPC
      p16+ versus OPC p16- or non OPC). All patients will be followed until death or at least 60
      months.
