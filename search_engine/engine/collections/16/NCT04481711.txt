      group (study group) and 22 patients (female/male:13/9) with <grade 4 osteoarthritis were
      included in the control group. Systemic venous blood samples of the patients were taken to
      evaluate the cytokine level (IL-6, TNF-Î±, IL-1). The Visual Analogue Scale was used to assess
      pain intensity, and the WOMAC (Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis
      Index) score was used to evaluate the functional status. Valgity and malaligment measurements
      were calculated using antero-posterior X ray Digital goniometer was used to evaluate the knee
      joint position sense (at 35, 55 and 70 degrees knee flexion angles). Measurements were taken
      once from patients in the control group, and twice in pre-op and post-op sixth weeks from
      study group.
