      and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The 3D models were used to design the model of
      personalized titanium plates. The model of the plates was transferred into a numerical
      control machine for manufacturing the personalized titanium plates by 3D printing technology.
      The plates were then surgically implanted for reconstruction assistance following
      microwave-induced hyperthermia to remove the bone tumor. Implementation parameters and knee
      function were then evaluated.
