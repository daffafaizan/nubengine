        -  Phase 1 "Patients selection (D0)": Patients will be assessed by the NCS-R during
           experimental stimulation (rest, tactile, noxious) and mobilizations (physiotherapy).
           Patients with potential pain will be included in the phase 2.

        -  Phase 2 "Analgesic administration (D1 and D2)": double-blind placebo-controlled
           randomized clinical trial on potential responders identified in phase 1. A medical
           doctor of our team will suggest to the physician in charge to prescribe the dedicated
           medication. One placebo and one real treatment will be administered on day 1 and 2 by
           the nurses at least half-hour before the physiotherapy. Randomization between day 1 and
           2 will be applied at that time.

      For each day of phase 1 and 2, several assessments will be performed: NCS-R, CRS-R and
      spasticity assessment.
