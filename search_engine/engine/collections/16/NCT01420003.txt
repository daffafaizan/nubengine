      found in serum. Membrane IgE (and M1prime) is expressed on IgE-switched B cells, IgE-memory B
      cels, and IgE-plasmablasts. Depletion of IgE-switched B cells and plasmablasts will reduce
      IgE-producing cells and serum IgE, and may be a target for treatment of allergic asthma. A
      humanized antibody targeting M1 prime is being developed by Genentech, Inc., as a potential
      therapeutic for asthma.

      Currently, the efficacy of MEMP1972A is being assessed in an allergen challenge study in mild
      asthmatics (MOP4843g). Extensive biomarker samples have been incorporated in that study to
      characterize the mechanism of action (MOA) as well as the kinetics of the MOA of MEMP1972A,
      which are poorly understood at this time. Furthermore, samples for the B cell enriched
      peripheral blood flow cytometry and bone marrow aspirates to evaluate the kinetics and MOA of
      MEMP1972a are collected only 24 hr after allergen challenge due to visit and sample volume
      limitations. It is known that maximal B cell responses are expected ~7 days after allergen
      stimulation. Therefore, the purpose of this research study will be to characterize the time
      course of B cell activation after allergen challenge, and more specifically measure the M1
      prime related biomarkers.
