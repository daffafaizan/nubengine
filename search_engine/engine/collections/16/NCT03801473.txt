      with robot assisted technology is used for rehabilitation. In several studies conventional
      rehabilitation was compared with robot assisted rehabilitation program, and they found no
      superior effects of robot assisted walking program. In this study we aimed to compare these
      modalities in terms of fatigue, anxiety and quality of life.
