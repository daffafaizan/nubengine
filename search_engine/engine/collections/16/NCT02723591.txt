      the adaptive design), prospective, randomized, multi-center, open-label trial examining
      long-term kidney transplant outcomes through the use of an adaptive design and a two-part,
      composite surrogate endpoint. Specifically, it was designed to compare the effects of twice
      daily, immediate-release tacrolimus and once daily Astagraf XL on DSA formation and the
      development of a peripheral blood molecular profile indicating the presence of IA in de novo
      kidney transplant recipients during the first year following transplantation. For the
      purposes of this study, IA was defined as a positive molecular signature using a molecular
      assay in all participants.

      Participants were screened prior to surgery and randomized 1:1 to receive immediate-release
      tacrolimus, administered twice daily, or Astagraf XL, as a component of a standard
      immunosuppression maintenance regimen also consisting of corticosteroids (if given per
      institutional protocol) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) (or MyforticÂ® equivalent).
      Investigators were encouraged to start participants on the randomized study treatment
      (immediate release tacrolimus or Astagraf XL) within 48 hours of transplantation
      (pre-transplant administration of study treatment was not allowed). However, if medically
      indicated per the treating physician's discretion, initiation of study treatment was delayed
      for up to seven days post-transplant.
