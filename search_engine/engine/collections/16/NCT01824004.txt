      recurrence rate makes gastric cancer a disease difficult to cure by surgery alone. Despite
      the benefit of CRT on local recurrence, the distant recurrence is the leading pattern of
      failure. We hypothesized that gastric cancer outcome could be improved using a more effective
      chemotherapy regimen. This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical outcomes and toxicity
      of adjuvant treatment including S-1/cisplatin chemotherapy followed by S-1 based CRT.
