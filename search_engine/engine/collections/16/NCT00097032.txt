      measures commonly believed to be affected by sedation and at doses typically used in clinical
      settings in stable bipolar I outpatients.One-half of patients are randomized to treatment
      sequence risperidone-quetiapine (R-Q), and the other one-half to quetiapine-risperidone
      (Q-R). Patients randomized to R-Q receive 2 mg of risperidone with dinner the night before
      testing and placebo with breakfast on the day of testing. After a 6 - 14 day washout period
      they receive 100 mg quetiapine with dinner the night before their second day of testing and
      100 mg with breakfast the day of testing.

      Those randomized to Q-R receive the same treatments, but in reverse order. Patients
      randomized to R-Q receive 2 mg of risperidone with dinner the night before testing and
      placebo with breakfast on the day of testing. After a 6-14 day washout period they receive
      100 mg quetiapine with dinner the night before their second day of testing and 100 mg with
      breakfast the day of testing. Those randomized to Q-R receive the same treatments, but in
      reverse order.
