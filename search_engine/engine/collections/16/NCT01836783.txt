      placental tissues recovered from live healthy donors. Amniotic tissue is an abundant source
      of collagen which provides an extracellular matrix to act as a natural scaffold for cellular
      attachment in the body; collagen provides a structural tissue matrix that facilitates
      cellular migration and proliferation in-vivo. The product is developed using proprietory
      techniques by BioDlogics, LLC. The amniotic allograft growth factors are thought to enhance
      formation of a supportive scaffold for regeneration, to facilitate interactions between cell
      types, and to influence anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial and immuno-privilege activities.

      Atraumatic extractions and socket grafts will be performed. Dental implants will be inserted
      into the grafted areas 8 weeks post-graft. The implants will be restored and followed for 24
      months post-insertion.
