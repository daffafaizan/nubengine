        -  Determine the efficacy of celecoxib, in terms of progression-free survival, in patients
           with progressive metastatic differentiated thyroid carcinoma.

        -  Correlate cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 protein expression in tumor biopsies by
           immunohistochemistry with clinical response in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral celecoxib twice daily beginning on day 1. Treatment continues
      for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who
      achieve a complete response (CR) receive 3 additional months of therapy beyond documentation
      of CR.

      Patients are followed at 4-8 weeks.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study within approximately
      6 months.
