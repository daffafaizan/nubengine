      inhalation therapy. The response to treatments is dose dependent thus applying the most
      efficient device to administer the treatment is integral. Evaluation of the efficacy of
      nebulisation devices in the treatment of COPD is limited. Technological development in recent
      years has led to new devices that optimize lung deposition and reduce the time needed for
      treatment.

      The aim of this study is to compare the vibrating mesh and jet nebuliser methods of
      delivering bronchodilator medication to patients hospitalised with an acute exacerbation of
      COPD, with respect to lung function and efficacy in spontaneously breathing patients.

      Patients admitted to hospital with an exacerbation of COPD and prescribed regular nebulised
      bronchodilators (combined salbutamol 2.5mg and ipratropium 0.5mg) will be recruited to the
      study. On one occasion between day 3-7 of admission they will perform pulmonary function
      testing namely measurement of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second(FEV1), Forced Vital
      Capacity (FVC), Inspiratory Capacity (IC) and cough peak flow. They will also complete the
      Borg breathlessness score. Measurements will be recorded at baseline (pre-bronchodilator
      administration) and one hour post-nebulised bronchodilator.

      Patients will be randomised to receive their nebulised bronchodilators via the standard
      hospital jet nebuliser or via a vibrating mesh nebuliser(Aerogen Solo).

      Change in lung function and symptom measures between baseline and one-hour post nebulisation
      will be analysed to look for any significant difference between the two groups
