      of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and PET data. Whereas functional MRI (fMRI) provides
      excellent spatio-temporal resolution for localizing changes in brain activity, PET offers
      high sensitivity and neurochemical specificity. Together, PET and MRI measures have the
      potential to help clarify the neurochemical basis of changes in fMRI signal induced by
      selective exogenous ligands or endogenous neurotransmitter.

      In the present study we will target the 5-HT1B receptor for which a selective radioligand
      exist (11C-AZ10419369). The receptor can be stimulated with the agonist sumatriptan, which is
      used for alleviating migraine attacks. The mechanism of action of sumatriptan is not
      precisely known and it is unknown to what degree sumatriptan crosses the blood-brain barrier
      and exerts its effect in the parenchyma. In this study we can determine the blood brain
      barrier penetration of sumatriptan and thereby evaluate Effect sizes, distribution of signal
      changes, and correlation between the occupancy at the 5-HT1B receptor in the parenchyma
      (measured by changes in BPND) and the hemodynamic response (measured by changes in CBF).

      Ahead of the main study a pilot study will be conducted in which increasing doses of
      sumatriptan will be tested in the same subject to obtain a dose-response curve. At the same
      time side effects will be observed and scored. This serves to find the dose with maximum
      effect size but minimal side effects, which can then be used in the main study for all
      subjects.
