    
      This is a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study to assess short and long-term
      clinical outcomes and immune responses after Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2) infection and/or Multisystem Inflammatory Syndrome in Children (MIS-C) in
      children (e.g., defined as individuals who have not reached their 21st birthday at the time
      of enrollment). SARS-CoV-2 causes Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)

      Participants will be identified through active recruitment measures within hospitals and
      through ambulatory and laboratory-based databases of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals <21
      years of age. The study will enroll a minimum of 250 subjects from a diverse racial/ethnic
      background, from participating medical centers in the United States. The study period of
      participation is 1 year (12 months).
