    
      MEK112110 is a dose-escalation, open-label study to determine the recommended dose and
      regimen for the orally administered MEK inhibitor GSK1120212 dosed in combination with
      everolimus in subjects with solid tumors. This will be accomplished using a dose-escalation
      procedure starting at low doses of GSK1120212 and everolimus. Dose escalation will continue
      based on predefined parameters until the maximum tolerated dose is identified. The
      recommended doses and regimens will be selected based on the safety and pharmacokinetic
      profiles. The clinical activity of GSK1120212 dosed in combination with everolimus will be
      explored further in an expansion cohort consisting of 20 subjects with metastatic pancreatic
      cancer. In addition a substudy will be conducted in 40 subjects with KRAS-mutant non-small
      cell lung cancer.
