      calcium deposit in calcific tendinitis of the shoulder. Persisting pain in cacific tendinitis
      is considered to be a consequence of increased tendon volume or changed tendon texture in the
      area of the calcification which leads to secondary impingement and inflammation.
      Consequently, removal of the deposit should be a causal treatment measure.

      Scientific evidence for the efficacy of the barbotage procedure in patients with persistent
      symptoms from calcific tendinitis is still limited. The cyclic often self-limiting course of
      the disease, and an anticipated placebo effect, questions about the method's efficacy can
      only be answered by high-quality randomized studies. In this trial the investigators want to
      randomize a cohort of patients to (1) Ultrasound guided needling, lavage and subacromial
      steroid injection, (2) Ultrasound guided subacromial steroid injection or (3) Ultrasound
      guided lidocain injection (sham). The investigators want to follow the patients over two
      years with repeated testing with a set of validated outcome measures together with radiologic
      re-examinations. The investigators want to find out whether the active treatments (1, 2) are
      more effective than the sham treatment and whether there are differences in outcome between
      the two active treatments. To increase the generalizability of the investigators' results,
      the investigators want to perform the study as a multi-centre study.
