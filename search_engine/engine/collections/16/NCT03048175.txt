      little is known about the systemic aspect of subjects with impacted or semi-impacted third
      molars and the possible effects of surgical removal on their systemic parameters. A
      case-control study of 40 subjects has been designed to evaluate i) the overall systemic
      inflammation and metabolism of subjects with bilateral third molars compared to subjects with
      no third molars and ii) the effect of bilateral removal in the immediate and medium
      postsurgical period. Systemic parameters are evaluated via high sensitive c reactive protein
      (CRP), lipids, fibrinogen, oxidative stress and endothelial function analysis.
