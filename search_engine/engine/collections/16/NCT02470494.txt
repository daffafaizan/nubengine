      endpoints or sample sizes are computed. Information gathered about device utility and clinic
      procedures from the physician, audiologist as well as subject questionnaires will be analyzed
      for the purpose of optimizing the process flow in different types of practice settings. A
      subset of relevant safety and efficacy measures from the Definitive Study (DEN150002) will be
      collected and adverse events will be tracked and reported per applicable regulations.
