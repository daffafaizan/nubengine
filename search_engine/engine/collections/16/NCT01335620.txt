      study.

      Twenty HIV-1 infected subjects will be recruited. Eligible subjects will currently be
      receiving stable antiretroviral therapy with undetectable plasma HIV RNA and have no evidence
      of previous HIV- resistance mutations on genotypic resistance testing.

      At baseline, subjects will switch antiretroviral therapy to:

        -  tenofovir/emtricitabine 245/200 mg daily (Truvadaâ„¢) plus

        -  raltegravir 400 mg twice daily On day 28, all subjects will attend for an intensive 24
           hour pharmacokinetic visit.

      Follow up over 6 months, subjects will attend on days 14, 90 and 180 for follow up visits
      that will include standard safety parameters. Assessment of cardiac biomarkers at baseline
      and on days 90 and 180 and assessment of neurocognitive function at screening, baseline and
      on day 180 will also be undertaken.

      Following completion of this study, subjects will recommence their usual antiretroviral
      treatment regimen and attend for a study follow up visit.
