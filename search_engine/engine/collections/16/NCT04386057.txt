    
      -  This is an open label, randomized, two arm, phase II with safety lead- in study
           exploring the anti-tumor activity of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)
           inhibitor LY3214996 with and without hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in patients with advanced
           pancreatic cancer.

        -  The research study procedures include screening for eligibility and study treatment
           including evaluations and follow up visits.

             -  The safety lead-in will test the safety of a combination of investigational drugs
                and also try to define appropriate dosage. The names of the study drugs involved in
                this study are:

                  -  LY3214996

                  -  Hydroxychloroquine Sulfate (HCQ)

             -  Following completion of a brief combination treatment safety lead-in cohort,
                participants will be randomized 1:1 for enrollment to one of two treatment arms:

                  -  Arm 1: receiving combination treatment with LY3214996 and HCQ

                  -  Arm 2: receiving monotherapy treatment with LY3214996

      It is expected that about 52 people will take part in this research study

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved LY3214996 as a treatment for any
      disease.

      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved HCQ for your specific disease
      but it has been approved for other uses.
