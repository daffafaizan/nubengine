    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, phase 2 study to assess the safety, reactogenicity,
      immunogenicity, and efficacy of HB-101 in adult patients awaiting kidney transplantation. For
      Groups 1 and 2, adult CMV-seronegative (-) patients awaiting kidney transplant from a
      CMV-seropositive (+) living donor will be enrolled according to treatment intent with regard
      to the method of CMV prevention after transplant (either preemptive or prophylactic). This
      will be defined at study enrollment by the investigator and institutional standards. Patients
      enrolled in Group 1 and 2 will be randomized to receive HB-101 or placebo. For Group 3, adult
      CMV-seropositive (+) patients awaiting kidney transplant from either CMV-seropositive(+) or
      CMV-seronegative(-) living donors will be enrolled. Group 3 will be open label where all
      patients will receive HB-101. The post transplant management for Group 3 patients will also
      follow either preemptive or prophylactic method per the institution standards. The intent of
      the study is to administer three doses of the study drug (HB-101 or placebo) prior to
      transplantation and within proximity to the time of transplantation. However, two doses of
      study drug will be sufficient for the patients to be included in the efficacy analyses if a
      third dose of study drug is not feasible due to transplantation timelines. Patients will not
      receive study drug after transplantation. Patients will be recruited globally from transplant
      centers. The total duration of the study of each patient participating in the study will be
      approximately 15 months.
