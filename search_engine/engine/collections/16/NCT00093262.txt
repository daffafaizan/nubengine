      postoperative hypertension by comparing the incidence of bailout in the clevidipine and
      placebo treatment groups during the 30-minute time period from initiation of study drug.
      Secondary objectives included assessments of efficacy through measuring time to target blood
      pressure (BP) lowering effect defined as 15% reduction in SBP, change in mean arterial
      pressure (MAP) and the incidence of bailout by causality. Assessments for safety included
      change in heart rate (HR) from baseline.
