      and adults that have a confirmed diagnosis of concussion per protocol guidelines in order to
      improve a concussion detection algorithm previously developed by Jan Medical, Inc. In order
      to gather sufficient variability, subjects with both confirmed concussion and suspected
      concussion will be included in the study as long as they meet eligibility criteria.
      BrainPulse recordings from subjects with suspected concussion will be compared to the
      recordings of subjects diagnosed with concussion. Subjects will be followed for 21 days after
      the initial injury with BrainPulse recordings to study the subject's recovery process. The
      symptomatic evaluation, physical examination, and BrainPulse recordings will be entered in a
      database to assess clinical outcome and device utilization.
