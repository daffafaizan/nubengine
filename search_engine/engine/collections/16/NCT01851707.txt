    
      This Phase 2 study is designed to examine the efficacy and safety of multiple dose levels of
      IPI-145 in subjects with active moderate-to-severe Rheumatoid Arthritis receiving a
      background stable dose of methotrexate. The study will employ a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, parallel design.

      Approximately 316 adult subjects who meet all eligibility criteria at Screening will be
      randomized at Baseline in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to one of 4 dose groups.

      All treatments will be administered twice a day (BID). After randomization, subjects will
      enter a 12-week Treatment Period, where study drug (IPI-145 or placebo) will be
      self-administered BID as an outpatient. During the Treatment Period, subjects will return to
      the clinic for efficacy and safety assessments every 2 weeks. Following Treatment Period
      completion at Week 12, subjects will enter a 3-week Follow-up Period which includes one
      clinic visit approximately 3 weeks after the last dose of study drug.
