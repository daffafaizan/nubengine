      transvaginal mesh kit. Secondly the investigators want to evaluate the effect of this
      surgical method on non-affected anterior vaginal compartment as well as patients' outcome.

      This prospective multicenter national study include patients (n=111) with symptomatic
      posterior vaginal wall with or without apical prolapse with stage II or more. Patients were
      recruited at four university hospitals and five central hospitals in Finland between
      September 2010 and August 2013. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees in
      participating hospitals and all attending patients gave written consent after oral and
      written counseling. Baseline evaluation include standardized gynecological examination in
      supine position using the POP-Q system. Detailed information on patients' characteristics and
      medical history is gathered, focusing on especially gynecological issues. Patients fill in
      Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) and Pelvic organ prolapse/urinary Incontinence
      Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12).

      The operations are performed by qualified surgeons (n=9) familiar with transvaginal mesh
      surgery. Intraoperative data is collected and immediate postoperative problems are
      registered.

      The first follow-up visit take place at three months postoperatively. Gynecological
      examination with POP-Q measurements are performed and complications documented. As
      preoperatively, PFDI-20 and PISQ-12 questionnaires are filled in by the patients.

      The second visit take place at one year postoperatively. Gynecological examination with POP-Q
      measurements are performed and possible late complications documented. PFDI-20 and PISQ-12
      questionnaires are filled in again by the patients.
