      neuroanatomical, neurodevelopmental, behavioral, and social/family/home outcomes of infants
      who were exposed to opioids in utero. Match control infants will be recruited into the study
      and based on birth hospital and birth month of the exposed infants. The study will quantify
      the effects of antenatal opioid exposure on the trajectory of brain development over the
      first 2 years of life, examine associations with developmental and neurobehavioral outcomes,
      and explore how specific factors (differing antenatal and postnatal exposures, severity of
      neonatal opioid withdrawal, maternal stress/depression/parenting) modify these effects. The
      investigators hypothesize that neural connectivity and neuroanatomical volumes are altered by
      antenatal opioid exposure and that the magnitude of these alterations correlates with
      developmental and behavioral outcomes. Further, maternal and environmental factors interact
      with antenatal opioid exposure to influence the trajectories of connectivity, development,
      and behavior over the first 2 years of life.
