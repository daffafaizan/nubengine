      artery tonometry (RH-PAT) to check endothelial dysfunction. Endothelial dysfunction is
      thought to be an indication of future heart disease or metabolic disorders. Adiponectin is a
      hormone associated with heart disease. Apolipoprotein levels, are established risk factors
      for coronary artery disease in the general population. Our group would like to see if there
      is a link between endothelial function, adiponectin, apolipoprotein levels and posttransplant
      heart disease complications. The study would be taking these results to find new clinical
      procedures for patients that are at potentially higher risk of heart problems during and
      after their liver transplant procedure.
