      advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC). However, Asian patients in real world experienced grade
      III/IV adverse events much more than expected. This multi-national, phase II, single arm
      study is going to explore more on the safety/efficacy and relevant biomarkers on sunitinib
      2/1 dose schedule in Asian people with advanced RCC.
