      colleagues applied bimatoprost to the base of the fingernails demonstrating a 16.9% increase
      in fingernail growth from baseline, and a 10.4% increase from baseline on untreated nail
      beds. Other than these two reports, there are no studies addressing this topic to our
      knowledge based on a Medline search for off-label use of this drug. Other relevant studies
      have addressed increased hair and eyelash growth with the prostaglandin agents. Researching
      the biochemistry of the relationship of prostaglandins to hair and nail growth, the final
      common pathway appears to be with protein kinase C and the production of tropocollagens. The
      dermatology literature has demonstrated that both hair and nail keratocytes reside in the
      nail bed suggesting that increased collagen production may enhance the growth of both the
      nail bed and nail plate, possibly reducing nail brittleness.
