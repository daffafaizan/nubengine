      needle pleural biopsy, thoracoscopy, or cutting-needle pleural biopsy under the guidance of
      computerized tomography or ultrasonography for histopathological analysis. This study aims to
      compare the diagnostic efficiency and reliability of Abrams' needle pleural biopsy under
      computerized tomography guidance with that of cutting-needle pleural biopsy under
      ultrasonography guidance in patients with pleural effusion.

      Methods. Patients with exudative pleural effusion, who could not be diagnosed by cytological
      analysis, will be included in the study. All patients were randomized following the thoracic
      computerized tomography with contrast enhancement. Patients either underwent Abrams' needle
      pleural biopsy under computerized tomography guidance or the cutting-needle pleural biopsy
      under ultrasonography. The two groups will be compared in terms of diagnostic efficiency and
      in terms of complications associated with the methods used.
