      of anatomic factors (i.e. BMI, neck circumference, retrognathia) and neurological drive
      (sleep stage, arousal). The interaction of baseline anatomic factors and drug-induced altered
      neurologic drive may also convey a risk for upper airway collapse (UAC) in patients receiving
      analgesics, or sedation/anesthesia.1;2 While there is mainly only anecdotal evidence to
      support the proposition that SDB is a strong predictor of sedation-related adverse events,3;4
      there is such a remarkable consensus of opinion regarding this association that, for example,
      the American Society of Anesthesiologists is developing guidelines to specifically address
      the issue of managing this group of "at risk" patients who are to undergo sedation or
      anesthesia. SDB is a term that is used to describe a spectrum of sleep-related breathing
      disturbances. Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a condition that incorporates SDB with daytime
      symptoms (i.e. hypersomnolence). These terms are commonly used interchangeably.

      At this juncture, what is needed are clear demonstrations: 1) that SDB confers risk for
      sedation-related adverse events (epidemiologically and/or experimentally), 2) of the patient
      and drug factors that moderate/mediate the risk, and 3) of the mechanisms responsible for the
      patient by drug interactions.

      This proposed project will, in a preliminary way, address the first and second of these
      issues. Specifically, the upper airway characteristics of patients with different severity
      classifications of SDB will be assessed while under the influence of two,
      neuropharmacologically distinct, intravenous sedatives.
