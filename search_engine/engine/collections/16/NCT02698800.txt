      patients using a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study, with the aim of developing a
      novel non-pharmacological approach for the treatment of insomnia. 15 individuals with
      insomnia will wear either BB or placebo (clear) lenses for 2 hours preceding bedtime while at
      home, for 1 week in a cross-over design. Sleep quality will be documented while at home, at
      also melatonin secretion while in the laboratory. It is predicted that compared to placebo,
      wearing BB lenses for 2 hours preceding bedtime will attenuate bright light associated
      melatonin suppression and improve sleep.
