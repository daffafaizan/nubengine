      chemotherapy (physician's choice) in subjects with low-grade ovarian cancer.

      Patients will receive Pembrolizumab 200mg q3w until progression or unacceptable toxicity, for
      a maximum of 35 cycles PLUS one of the following standard chemotherapies for LGSOC
      (investigators' choice):

      Carboplatin AUC 4 + Gemcitabine 1000mg/m² (q3w for 3-6 cycles) or Carboplatin AUC 5 +
      pegylated liposomal Doxorubicin 30mg/m² (q4w for 3-6 cycles) or Carboplatin AUC 5 monotherapy
      (q3w for 3-6 cycles). As primary objective 6-month progression free survival (PFS) rate will
      be analysed. About 2 sites in Germany will participate in this study to recruit 29 patients
      in 24 months.
