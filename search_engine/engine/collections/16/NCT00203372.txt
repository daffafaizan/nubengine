      the treatment of stage II or stage III primary breast cancer. Safety of the TAC-bevacizumab
      combination will be evaluated. In addition, the study design incorporates an initial cycle of
      bevacizumab or placebo alone. Assessing the isolated effects of bevacizumab in a setting
      where pre- and post-treatment tissue specimens can be obtained will provide essential
      information about the mechanisms by which VEGF inhibition affects tumor growth, and
      represents an ideal opportunity to evaluate the molecular effects of bevacizumab on breast
      tumor tissue.
