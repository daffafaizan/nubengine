    
      Objective: To establish the influence of deep neuromuscular blockade (NMB) on the abdominal
      working space during laparoscopy.

      Study design: A single center prospective cohort study

      Study population: 10 adult patients (18 years or older), equally distributed by gender,
      scheduled for laparoscopic donor nephrectomy

      Study procedures:

      Induction of general anesthesia followed by intubation and creation of a pneumoperitoneum (12
      mmHg).

      Each patient will have a MRI scan during 3 stages:

      Phase 1: No neuromuscular blockade (TOF ratio 1) Phase 2: moderate neuromuscular blockade(TOF
      1-3). Phase 3: deep neuromuscular blockade (PTC 0-1)

      Primary outcome:

      The abdominal space measured by MRI: Skin - sacral promontory distance

      Secondary outcome:

      3D volume measurement of the abdominal cavity by MRI.
