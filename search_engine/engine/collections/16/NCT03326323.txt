    
      Acute Normovolemic Hemodilution (ANH) involves the removal of the patients own blood
      immediately at the induction of anesthesia and replacement of this blood intraoperatively
      with an equivalent volume of crystalloid or colloid solution in order to dissuade the loss of
      red blood cell mass, the mechanism of action is dilution of the blood, hematocrit reduction,
      and reduction of the anticoagulant components of the blood associated with bleeding during
      cardiopulmonary bypass graft surgery. The collected blood is isolated from the negative
      effects of the cardiopulmonary bypass machine.. The collected blood is then stored in
      anticoagulant treated blood bags in the cardiovascular operating room and re-infused into the
      patient in reverse order of collection at the commencement of surgery, leaving the most cell
      rich blood to be re-infused into the patient last. This study will evaluate the effect in
      patients with and without ANH utilization on; hemostatic markers, chest tube drainage 24
      hours post CABG, and need for allergenic blood transfusion. Positive effects on the
      hemostatic markers of anticoagulation and platelets, reduced chest tube drainage at 24 hours
      post CABG, and reduced number of transfused red blood cells will indicate a positive
      correlation with ANH utilization during isolated on pump CABG surgery.

      The benefits of ANH utilization in blood conservation will benefit patients by reducing their
      exposure to allogenic blood transfusion with its myriad side effects.
