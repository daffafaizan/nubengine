      In stage I of the trial, 21 patients will be treated with intralesional bevacizumab. Keloids
      that fail to respond to 4 injections will not be treated any longer with bevacizumab and all
      such patients will be removed from the trial.

      If 5 or more patients show some degree of objective response to treatment in at least one
      treated keloid, the trial will continue to enroll another 45 patients to a total of 66
      patients, otherwise, the trial will stop in its entirety.
