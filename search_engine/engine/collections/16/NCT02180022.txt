      obesity, not only in adults but also in children and adolescents, thus increasing the risk of
      early development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Quercetin, found abundantly in onion,
      prevents the induction of endothelial dysfunction, superoxide production, and overexpression
      by angiotensin II in the rat aorta. Furthermore, in our previous study we showed that
      supplementation with quercetin-rich onion peel extract (OPE) influenced adipokine expression,
      thus addressing its modulatory effect on obesity-induced inflammation, and improved insulin
      resistance by alleviating the metabolic dysregulation of free fatty acids, suppressing
      oxidative stress, upregulating glucose uptake, and downregulating inflammatory gene
      expression. But there are limited studies on the relationship between quercetin
      supplementation and endothelial dysfunction in humans.
