      (MM). The investigatorswill recruit 50 MM specimens of patients diagnosed with either
      unilateral or bilateral ptosis who were referred to undergo a posterior approach surgical
      correction (MMCR). In this surgical approach, the proximal part of MM is removed between the
      levator palpebrae superioris muscle and the tarsus of the upper eyelids. The excised tissue
      is generally not used but simply discarded. For study purposed, the investigators will obtain
      the patients' consent to save these tissues and carry out histologic examinations of the
      samples. No change in the surgical procedure or the following management will be needed.
