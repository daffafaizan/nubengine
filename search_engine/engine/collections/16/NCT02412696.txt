    
      Patients will be recruited from multiple community and hospital-based practices that care for
      pregnant women. Subjects will be given a physical exam, have measurements taken, answer
      questionnaires and then will be screened using a home sleep apnea test (HSAT) Type III
      device. Those diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea will then be randomized to one of two
      groups (below).

      Both groups will have:

        1. blood testing for placenta-secreted circulating markers

        2. placental histopathological and immunohistochemistry examination of placental expression
           of markers.

      Both groups will answer sleep and mood questionnaires, have blood pressure, blood glucose and
      activity / sleep watch monitoring and will receive an educational session on pregnancy
      health.

      Randomization groups include:

        1. Nasal dilator strips: Participants receiving nasal dilator strips will be monitored by
           need for refill of supplies and periodic phone calls.

        2. CPAP + nasal dilator strips: Subjects randomized to positive airway pressure (PAP)
           therapy will receive auto-titrating PAP. Pressure requirements will be monitored
           remotely and pressure modified as needed. PAP adherence will be determined subjectively
           and objectively. This group will also receive nasal dilator strips as described above.

      All subjects will receive small gift incentives such as baby-related items. Monetary
      incentives will also be issued at data collection points.
