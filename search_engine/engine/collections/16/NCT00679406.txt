      duty personnel. Chronic insomnia often persists post-deployment, contributes to poor mental
      and physical health outcomes, and requires targeted interventions. Effective behavioral
      treatments of insomnia have not been adapted and tested for the treatment of chronic insomnia
      comorbid to combat-related mental disorders and stress reactions. In addition, effective
      behavioral insomnia treatments are typically delivered over an 8-week period. This format may
      not be easily exportable to primary and community care settings where military returnees and
      veterans seek help. The goal of this R34 Exploratory Clinical Research Grant is to adapt and
      test the effects of a 4-week behavioral treatment that targets chronic insomnia (lasting >1
      month) in service members returning from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF) and Operation Enduring
      Freedom (OEF), and who present with the typical psychiatric comorbidities associated of
      combat-related anxiety and mood disorders and stress reactions. We call this intervention the
      Brief Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia for Military Veterans (BBTI-MV). The proposed study
      includes two phases. Phase I aims at iteratively adapting and refining a treatment manual for
      insomnia in OIF/OEF military returnees. Outcomes of interest include self-report, diary, and
      actigraphic sleep measures, as well as measures of PTSD, anxiety, and depression, and
      perceived physical health.
