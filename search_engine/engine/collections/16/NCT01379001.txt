      manipulation and arterial spin-labeled perfusion MRI (pharmacologic ASL-pMRI) as an in vivo
      probe of cholinergic function. Methods to investigate cholinergic function in vivo are needed
      to better understand the role of acetylcholine in the physiology of the cerebral cortex, and
      in cognitive processes in health and in disease states. In this study, pharmacologic ASL-pMRI
      will be used to characterize the normal cerebral perfusion response to cholinergic
      manipulation in young healthy subjects. Cognitive measures will also be obtained and
      correlated with cerebral perfusion changes. Pharmacologic ASL-pMRI and cognitive testing will
      then be used to study how the cholinergic response is altered with normal aging and in
      delirium
