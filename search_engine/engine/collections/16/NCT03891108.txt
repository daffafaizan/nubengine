      or D; followed by review of safety and tolerability data during and after the infusion. The
      study will proceed with treatments A, and C unless one or more of these treatments shows poor
      tolerability; in which case the study may proceed with treatment B or D in the follow-up
      cohorts. Additional participants will be randomized equally to each of the treatments the
      study will proceed with.
