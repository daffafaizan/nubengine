    
      The purpose of this retrospective data collection on re-ablations performed in both treatment
      arms (Cryo arm and Radiofrequency arm) of the FIRE AND ICE Trial is to gain insight into
      re-occurrence of atrial arrhythmias resulting in a re-ablation after a performed index
      ablation procedure. Data to be collected from subject charts include pulmonary vein anatomy,
      documented atrial arrhythmias prior to re-ablation, pulmonary vein reconnection, pulmonary
      vein ablation lesion gaps and gap location, ablation lesions performed during the
      re-ablation, procedure parameters of the RF or cryo catheter utilized during the re-ablation,
      and success of re-ablations performed.
