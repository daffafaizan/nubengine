      have a more aggressive disease course. GBA may therefore provide a target for disease
      modifying therapies in mutation carriers. Using positron emission tomography (PET) and
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain imaging to measure network progression rates in
      mutation carriers will allow for the assessment of the potential disease modifying effects of
      new anti-GBA therapies.

      The investigators will also determine whether magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) network
      methods, which are less invasive and more broadly available than positron emission tomography
      (PET), produce comparable network progression measurements in individual patients. These
      determinations will be critical for the design of clinical trials of new disease-modifying
      drugs.
