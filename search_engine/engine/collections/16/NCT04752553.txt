      pandemics for both doctors and patients, low cost and easily accessibility. Pandemics
      especially COVID 19 has radically change the medical team thoughts about the telemedicine. It
      can decrease the exposure of the medical team to infection and expected by some of the
      medical team to be very beneficial if done in good and legal manner. Although, telemedicine
      has many advantages, also has many disadvantages and medicolegal problems, breakdown in the
      relationship between medical teams and patients, mis diagnosis or wrong treatment. There are
      many legal and ethical aspects of telemedicine. These include the medical responsibilities,
      the confidentiality and privacy of the patients can not be maintained, the jurisdictional
      problems. Shortage of medical practitioners and specialists, shortage of internet facilities,
      low education levels in some patients all are problems facing the telemedicine in developing
      countries. The evolution of telemedicine poses a series of legal problems ranging from the
      profiles on the subject of authorization and accreditation to those concerning the protection
      of patient confidentiality, the definition and solution of which, in the absence of specific
      regulatory provisions, is mainly left to the assessment of compatibility of the practices
      adopted so far, with the general regulatory framework.

      This research will be done to clarify the role of telemedicine, and if it has a share hand or
      the upper hand if compared with traditional medicine.
