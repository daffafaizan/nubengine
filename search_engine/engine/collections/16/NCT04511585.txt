      active enough to meet the physical activity (PA) international guidelines in France, Europe
      and in the US. Therefore, there is a need to find efficient programs to improve PA habits in
      children from early age. The Great Live and Move Challenge (GLMC) study is a 2-year
      cluster-randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate a multilevel and theory-based
      intervention to promote PA practice in children aged 7-11 years from French primary schools.
      The aim of this paper is to describe the GLMC study protocol. The primary hypothesis is that
      the GLMC intervention will increase by 15% the proportion of children meeting the World
      Health Organization recommendations of 60 minutes/day of moderate to vigorous PA. Study
      recruitment goal is 5000 children . The GLMC is implemented on children and their parents and
      involves multiple local grass-roots partners, such as school teachers and municipal
      officials, as well as policy stakeholders. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) constitutes
      the foundations of the intervention conception. The total duration of the intervention is 3.5
      months each year, for two years. Children and parents are evaluated at pre- and
      post-intervention every year regarding PA practice (self-reported and objectively measured in
      a subsample of 400 children), TPB variables (i.e., intentions, attitudes, subjective norms,
      perceived behavioral control) and other psychosocial variables (e.g., perceptions of active
      opportunities). This study will evaluate the effectiveness of a multilevel and theory-based
      primary school PA program and potentially provide valuable information for schools and public
      health policers looking for innovative PA programs.
