      Epidemiology, NCI has a strong interest in fostering cervical cancer prevention solutions for
      all kinds of settings, including lowresource ones that rely on development of robust,
      low-cost screening and triage tools. Therefore, to support development of algorithms for
      cervical image recognition software, NCI seeks to share digital cervical images and
      accompanying clinical data from our large epidemiological studies on HPV and cervical cancer

      screening with interested and qualified image analysis researchers. To accommodate the many
      researchers that are interested, we have created this standard protocol to describe a unified
      process for sharing deidentified cervical images and accompanying de-identified clinical data
      from the following NCI studies: Costa Rican Natural History Study of HPV and Cervical
      Neoplasia , ASCUS LSIL Triage Study-- ALTS , SUCCEED and Costa Rica Vaccine Trial .
