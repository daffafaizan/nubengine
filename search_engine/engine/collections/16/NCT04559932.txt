      whether the tracheostomy module is associated with improved knowledge and skills for CHPs
      (community health providers). This investigators proposed study is guided by the evaluation
      of knowledge acquisition and self-efficacy as a theoretical framework 24. CHPs' sense of
      self-efficacy or perceived capability in caring for this population is important to foster to
      potentially mitigate significant morbidity and mortality, while ultimately striving for safe,
      high-quality clinical care for these medically complex children.
