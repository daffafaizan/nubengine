      neonatal seizures. Prior to using an investigational intravenous topiramate formulation in
      children and neonates, the pharmacokinetics and safety of the formulation must be
      demonstrated in adults. The immediate aims of this study are to determine the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of a novel intravenous topiramate formulation. An additional aim
      is to determine if sex, advancing age, or genotype affects topiramate absorption,
      distribution, or elimination.
