      study extension. After 3 weeks of outpatient use of study pump (1 week) and study pump+CGM
      (2weeks) as run-in period, patient and parents will be admitted for 4-hour training to
      closed-loop (AP) mode. Following randomization (1:1), patient will be allocated to '24-hour'
      use of AP or 'dinner and overnight AP mode/day time pump and CGM use' for the next 18-week
      period. A hotline phone number will be given to the patient and parents so that they can
      contact the study staff as needed. A logbook will be provided to collect details about
      hypoglycemic and hyperglycemic episodes, physical activity and noticeable events. Phone calls
      will be scheduled between investigator and patient+parents 48 hours, 1 week and 2 weeks after
      AP mode initiation. Potential misbehaviors will be corrected and all questions answered. If
      needed, AP parameters may be revised and reconfigured. Hospital visits will be scheduled 6,
      12 and 18 weeks after AP mode initiation for the same purposes, plus HbA1c measurement at
      week 12 and 18. At 18-week visit, a study extension for a further 18-week period will be
      initiated. AP mode that will be prescribed to all patients will depend from an independent
      DSMB decision based upon study safety data collected after 6 and 12 weeks from the first 30
      included patients. Visits will occur at week 27 (safety follow-up) and 36 (final visit).
