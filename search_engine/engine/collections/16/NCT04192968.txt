      with a speech-language therapy. At present, 70 to 80% of children with congenital - profound
      deafness who are implanted at an early age will have a language level identical to their
      hearing peers. But 20 to 30% of them will be able to present linguistic difficulties.

      The objective recording of the cortical activity in response to a sound stimulus gives a
      proof of the quality of the auditory stimulation that is perceived by the cortex, an
      essential condition for the further linguistic development of the child. By the use of
      complex stimuli of speeching type, all the channels involved in the auditory processing are
      analyzed.

      The recording in routine clinical practice of the automated cortical auditory evoked
      potentials in response to a vocal stimulus makes it possible to objectify the quality of the
      auditory rehabilitation received by the child.

      The implanted children all benefit from regular and prolonged speech therapy follow-up, with
      a complete evaluation every year. It is important to regularly monitor the linguistic
      evolution of young children who are implanted in order to identify children at risk of poorer
      linguistic development at an early age.

      The objective of the study is to compare the responses recorded with automated cortical
      auditory evoked potentials, of children who had one or two cochlear implants for 3 years, and
      the results of the speech therapy assessment.
