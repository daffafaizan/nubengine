      inadvertent air insufflations and colon elongation. Residual air in the lumen was suctioned
      to minimize angulations at flexures. Water at 37°C was infused with a pump (Olympus) through
      the biopsy channel to confirm correct tip orientation for scope advancement. The infused
      water was removed predominantly by suction when the colonoscope was smoothly advanced during
      the insertion phase, and turbid luminal water due to residual feces was exchanged by clean
      water until the lumen was clearly visualized. Occasionally, if it was difficult to determine
      whether the colonoscope tip was in the cecum, air was allowed to be insufflated for
      observation. If the position of the scope tip was confirmed to be not in the cecum,
      insufflated air would be removed by suction and the WE method would be continuously used
      until successful intubation.

      For the AI method, water was not used, and air was insufflated during insertion.

      Air was insufflated to distend the lumen for inspection and biopsy or polypectomy during
      withdrawal for both methods. Polyps will be removed by forceps biopsy (polyps size <3mm),
      cold snare technique (3-6mm) or endoscopic mucosal resection (size≥6mm).
