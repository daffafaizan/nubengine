    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To evaluate the safety profile of intravenous anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody BMS-986218
      (anti-CTLA4-NF mAb [BMS-986218]) alone or with nivolumab administered in combination with
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) targeting 1-4 lesion(s) for patients with
      metastatic cancers.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine antitumor activity of anti-CTLA4-NF mAb (BMS-986218) therapy with SBRT
      treatment for 1-4 lesions in non-irradiate tumors (abscopal lesions; out of external beam
      radiation [XRT] field) as defined by Immune-Related Response Criteria (irRC).

      II. To determine antitumor activity of anti-CTLA4-NF mAb (BMS-986218) therapy with RadScopal
      treatment in the low dose treated lesion as defined by irRC.

      III. To evaluate treatment efficacy in different SBRT treatment sites (liver versus [vs.]
      adrenal, lung vs. adrenal).

      IV. To evaluate treatment efficacy by comparing anti-CTLA4-NF mAb (BMS-986218) alone with
      SBRT treatment vs. anti-CTLA4-NF mAb (BMS-986218) in combination with nivolumab and SBRT
      treatment.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate treatment efficacy by comparing anti-CTLA4-NF mAb (BMS-986218) alone or with
      SBRT treatment vs. ipilimumab alone or with SBRT treatment (previous trial).

      II. To evaluate the associations of tumor-associated and systemic immune biomarkers for
      therapy with clinical response outcomes and toxicity prediction.

      III. To evaluate whether skeletal mass, neutrophil, neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, and tumor
      bulk are correlated with clinical outcomes and adverse events.

      IV. To evaluate whether tumor kinetics in combination with clinical correlates can help
      determine treatment response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody BMS-986218 intravenously (IV) over 30
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 cycles in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also undergo SBRT on days 36-39 (days 8-11 of
      cycle 2).

      ARM II: Patients receive anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody BMS-986218 and SBRT as in Arm 1.
      Beginning cycle 2, patients also receive nivolumab IV over 30 minutes starting on day 1.
      Cycles repeat every 28 days for up to 2 years in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 60 days and 6 and 12
      months after last cycle of anti-CTLA4 monoclonal antibody BMS-986218.
