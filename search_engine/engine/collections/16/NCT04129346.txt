      of a 12 week mHealth intervention to increase PA in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) patients
      using a two-arm randomized control trial (RCT). We will also examine the effects of the
      intervention on symptom burden, quality of life, and functional performance. Inactive MBC
      patients (n=50) will be assigned to Fit2ThriveMB or education control. Participants assigned
      to the Fit2ThriveMB will receive the Fit2ThriveMB smartphone app, Fitbit, and coaching calls.
      Participants in the education control will be asked to download the app cancer.net from the
      American Society of Clinical Oncology, will receive educational materials and calls during
      the intervention period and the Fitbit following completion of 12 week assessments.
