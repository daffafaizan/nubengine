        -  Explore effects of TMS and tDCS on movement intention.

        -  Discern the neural activity underlying modulation of movement intention with
           neuroimaging recording.

        -  Identify brain stimulation's effect in patients with psychogenic tremor and
           non-epileptic seizures.

        -  Technical development of new experimental paradigms and data analysis methods.

        -  Data collection for hypotheses development.
