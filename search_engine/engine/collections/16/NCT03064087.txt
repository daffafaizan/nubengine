      abnormalities. The patient takes at home two urine samples with the Colli-Pee device (a
      device that allows to collect first-void urine), the day before the visit to the colposcopy
      centre. At the colposcopy centre, two vaginal self-samples are taken by the patient herself:
      one with a cotton swab and a second with a plastic brush. Finally, the gynecologist takes a
      cervical Pap smear with a Cervex-Brush Combi.

      A real-time PCR test will be used to detect DNA of high-risk HPV types. It is possible that
      in the future also other tests will be validated on these samples. The colposcopy and
      histological findings will be used as the gold standard. The main purpose of the study is to
      assess the relative diagnostic tests accuracy of hrHPV testing on self- and urine samples
      compared to hrHPV testing on cervical samples taken by a clinician. Furthermore, the
      participating women will receive also a questionnaire which can give insights into the
      attitudes and preferences of the women with regard to the self-sampling devices.
