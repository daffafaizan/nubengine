      the effects on critical patients on invasive mechanical ventilation of early mobilization
      with a cycle ergometer. Patients (age > 18 years) will be recruited for this study from among
      those admitted to the intensive care department at the Hospital de Cl√≠nicas de Porto Alegre.
      Eligible patients will have been on invasive mechanical ventilation for at least 24 to 48
      hours, will have spent maximum of 1 week in hospital and will not exhibit any characteristics
      restricting lower extremity mobility. These subjects will be randomized to receive either
      conventional physiotherapy or conventional physiotherapy with an additional cycle ergometer
      intervention. The intervention will be administered passively for 20 minutes, at 20
      revolutions per minute, once per day, throughout the time the patients remain on invasive
      mechanical ventilation.
