      However, by mistake, the randomisation application was set up consistent with the vaccine
      supply ratio (2:1) rather than the treatment group randomization ratio (1:1). Subsequently,
      the protocol was amended to adjust the sample size and randomisation ratio for the study.

      The study will enrol 126 subjects randomised 2:1. 84 subjects will receive Prepandrix™ and 42
      subjects will receive Fluarix™.
