      fibrosis is the most serious complication of schistosomiasis mansoni which can lead to
      reduced work capacity and early death in endemic countries. There is, however, limited
      knowledge on the development of liver fibrosis and the differential patterns morbidity
      observed in endemic communities. Our preliminary cross-sectional study in Ethiopia seems to
      indicate that serum levels of antioxidants may influence the development of fibrosis. The
      present project is a translational study combining basic antioxidant laboratory work with is
      a randomised double blinded placebo controlled prospective study in endemic areas in
      Ethiopia, investigating the role of food based antioxidant supplements on the outcome of
      anti-schistosomal chemotherapy with regards to the extent of fibrosis reversal. In addition,
      analysis of dietary intakes of antioxidants among communities with comparable levels of S.
      mansoni infection but with differing levels of schistosomal periportal fibrosis will be
      undertaken to compare serum levels of antioxidants and prevalence of liver fibrosis.
      Furthermore we plan to assess development of schistosomal peri-portal fibrosis in a cohort of
      students established 9 years back who had comparable levels of community prevalence of
      schistosomiasis but with differing access to fruits and vegetables. Research on this topic
      has a high priority globally which is in line with the millennium development goals.
      Knowledge in this field will also add to our understanding of fibrosis development in general
      and to the efficacy of clinical treatment of schistosomiasis in particular.
