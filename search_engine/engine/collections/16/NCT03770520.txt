      choosing the vessels to graft, however, some of the grafts occluded shortly after surgery due
      to competitive flow, these vessels may not be significantly stenosis in functional assessment
      such as Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR). Quantitative Flow Ratio (QFR) is a novel method for
      evaluating the functional significance of coronary stenosis. Comparing to FFR, there is no
      need for pressure wire or ATP when performing QFR. This study plan to investigate the
      clinical effect of QFR in CABG, all patients included will be allocated 1:1 into two groups:
      QFR-guided and Angio-guided, QFR-guided group will be performed a CABG based on the result of
      QFR, the other group will be based on heart team discussion of CAG, CTA will be adopted to
      evaluate the 1 year graft patency.
