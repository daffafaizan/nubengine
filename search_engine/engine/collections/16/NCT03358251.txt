    
      This study is an open-label split-mouth study that investigates the safety and efficacy of
      Pocket-X Gel, a periodontal in-situ gelling product, in improving the healing of the gingiva
      and preventing bacterial re-colonization in the periodontal pocket following scaling and root
      planing.

      The study includes a single arm. All participants will undergo 1-4 sessions of scaling and
      root planing (SRP), which is the conventional gold-standard treatment for periodontal
      disease. The number of SRP sessions is dependent on the severity of the periodontal disease.
      Following completion of SRP, participants will undergo treatment with Pocket-X Gel, which
      will be inserted into periodontal pockets present in one/two of the participants mouth
      segments (quadrants), following scaling and root planing. The other mouth segments will not
      undergo further intervention. The number of segments to be treated is dependent on the
      clinical symmetry between the treated segment(s) and the contralateral segment(s).
      Participants will be followed for a total duration of 6 months. Additional application of
      Pocket-X Gel may occur 1 month and/or 3 months following first application, depending on the
      state of the participant's periodontal disease.

      The rationale for the study is the hypothesis that a physical barrier inserted into
      periodontal pockets following scaling and root planing would assist in maintaining the pocket
      clean by preventing bacteria from re-entering the cleaned pocket, thus allowing the gums to
      properly heal and seal the pockets while preventing further inflammation.
