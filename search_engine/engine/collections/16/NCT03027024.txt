    
      Subjects participating in the trial will attend a total of 8 study visits (1 preoperative, 2
      operative and 5 postoperative) over a period of 3 months, same as the surgeon's standard
      follow up protocol for bilateral cataract surgery with IOL implantation. Subjects would have
      the option for unscheduled visits if required medically.

      Primary endpoint data will be collected at the final visit. Data analyses will be done in the
      end to support the study publication plan.
