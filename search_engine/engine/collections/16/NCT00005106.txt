      (zidovudine plus lamivudine) plus nelfinavir, or Combivir plus abacavir. Patients are
      stratified into 2 groups based on their screening plasma HIV-1 RNA: (1) greater than 1,000 up
      to 100,000 copies/ml or (2) greater than 100,000 up to 200,000 copies/ml. Measurements and
      evaluations for assessment of body fat composition, virologic and immunologic outcomes,
      markers of alterations in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism, and safety are performed at
      Baseline, Weeks 4, 8, 16, 24, and every 12 weeks thereafter until Week 96 or withdrawal. In
      addition, health-related quality of life and health care resource utilization data are
      collected at specified treatment visits.
