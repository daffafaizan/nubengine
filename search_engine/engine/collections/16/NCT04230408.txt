    
      Prospective, non-randomized, open label, single arm, multi-institutional, phase 2 study,
      including patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer able to receive concurrent
      chemoradiation. Eligible patients will then receive treatment as follows:

      Induction chemo-immunotherapy Two 21-day cycles of carboplatin, paclitaxel and durvalumab
      will be given BEFORE concurrent chemo-immuno-radiotherapy.

      Thereafter, patients without progressive disease (or patients with disease progression that
      is still locally advanced and can be safely encompassed within tolerable radiation fields)
      will receive concurrent chemo-immuno-radiotherapy, as follows:

      Concurrent chemo-immuno-radiotherapy Concurrent carboplatin, paclitaxel, and durvalumab with
      radiation therapy, initiated preferably 3-5 weeks after the last dose of induction
      chemo-immunotherapy.

      Thereafter, patients without progressive disease will receive consolidation immunotherapy, as
      follows:

      Consolidation immunotherapy Twelve 28-day cycles of durvalumab will be given, initiated
      preferably within one week following concurrent chemo-immuno-radiotherapy.
