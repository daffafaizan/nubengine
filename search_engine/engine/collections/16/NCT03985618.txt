      the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries, the chance of spontaneous vaginal delivery in
      women with a BMI ≥35kg/m2 is 55%, while the chance is 36.7% in women with a BMI ≥40.0kg/m2.
      This number includes women who go into labour spontaneously, in which, the odds of a vaginal
      delivery are highest. The rate of failure to induce labour approaches 80% with increased
      complications and morbidity including abnormal fetal heart rate monitoring, labour dystocia,
      emergency C-section, and fetal macrosomia. It has been proposed that some women may benefit
      from a planned Caesarean section delivery. However, Caesarean sections are also not
      straightforward in women with obesity, and come with significant risks of short- and
      long-term morbidity for mother and baby, including prolonged operative times, higher volumes
      of blood loss and infection rates and higher rates of NICU admission.

      Given that there are many considerations when deciding how to best deliver a woman with
      obesity, it is not surprising that there is a high degree of clinical equipoise. In reality,
      the decision is made jointly between the patient and her care provider, often guided by
      overall instinct and local resource availability.

      Studies to date have been retrospective in nature. There is a significant need for
      prospective study of the outcomes and experiences of planned induction of labour and planned
      Caesarean section in women with obesity to allow evidence-based counselling and
      decision-making.
