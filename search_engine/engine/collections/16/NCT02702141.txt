      dosing schedule of every 42 days).

      Individual expansion cohorts of up to approximately 20 patients will be opened at dose levels
      selected by the Safety Monitoring Committee based on the aggregate known safety and activity
      data to further define the safety and antitumor activity in refractory and relapsed disease
      subgroups.
