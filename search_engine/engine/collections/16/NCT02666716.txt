      non-ICU patients and healthy volunteers due to underlying disease(s). Therefore,
      extrapolation of data from healthy volunteers and non-ICU patients is not possible.

      To be able to include 20 patients within the study duration, a multi-centre approach is
      necessary.

      Patients will receive standard care, as stated in the product characteristics or according to
      local protocols. Blood sampling for pharmacokinetic analysis will be retrieved through a
      central venous catheter. A maximum of 62 milliliter blood in total will be drawn for this
      study. Patients will be monitored daily during the treatment period for adverse events of the
      study drug.

      Full pharmacokinetic curves will be taken on day 3 of iv therapy. Limited pharmacokinetic
      curves will be taken on day 7 of iv therapy. These two moments of pharmacokinetic analysis
      will enable the determination steady state and enable the determination of intra-individual
      variability.

      As probably not all patients included will be treated with iv fluconazole for 7 days,
      switching to oral/enteral therapy is allowed after day 3. To assess bioavailability limited
      pharmacokinetic curves will be taken on day 3 of oral/enteral therapy.
