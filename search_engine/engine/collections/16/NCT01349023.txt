      week for four weeks, participants are provided with all of their foods and beverages for
      breakfast, lunch, and dinner meals. Across test days, the entrée at each meal is varied in
      both energy content and energy density between a standard level (100%) and a reduced level
      (64% of the standard). Following consumption of a compulsory entrée, a variety of
      unmanipulated foods will be served for ad libitum consumption. The order of experimental
      conditions is counterbalanced across the subjects.
