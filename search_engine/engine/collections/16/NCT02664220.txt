      in pediatric patients despite utilization of evidence-based practices. Povidone-iodine is a
      commonly used antiseptic in surgical procedures and has been shown to be effective in
      reducing postoperative abscesses in adults with perforated appendicitis. This trial will be
      the first to rigorously test the efficacy of povidone-iodine irrigation in children and to
      verify its safety profile in this patient population.
