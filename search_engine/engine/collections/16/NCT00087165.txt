    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Determine the efficacy of GTI-2040, docetaxel, and prednisone, in terms of
           prostate-specific antigen (PSA) response rate, in patients with hormone-refractory
           prostate cancer.

      Secondary

        -  Determine objective tumor response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the median time to progression in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Determine the median duration of PSA response in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Correlate baseline and post-treatment levels of ribonucleotide reductase activity in
           tumor biopsies and peripheral blood mononuclear cells and tumoral expression of c-myc,
           R2 subunit protein, and markers of cellular proliferation and apoptosis with clinical
           outcomes in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.

      Patients receive GTI-2040 IV continuously on days 1-14, docetaxel IV on day 3 of course 1 and
      on day 1 of subsequent courses, and oral prednisone twice daily on days 1-21. Treatment
      repeats every 21 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed for survival.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.6-9.5
      months.
