      week in two fractions for a total of 12 cycles using a previous prescription developed by
      Salazar et al to a total of 6000 rad.

      Treatment will be given to a large field with a 2-3 cm tumor margin. All involved or
      suspicious nodal areas will be radiated as well. The drug Navelbine will be given in a dose
      escalation on the same day the radiation is administered. The starting dose for Navelbine
      will be 20 mg/m2 and the escalation will be in 10 mg increments.
