      exercises on breast cancer-related lymphedema volume and severity, as well as participant's
      physical function and quality of life. Women diagnosed with unilateral breast cancer related
      lymphedema were randomly divided into two groups: the kinect based rehabilitation group KBRG
      and resistance exercise group REG. woman in The KBRG received virtual reality therapy using
