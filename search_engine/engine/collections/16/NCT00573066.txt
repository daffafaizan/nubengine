      followed by a continuous infusion for up to 24 hours in infants who are immediately
      post-operative from cardiac surgery and require tracheal intubation with mechanical
      ventilation in the post-operative period. Three bolus doses and infusion doses will be
      administered to a total of 36 evaluable patients.
