      (PD) of single ascending doses (SAD) and multiple ascending doses (MAD) of BLD-0409 in
      healthy volunteers (HV) to facilitate the dose/dosing regimen selection for future clinical
      studies with BLD-0409 in various chronic liver diseases.

      The study consists of two parts:

      Part 1: SAD in HV with up to 6 cohorts (including a food effect cohort). For SAD cohorts and
      planned dosing schedule.
