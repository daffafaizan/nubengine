      SCD interventions while also identifying effective implementation strategies informed by a
      systematic and rigorous work done by the members of the SCDIC consortium to improve the
      quality of life of people with SCD, a life-threatening hematological disorder. This study
      aims to collect detailed information about the planned interventions, the implementation
      strategies and the control conditions from each site.
