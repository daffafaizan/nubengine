      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). In addition, superior effect of immunotherapy for
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma was also reported recently. While, clinical application of
      ctDNA, PD-L1 and CD8 T cell monitoring in neoadjuvant immunotherapy for patients with
      esophageal squamous cell carcinoma is largely unknown. This trial will evaluate firstly the
      efficacy and the safety of Camrelizumab plus chemotherapy （albumin-bound paclitaxel plus
      cisplatin）as neoadjuvant approach. The evaluation indicators include pathological complete
      response rate (pCR) and objective imaging response rate after neoadjuvant therapy (ORR). ),
      2-year progression-free survival (2y-PFS), postoperative progression-free survival (PFS), and
      overall survival (OS) after treatment. Objective response rate (ORR) based upon
      immune-Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Version (RECIST v1.1). Major pathological
      response assessed by post-operational pathological review ctDNA efficacy will also be
      evaluated along with clinical management. Monitoring tumor burden, clonality as well as tumor
      heterogeneity evaluation will be correlated to radiological assessment and pathological
      findings.
