      part at a operative gynaecological department of a university hospital. Women who apply to
      the university clinic who have a medical indication for hysteroscopic surgery will be
      recruited after informed consent.

      Patients included in the study will be allocated to three groups. The intervention arms will
      be two arms and one sham group. The randomisation will be performed to three groups by a
      third party who is not involved in the surgical procedures.

      Upon initial evaluation, a form evaluating age and other sociodemographic characteristics
      will be filled out before the scheduled hysteroscopy procedure. After completion of the
      initial form, rectal tablets will be administered according to the allocated group; two hours
      previously to the procedure. Hysteroscopy will be under general anaesthesia with a 10 mm
      hysteroscope during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.

      During the procedure the duration of the cervical entry and total duration of the operation
      will be noted. Additionally basal dilatation will be noted.

      Two hours after the procedure pain will be documented according to the Visual Analogue Scale
      which is a ten point scale. A value of "1" indicates "no pain". A value of "10" indicates
      "excruciating" pain.
