    
      This is a prospective, single arm, pilot study to determine the symptomatic radiation
      necrosis rate at 6 months utilizing dose-reduced stereotactic radiosurgery with immunotherapy
      for subjects with a diagnosis of 1-10 brain metastases from MRI and tissue diagnosis of
      primary malignancy.

      Primary end-point is 6 month symptomatic radiation necrosis, defined as a 6-month rate of
      clinical symptomatology requiring steroid administration (i.e. Decadron) and/or operative
      intervention concomitant with advanced and routine brain imaging findings consistent with
      radiation necrosis. Follow-up MRIs will be fused with the planning scan for this assessment.
