      in participation will be determined at their initial prenatal visit. Those that are
      interested will be consented. Between 24-28 weeks of gestation, the recommended period of
      glucola testing, a soft sensor for continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS) will be
      inserted superficially under the skin. The patient will be instructed on how to wear and care
      for the device. She will wear the CGMS for 7 days, then return to the clinic for removal of
      the device, and downloading of the data. She will perform the routine glucola test sometime
      between days 2 to 7 . Finger stick blood glucoses will be checked by the patient 2 times
      daily during the 7 days of wearing the CGMS. Results of CGMS will not be available to the
      patient or her physician until after completion of the pregnancy. The patient will be treated
      routinely, based on the results of the routine glucola test.
