      that the probiotics in VSL#3 may be effective in IBS in adults. Because there is a
      significant unmet need for improved IBS therapies to prevent frequent exacerbations that lead
      to unscheduled health care, we will conduct a safety study of the probiotic VSL#3.
      Preliminary studies suggest that probiotics such as VSL#3 are effective in the treatment of
      adults with IBS but safety studies have not been carried out. A safety study of VSL#3 has
      been carried out in adult asthmatics that demonstrated no significant adverse effects. Before
      a trial of VSL#3 can be performed in children with IBS, the FDA has requested that a safety
      trial be conducted in adults with IBS.

      Consent will be obtained from the subject.

      Adults who meet the criteria for irritable bowel syndrome will be recruited and studied. They
      will have been diagnosed by an adult gastroenterologist.

      During a baseline one week period, the subjects will keep a diary of pain episodes, pain
      severity, pain-induced interference with activity, and stooling pattern (i.e.,
      pain/activity/stool diary).

      Following the baseline period, the subjects will be randomized into either a 4 week or 8 week
      treatment period with the probiotic. The treatment will be open label. During the treatment
      period, subjects will keep the diary for pain and stooling habits and a daily record of
      symptoms (i.e., daily temperature monitoring).

      At the end of the treatment period the pain/stool/activity diary will be repeated. Four weeks
      after the treatment period ends a follow-up phone call will be made to participants to check
      on their pain and stooling patterns.
