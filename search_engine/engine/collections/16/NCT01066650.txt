      To investigate whether the clinical outcome following the randomized implantation of the
      Endeavor Resolute® versus XIENCE V® drug-eluting stent is similar, as assessed in a
      non-inferiority setting by comparing target-vessel failure (TVF) of both stents. We want to
      compare for both drug-eluting stents the combined endpoint of death, myocardial infarction or
      revascularization related to the target-vessel, as well as death or myocardial infarction
      that cannot be related to a significant flow obstruction in another vessel or to another
      cause. According to current literature, non-inferiority of Endeavor resolute ® and XIENCE V®
      is expected. But the non-inferiority of Endeavor resolute and XIENCE V® is not tested in a
      controlled randomized trial yet.
