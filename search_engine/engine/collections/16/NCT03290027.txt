      severity on the chest and/or back (including shoulders) were enrolled provided they had mild
      to moderate acne on the face. During the 12-week treatment period subjects used the study
      product twice daily. Subjects were instructed to treat the entire face (and chest and/or back
      including shoulders, if applicable).

      Efficacy was assessed by using an Investigator's Global Assessment scale (IGA 5 point scale)
      and by counting the number of inflammatory and non-inflammatory lesions on the face at
      Baseline and Weeks 4, 8, and 12.

      Safety assessments included the investigator's assessment of local cutaneous tolerance of the
      treated skin (dryness, non-lesional erythema, peeling, stinging, burning, and itching;
      assessed separately on the chest and/or back including shoulders (if applicable), vital signs
      (blood pressure and pulse rate), and adverse events (AEs). Urine pregnancy tests were
      performed at Baseline and at every visit through Week 12 for all female subjects. A physical
      examination was performed.
