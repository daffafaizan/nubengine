    
      Patients with locally advanced, potentially operable or metastatic gastric cancer or
      adenocarcinoma of the esophagogastric junction without prior therapy in the palliative
      setting are treated with:

        -  Arm A: FLO

        -  Arm B: FLOT

      max. 12 cycles

      Evaluation of quality of life by standard forms at baseline and then every 2 months until
      progress of disease. Pharmacogenetic analyses will be done to evaluate a risk profile for
      platin-based therapies. 140 patients will be treated (70 per arm)

      primary endpoint:

        -  Response Rate

      secondary endpoints:

        -  Prospective Validation of a pharmacogenetic risk profile for patients with advanced GC
           under first-line therapy with platin/docetaxel

        -  Evaluation of quality of life

        -  safety and tolerability

        -  progression free survival (PFS), time to treatment failure (TTF), overall survival (OS)
