      I. Determine the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of E7389 (eribulin mesylate) when given in
      combination with gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in patients with advanced cancer.

      II. Determine the safety, tolerability, and toxicity profile of E7389 and gemcitabine given
      in combination.

      III. Assess the antitumor activity of E7389 in combination with gemcitabine in patients with
      measurable disease.

      IV. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of E7389 and gemcitabine to assess for any possible
      interactions between the two agents.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study. Patients receive eribulin mesylate
      intravenously (IV) and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 OR
      on days 1 and 8.

      Courses repeat every 28 or 21 days* in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of eribulin mesylate and
      gemcitabine hydrochloride until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is
      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience
      dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). NOTE: *If DLT is observed at the first dose level of the 28-day
      schedule, subsequent patients are treated on days 1 and 8 of the 21-day schedule; patients
      enrolled in the expansion cohort (patients with ovarian or endometrial cancer or
      chemotherapy-naive or minimally pre-treated cancer) receive treatment according to the 21-day
      schedule.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months
      thereafter.
