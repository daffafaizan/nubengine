      coagulation by the use of a CBP. Coagulation is a process of primary hemostasis by adhesion
      of trombocytes and aggregation, followed by secondary coagulation and fibrin formation.
      During CTC fibrinogen is the first coagulation factor which reaches critical concentration
      necessary for clotting. Point of Care clotting assay with thromboelastography (TEG) provides
      qualitative information on coagulation factors and clot strength. Specific coagulation factor
      correction of impaired clotting improves clot strength and may reduces the number of
      perioperative allogeneic blood transfusions, resulting in possible reduction of postoperative
      blood loss and reduction of the risk of re-operation in the short and long term. The
      hypothesis of this study is that a single dose fibrinogen concentrate immediately after CTC
      leads to a decrease in the number of allogenic blood transfusions in patients with clinically
      impaired clotting, verified by TEG.
