      perinatal mortality. Due to pulmonary hypoplasia and preterm delivery, mortality exceeds 60%
      when PPROM occurs prior to 24 weeks. When oligohydramnios persists, it may raise to 90%.
      Morbidity in survivors is also significant. In uncontrolled series, serial amnioinfusions,
      which have acceptable invasiveness and are of limited complexity, mortality was reduced to
      60%.

      We propose an open, multicenter randomized trial comparing perinatal survival in patients
      presenting with early spontaneous PPROM and persistent oligohydramnios, managed either
      conservatively or with serial amnioinfusions. Inclusion criteria: Single pregnancy, early
      spontaneous PPROM < 24.3 weeks, oligohydramnios (deepest vertical pocket < 2 cm) for at least
      4 days and no longer than 15 days at enrolment. The study is open and will be run through a
      dedicated password protected web site, and with a minimal number of outcome measures. Primary
      outcome: Survival till discharge from the NICU. Secondary outcomes: Latency time from PPROM
      to delivery, gestational age at birth, indication for delivery, number of days of ventilatory
      support, serious neurologic morbidity, neonatal sepsis prevalence, need for oxygen at 36
      weeks post-conception.
