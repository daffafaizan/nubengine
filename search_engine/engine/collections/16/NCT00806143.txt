      major depressive disorder in a double-blind, controlled trial randomized to either sequential
      bilaterally on the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) or monolaterally on
      the right DLPFC. Patients will be randomized to receive sequentially low-frequency rTMS at 1
      Hz to the right DLPFC and high-frequency rTMS at 10 Hz rTMS to the left DLPFC, or to receive
      low-frequency rTMS at 1 Hz to the right DLPFC. Significant antidepressant effect as expressed
      by a reduction of Hamilton Depression Scale score will be recorded in both the groups of
      patients.
