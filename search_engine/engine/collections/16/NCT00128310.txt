      vinorelbine will be 3 months, and for patients treated with gemcitabine plus vinorelbine will
      be 5 months. That implies a reduction in risk ratio of 40% (Hazard ratio = 1,67). Assuming a
      bilateral alpha error of 0.05 and beta error of 10%, and the number of events needed if 60%
      of patients have progressed after 1 year, the number of patients needed per treatment arm is
      114. Considering a 10% post-randomization drop-out, the final number of patients is 252 (126
      per arm).
