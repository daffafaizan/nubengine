      Patients with this abnormality as an early manifestation of glucose intolerance are at higher
      risk of type 2 diabetes. The pathophysiology of this abnormality appears to be related with
      delayed first phase insulin release. Improvement of first phase insulin secretion and delay
      in gastric emptying induced by sitagliptin phosphate could have favorable effects in patients
      in whom delayed insulin secretion is associated with reactive hypoglycemia.
