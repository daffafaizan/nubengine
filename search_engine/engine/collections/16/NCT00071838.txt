      nervous system (CNS) inflammation, demyelination, axonal loss, and leads to substantial
      disability in young adults. Existing approved treatments include interferon beta, glatiramer
      acetate and mitoxantrone. These therapies are only moderately effective in reducing disease
      activity.

      The Neuroimmunology Branch (NIB) has during the last three years tested the tolerability and
      safety of monthly intravenously administered daclizumab (Zenapax(Registered Trademark)), a
      humanized monoclonal antibody against the IL-2 receptor alpha chain, in patients who receive
      interferon-beta, but responded incompletely to therapy with interferon-beta. Daclizumab has
      been well tolerated and inhibited inflammatory disease activity by almost 90%. Under an
      amendment of this protocol, it was demonstrated that the efficacy of daclizumab is maintained
      once interferon-beta therapy is discontinued.

      In the current trial, we will test the efficacy of daclizumab alone in relapsing-remitting MS
      patients. This trial is a single-centre, open-label, baseline to treatment cross-over phase
      II trial. Daclizumab will be administered intravenously at 1mg/kg bodyweight.
      Contrast-enhancing MRI lesions will serve as the primary outcome measure in this phase II
      trial, and a number of clinical, MRI, and immunological parameters will be measured as
      secondary and tertiary outcomes. Daclizumab is a promising new immunomodulatory treatment for
      relapsing-remitting MS.
