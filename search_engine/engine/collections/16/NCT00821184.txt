      work by stopping muscles from tightening or behavioral modification. This study will help
      determine if behavior modification (fluid regulation, pelvic exercises, timed voiding)
      performed in conjunction wth oral Vesicare anticholinergic therapy, is more effective for
      treating overactive bladder symptoms than oral Vesicare anticholinergic therapy alone.
