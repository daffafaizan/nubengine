      blocking a specific protein called Polo-like Kinase 4 (PLK4) that is involved in cancer cell
      growth. CFI-400945 may slow down the growth of cancer cells or may cause cancer cells to die.
      This drug has been shown to shrink tumours in animals and has been studied in some patients
      and appears well tolerated with little side effects. CFI-400945 seems promising but it is not
      clear if it can offer better results than standard therapy.
