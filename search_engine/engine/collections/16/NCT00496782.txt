      enrollment has projected difficulties in completing the study in a timely manner, despite the
      best efforts by the sponsor and the sites. Given the difficulties encountered in this pilot
      study and the need to conduct an even larger confirmatory study, the decision to discontinue
      the study has therefore been made. It should be noted that safety concerns have not been seen
      in this study and have not factored into this decision.
