    
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the Central Nervous
      System (CNS). There are many forms of MS; althoughthe majority are Relapsing Remitting (RRMS)
      representing approximately 80% of the cases. The disease appears to be more inflammatory in
      RRMS as manisfested by an increase inGadolinium enhancement on MRI and an increase in
      inflammatory bioassay markers.

      Zocor is in a class of drugs (statins) that are used to lower cholesterol. Statins also have
      an anti-inflammatory effect on the CNS. Zocor has been shown in a small clinical trial to
      reduce the number of new MRI-detected brain lesions over a six month treatment period in
      patients with RRMS. This study is to evaluate the safety of combining Avonex with Zocor for a
      a period of fourteen months in patients with RRMS and to evaluate the effect of treatment on
      new or enlarging lesions as measured by MRI.
