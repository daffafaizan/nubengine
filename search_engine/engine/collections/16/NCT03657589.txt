      implant procedure, and patients scheduled for a revision surgery after developing infection
      after implant surgery.

      Twenty subjects examining only specific aim one is funded and will be studied. If future
      funding is granted and additional 30 subjects for aim one and 40 for aim two will be studied
      Subjects in both groups will receive an ultrasound examination of the oral cavity prior to
      their clinically-scheduled dental surgery. Subjects in group 1 also may receive a CBCT scan
      if not previously clinically-ordered.
