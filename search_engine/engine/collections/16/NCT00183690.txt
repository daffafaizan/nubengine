      or physical integrity of oneself or others has occurred or was threatened. People with PTSD
      have persistent frightening thoughts and memories of their ordeal and often feel emotionally
      numb, especially with people to whom they were once close. Effective treatments for
      post-traumatic stress disorder are available, and research is yielding new, improved
      therapies that can help reduce symptoms of PTSD. Prolonged exposure (PE) therapy is a brief
      cognitive behavioral therapy that has been effective in treating symptoms of PTSD in adults.
      However, no treatments have been proven effective for the treatment of PTSD in adolescents.
      This study will compare the effectiveness of PE therapy versus non-trauma directed active
      psychotherapy in reducing the symptoms of PTSD in adolescents. In addition, this study aims
      to refine the existing PE treatment protocol for adolescents with PTSD.

      Participants in this single-blind study will be randomly assigned to receive either PE
      therapy or AP. All participants will receive 12 to 18 therapy sessions, which will be
      conducted weekly. Assessments of PTSD symptoms, depression, and overall functioning will be
      conducted at baseline, immediately post-treatment, and 3 months post-treatment.
