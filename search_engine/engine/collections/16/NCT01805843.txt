      capacity limitation an exercise test (Doppler echocardiography with spiroergometry) will be
      performed. Patients who show elevated SPAP at rest or during exercise (in this study SPAP â‰¥
      40 mmHg) or with reduced exercise capacity (peak VO2 < 75%) a right heart catheterization
      (RHC) will be suggested. Additionally for the evaluation of exercise capacity a 6 MWD will be
      performed. This work- up of patients allows clinical and hemodynamic evaluation.
