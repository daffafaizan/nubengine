      indication for liver transplantation (LT). Although LT is a cure for cirrhosis of the liver,
      it does not always cure HCV infection or reinfection of post-transplanted liver. Post-LT
      recurrent HCV can lead to accelerated liver fibrosis. Chronic exposure to lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS) from gut-derived bacteria has shown to be at elevated levels in patients with cirrhosis
      due to HCV compared to normal controls. Therefore, the investigators hypothesize that LPS
      contributes to cause of liver fibrosis, specifically in patients with post-LT recurrent HCV,
      and this effect maybe modified with the poorly absorbed antibiotic, rifaximin, which alter
      the gut flora of the patients.
