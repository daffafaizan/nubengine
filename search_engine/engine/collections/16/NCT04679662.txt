      the risks typically associated with open heart surgery. Furthermore there is an unmet
      clinical need for patients with severe MR who are refused or denied surgery due to high risk.
      Percutaneous therapy provides a novel alternative treatment option for these patients with
      the aim of reducing morbidity and mortality over and above current medical therapy. The
      Polares Medical PLAR Implant and Delivery System is a catheter-based technology designed to
      permanently implant a prosthesis using a transvenous / transseptal approach to augment the
      posterior mitral valve leaflet and improve coaptation with the anterior leaflet. Approved
      edge-to-edge repair has already been shown to be a viable alternative for high risk MR
      patients. However treatment with these devices is limited to specific anatomies and often
      requires multiple devices which increases clinical risk, adds to procedural time, and can
      result in residual MR. The PLAR Implant and Delivery System has been designed to overcome and
      mitigate some of these shortfalls.
