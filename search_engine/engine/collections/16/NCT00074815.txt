      reuptake inhibitor (SRI) drugs as initial treatment. However, recommended doses of these
      medications leave many children with clinically significant residual symptoms. Health care
      experts typically recommend augmenting SRI treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT),
      yet this recommendation is seldom followed. This study will contrast two CBT augmentation
      strategies to continued medication management alone: CBT administered by a psychologist and
      instructional CBT (I-CBT)administered by a psychiatrist in the context of ongoing medication
      management.

      All patients in the trial will be eligible to receive a full course of CBT by study end.
      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive CBT, I-CBT or continued
      medication management. All participants will continue their SRI treatment for 12 weeks. After
      the 12-week treatment period, participants who received I-CBT or medication management alone
      and who remain symptomatic will be given CBT as will participants who are asymptomatic but
      relapse within 6 months after treatment. Assessments will be conducted at Weeks 0, 4, 8, and
      12. Follow-up assessments will be conducted at 3 and 6 months post-treatment.
