    
      Background: Built with evidence that makes it possible to work in cardiac rehabilitation
      programs in patients with type 2 diabetes with more security, guaranteeing them an
      improvement in cardiorespiratory fitness, the hemodynamic and glycemic variables, allowing
      them a better quality of life

      Method/Design: The research instrument is applied before and after the practice of the
      proposed exercise program (consisting of aerobic and anaerobic exercises performed for 12
      weeks in three weekly meetings, of 60 minutes each). The instrument is based on the following
      collection protocol: assessment of BP, HR, Borg scale, respiratory rate (RR), oxygen
      saturation (SAT), the DP calculation and will be carried out the examination to check HbA1C
      Will be performed for 12 weeks in three weekly meetings, of 60minutes each, in total of 36
      sessions with antecipated 60 pacients splited in 2 groups "Control" and "intervention"

      Discussion: Correlate the variability of heart rate behavior and glycated hemoglobin after
      the exercise program; To demonstrate the possible association between the change of the
      cardiorespiratory parameters according to the variation of glycated hemoglobin; Demonstrate
      the possibility of association between the variation of the cardiorespiratory parameters and
      glycated hemoglobin according to sex;
