      filled the patients choose whether or not to schedule a second appointment for evaluation of
      their fracture: The first group will be scheduled for a second visit (standard treatment).
      The alternative (Optional follow-up) will be to take a handout describing the recovery and
      providing instructions for how to contact us should they get off course.

      Since it is up to the subject to decide whether or not he or she wants a second appointment
      or the brochure, it is observational rather than interventional.

      Evaluation: 2-6 months after injury all patients (independent of group) will be contacted by
      either phone or email by a blinded research assistant and asked to provide the following:
      pain with NRS (scale 0-10); three satisfaction questions; disability with use of Quick DASH;
      and if they returned to modified and regular work.

      Patients in the standard group A will return to the Hand and Upper Extremity Service for
      their usual practice follow-up examination 1-3 months after treatment.
