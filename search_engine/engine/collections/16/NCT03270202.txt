      healthcare are: 1) The majority of people are not sufficiently active, and 2) there is a lack
      of large, long-term intervention studies documenting the effect of personalized activity and
      improved health in the population. Using HUNT data an algorithm called Personal Activity
      Intelligence (PAI) has been developed. PAI was integrated in a smartphone application and
      user friendly wristband (Mio Slice), that measures heart rate continuously and estimates an
      individual threshold for total physical activity (defined as 100 weekly PAI) that is
      associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and mortality. The primary aim of the
      study is to reveal whether using the wristband will increase cardiorespiratory fitness,
      determined by maximal oxygen uptake, after 4 months among low-fit participants. The secondary
      aims includes the effect on reversing cardiovascular risk factors, cardiac structure and
      function, adherence to physical activity and identification of barriers after 16 weeks and 1
      year.
