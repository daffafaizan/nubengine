      neurodevelopmental outcomes, including lower mean intelligent quotients (IQs). However, it is
      difficult to predict with neonates are most likely to be affected and a cost effective method
      is needed. AEEG has been used in neonates with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy and abnormal
      sleep wake cycles have been proposed to predict poorer long term outcomes. We thus
      hypothesize that abnormal sleep wake cycles in neonates with congenital heart disease will
      correlate with poorer outcomes. In our study, we will examine the relationship between
      performance on a neurodevelopmental screening tool, the Dubowitz neonatal neurological
      screening tool, and the sleep wake cycles on AEEG both before and after cardiac repair to try
      and predict which neonates are at increased risk of adverse long term outcomes. We will also
      compare the findings of the AEEG and performance on the neurodevelopmental tool to the data
      gathered from neonates without cardiac disease.
