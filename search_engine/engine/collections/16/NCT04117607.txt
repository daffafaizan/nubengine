    
      This is a Phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in three parts. A single ascending
      dose (SAD) study in six cohorts receiving a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of 1, 10, 30, 60,
      100, or 200 mg of rezafungin; a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in four cohorts receiving
      30 mg x 3 doses, 60 mg x 3 doses, 100 mg x 3 doses, or 200 mg x 3 doses of rezafungin SC with
      dosing frequency of once every 7 days; and a two-period cross-over bioavailability (BA) study
      receiving 100 mg of rezafungin. The two period cross-over BA study will be assessed unblinded
      in two sequences (10 subjects, 100 mg or maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of rezafungin in Part
      1); 5 subjects will receive an SC injection of rezafungin in Period 1 followed by an
      intravenous (IV) infusion of rezafungin in Period 2, and 5 subjects will receive an IV
      infusion of rezafungin in Period 1 followed by an SC injection of rezafungin in Period 2.
      Each SAD (except cohort 1) and MAD cohort will contain 8 subjects (6 subjects will receive a
      SC injection of rezafungin and 2 subjects will receive placebo). Each SAD (except cohort 1)
      and MAD cohort will be conducted with sentinel dosing. SAD cohort 1 will be comprised of 4
      subjects (3:1 rezafungin to placebo) with no sentinel dosing. Parts 2 and 3 of the study will
      only be conducted after FDA review for safety data and PK data from all subjects
      participating in Part 1; Part 3 may be run in parallel with the first cohort (Cohort 7) of
      Part 2. Individuals in the SAD cohorts will participate for approximately 58 days, including
      up to 28 days for screening and 30 days for dosing and follow-up (FU). Individuals in the MAD
      cohorts will participate for approximately 73 days, including up to 28 days for screening and
      45 days for dosing and FU. Individuals in the BA cohorts will participate for approximately
      80 days, including up to 28 days for screening and 52 days for dosing and FU. The study will
      have a duration of approximately 30 months. The primary objectives are to determine the: 1)
      safety and tolerability of single ascending SC doses (SAD) of rezafungin; 2) safety and
      tolerability of multiple ascending SC doses (MAD) of rezafungin; and 3) pharmacokinetic (PK)
      profile in plasma of rezafungin in healthy adult subjects. The secondary objective is to
      evaluate the BA of rezafungin when administered by SC injection relative to IV infusion in
      healthy adult subjects.
