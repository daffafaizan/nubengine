      frequently associated with secondary bacterial pneumonia. It is important, though difficult,
      to differentiate patients who only have viral pneumonia from those who have viral pneumonia
      with secondary bacterial pneumonia. This will help physicians to prescribe antibiotics to
      only those with bacterial pneumonia and avoid antibiotic use in those with pure viral
      pneumonia, thus help to limit health-care cost and to decrease emergence of antibiotic
      resistance. In adult studies, TREM-1 has been shown to be specifically expressed in bacterial
      infections.

      We propose that measuring TREM-1 in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid will help to
      differentiate these groups. Our hypothesis is that concentration of TREM-1 will be
      significantly elevated in the BAL fluid of children with bacterial pneumonia and viral with
      co-existing bacterial pneumonia than in children with pure viral pneumonia.
