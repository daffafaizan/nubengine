      block are routine in modern anaesthesia, whereas monitoring of analgesia still requires
      further studies. Recently, the Surgical Pleth Index (SPI) was added as a surrogate variable
      showing the nociception-antinociception balance into abovementioned parametres constituting a
      novel approach in monitoring patients intraoperatively, known as adequacy of anaesthesia
      (AoA) or tailor-made anaesthesia.
