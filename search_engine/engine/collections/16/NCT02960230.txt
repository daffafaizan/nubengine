      called poly-ICLC, in combination with nivolumab, every 3 weeks for the first 6 months of
      treatment. Subjects will be monitored routinely by laboratory assessments, physical
      evaluation, vital signs, and MRI. Subjects who tolerate therapy well and have stable or
      improved disease after 6 months of treatment can continue to receive treatment, nivolumab
      continuing every 3 weeks but vaccine and poly-ICLC now every 6 weeks, for a total of 96 weeks
      of treatment.
