    
      A multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, active-control trial is designed to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of INV-144 versus losartan plus placebo co-administered once
      daily for 12 weeks in subjects who have type 2 diabetes and hypertension with nephropathy as
      evidenced by albuminuria.

      Approximately 92 adult subjects will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive
      either INV-144 or losartan plus placebo once daily for 12 weeks. The goal is to have
      approximately 80 subjects complete the entire study.

      The trial will consist of a 4-week open-label losartan run-in period, a 12-week double-blind
      active treatment period, and a 4-week safety follow-up period. Efficacy will be evaluated by
      measurement of UACR, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and the HOMA-IR ratio. Safety
      will be monitored throughout the study by evaluation of adverse events (AEs), physical
      examinations (PEs), clinical laboratory results, vital signs, and electrocardiograms (ECGs).

      Blood samples for PK analysis will be obtained in a subset of approximately 22 subjects, at 2
      to 4 sites, to ensure that PK data are obtained from a minimum of 9 subjects in each
      treatment arm.
