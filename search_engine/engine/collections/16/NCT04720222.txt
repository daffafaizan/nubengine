    
      The purpose of this clinical investigation with healthy subjects (defined as subjects without
      urological problems or lower urinary tract symptoms, assured by pre-defined inclusion and
      exclusion criteria) is to collect raw measurement data of the urinary bladder region of
      volunteers with the TENA-PROTO1, in multiple postural positions to evaluate the detectability
      of the bladder in the intended users and to determine the position criteria for the (future)
      ultrasound sensor on the lower abdomen. Secondarily, this clinical investigation aims to
      collect data on the adhesive and supportive belt used to fix the transducer assembly to the
      lower abdomen by the subject. Furthermore, safety of the subjects will be continously
      documented such as adverse events (AE) and device deficiencies (DD); AEs, Adverse Device
      Events (ADE), Severe Adverse Events (SAE), Severe Adverse Device effects (SADE),
      Unanticipated Serious Adverse Device Effects (USADE) and DDs.
