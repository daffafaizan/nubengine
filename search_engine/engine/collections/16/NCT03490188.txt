      patients as mentors to newly transplanted patients and its relationship with patient anxiety
      following discharge as well as the prevention of 30-day readmissions for kidney transplant
      recipients. The primary hypothesis is that the treatment group of patients who undergo a
      targeted mentorship program will be better compliant with the discharge instructions and will
      perform better when compared to the control group who undergoes current routine
      post-transplantation care. Evidence from this experiment can help advance our understanding
      of patient-engagement in the continuity of care delivery, decrease patient readmission rates,
      and improve overall cost utilization.

      Methods:

      The investigators will conduct a single institution randomized control trial assigning
      patients getting discharged after a kidney transplant to a treatment group that involves a
      30-day mentoring initiative by former transplant patients, and comparing the efficacy with a
      similar control group. The overall study period will be divided into the following sections,
      summarized in Figure 1.
