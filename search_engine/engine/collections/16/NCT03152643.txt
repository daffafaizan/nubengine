    
      This is a multicenter, randomized clinical trial comparing the efficacy and safety between
      cleavage-stage embryo transfer and blastocyst-stage embryo transfer in IVF/ICSI treatment
      cycle, taking into account of subsequent vitrified embryo transfers.Randomization will be
      performed on day 2/3 after oocyte retrieval, when at least 3 embryos are achieved. Patients
      in group A will have 1 cleavage-stage embryo transferred. Patients in group B will have 1
      blastocyst-stage embryo transferred. The outcomes from all the embryo transfers within 1 year
      after randomization will be followed up. If a pregnancy/live birth is not achieved, single
      embryo transfer is required for the first 3 embryo transfers within 1 year after
      randomization. For embryo transfers beyond the third within the 1 year, patient's treatment
      must follow their randomized allocation, and SET is no longer mandatory. The follow-up period
      is 2 years from the day of randomization.Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the participants who
      were unable to undergo the embryo transfers in 1 year of randomization will have 3 months
      extension for frozen embryo transfer. The follow-up for these participants will be extended
      for 3 months as well.
