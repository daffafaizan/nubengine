    
      This is a multicenter, outpatient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      parallel-group, study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjunctive topiramate
      in treating subjects with OCD. The study consists of a washout/screening phase, a
      double-blind treatment phase of 12 weeks, a taper period of approximately 7 days. Upon
      successful completion of the washout/screening phase subjects will be randomized into 1 of 2
      treatment groups: topiramate up to 400 mg/day or placebo. A placebo control will be used to
      establish the frequency and magnitude of changed in clinical endpoints that may occur in the
      absence of active treatment.

      During the double-blind phase, subjects will be seen weekly for the first two weeks and then
      every other week for the remainder of the double-blind phase. Study medication will be
      titrated over the 8-week titration period up to 400mg/day or the subject's maximum tolerated
      dose. After the titration period, the dose will remain stable for the maintenance period
      during which visits will occur every 14 days. At the completion of the maintenance period,
      subjects will taper their study medication over the next 7 days.

      This study will be conducted in up to 96 subjects with a diagnosis of OCD with an onset at
      least 1 year prior to screening supported by the SCID-I. Forty-eight subjects will be
      assigned to topiramate and 48 will be assigned to placebo.
