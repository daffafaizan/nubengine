      tolerability and immunomodulation effect of combining N-803 with antiretroviral therapy (ART)
      during acute HIV infection (AHI). The study will be conducted at one study site, the Thai Red
      Cross AIDS Research Centre (TRCARC) in Bangkok, Thailand.

      Eligible participants will be asked to undergo LN Bx at baseline (untreated AHI), prior to
      initiating dolutegravir-based ART. N-803 will be administered subcutaneously at weeks 0, 3, 6
      (total 3 doses) and will be initiated together with ART. Participants will be asked to
      undergo a second inguinal LN Bx on the opposite groin approximately at week 6 (no later than
      1 week after completion of study agents). They will be followed for safety parameters at
      weeks 8 and 12, after which they will roll over to the RV412, WRAIR#2178 safety monitoring
      protocol. The study duration for individual participants will be approximately 12 weeks. The
      study may include additional optional procedures at baseline and week 6 such as
      leukapheresis, brain MRI imaging and lumbar puncture, according to participants' consent.

      It is hypothesized that N-803 initiated with ART during AHI, will be safe, and will lead to a
      reduction of HIV reservoir size in LN, demonstrated by decreased frequencies of vRNA+ and
      vDNA+ cells in the LNs, in comparison with ART alone.
