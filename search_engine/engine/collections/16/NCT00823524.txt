      Primary

        -  To assess the safety of donor natural killer (NK) cell infusion after
           HLA-mismatched/haploidentical allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from a
           familial donor in patients with advanced malignant disorders.

        -  To determine the maximum number of donor NK cells that can be safely given to these
           patients.

      Secondary

        -  To assess the clinical efficacy donor NK cell infusion, in terms of tumor response,
           response duration, and survival, in patients with progressive or recurrent malignant
           disorders.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

        -  Phase I: Patients receive an infusion of donor natural killer (NK) cells on days 18 and
           21.

        -  Phase II: Patients receive an infusion of donor NK cells on days 14 and 21. After
           completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.
