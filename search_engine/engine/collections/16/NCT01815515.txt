    
      The objective of this study is to evaluate a radiolabeled urea-based small molecule inhibitor
      of prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), [18F]DCFBC (DCFBC) PET imaging for detection of
      metastatic prostate cancer. PSMA is a well characterized histological marker of prostate
      cancer tumor aggressiveness and metastatic potential. The investigators propose to assess the
      ability of DCFBC PET to detect metastatic prostate cancer by visual qualitative and
      quantitative SUV analysis. Correlation will be made to sites of suspected metastatic disease
      detected by standard conventional imaging modalities (CIM) for prostate cancer which includes
      IV contrast CT of chest/abdomen/pelvis and whole body bone scintigraphy.
