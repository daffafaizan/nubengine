      used for treatment of knee osteoarthritis. Even though there are many studies investigating
      the effectiveness of these treatments, the results are mostly qualitative. Also there are a
      few studies comparing these two treatment modalities. In this study the investigators aim to
      compare these modalities both for self-reported data (pain, physical function) and objective
      measurement data (femoral cartilage thickness via ultrasonography). Patients with unilateral
      osteoarthritis/unilateral complaint will be included in the study. Unaffected side will be
      controls for each group.
