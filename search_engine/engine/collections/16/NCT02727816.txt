      comparing different hydrogel lens materials. For each study, this study will involve 2
      visits: lens dispensing (baseline) and 1 hour post lens settling. Each subject will be
      randomized to wear the test and control lenses, in the right or left eye, in a series of four
      short fitting comparisons as follows:

      Pair 1 (P1): filcon IV I (Base Curve (BC) 8.6) and ocufilcon D

      Pair 2 (P2): filcon IV I (Base Curve (BC) 8.7) and ocufilcon D

      Pair 3 (P3): methafilcon A (Base Curve (BC) 8.6) and ocufilcon D

      Pair 4 (P4): methafilcon A (Base Curve (BC)8.7) and somofilcon A
