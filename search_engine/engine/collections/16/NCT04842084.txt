      TGA using Calibrated Automated Thrombography method, enables the quantification of thrombin
      concentrations in platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and in platelet-poor plasma (PPP). The thrombin
      generation (TG) profile varies from patient to patient and depends on the activity of the pro
      and anti-coagulant factors. The TGA values depend on the analytical conditions such as Tissue
      Factor (TF) concentration and the plasma analyzed (PRP or PPP). According to the clinical
      context, different TF concentrations (1, 5 and 10 pM) can be used to trigger the coagulation
      cascade.

      As a consequence, the reference values vary with the analytical conditions but also with the
      studied population (men or women). The reference values are not provided by the manufacturer
      and each laboratory has to establish the normal values according to the analytical conditions
      chosen for the pathology explored (hemorrhagic or thrombotic). Moreover, in PPP, the TG
      results can be different according to batch reagents. That is the reason why plasma will be
      frozen for a new determination in case of deviation of the result of the control plasma.

      The aim of the study is to determine the normal values of TG in fresh PRP and in PPP with
      different TF concentrations.
