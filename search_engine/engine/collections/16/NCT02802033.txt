    
      The registry is designed to be open-ended. However, a statistical evaluation of the content
      und structure of database and CRFs in order to investigate the feasibility and quality of
      data collection is planned to take place prior to the registry expansion.

      Variables applicable to patients with a degenerative spine disorder which will be collected
      in the registry include:

        -  Patient details

        -  Symptoms

        -  Diagnosis

        -  Imaging assessment

        -  Treatment details

      Feasibility phase:

      The statistical evaluation of the feasibility and quality of data collection will be
      performed after the first 5 sites have each enrolled 12 patients with a degenerative
      pathology and documented one follow-up visit. During this evaluation, enrolment of further
      patients can be continued.

      Based on the findings of this feasibility phase, adjustments to the existing database can be
      performed before the registry is rolled out on larger scale.

      Registry expansion:

      Following the evaluation process of the feasibility phase, the registry will be expanded to
      allow data entry in more sites globally. Multi-site participation of this registry will be
      rolled-out in stages, and will be offered to sites with appropriate expertise which are
      selected based on their potential (interest, resources and expected patient volume).
