      health-related fitness, body compositions, blood biochemistry, blood biomarker, balance,
      quality of life, and musculoskeletal ultrasonography and to evaluate the association between
      fitness parameters and disease incidence with these data. We expect to recruit 1200 adults
      who attend the annual health check-up in National Taiwan University, BeiHu Branch in 2016 and
      2017 and to train 60 individuals having sarcopenia with strengthening exercise. This study
      will establish the urban elderly cohort, measure both physical and functional parameters,
      find the risk factors for aging, and validate the role of strength training for those
      sarcopenia patients. We hope this study will be widely cited in related fields in the future.
