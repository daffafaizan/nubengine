      lessening patient's discomfort. Although fasting is a basic requirement for avoiding
      pulmonary aspiration, it is sometimes associated with patient discomfort and hypoglycemia.
      According to the current guidelines for preoperative fasting of children, fasting is required
      for 2-hours, 4-hours, and 6-hours period after ingestion of water, breast milk, and infant
      formula respectively. Limited data is available for the effect of patient positioning on
      gastric emptying. A previous study had reported that gastric emptying of non-nutrient liquids
      was faster in the sitting position compared with the left lateral position . Another study
      showed similar findings after nutritive liquid and solid meals; whilst, a third study had
      reported that gravity has a little effect on gastric emptying.

      In pediatric population the effect of posture on the duration of gastric emptying is not well
      investigated.

      Gastric ultrasound is a valid, accurate, reproducible, non-invasive, bedside test for
      evaluation of the gastric volume. gastric ultrasound has been validated in adults as well as
      children for estimating the volume of gastric contents and evaluating gastric emptying.

      The aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of semi sitting versus supine positions on
      gastric emptying of fluids in children using gastric ultrasound.
