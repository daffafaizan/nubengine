      I. Determine the efficacy of sorafenib, in terms of anti-tumor effects and proportion of
      clinical responses, in patients with previously untreated unresectable stage III or stage IV
      melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Correlate the efficacy of this drug with the presence of mutant or wild-type BRAF gene in
      tumors of these patients.

      II. Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. III. Correlate serum
      cryptic collagen epitopes with the extent of tumor burden, invasion, and metastasis in
      patients treated with this drug.

      IV. Determine the potential of serum cryptic collagen epitopes to serve as a surrogate marker
      for monitoring the course of disease in patients treated with this drug.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to presence of BRAF
      gene mutation in tumor sample (yes vs no).

      Patients receive oral sorafenib twice daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26-74 patients (13-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this
      study within 5.2-18.5 months.
