      disorder without psychotic features by DSM-5 will be recruited. Subjects will be accepted
      into the protocol after an opportunity to review and provide voluntary written informed
      consent and completion of a comprehensive medical and psychiatric history, physical
      examination, mental status examination, and routine laboratory assessments. Patients will be
      recruited in outpatient settings to the Refractory Depression Clinic. Providers or Refractory
      Depression consult team will be informed if the patient may be eligible for participation in
      the ketamine protocol. Subjects must have established care in the VA Connecticut Healthcare
      System. If the Veteran is interested, a screening visit for further evaluation for the
      ketamine protocol will be scheduled. Veterans will receive up to 6 infusions for ketamine
      weekly, per PI discretion. The primary goal of this proposal is to test the effectiveness of
      repeated ketamine treatment (0.5 mg/kg; once or twice a week for up to 6 weeks; up to a total
      of 6 ketamine infusions). An open-label trial will be conducted that will include up to 25
      Veterans with MDD with a follow-up of 6 months. This open-label trial will allow us to
      examine the safety and tolerability of the ketamine treatment in this population and the
      long-term effects. All patients will receive usual standard care during this trial.
