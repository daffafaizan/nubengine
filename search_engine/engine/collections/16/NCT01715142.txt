      cytotoxics delivery to the epithelial tumoral compartment. There is thus a rationale for
      combining chemotherapy and antistromal drugs like nab-paclitaxel (Abraxane), a solvent
      (CremophorÂ® EL)-free, albumin-bound form of paclitaxel that has been initially developed to
      reduce the toxicities associated with Taxol injection while maintaining or improving its
      chemotherapeutic effect. This unique protein formulation provides a novel approach of
      increasing intra-tumoral concentrations of the drug by a receptor-mediated transport process
      allowing transcytosis across the endothelial cell.

      Abraxane has been approved for commercialization in 38 countries, including the US, Canada,
      the EU, Australia, China, India and Korea for the treatment of women with metastatic breast
      cancer. Abraxane alone and in combination is being evaluated in a number of cancers,
      including metastatic melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer and other solid
      tumors.
