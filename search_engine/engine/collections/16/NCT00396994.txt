      are limited to pharmacologic interventions, the majority of which are antiresorptive.
      Preliminary data demonstrate that high frequency, low magnitude mechanical stimulation (LMMS)
      can preserve bone mineral density (BMD) by preventing bone resorption due to disuse and
      aging, and can stimulate new bone formation.

      To confirm and extend these observations, this study is a three-year, double-blind,
      randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of LMMS in 200 elderly women and men (60 years
      of age and older). A clinical center located in Boston, MA has recruited participants from
      multiple independent living facilities in close geographic proximity. Participants meeting
      the inclusion/exclusion criteria have been randomized to either brief daily exposure to LMMS
      on a vibrating platform or a placebo platform over a three year period. All participants
      receive 1000 mg of elemental calcium and 800 IU of vitamin D per day.

      This study will provide new and important information about the role of low magnitude high
      frequency mechanical stimulation on the skeleton.
