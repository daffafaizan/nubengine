      mortality, and is associated with risky sexual behavior and injection drug use (IDU), two
      major forms of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) transmission in
      urban and suburban United States. Through these high-risk behaviors, persons with opioid use
      disorder (OUD) develop both direct comorbidities (e.g. blood stream infections and infectious
      endocarditis), as well as risk-associated illnesses (e.g. sexually transmitted infections,
      HCV and hepatitis B virus [HBV]) which have considerable downstream health care effects. As
      such, there is a need for pharmacologic agents in the treatment of OUD that go beyond
      avoidance of withdrawal and facilitate decreased frequency or complete cessation of opioid
      use.

      The biologic mechanism of OUD, common to all forms of addiction, is a conditioned drug
      cue-related response in the CNS, causing a dopamine surge. If effective, a central
      pharmacologic strategy targeting the aberrant reward circuitry seen in OUD could potentially
      reduce drug craving and result in opioid abstinence.

      In the SEARCH Pharmacokinetic (PK) investigation, we aim to understand the pharmacokinetic
      signal of the novel, oral agent ANS-6637, an aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 (ALDH-2) inhibitor that
      has the potential to reduce dopamine surge in the CNS and inhibit opioid craving. In
      preclinical studies, the active metabolite of ANS-6637, GS-548351, showed substrate dependent
      inhibition of CYP3A in vitro, with little or no inhibitory effect on the activities of other
      cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. As such, the current investigation seeks to explore the
      potential inhibition of CYP3A by ANS-6637 with the FDA-recommended CYP3A probe substrate,
      midazolam.
