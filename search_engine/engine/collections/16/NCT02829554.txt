      unrelated to the decision) emotions influence cancer-related decision making, no research has
      systematically examined whether these two types of emotion generate similar patterns of
      influence, as predicted by decision-making models. This is important because incidental
      emotions are often used experimentally to draw causal conclusions about how emotions
      influence cancer-related decisions with the notion that results will generalize to produce
      knowledge about integral emotions as well. Across three studies, we plan to directly compare
      integral and incidental emotional influences on judgments and decisions related to cancer
      control. We plan to examine whether effects are contingent on the type of emotional influence
      (the discrete emotions anger and fear, or general positive affect) or type of emotion
      induction (video, autobiographical induction, or evaluative conditioning). Across
      experiments, we predict that emotion will influence both judgment and decision-making
      outcomes when the induced emotion is integral as well as when it is incidental. However, we
      predict that the magnitude of the effect of emotion on these types of responses will be
      significantly greater when emotions are integral to a judgment or decision, compared to when
      emotions are incidental.
