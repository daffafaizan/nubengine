    
      Part A was an open-label, multiple ascending dose patient study of necuparanib given first as
      a single dose and then daily in combination with the nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine regimen.
      It was conducted to evaluate the safety and tolerability of necuparanib alone and in
      combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine and to recommend a necuparanib dose regimen
      for subsequent evaluation in Part B. Part B is a randomized, double-blind study investigating
      the antitumor activity of necuparanib in combination with nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine
      compared with nab-paclitaxel, gemcitabine, and placebo. In both Parts A and B, a treatment
      period consists of one 28-day cycle. The Study Patient and Investigator can decide to
      continue with additional 28-day cycles according to the patient's status at the end of each
      28-day cycle. Part A has completed enrollment and Part B is currently open.

      Part A - Primary Objectives:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of necuparanib in combination with
           nab-paclitaxel and gemcitabine.

        -  To determine the dose of necuparanib to be carried forward into Part B.

      Part B - Primary Objective:

      To evaluate overall survival in patients treated with necuparanib + nab-paclitaxel +
      gemcitabine compared with placebo + nab-paclitaxel + gemcitabine.
