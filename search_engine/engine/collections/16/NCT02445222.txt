    
      Patients are enrolled following completion or early discontinuation from a Novartis sponsored
      or supported study of CAR T-Cell treatment. Patients will be followed for 15 years post
      treatment from the last treatment. They will be monitored for safety and efficacy within the
      primary treatment protocols for the protocol defined duration. Patients can drop off
      treatment protocols at any time to enter this long term Follow up study. Patients
      discontinuing from the primary treatment protocols for any reason will be enrolled in this
      long term follow up (LTFU). This will allow collecting data on long term safety and efficacy
      (as applicable) as mandated by the health authorities of all patients treated with CAR-T
      therapy within the concept of a single protocol.

      Collection of such long term effects of CAR-T cell therapy will help to further define the
      risk-benefit profile of CAR-T Therapies.
