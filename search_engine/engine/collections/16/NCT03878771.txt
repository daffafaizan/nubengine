      due to auto-immune diseases is a major concern by the dentists through all the world. Topical
      corticosteroids, analgesics, Laser bio modulation all have been proposed as treatments with
      limited efficacy in many cases. There are few number of clinical trials on Plasma preparation
      in management of oral mucositis and oral ulcers. Platelet rich fibrin (PRF) is one of the
      platelet concentrates. The preparation protocol of PRF is simple and easy, could be prepared
      autologous and immediately placed on the oral ulcers and mucositis.

      Subjects and Methods: A non Randomized clinical trial will be conducted. Ten patients with
      different resistant oral ulcers and mucositis were enrolled. all with grade 4 WHO mucositis
      score. The initial numerical ratting score of pain is 10. For all patients 20 ml blood sample
      will obtained in plain blood vacutainer, centrifuged for 15 minutes on 3000 rpm. The
      resultant gel, obtained and squeezed to prepare a membrane, the membrane will be mixed with
      orabase and placed over the oral ulcers and mucositis over a piece of gauze. The patients
      will be instructed not to eat or drink for 2 hours after application. The remaining serum
      after squeezing was mixed with equal amount of orabase and used topically on the oral
      mucositis and ulcers.

      Clobetasol Propionate 0.05% in orabase will be applied to 10 control patients 3 times per day
      for one week.

      The steps will be repeated after one week if the patients' symptomatic scores for WHO and
      numerical rating score were not zero.
