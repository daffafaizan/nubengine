      activity limitation in people under 45 years of age. It has got a high recurrence, which
      decreases the activities of daily life, facilitates the focus of attention to pain and
      increases the fear of movement, with the consequent muscular atrophy. A serie cases will be
      conducted comparing a a table of exercises versus electropuncture.

      Objective: Evaluate the effectiveness that exists when performing a tratment based on a table
      of exercises for strengthening the lumbar muscles versus a treatment based on
      electropuncture.

      Methods: A sample of 12 subjects with chronic low back pain will be assigned to an exercise
      program or dry electropuncture treatment (EPS), during 4 weeks (2 sessions/week). The
      measurement variables selected for the study were the followings: Straight Leg Raise,
      Vasalva, Gaesslen test, algometry (pressure pain threshold), goniometry (measurement of the
      range of motion), Scale of disability for low back pain of Oswestry, Beck's Depression
      Inventory (BDI), Visual Analogue Scale (EVA), Mcquade's Test and the Roland-Morrys'
      Questionnaire, developing a pre-treatment and post-treatment assessment.
