    
      A prospective, randomized clinical trial was performed on 28 patients (22 females, 6 males)
      with an average age of 65 years (range, 53 to 77) undergoing complete arthroscopic repair of
      a massive rotator cuff tear. In 14 patients, after the repair was completed, 6 cc. of PRF
      (vivostat Â®) were locally applied to the repair site. In 14 patients no addition of PRF was
      performed. All patients underwent an arthro-MRI to evaluate the integrity of the repair and a
      clinical exam one year after the operation. All patients were then followed clinically at a
      minimum of 2 years. Functional outcome was evaluated with the Constant and DASH scores.
