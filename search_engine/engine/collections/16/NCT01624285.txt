      I. Two-year recurrence free survival (RFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. One-year recurrence free survival. II. Overall survival (OS). III. Safety. IV. Impact of
      drug-drug interactions (i.e. immunosuppression agents). V. Impact of biomarkers
      (alpha-fetoprotein [AFP], protein-induced by vitamin K absence or antagonist II [PIVKA II]).

      VI. Effects of therapy on wound healing. VII. Impact of hepatitis C viral recurrence.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate orally (PO) twice daily (BID).

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID.

      In both arms treatment continues for 24 months in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years.
