      a Standard Dose group or to Escalating Dose indomethacin group after obtaining parental
      consent. The infants randomized to the standard dose group will receive indomethacin (0.1
      mg/kg) at 24 hr intervals for 5 days. Escalating Dose group infants will receive indomethacin
      (0.2 mg/kg/dose) at 12 hr intervals for 2 doses, followed by indomethacin (0.3 mg/kg/dose) at
      12 hr interval for 2 doses, then Indomethacin (0.4 mg/kg/dose) at 12 hr interval for 2 doses,
      increased to indomethacin (0.5 mg/kg/dose) at 12 hour interval for 2 doses and finally
      indomethacin 0.6 mg/kg/dose at 12 hourly interval for 2 doses. To keep the study blinded, the
      standard group will receive 5 extra doses of normal saline infusion of similar volume at 12
      hrly intervals between the indomethacin schedules to match the Escalating dose Indomethacin
      Schedule. Daily Echo will be performed and if the Echo showed closure of PDA after 3 days of
      assigned treatment, no further indomethacin will be given in both the groups.
