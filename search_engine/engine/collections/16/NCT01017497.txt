      in combination with whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) for the treatment of brain metastases. To
      establish a target for SRS, the gross tumor volume (GTV) is typically defined as the
      contrast-enhancing volume on T1-weighted axial MRI images. In turn, the volume chosen for
      treatment (the planning target volume or PTV) is generated by expanding the GTV to account
      for microscopic extension of tumor beyond the MRI-visualized volume and deviations in patient
      positioning at the time of treatment., However, the optimal PTV in patients undergoing SRS of
      brain metastases has not been established.

      This pilot randomized study of approximately 49 patients (representing a total of 80 brain
      lesions) should be sufficient to explore the effect of margin expansion around the GTV for
      brain metastases. The patients enrolled in this study will undergo radiosurgery to a planning
      treatment volume generated by expanding the GTV of each lesion by either a 1mm or 3mm margin.
      Each lesion, not each patient, will be randomized to receive either the 1mm or 3mm margin
      with 40 lesions randomized to each arm (a patient with multiple lesions potentially could
      have a lesion randomized to the 1mm arm and a different lesion randomized to the 3mm arm).
      The primary outcome of 12-month local recurrence and the secondary outcome of the rate of
      radionecrosis at the SRS treatment site will be lesion-specific outcomes. All other secondary
      outcomes will be patient-specific outcomes.
