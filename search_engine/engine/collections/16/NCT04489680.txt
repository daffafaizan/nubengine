      the surgery and centralization of cleft care. Simulations allow trainees to learn complex
      surgical skills whilst ensuring patient safety. Existing cleft surgical simulators are
      over-simplified or prohibitively expensive. We developed and tested a high-fidelity yet
      cost-effective simulator for cleft palate repair.

      Methods: Skeletal elements were obtained through high-resolution scanning of a pathologic
      specimen, 3D printed and then molded in plastic. Soft tissue components were formed through
      molding layers of silicone. 26 UK specialty trainees performed a vomerine mucosal flap and
      intra-velar veloplasty in a one-hour workshop. Pre- and post-simulation questionnaires
      assessing cleft knowledge and surgical confidence were compared for statistical significance.
