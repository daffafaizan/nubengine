      and sign consent forms, then divided into 3 groups. Doctors collect the basic information of
      patient. All patients receive laboratory and image examination as baseline. Then, they will
      give cell treatment based on the clinical protocol. Doctors have follow-up visit on 2 weeks,
      1, 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after treatment, and do safety and efficacy evaluation.

      Safety evaluation. Researcher collect all examination data of patients and compare with each
      groups. The safety tests including blood routine, urine routine, hepatorenal function, C
      reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and tumor marker, etc.

      Efficacy evaluation. Based on Lysholm, the international knee documentation committee (IKDC)
      knee evaluation form, and Visual Analogue Scale/Score (VAS) to examine the change/improvement
      of knee joint function. By Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examination, grade patients with
      Kellgren-Lawrence Grading Scale, Assessment of Preoperative Cartilage Defect Severity
      (AMADEUS), and observe the change/improvement of patient.
