      spasticity (tightness of the muscle) in the calf muscles. First, investigators will decrease
      spasticity in an innovative way through dry needling. Second, investigators will follow this
      spasticity reduction technique using external electrical stimulation applied to the calf,
      while the participant walks on a harnessed treadmill (for safety). The investigators believe
      modulating tone in the calf with dry needling will allow for improved strength with
      electrical stimulation, while simultaneously improving the efficiency of the muscles during
      walking. The investigators hypothesize that decreasing spasticity will result in enhanced
      gait efficiency, and lower fatigue, all while allowing the participant to meet their personal
      mobility goals.10 The investigators are proposing an innovative study design. Assessing
      changes in muscle spasticity using electromyography and the Modified Ashworth scale before
      and after each portion of our two-pronged intervention will enable them to understand the
      immediate effects of dry needling, as well as the combined effects of function electrical
      stimulation with with treadmill training. Following the intervention assessments with
      pre-post functional tests will allow us to determine long term changes. This proposal offers
      a unique approach to management of spasticity in people with Multiple Sclerosis (MS), with
      the advantage of being minimally invasive and inexpensive. Results of this pilot study will
      inform the potential use in MS, and will allow for a larger study examining optimal
      intervention parameters for future use.
