      1/1/2003 through 6/30/2009). Date of first FSC or ACs (tiotropium; ipratropium alone or in
      combination with albuterol) was defined as the index date. Managed care enrollees (aged >40
      years) having at least one medical claim with a primary diagnosis of COPD (ICD code 491.xx,
      492.xx and 496.xx) and a diagnosis of depression (at least one claim with depression/anxiety
      or at least one prescription claim for depression/anxiety) in one-year pre-index and within
      60-days post-index were defined in the comorbid population. Patients were continuously
      eligible throughout the one-year pre and post-index periods. Negative binomial models were
      used to analyze number of COPD-related events [hospitalization (IP), emergency department
      (ED), office visits with oral steroid and/or antibiotic prescription within 5 days (OV+Rx)]
      and logistic regression was used to examine risk of COPD events between the two cohorts.
      COPD-related costs were compared between the two cohorts using - generalized linear model
      with log-link/gamma distribution after adjusting for baseline differences.

      Specifically the study hypothesis for the primary outcome being tested was:

      Ho: There is no difference in risk of any COPD-related exacerbation between FSC and AC
      cohorts Ha: There is a difference in risk of any COPD-related exacerbation between FSC and AC
      cohorts

      Hypothesis for the key secondary outcome of COPD-related costs that was tested was:

      Ho: There is no difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and AC cohorts Ha: There is a
      difference in COPD-related costs between FSC and AC cohorts
