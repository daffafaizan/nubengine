      demonstrates efficacy in: 1) reducing symptoms of psychological distress (e.g., anxiety,
      depression, worry, rumination); 2) improving outcomes specific to the ERT mechanism-based
      model (e.g., attentional control, decentering, reappraisal); 3) improving quality of life and
      functioning, for adults aged 18-65 years old.
