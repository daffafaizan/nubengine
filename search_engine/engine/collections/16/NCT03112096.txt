      positron emission computed tomography. Ten cognitively healthy subjects and 10 patients with
      Alzheimer's Disease will be enrolled. The primary outcome measures are to evaluate
      pharmacokinetics of [18F]THK-5351 Positron Emission Tomography imaging . Tracer
      biodistribution will be evaluated by global and regional standardized uptake value ratio of
      [18F]THK-5351 in the brain. Safety. For safety assessment, a physical examination,
      Electrocardiogram and vital signs will be performed at baseline and at the completion of all
      imaging to assess for interval change.
