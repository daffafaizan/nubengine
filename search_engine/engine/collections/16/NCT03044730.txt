      I. To evaluate the median progression-free survival (median PFS) for participants receiving
      pembrolizumab with capecitabine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic triple
      negative breast cancer (TNBC) and hormone-refractory metastatic breast cancer (MBC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the objective response rate (ORR) for participants receiving pembrolizumab
      with capecitabine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic TNBC and
      hormone-refractory MBC.

      II. To describe the safety and tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab and
      capecitabine for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic TNBC and hormone-refractory
      MBC.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Analysis of expression of programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) through
      immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis.

      II. To assess circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). III. To evaluate ORR and median-PFS using
      immune-related Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (irRECIST).

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1 and capecitabine orally (PO) twice
      daily (BID) on days 1-14. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for up to 2
      years.
