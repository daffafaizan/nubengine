      short- and long-term weight loss in adolescents. The investigators plan to establish whether
      weight loss translates into a change in obesity-related biomarkers associated with adolescent
      obesity. Each participant with an activity tracking device will have the goal of reaching
      10,000 steps per day, in addition to their individual fitness plan.
