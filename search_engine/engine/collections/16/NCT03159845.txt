      are enrolled at the moment of stem cell collection. They are randomized 1:1 in two groups at
      the moment of the graft. Patients of the Control group take only standard antimicrobial
      prophylaxis after SCT; the Sample group takes in addition a daily oral supplementation of
      Zinc Sulfate (600 mg/die) from day +5 until day +100 after SCT. The aim of the study is to
      investigate the immune reconstitution in presence of Zinc, focused on thymic reconstitution.
      Laboratory tests are performed on peripheral blood samples, collected at 4 time-points: two
      before transplant (at the moment of the enrollment and the day before conditioning) and two
      after transplant (day +30 and +100).
