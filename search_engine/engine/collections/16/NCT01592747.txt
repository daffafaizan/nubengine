      withdrawal study in pediatric outpatients with autism, Asperger's Disorder, or Pervasive
      Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS). Patients who completed at least 12
      weeks of study drug exposure and met protocol specified responder criterion in lead in Study
      MEM-MD-91 (NCT01592786) at two consecutive visits separated by at least two weeks were
      eligible to transition to this study. The responder criterion was defined as having at least
      a 10 point improvement (reduction in score) in the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) total
      raw score relative to the Visit 1 total raw score in Study MEM-MD-91.

      Weight based dose limits were selected in this study to ensure that exposure in terms of area
      under the curve (AUC) was less than the predefined limit of 2100 ng·h/mL which represents a
      10-fold lower exposure than observed at the NOAEL(No observed adverse effect level) of 15
      mg/kg/day in juvenile rats.

      The weight-based dose limits in this study were as follows:

        -  Group A: ≥ 60 kg; maximum 15 mg/day

        -  Group B: 40-59 kg; maximum 9 mg/day

        -  Group C: 20-39 kg; maximum 6 mg/day

        -  Group D: < 20 kg; maximum 3 mg/day
