    
      Study Design The CLEVER-TAVR cohort (Cerebral Lesion and Neurocognitive Status Changes after
      Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement) is a multicenter prospective observational study.
      Patients with aortic stenosis who successfully undergo TAVR procedure from January 2021 to
      December 2021 will be enrolled in this study according to the inclusion criteria.
      Preoperative cognitive function, DW-MRI evaluation and baseline data will be recorded. All
      patients should be followed up for 1 year, including telephone follow-up once a month to
      record the main end-point events, and clinic follow-up at 30, 90, 180, 360 days after TAVR.
      Laboratory examination, electrocardiogram, color Doppler ultrasound and other examinations
      will be collected and recorded. The changes of cognitive function and brain imaging (DW-MRI)
      will be evaluated before discharge(7 days), 30, 90, 180, 360 days after procedure. The
      primary endpoint will be major adverse cardiovascular and cerebral events(MACCE), including
      all-cause death, stroke, acute kidney injury, myocardial infarction, bleeding complications,
      vascular complications, permanent pacemaker implantation, conduction block and arrhythmia,
      valve related complications. The postoperative valve function, life quality and other
      complications related to TAVR will also be recorded.
