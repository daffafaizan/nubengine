    
      Prospective, non-randomized, post market clinical evaluation of the VISITAG SURPOINT™ Module
      with External Processing Unit (EPU) when used with STSF catheter and ST catheter compared to
      an historical control performance goal.

      A maximum of 330 subjects will be enrolled across up to 45 sites. Two hundred eighty (280)
      enrolled subjects will be treated using the STSF catheter with EPU and 50 subjects will be
      treated using the ST catheter with EPU. Prior to enrollment, a few sites will be selected to
      only enroll subjects who will be treated with the ST catheter and the remaining sites will
      only enroll subjects who will be treated with the STSF catheter.

      Bayesian adaptive design will be used to assess early success at up to two interims: one
      after all subjects have completed the 3- month follow-up assessment, and a second to occur
      after all subjects have completed the 6 months follow-up visit.

      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to demonstrate the safety and
      12-month effectiveness of Tag Index-guided ablation using the VISITAG SURPOINT™ Module with
      External Processing Unit when used with the THERMOCOOL SMARTTOUCH® SF (STSF) and THERMOCOOL
      SMARTTOUCH® (ST) catheters for pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) in the treatment of subjects
      with drug refractory symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Specifically:

        -  To demonstrate the safety based on the proportion of subjects with early-onset (within 7
           days of ablation procedure) primary adverse events

        -  To demonstrate the 12-month effectiveness based on the proportion of subject with
           freedom from documented atrial arrhythmia (atrial fibrillation (AF), atrial tachycardia
           (AT) or atrial flutter (AFL) episodes during the effectiveness evaluation period (Day
           91-365)
