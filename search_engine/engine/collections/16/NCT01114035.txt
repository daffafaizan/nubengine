    
      The objectives of this PHRC are:

        -  the phenotypic analysis of the intestinal epithelial dysplasia by clinical and
           histo-pathological investigations.

        -  the identification of proteins involved at the intestinal level in the differentiation,
           the proliferation and the membership of the epithelial cells

        -  from the phenotypic study, a genetic analysis of type maps by homozygote on the whole
           genome partner in an approach guided by possible candidate genes

        -  the study of the genes, chosen according to their location, to their profile of
           expression, and to their function in touch with the pathogenic hypotheses
