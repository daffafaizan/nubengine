      shortly after birth and grow rapidly in the following weeks and months. The proliferative
      phase involves a rapidly dividing endothelial cell proliferation. The tumors generally
      stabilize and then involute over time. They are usually clinically insignificant; however, a
      small percentage of them can be life threatening secondary to location, associated syndrome,
      and physical findings such as ulceration. Treatment options have included steroids,
      interferon, vincristine and more recently propranolol. There are few published prospective
      research studies on the effectiveness of these treatment options. Because of several factors,
      it has been difficult to objectively measure response of these lesions. The purpose is to
      determine (1) whether multiple quantitative skin imaging modalities can quantitatively
      describe the clinically relevant features of infantile hemangiomas, including color (red,
      blue), lightness, size (height, volume), biomechanical properties, temperature and perfusion
      and (2) the natural ontogeny and response to treatment over time. The treatments are oral
      propranolol, topical timolol and untreated (observation).
