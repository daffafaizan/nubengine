      treatment, crossover, relative bioavailability study of ATI-1501 under fasting and fed
      conditions in healthy adult subjects. The purpose of this study is to determine the relative
      bioavailability of ATI-1501 oral suspension to the comparator drug, FlagylÂ®. The study also
      aims to evaluate the safety and characterize the PK profile of ATI-1501 oral suspension in
      healthy adults. The PK of ATI-1501 oral suspension in a population of subjects with no
      concomitant illnesses will be recorded and analyzed. Blood samples will be collected through
      individual venipuncture or an indwelling catheter at pre-described time intervals throughout
      the study to determine the bioavailability of ATI-1501 oral suspension and characterize its
      overall PK profile. In addition, blood samples will also be collected using a microsampling
      device to validate the use of blood microsampling for future studies. Subjects will be
      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment sequences and each group of subjects will undergo 4 periods of
      treatment. Each subject will receive each treatment regimen in this crossover study design,
      allowing for a 7-day washout period. The study drugs will be administered under fasting and
      fed conditions to evaluate the effects of food on the absorption of metronidazole,
      administered in the ATI-1501 oral suspension. The palatability of ATI-1501 will be assessed
      using the 9-point scale to assess the taste, texture, and smell of the 2 study drugs. A
      3-point scale will be used to evaluate the degree of bitterness of the 2 study drugs
