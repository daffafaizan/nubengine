      early acute kidney injury may reduce severe AKI as the disease progresses. Urine
      alkalinisation to prevent binding of SARS-COV-2 to renal tubular epithelial cells is a novel
      concept that could be used to design other therapies to reduce viral binding. Showing
      feasibility with this safe and available strategy could be the first step toward other
      related efforts.
