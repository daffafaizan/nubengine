      primary total knee replacement (TKR) in a consecutive series of patients who meet the
      eligibility criteria. Forty-eight cases enrolled will receive the Triathlon速 Cruciate
      Retaining Total Knee System (Triathlon速 CR) in a procedure using patient-specific cutting
      guides to reproduce the natural kinematic alignment of the knee. Another forty-eight cases
      enrolled will receive the Triathlon速 CR device in a procedure using patient-specific cutting
      guides modified to provide neutral overall limb alignment of the knee. And the last
      forty-eight cases will receive the Triathlon速 CR device in a procedure using traditional
      instrumentation intended to achieve a neutral overall limb alignment.
