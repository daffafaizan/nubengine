      ie, a case of osteonecrosis which occurred in relation to an anti-NGF compound of another
      company. All indications with the exception of Cancer Pain are affected resulting in
      termination of all studies in respective indications. Recruitment of Study A4091044 was
      stopped effective 27 Dec 2010. Two patients recruited so far did not receive further doses
      and were followed up for safety until LSLV on 22 Mar 2011.
