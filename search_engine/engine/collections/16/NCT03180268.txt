      I. To determine, in terms of progression-free survival (PFS), the extent of clinical benefit
      of the addition of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) to gross total resection (GTR) for patients
      with newly diagnosed World Health Organization (WHO) grade II meningioma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Overall survival (OS). II. Disease-specific survival (DSS). III. Toxicity (grade 3+,
      exclusive of expected alopecia). IV. Neurocognitive function (NCF). V. Outcomes and patient
      reported outcomes (PRO) measurements. VI. Adherence to protocol-specific target and normal
      tissue parameters. VII. Concordance measurements of central versus parent-institution
      pathology. VIII. Tissue microarray construction, and assessment of pHH3 mitotic index and
      molecular correlates to OS.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms after undergoing gross total resection.

      ARM I: Patients undergo observation.

      ARM II: Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week over 6.5-7 weeks for a total of 33
      fractions (59.4 Gy in 33 daily fractions of 1.8 Gy each).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 12 months, every 6
      months for year 2 and 3, then yearly for 10 years.
