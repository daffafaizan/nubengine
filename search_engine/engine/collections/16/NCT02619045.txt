      undergoing an intra venous chemotherapy. Patients with a solid tumor (200 patients in total),
      starting a first cycle of intravenous chemotherapy with 21 days cycle will be included in
      this study. Patients will be followed all over the chemotherapy period through regular and
      defined telephone appointments carried out by a dedicated nurse. During phone call, a
      specific questionnaire will be used in order to retrieve data regarding patients toxicities,
      general care, quality of life, ...Actions taken following each phone call will also be
      documented (consultation, hospitalization, prescription,...). The main objective of this
      study is to evaluate the impact of this telephone follow-up program on the care of patients
      under chemotherapy treatment. In addition, a medico-economic analysis of this device compared
      with historical data from the national database SNIIRAM will be done.
