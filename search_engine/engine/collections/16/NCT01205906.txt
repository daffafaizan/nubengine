      life. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been shown to be effective in decreasing the
      impairment caused by tinnitus. One recent way delivering CBT is an internet-based self-help
      intervention. Internet interventions for patients with chronic tinnitus, developed by Swedish
      scientists, showed promising results (Andersson et al., 2002; Kaldo et al., 2007; Kaldo et
      al., 2008). The main purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of this internet-based
      self-help training for chronic tinnitus with a traditional well-established CBT group
      treatment and with a discussion forum group in a randomized controlled trial. Secondary goals
      are a process evaluation of both treatments, the identification of predictors of treatment
      success, an estimation of the cost-effectiveness of each treatment and the validation of the
      Tinnitus Cognitions Questionnaire (T-Cog; Hiller & Haerk√∂tter, 2005).
