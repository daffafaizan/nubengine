    
      Three different groups of spinal cord stimulation will be compared

        1. BASE - High Density Stimulation - Sham

        2. BASE - Conventional stimulation- HDS

        3. BASE - Sham - High Density Stimulation

      BASE consists of the baseline where no intervention of stimulation will occur. Sequentially,
      two phases will follow which will last 7 days per phase. The conventional stimulation is the
      stimulation that is generally used. The high density stimulation is the new spinal cord
      stimulation offering lots of advantages improving quality of life.

      The 3 different study designs will be compared against each other according to a
      questionnaire including pain, need for medication, sleep quality, quality of life,
      effectiveness.
