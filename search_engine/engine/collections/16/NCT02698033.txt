    
      The primary objective of the study is to identify and characterize a sub-population of
      high-threshold peanut allergic individuals and characterize their immunological phenotype in
      comparison with the low-threshold peanut allergic individuals enrolled in the adult PN OIT
      study (NCT01750879).

      Clinical Objective:

      To evaluate the clinical status of peanut-sensitized individuals previously passing a DBPCFC
      to 443 mg as being either: non-allergic, stably high-threshold allergic or more clinically
      reactive on repeat exposure.
