    
      Functional MR is a frequent outcome of ischemic heart disease or dilated cardiomyopathy.
      Patients with functional MR generally have normal valvular structures complicated by left
      ventricular dysfunction. Left ventricular dysfunction will often create geometric distortions
      that prevent complete leaflet coaptation, rendering the valve incompetent. Changes that will
      induce functional MR may include (i) dyskinetic or akinetic wall segments, (ii) dilation of
      the valve annulus or (iii) dilation of the left ventricle leading to tethering of the chordae
      tendinae.

      The iCoapsys Device is intended to treat patients with functional MR. The device is not
      indicated for patients with diseased or damaged valvular structures caused by rheumatic
      fever, degenerative diseases, endocarditis, infiltrative diseases or congenital disorders.
