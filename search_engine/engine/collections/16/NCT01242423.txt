    
      ESWT is administered as a one-off treatment on the wound surfaces within 24 hours of a 2nd
      degree burn trauma and immediately after an intraoperative skin graft excision procedure. A
      defocused sound head is orthogradely applied to the burn wound or the donor site. 100
      impulses/cm² is administered at 20 seconds per cm². The defocused sound head is placed on the
      wound along with a sterile gel (Lavaseptgel®, Octenidingel®) and a sterile protection foil.
      The shockwaves deployed are not at an energy density that is painful. This single application
      of ESWT is followed by routine dressing using Mepitel® in combination with
      Polyhexanid/Octenidin®.
