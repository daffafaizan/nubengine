      different from those who had a traumatic brain injury, this study aimed to measure the
      effects of hyperglycemia induced by stress or by diabetes on the outcomes of patients with
      thoracoabdominal injuries in comparison with those who had non-diabetic normoglycemia (NDN).
      The primary study hypothesis stated that, following thoracoabdominal injuries, the patients
      with SIH had a worse outcome than patients with DH. The primary outcome was mortality rate of
      these patients.
