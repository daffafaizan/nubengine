    
      We propose to complete a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of 201 subjects with medication
      treated diabetes and evidence of poor adherence to a statin medication (<70% medication
      possession ratio (MPR) determined through pharmacy records; no combination meds). Study
      subjects will use GlowCaps to store their statin medication.

      Arm 1 will receive weekly feedback containing general information about the subject's
      adherence (i.e., reminding the subject how many days that week he or she took the
      medication). Arm 2 will be provided the same weekly feedback and the information of whether
      his or her adherence is above or below the average adherence in their arm, along with a
      message of encouragement tailored to their place in the arm distribution. Subjects with
      perfect adherence will receive: "You took your pill every day for the last 7 days. Great job!
      Keep it up" with their weekly adherence report. Subjects with less than perfect adherence and
      adherence rate in the top 50% of the arm will receive: "You took your pill for ** days out of
      the last 7 days. Your medication adherence was as good or better than half of people in this
      study. Taking your pill every day would improve your health even more" with their weekly
      adherence report. Subjects with less than perfect adherence and adherence rate in the bottom
      50% of the arm will receive: "You took your pill for ** days out of the last 7 days. Your
      medication adherence was in the bottom half of the people in this study. If you took your
      pill more often, you could be in the top half of people in the study" with their weekly
      adherence report. Adherence records will be displayed on each subject's Way to Health (WTH)
      account in all arms. Arm 3 will be the usual care control.
