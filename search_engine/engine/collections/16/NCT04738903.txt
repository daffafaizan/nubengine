      in the form of a decrease in contrast sensitivity and night vision. This degradation of the
      visual quality is attributed to changes in the corneal asphericity that increase the high
      order aberrations (HOAs), such as spherical aberrations because it leads to shifting of the
      corneal asphericity towards the oblate shape.

      The wavefront-optimized (WFO) profile avoids the creation of new HOAs, but it is not able to
      treat those which are already present pre-operatively.

      The Q-adjusted treatments correct the sphero-cylindrical refractive errors and try to
      maintain the corneal asphericity at the same time, but like the WFO ablation profiles, it is
      limited to correcting the spherical aberrations and not the non-rotational symmetric HOAs.

      Some studies compared Lasers of two different platforms on contralateral eyes of the same
      patient in order to minimize inter-patient differences such as corneal wound healing and
      corneal biomechanics. By exclusion of these inter-patient differences, a more accurate
      judgment on the outcomes can be achieved.
