      occur worldwide with an incidence of about 8-12/1,000 live births , Most of these defects are
      mild or moderate. They either do not need treatment or treatment is needed only after
      infancy. Other defects are severe and require early treatment in infancy, which are the
      primary objectives of screening, because they are at risk of adverse or irreversible outcomes
      as a consequence of congenital heart defects. However, about half the neonates in the nursery
      have no distinctive clinical signs (symptoms, abnormal murmurs or cyanosis).So it's necessary
      to develop a screening strategy for neonatologist and pediatrician, especially physicians in
      community. Screening strategy in our study consists of 7 indicators: Family history of CHD,
      tachypnea, heart murmurs(≥ 2 grade), cyanosis, other non-cardiac malformations,special face
      feature（relating to chromosomal or non-chromosomal syndromes）, subnormal Pulse Oximetry
      reading (Oxygen saturation of less than 95% in either limb or more than 3% difference）。The
      newborn babies with any of these 7 indicators positive will be considered positive-screened
      and echocardiography will performed.

      The whole study (screening for CHDs with 7 indicators and performing the echocardiography for
      diagnosis) will be conducted by one single investigator (Quming Zhao from Children's Hospital
      of Fudan University). The new generation Pulse Oximetry has been proved to have low
      intraobserver and interobserver variability, but the interobserver variability in clinical
      evaluation (especially murmurs and cyanosis) remain unknown, the investigator will also
      assess the interobserver variability by comparing Quming Zhao and other two pediatricians
      (from the participating Hospital)(blind to each other).
