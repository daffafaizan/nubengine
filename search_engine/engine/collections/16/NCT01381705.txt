    
      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  Genotype the full cohort of samples available from the RESORT clinical trial
           (ECOG-E4402) for FCGR3A 158V/F in parallel to independently verify results.

        -  Correlate the FCGR3A 158V/F polymorphisms to response, response duration, and time to
           rituximab resistance.

      Secondary

        -  Quantify copy number variation in FCGR3A in this cohort.

      OUTLINE: Archived DNA samples isolate from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and from
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue samples are analyzed for FCGR3A 158V/F polymorphisms
      using different complementary genotyping methods. Assay results are reviewed and compared
      with patients' outcome data.
