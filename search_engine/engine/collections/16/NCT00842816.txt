      in the brain that include loss of cells and accumulation of abnormal protein deposits.
      Initial symptoms are cognitive, with deficiencies in short-term memory the most common
      symptom. As the disease progresses so does the severity of cognitive deficiency. Loss of
      speech and immobility occur in the terminal stages There is no cure for AD and no marketed
      treatment that modifies the underlying disease process. Available therapies improve some
      symptoms of AD by increasing brain concentrations of molecules involved in cognition. ST101
      differs from marketed therapies in that it has demonstrated two actions in animal research
      testing. It improves cognition and it also reduces the accumulation of abnormal protein
      deposits in the brain. These two properties suggest that ST101 may be a promising agent for
      the treatment of AD. This study is designed as a preliminary dose
      exploration/proof-ofÂ¬concept investigation of the ability of ST101 to improve cognition
      during 12 weeks of administration.
