      ~20% of hospital inpatients and consumes ~1% of the annual NHS budget. AKI occurs following a
      diverse range of insults, commonly ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) but also sepsis and
      drug toxicity. Therapies for AKI are currently supportive and short-term mortality remains
      high, with ~2 million deaths per year worldwide. In those who survive an episode of AKI, 30%
      are left with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The remaining 70% that recover full renal
      function are at ~28-fold increased risk of ultimately developing CKD. This risk is even
      greater in elderly patients. Importantly, CKD is strongly and independently associated with
      incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), and together these exert a global socioeconomic
      burden.

      The recognition that AKI and CKD are linked is recent and the molecular pathways that control
      the transition from acute injury to chronic disease are not well defined. Currently, there
      are no specific treatments that reduce the risk of progressing to CKD after AKI. Thus, there
      is an unmet need for therapies that will prevent the transition from AKI to CKD and reduce
      the cardiovascular burden associated with both. Our preliminary investigations (not yet
      published) in humans and mice suggest that AKI causes sustained activation of the endothelin
      (ET) system to the long-term detriment of renal and systemic haemodynamic function. These
      pilot data form the basis of our project that seeks to determine whether the ET system is
      active in patients with AKI and, thus, represents a potential target for therapeutic
      intervention.
