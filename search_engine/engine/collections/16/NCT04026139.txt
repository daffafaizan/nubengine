      together with knee OA. Intervention: Patients in the experimental and control group were
      instructed by clinical staff to perform home-based exercises and followed up through phone
      calls. The experimental group performed exercises using an elastic resistance band with 10
      repetitions/set × 5 sets/day × 3 days/week. The control group underwent active joint
      range-of-motion exercises and isometric contraction exercises. The intervention regimens
      lasted 12 weeks.
