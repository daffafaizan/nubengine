      clinical trial. IL-2 will be administered first as an induction course of IL-2 or placebo
      each day for 5 days, followed by a maintenance course at the same dose or placebo every two
      weeks over 6 months.

      The primary efficacy criteria will be the % change from baseline in Treg at day-5, which is
      indicative of the biological response to IL-2.

      The secondary efficacy criteria will be (i) the maintenance of regulatory T cells during the
      6 months of treatment with IL-2 vs. placebo and (ii) the stabilization or regression of the
      disease as determined by disease activity parameters assessed by MRI (cumulative number of
      new lesions in T1 enhanced by gadolinium after 6 months) in the groups treated with IL-2
      compared to placebo.

      Expected impact: MS-IL2 will define which patient respond to IL2 and which doses prevent
      relapses in RRMS. In addition, the deep phenomics studies will further provide the foundation
      for a clinical phase II to define clinical efficacy.
