      of life. Current therapies are lacking a progression of intensity based on clear criteria. In
      addition, therapies include rather analytical exercises and the transfer of the achieved
      functions to activities of daily living remains difficult. Therefore, the investigators
      developed a criterion based system, in which the investigators are matching interventions to
      specific neglect related deficits and behaviour. The investigators plan a randomised
      controlled trial (stage 2 "development of concept trial") to evaluate whether an Experimental
      Group with 20 Sessions of 30 minutes with a visual and tactile scanning training in the
      personal, peripersonal and extrapersonal space combined with trunk rotation or a Control
      Group with 20 Sessions of 30 minutes of a standard visual scanning programme results in
      larger improvements on the neglect behaviour during activities of daily life (Catherine
      Bergego Scale). Sixteen stroke patients with left side neglect (i.e. right brain lesions)
      will be recruited in an inpatient rehabilitations setting.
