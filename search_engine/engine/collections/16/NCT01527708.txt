      was used for the sake of the study.Three study groups were formed: 1) Normal 2) Keratoconus
      group (KC) included patients with progressive keratoconus and 3) Collagen-Cross-linking group
      (CXL) included keratoconus patients that had been treated with uneventful CXL at least on
      year prior to their enrollment in the study.

      Three consecutive scans were obtained by two experienced operators. The same procedure was
      repeated within two weeks for the assessment of intersession variability. In all cases
      acceptable maps had at least 10.0mm of corneal coverage. Keratometry (K), asphericity (Q),
      best-fit toric ellipsoid radius (Rs), eccentricity (ecc) and aberrometry (6.0mm pupil
      diameter), were analyzed. Furthermore we calculated and studied CRMS and CLRMS in order to
      better appreciate the visual significance of HOAs. Precision (Pre), repeatability (COR) and
      intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), were calculated for evaluating intrasession and
      intersession repeatability. Bland-Altman analysis was used for assessing interobserver
      repeatability.
