      for over 5 years and collected information on cardiovascular risk factors. Fasting blood
      samples and urine were collected and biomarkers of B-vitamins were measured and were related
      to renal function or to global cardiovascular risk. Global cardiovascular risk was calculated
      from established models that include Routine clinical and laboratory markers such as plasma
      lipids, smoking, hypertension, and BMI.

      we measured the following markers: Glucose (fasting plasma glucose); HbA1C; serum creatinine;
      Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urinary Albumin, C-reactive Protein, Soluble vascular cell
      adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), cystatin C, vitamin B1, vitamin B12, holotranscobalamin,
      methylmalonic acid, homocysteine, and different vitamin B6 forms.
