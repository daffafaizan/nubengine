      Prospective, multi-center, controlled, non blinded, randomized phase III Study

      Treatment:

      Patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer and progression after previous treatment
      with trastuzumab are being randomized to either:

      A. Capecitabine 2500 mg/m² orally day 1-14 q day 22 until progression * and discontinuation
      of Trastuzumab

      B. Capecitabine and Trastuzumab:

      Capecitabine 2500 mg/m² orally day 1-14 q day 22 until progression * Trastuzumab 6 mg/kg body
      weight every 3 weeks i.v. as a 90 min infusion until progression *

      Objectives:

      Primary objective:

      To compare the time to disease progression in patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast
      cancer and progression after previous treatment with trastuzumab randomized to capecitabine
      alone or in combination with trastuzumab.

      Secondary objectives:

      To compare the objective response rate between the two arms To compare the duration of
      response To compare the clinical benefit defined as CR, PR, or stable disease > 24 weeks
      between the two arms To evaluate the safety of the capecitabine + trastuzumab combination To
      compare overall survival between the two arms

      Tertiary objective:

      To determine the HER2 status in tissue collected directly before study entry
