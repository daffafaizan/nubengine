      phaeochromocytoma or paraganglioma, not amenable to surgical resection.

      Patients will receive vandetanib (an inhibitor of VEGF, EGFR and RET tyrosine kinase) in
      combination with standard radiation therapy Iodine-131 labelled Meta-iodobenzylguanidine
      (131I-mIBG).

      Vandetanib and 131I-mIBG will be given in 12-weekly cycles: 131I-miBG will be given on day 1
      of each cycle and vandetanib will started on day 1 of each cycle and continue to be taken
      once every day. The phase I trial aims to determine with recommended phase II dose of
      vandetanib (either 100, 200 or 300 mg once daily) - the dose of vandetanib that patients will
      receive will depend on the dose under investigation at the time of patient registration.

      The vandetanib dose will be determined by the Modified Continual Reassessment Method (mCRM) -
      a toxicity model which described the probability of a toxicity occurring at each dose level,
      which is based on clinical judgement and any available toxicity data.
