      of coffee and especially instant coffee cause gastrointestinal symptoms in healthy
      individuals. Up to now, few studies have investigated the relationship between coffee
      consumption, gastrointestinal symptoms and stress in healthy individuals with conflicting
      results.Coffee consumption is related with increased gastric acid and gastrin secretion,
      however it does not seem to affect stomach or stomach walls. Stress, which characterizes
      modern lifestyle, also is found to increase gastric acid and gastrin secretion and seems to
      be exclusively responsible for gastrointestinal symptoms.
