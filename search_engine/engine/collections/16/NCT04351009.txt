    
      All patients of colon cancer fulfilling the inclusion criteria and excluding the patients
      according to the exclusion criteria will undergo standard laparoscopic/open colectomy.

      Patients will undergo intra-operative on-table colonoscopy after induction of anesthesia.
      Indocyanine green dye is injected around the tumor and followed with near-infrared scope. All
      sentinel nodes will be marked with clips/sutures for identification by the pathologist
      post-operatively. Any aberrant lymph nodes identified outside the planned resection margins
      will be excised, marked with the position of excision and sent separately from the gross
      specimen. After this the surgeon will proceed with the surgery including vascular ligation
      and resection of mesocolon.

      After surgery, all the lymph nodes identified in the specimen including the tagged sentinel
      lymph nodes will be examined using standard Hematoxylin and eosin staining. If all the lymph
      nodes are negative for metastasis, the sentinel lymph nodes will undergo additional stepwise
      sections and immunohistochemistry for pancytokeratin.
