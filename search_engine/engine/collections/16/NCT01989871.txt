    
      Preterm infants born at <32 weeks of gestation at our institute will qualify for this study.
      Recruitment will occur between day 7-14 of life after sever brain malformations or
      intraventricular bleeding will be ruled out. Randomization to control or intervention will be
      via sealed envelopes. In the control group - infants will be treated according to the common
      practice in the neonatal intensive care unit. Transition to oral feeding will occur at 33
      wkks (breast feeding) and 34 wks (bottle feeding). Meals will be given every 3 hours, the
      amount will be written by the care giving physician and will be written as a strict number
      (i.e 30 ml every 3 hours) Parents in the intervention group will be taught be the nurses
      (NIDCAP trainees) to identify their infants' ques (self regulation or withdrawn as well as
      signs of hunger), This parents will be taught the physiology of maturation of feeding, as
      well as various techniques of infants feeding amongst them pace feeding. During the study
      parents in both groups will be interviewed every 14 days as for their satisfactions,
      anxieties, infants ability to cope. video typing during Kangaroo care at 32 and 35 wks as
      well as during feeding at 35 weeks will be done and evaluated. General movements assessment
      (neurodevelopment) will be done at 33 -35 weeks gestational age, as well as at 52 weeks.
      Alberta infant motor scales will be evaluated at 4 and 8 month corrected age,Automated Brain
      stem evoked Response (ABR) will be done at 33 wks for assessment of brain stem maturity,
      duration of hospitalization, weight gain per week at 33, 34 and 35 weeks will be calculated,
      age at full oral feeding will be noted. At the age of 6 month Griffith's developmental scales
      will be performed
