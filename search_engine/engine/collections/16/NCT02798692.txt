    
      Hookipa Biotech AG is developing a replication-deficient lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus
      (rLCMV) vector platform. HB-101 is a bivalent vaccine containing two recombinant,
      replication-deficient lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (rLCMV) vectors, one expressing the
      pp65 protein of the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and one expressing the gB protein of human
      cytomegalovirus (HCMV).

      This Phase 1 will enroll three successive cohorts of 18 healthy volunteers. Each cohort will
      receive either a low dose, a middle dose or a high dose of the vaccine (n=14 volunteers), or
      placebo (n=4). A DSMB will review the safety data for the low dose cohort, before progressing
      to the middle, and so before high dose. Eight DSMB meetings have been planned for the whole
      study.

      The subjects will be followed up to 12 months post first administration.
