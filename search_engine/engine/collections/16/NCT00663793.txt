    
      This is an 2-3 month open-label, two week pharmacokinetic study of two novel formulations of
      oral testosterone (T), in normal men whose endogenous T production has been temporarily
      suppressed by the administration of the potent GnRH antagonist Acyline. We will be
      determining the relative pharmacokinetics of six different oral formulations of T in both
      rapid and slow release compared to the immediate release preparation studied previously by
      our group.
