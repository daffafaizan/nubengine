      treatment of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting (CINV). The primary objective of the
      study is to verify 0.75 mg palonosetron, concomitantly administered with corticosteroids, is
      not inferior and superior to granisetron hydrochloride in acute stages 0 - 24 hours and in
      delayed stages 24 - 120 hours after administration of highly emetogenic chemotherapy,
      respectively. Corticosteroids are commonly employed in current medical treatments with 5-HT3
      receptor antagonists.

      This is a multicenter, parallel, group comparative study where subjects are assigned to
      treatment groups in accordance with a central registration system. After obtaining written
      informed consent, the patients that satisfy the inclusion criteria without meeting the
      exclusion criteria are assigned using minimizing procedures to either a single-dose of 0.75
      mg palonosetron group or a single-dose of 40 μg/kg granisetron hydrochloride with covariates
      of chemotherapy regimen, gender and age. A palonosetron group will receive intravenous
      injections of 0.75 mg palonosetron (5 mL) and then granisetron placebo before administration
      of highly emetogenic chemotherapy. A granisetron hydrochloride group will be treated with
      palonosetron placebo and then intravenous 40μg/kg granisetron hydrochloride before
      administration of highly emetogenic chemotherapy. The onset of nausea and emetic episodes and
      the time of an antiemetic procedure will be observed for 120 hours after the start of highly
      emetogenic chemotherapy. The objective is to find the patients' global satisfaction with the
      antiemetic therapy. Adverse events will also be observed for seven days after the
      administration of the each drug.
