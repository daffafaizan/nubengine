    
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and tolerability of intrapleural
      Visudyne®-mediated photo-induction as a means to selectively increase tumor uptake of
      systemically administered Lipoplatin™ in patients with primary or secondary pleural
      malignancies.

      The secondary objectives are:

      Assessment of treatment efficacy as measured by dyspnea reduction, pleural effusion free
      survival as well as local relapse rate, progression free and median overall survival.

      Analysis of the pleural intratumor penetration of Lipoplatin™ by repeated biopsies for
      Lipoplatin concentration measurements before and after Visudyne® treatment as well as vessel
      modulation related parameters (pericyte coverage, vessels morphology).
