      common subtype in Asians.No effective treatment for advanced mucosal melanoma
      patients.Malignant melanoma is a highly vascular tumor in which vascular endothelial growth
      factor(VEGF) is strongly expressed and seems to play an important role in disease
      progression.A randomized phase II study evaluated the activity of Bevacizumab in combination
      with carboplatin plus paclitaxel(CPB arm) in patients with previously untreated advanced
      melanoma.Overall response rates was 25.5%,median overall survival time(OS) was 12.3 months in
      the CPB arm. Investigators conducted a randomized phase II study in patients with previously
      untreated metastatic mucosal melanoma to characterize the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab
      when combined with carboplatin plus paclitaxel.
