    
      OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicities and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of six doses of
      SS1(dsFv)-PE38 QOD administered by intravenous infusion to patients with advanced
      malignancies.

      II. Characterize the plasma pharmacokinetics of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 after intravenous infusion.

      III. Determine toxicities attributable to subsequent courses of SS1(dsFv)-PE38.

      IV. Evaluate the response of selected advanced malignancies to intravenous infusion of six
      doses of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 QOD administered at the MTD.

      V. Determine the induction of antibody against SS1(dsFv)-PE38 and its relationship to
      pharmacokinetics.

      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: To exclude immediate allergic hypersensitivity reaction, each patient will
      receive a test dose of SS1(dsFv)-PE38, and be observed for 30 minutes prior to receiving
      study dosing. Each treatment will be given by intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every
      other day. Hydration will be maintained. (Oral hydration may be adequate, but intravenous
      hydration may be used at the Investigator?s discretion.) Patients will be observed for at
      least 4 hours after infusion on Day 1 of each treatment course to exclude immediate allergic
      reaction. Treatment may be repeated for a maximum of two additional courses after 4 weeks if
      re-treatment criteria are met. At least three patients will be accrued at each dose level.
      Dose escalation within a patient will not be allowed.
