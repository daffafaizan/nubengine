      occupational exposure to this important chemical is associated with increased risk for
      myeloid leukemia. The significance, however, of these observations for occupational and
      environmental health is uncertain because of inconsistencies among epidemiologic studies and
      lack of a demonstrated mechanism through which formaldehyde can cause leukemia. Cytogenetic
      damage is one potential leukemogenic mechanism, but there are few studies of
      formaldehyde-exposed humans. Some experimental data suggest that epigenetic changes in
      myeloid cells could also be involved. We plan to study 40 workers exposed to high levels of
      formaldehyde and 40 unexposed controls to examine the hypothesis that formaldehyde is
      associated with these changes. To determine formaldehyde exposure, we will incorporate a
      number of methods, including questionnaires to determine potential past exposure and on-site
      monitoring to determine current average and peak intensities of exposure. We will then
      examine differences in aneuploidy and structural abnormalities in myeloid progenitor cells
      cultured from peripheral blood. We will specifically look for differences in genes associated
      with myeloid leukemia such as monosomy 7 and trisomy 8 using interphase and Octochrome FISH.
      We will also determine whether aberrant methylation in progenitor cells, specifically
      hypermethylation of genes associated with myeloid leukemia, is higher in those exposed to
      formaldehyde. This study will substantially contribute to our understanding of the
      leukemogenic potential of formaldehyde, which has important public health and regulatory
      implications.
