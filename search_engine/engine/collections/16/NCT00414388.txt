      participation in this study. Patients who relapse or progress shortly (within 12 weeks) after
      discontinuation of chemotherapy with either docetaxel/prednisone or mitoxantrone/prednisone
      will also be offered participation in this trial. Enrolled patients will receive sorafenib as
      per protocol define dose. Sorafenib will be administered in combination with the last
      chemotherapy utilized. If there is no disease progression after 6 cycles, chemotherapy will
      be stopped and Sorafenib may continue until disease progression.
