      chronic kidney disease and may increase the mortality. This study aimed to investigate
      whether pulse wave analysis could be the predictor of IDH.

      In this study, patients under regular hemodialysis were enrolled from Taoyuan Chang Gung
      memorial hospital. Subjects were evaluated by pulse wave instrument, heart rate variability
      analyzer and Constitution in Chinese Medicine Questionnaire before hemodialysis. According to
      the definitions of IDH, subjects in study group and control group were confirmed by the
      dialysis records. Furthermore, repeated examinations were done for 3 hemodialysis to
      investigate the possible predictive factors for IDH.
