      effects of a nutrition/physical activity behavioural intervention in women with a history of
      GDM within the past 5 years. The investigators have designed the intervention to include
      in-person sessions- but at a feasible frequency for busy mothers- as well as telephone calls
      and an on-line discussion forum, to provide an ongoing source of support, information, and
      accountability. Further, participants' partners will be invited to some of the in-person
      sessions and childcare will be provided on-site. Importantly, there are no meal replacements
      included, despite the study title, because focus group discussions indicated that this was
      not of interest to the target population.

      The investigators will hold in-person sessions at a frequency of once per month over a
      4-month period. In addition to the in-person, on-site sessions, we will arrange for
      participants to have in a grocery store 'tour' led by a student from the McGill School of
      Dietetics and Human Nutrition BSc program. This will allow a review of label reading and
      interpretation as well as tips on produce selection. Details of the intervention are provided
      under the trial arm section below.
