      insulin pump therapy in patients with type 2 Diabetes Mellitus, as compared to patients on
      multiple daily injections (MDI) therapy over the same time period. It also evaluates between
      group changes in diabetes clinical outcomes after 6 months in patients with type 2 DM.
      Patient related outcomes will be measured after 6 months of therapy. The primary endpoint
      will be between group difference in average HbA1c changes from baseline to 6 months, when
      comparing Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII) to MDI.

      The secondary end point concerns the safety issues such as severe hypoglycemia incidence:
      defined as an episode absolutely requiring assistance from another person and preferably
      accompanied by a confirmatory blood glucose by finger stick of less than 50mg/dL (2.8
      mmol/L), (i.e., subject is unable to treat self and requires carbohydrate, glucagon or other
      resuscitative actions to prevent further clinical deterioration), hospitalizations, Diabetic
      Ketoacidosis (DKA), an acute metabolic complication of diabetes, characterized by
      hyperglycemia, hyperketonemia, and metabolic acidosis, within group difference in HbA1c from
      6 months to 12 months, change in weight or BMI, change in Lipids : total cholesterol, high
      density lipoprotein(HDL),low density lipoprotein(LDL),triglyceride, change in blood pressure,
      Insulin Dosage Changes (Total Daily Dose), Number of self monitoring blood glucose
      (SMBG)/day, treatment satisfaction: Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire status and
      change version (DTSQs and DTSQc).

      The hypotheses underlying the secondary outcomes : the pump therapy improves glycaemic
      control whilst utilizing less total daily dose of insulin in comparison to multiple daily
      injections of insulin. This is associated with parallel improvement in metabolic profiles
      such as blood pressure and lipids. As for the glucose monitoring, investigators want to
      evaluate whether there is any difference in the frequency of SMBG/day between the 2 treatment
      groups. More frequent SMBG monitoring denotes better compliance, motivation and empowerment
      by the participants to control their diabetes.
