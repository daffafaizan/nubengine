    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. At the end of an
      initial 2-week washout period, patients fulfilling the inclusion criteria are assigned to
      three groups, i.e. control group (placebo), low dose Ginseol Kg1 group (100mg), or high dose
      Ginseol Kg1 (300mg) group. They will intake the study drug for 8 weeks. 24-h ambulatory BP
      monitoring (ABPM) and pulse wave velocity are measured at the end of the washout period and
      after 8 weeks of active treatment. At each visit, seated SBP and DBP, heart rate, use of
      concomitant medication and spontaneously reported adverse events are recorded. Compliance
      with medication (determined by counting returned tablets) is evaluated at each visit.
