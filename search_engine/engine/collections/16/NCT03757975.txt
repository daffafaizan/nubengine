      vaginal) and supracervical hysterectomy (abdominal and by laparoscopy) on quality of life,
      sexual function, urethral length and urinary incontinence. The patients fulfill
      questionnaires (UDI 6, IIQ7, FSFI and ICIQ) before operation and 6 months after. Additionally
      the investigators measure urethral length before procedure and 6 months after.
