    
      This Phase 2 study, Concussion in Motor Vehicle Accidents - The Concussion Identification
      Index (CIDI), focuses on the psychometric properties of the relationship between acute injury
      events, i.e. head impact, loss of consciousness (LOC), and post-traumatic amnesia (PTA),
      commonly reported post-crash signs and symptoms, and neurocognitive outcomes.

      Cohort 1 is the validation group and will be used to confirm the optimal cut-off score of the
      Concussion Identification Index (CIDI) with the score on the ImPACT.

      Cohort 2 is the cross-validation group.
