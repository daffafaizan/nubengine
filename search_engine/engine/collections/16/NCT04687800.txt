      cataract surgery performed in conjunction with minimally invasive glaucoma surgery. After
      qualifying for this study, subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 allocation of one of two
      arms. The purpose of this study is to determine if Dextenza (dexamethasone) 0.4mg
      intracanalicular insert delivery system, provides a decreased risk of elevated post-operative
      IOP vs. standard therapy controlled topical steroid Durezol (Difluprednate ophthalmic
      emulsion) 0.05%
