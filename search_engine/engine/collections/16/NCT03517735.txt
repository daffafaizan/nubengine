      adjusting drug doses to the minimum required for efficacy. Indeed, automated and continuous
      titration may avoid overdosing, improve hemodynamic stability and also decrease the mean time
      to tracheal extubation.

      Medsteer SAS developed a controller, EasyTiva device, allowing the closed-loop
      coadministration of propofol and remifentanil, guided by a Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor.

      Automated sedation is so facilitated by the BIS which permits continuous monitoring of
      electrocortical activity.

      This randomized monocentric trial compares the automated administration with manual
      intravenous administration of propofol-remifentanil for maintaining adequate depth of
      hypnosis (BIS 55-75) during sedation after cardiac surgery.
