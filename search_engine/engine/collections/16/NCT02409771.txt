      follow-up. The PRECIZON Presbyopic is a lens intended for implantation in the capsular bag,
      indicated for optical correction of aphakia in adults whom the crystalline lens has been
      removed and who desire presbyopia correction. The main objective is to evaluate the ability
      of the PRECIZON Presbyopic to provide near, intermediate and distance vision in patients
      undergoing cataract extraction / Clear Lens Exchange (CLE) and intraocular lens implantation.
      Study results will be used for CE-approval and registration and marketing purposes.
