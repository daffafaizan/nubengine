      over the age of 65 in the United States and other Western countries. More than 1.6 million
      people in the US currently have one or both eyes affected by the advanced stage of AMD.

      Lucentis® is the most effective treatment for neovascular AMD studied to date. Bevacizumab
      (Avastin®) and Lucentis® are derived from the same monoclonal antibody. Following the
      encouraging clinical trial results with Lucentis®, several investigators began evaluating
      intravitreal Avastin® for the treatment of CNV. Given its molecular similarity to Lucentis,
      its low cost, and its availability, the interest in Avastin® has been considerable. Avastin®
      has not been evaluated relative to Lucentis®.

      In addition, previous studies do not answer the question of whether a reduced dosing schedule
      is as effective as a fixed schedule of monthly injections. Treatment dependent on clinical
      response has the potential to reduce the treatment burden to patients as well as to reduce
      the overall cost of therapy.

      Only a single eye in each patient was analyzed.

      At the five year follow-up visit, the subjects will undergo the same examinations and
      procedures as in the original study; however, the five year follow-up visit deos not involve
      any study treatment.
