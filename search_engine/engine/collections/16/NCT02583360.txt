      coordination, regurgitation or vomiting, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and airway
      aspiration. Often these infants must rely on feeding tubes, either inserted through the nose
      or surgically placed, to meet their nutrition and hydration needs until they are able to
      orally feed safely, effectively, and efficiently. The process of assessment and treatment of
      swallowing disorders is often stressful for the infants and their providers, including
      parents. The goal of this study is to combine two commonly used diagnostic techniques (video
      fluoroscopy swallow studies and esophageal manometry) to more comprehensively evaluate
      feeding from the mouth to the stomach in infants. The hope is that by doing so treatment
      strategies can be improved.

      : Eligible subjects (study) will undergo diagnostic VFSS in combination with manometry,
      either concurrent or sequential. They will have parental choice of preferred feeding therapy.
      The data is from single center prospective observational study. The controls are those who
      had VFSS alone with provider recommendations from the same single center.

      In addition, we are also embarking on alternate strategies to achieve the original stated
      aims: 1) Mechanisms of dysphagia is ascertained by studying concurrent recordings of VFSS and
      manometry. 2) Feeding outcomes of Dysphagic infants are ascertained by evaluating the
      discharge outcomes and 1-year feeding outcomes among those that had evaluation of dysphagia
      using VFSS. 3) Dysphagic infants that had sequential VFSS and manometry studies are evaluated
      to test which method is a better predictor of stated outcomes.
