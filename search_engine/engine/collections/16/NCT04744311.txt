      the patient and the anaesthesia. Scales for measuring the quality of post-operative recovery
      have been developed. Ciechanowicz et al. developed and validated a postpartum recovery score
      for women with a caesarean section: the ObsQoR-11. This multidimensional scale is a
      questionnaire of 11 items evaluating: moderate pain, severe pain, nausea and vomiting,
      feeling of discomfort, shivering, feeling of comfort, ability to mobilize, ability to carry
      the newborn, ability to feed, ability to groom alone, and finally feeling of self-control.
      The investigators aimed to validate the translated version of the Turkish ObsQoR-11 scale.
