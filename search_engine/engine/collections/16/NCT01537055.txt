      eligible in this multicenter randomized comparative trial. Eligible patients will be
      randomized to receive either (1) levofloxacin-based sequential therapy for 10
      days〔lansoprazole 30mg and amoxicillin 1g for the first 5 days, followed by lansoprazole
      30mg, levofloxacin 250mg, and metronidazole 500mg for another 5 days (all given twice
      daily)〕or (2) levofloxacin-based triple therapy for 10 days〔lansoprazole 30mg and amoxicillin
      1g, and levofloxacin 250mg for 10 days (all given twice daily)〕. Eradication will be
      confirmed with 13C-Urea Breath Test 6 weeks after therapy.
