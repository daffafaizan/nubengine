      with rheumatoid arthritis, and the Food and Drug Administration has approved the drug for
      that use. Because medicines for arthritis often help patients with eye inflammation, this
      study will examine whether TNFR:Fc can help patients with uveitis.

      Patients with uveitis who are not responding well to standard treatment, such as steroids,
      and patients who have side effects from other medicines used to treat their uveitis or have
      refused treatment because of possible side effects may be eligible for this study. Candidates
      will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, and eye examination. The eye
      exam includes a check of vision and eye pressure, examination of the back of the eye
      (retina), and front of the eye, including measurements of protein and inflammation.
      Candidates will also undergo fluorescein angiography-a procedure in which photographs are
      taken of the retina to see if there is any leakage in the eye's blood vessels. A blood test
      and joint evaluation will also be done.

      Study participants will be given an injection of TNFR:Fc twice a week for up to 12 months and
      may continue other medicines they may be taking, such as prednisone or methotrexate. They
      will have follow-up examinations at week two and months one, two, three and four. Those who
      wish to continue treatment after the fourth month can receive the drug for another eight
      months and will have follow-up exams at months six, nine and 12, and one month after
      treatment ends. Each follow-up visit will include a repeat of the screening exams and an
      evaluation of side effects or discomfort from the medicine.
