      radiological techniques like OPT or dental films. In contrast to these two-dimensional
      imaging methods the Cone Beam Computer Tomography (CBCT) respectively the Digital Volume
      Tomography (DVT) offers a three-dimensional imaging of the maxillofacial region, providing
      the opportunity to study objectives in all standard plans with 3D-reconstruction in
      multisection views.

      A preoperative radiological investigation using CBCT on patients who are supposed to undergo
      surgery for impacted and supernumerary teeth in the frontal maxilla shall clarify the
      certainty and safeness of this 3D-imaging method. Therefore a comparison between the findings
      on the CBCT, on eventually former conventional x-rays and the intraoperative finding as gold
      standard is done.
