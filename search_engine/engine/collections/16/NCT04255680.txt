    
      Primary Objective:

      The primary objective of this study is to identify whether frataxin levels and specific RNAs
      and proteins in blood and buccal cells differ between patients with FRDA and controls.

      Secondary Objective:

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

        -  To understand the variability of frataxin and specific RNAs and proteins identified in
           buccal cells.

        -  To correlate levels of frataxin and specific RNAs and proteins with features of FRDA.

        -  To correlate levels of frataxin and specific RNAs and proteins with triglycerides, high
           density lipoprotein (HDL), low density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, and other lipids.
