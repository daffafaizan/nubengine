      biopsy (TRUSbx) is the most widely used technique. Due to the transrectal path the biopsy
      needle will bring bacteria from the colon into tissue. The patent should always receive
      prophylactic antibiotics to reduce the risk of clinical infection. Infections related to
      transrectal prostate biopsy (TRUSbx) are increasing in parallel with rising antibiotic
      resistance.

      The investigators have in an ex-vivo setting previously shown a drastic reduction in
      bacterial transfer across the colon wall using a novel biopsy needle designed to minimize
      bacterial transfer. Biopsy of prostatectomy specimen using the novel needle has shown biopsy
      quality equal to the tru cut biopsy needle used today.

      This is the first human pilot aiming to evaluate if biopsy quality of the novel needle is
      equal to the reference tru cut biopsy needle in prostate biopsy.
