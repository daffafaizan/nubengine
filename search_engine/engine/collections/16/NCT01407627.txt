    
      PRIMARY AIM: To examine whether the physiologic and molecular responses to Angiotensin II
      (AngII) challenge differ in response to fructose intake as assessed by two independent means:

        1. The renal and mean arterial pressure (MAP) response to an AngII challenge.

        2. Reactive changes in circulating levels of renin and aldosterone with graded AngII
           challenge.

      PRIMARY HYPOTHESES: Ingestion of fructose in healthy subjects will result in:

        1. A decrease in renal and systemic sensitivity to infused AngII.

        2. A decrease in the reactive changes in renin and aldosterone with graded AngII challenge.
