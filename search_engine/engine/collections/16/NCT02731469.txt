    
      BCD-131 is novel drug product of pegylated darbepoetin alfa.

      Clinical trial BCD-131-1 will be conducted in two stages:

      Stage I is an open-label, non-randomized clinical study of pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, tolerability, safety and immunogenicity of BCD-131 given to healthy
      volunteers at ascending doses (Phase 1, a traditional "3+3" design).

      Also, the PK and PD parameters of the closest analogues of BCD-131 (Mircera and Aranesp)
      given as subcutaneous injections at therapeutic doses will be evaluated.

      Stage II aims to further evaluate pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and safety of
      subcutaneous and intravenous injections of BCD-131 at a dose which ensures PD effects similar
      to those of the closest analogues (Mircera, Aranesp) given as subcutaneous injections at
      therapeutic doses.
