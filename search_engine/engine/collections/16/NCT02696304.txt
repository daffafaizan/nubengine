    
      Enroled patients (both groups) will be evaluated for the following criteria. Then, a
      comparison between both groups will be performed.

      1. Primary endpoint: the following factors will be studied, and compared between both groups
      (with or without TBI):

        -  Adipose tissue repartition using biphotonic absorptiometry and abdominal MRI

        -  Ectopic adipose tissue evaluation (visceral and hepatical) using MRI and proton
           spectroscopy

        -  Adipose tissue inflammation (using PCR array) : quantification of the following
           biomarkers: alpha TNF, IL6, IL1beta, IL10, MCP1, leptine and adiponectine

        -  Adipose tissue fibrosis (PCR array): quantification of the following markers of
           fibrosis: Col 1a1, Col 3a1, Col 6a1, Col 6a3, Tenascin C, Lumican, TGF beta

        -  Preadipocytes quantification in the adipose tissue (immunohistochemistery)

      Concerning the secondary endpoints, the following points will be studied :

        -  Cardiovascular risk factors and nutritional statement

        -  Anthropometric measurements

        -  Other endocrinal abnormalities possibly associated with the MS

        -  Analysis of inflammation blood markers and adipokines quantification.
