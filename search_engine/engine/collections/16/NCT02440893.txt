      (ASGES) or Corus CAD in pre-diabetic patients who are medication naive. This study provided
      data to determine if the Corus CAD (ASGES) signature was different in pre-diabetic patients
      when metformin was newly prescribed and taken. The primary aim of this study was to evaluate
      whether metformin used in pre-diabetic patients to prevent progression to type II diabetes
      had a significant effect on the gene expression levels measured in Corus. This was a
      prospective study. Subjects were enrolled from participating sites as applicable
      inclusion/exclusion criteria were met. The study aimed to enroll approximately fifty (50)
      patients.
