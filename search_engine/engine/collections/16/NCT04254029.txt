      after design, carried out from November 2016 and May 2017.

      Intervention consisted of the administration of a daily consummation of 425 ml of drink
      containing the extracts of 1,38mg of leaves extracts of moringa oleifera and 23,46 mg of
      stevia rebaudiana Bertoni leaves extracts lasting 45 days. Before and after intervention, the
      following were done by the participants: bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), blood
      pressure measurements, fasting blood sugar, HbA1c, lipid profiles, liver function tests,
      kidney function tests, urinary excretion of albumin tests and full blood counts. These were
      followed by morphological workup including Electrocardiograms (ECGs), transthoracic heart
      ultrasounds and Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurements (ABPM), also done before and after
      intervention.

      Clinical evaluation with fasting blood sugar control, blood pressure controls and urinary
      excretion albumin tests were done for safety purposes.
