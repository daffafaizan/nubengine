      noninterventional study protocol, but falls within current practice. The decision to
      prescribe Sutent® is clearly not driven by the decision to include the patient in this
      study.The sample size for this study is not based on statistical considerations. It is
      expected that a minimum of 100 patients will be enrolled in the study by the end of the first
      year and the data collected would be adequate to fulfill the observational objectives of the
      study.The study will be initiated at 10 sites across India during the 1st year. The study may
      be expanded with the addition of new sites during the 2nd year.
