      infection compared to general population, with a more important mortality risk because
      pneumococcus is considered as one of the major pathogenic agents. Antipneumcoccal vaccination
      is recommended to patients suffering from chronic inflammatory rheumatism treated with
      immunosuppressants. Methotrexate is a long term treatment used in first intention for
      rheumatoid polyarthritis. A recent study shows a decrease of efficacity of antipneumoccal
      vaccination for patients suffering from rheumatoid polyarthritis treated by methotrexate. The
      tested hypothesis will be the presence of better vaccinal protection for patients suffered
      from rheumatoid polyarthritis after 1 month between antipneumococcal vaccination and the
      initiation of methotrexate. The objective is to compare immunologic response for
      antipneumococcal vaccination between patients who are vaccinated in the same time of
      initiation of methotrexate and patients who are vaccinated 1 month before the beginning of
      the treatment.
