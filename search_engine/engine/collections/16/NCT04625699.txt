    
      This is an open label, single arm, pilot study of adjuvant durvalumab+ tremelimumab (D+T) for
      patients with stage II-IIIB (excluding N3) NSCLC.The trial will evaluate the feasibility of
      adjuvant D+T in patients who have undergone surgical resection and standard of care (SOC)
      adjuvant treatment and subsequently develop detectable plasma ctDNA. 15 evaluable patients
      will be enrolled. Patients with resected stage II-IIIB (excluding N3) NSCLC who have
      completed adjuvant standard of care treatment will be pre-screened and consented for the
      trial. They will undergo ctDNA testing with the Signatera assay at the completion of adjuvant
      treatment and every 4 months thereafter with standard CT imaging assessment up to 1 year.
      Patients with detectable ctDNA at a mutant allele frequency of >0.1% and no evidence of
      recurrence on CT imaging will be enrolled in the trial. They will receive durvalumab every 4
      weeks for 4 cycles and tremelimuamb on cycles 1 and 3 with concomitant plasma ctDNA
      quantification. Patients will be followed with standard CT imaging of the chest as well as
      routine and exploratory blood tests every 4 months until 1 year after completion of D+T. They
      will also be followed for up to 3 years for determination of DFS and OS.
