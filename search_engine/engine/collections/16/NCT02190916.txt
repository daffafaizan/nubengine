      invited via email to participate in this study. The Contract Registry includes people who
      self-identify as having one of the following types of vasculitis: granulomatosis with
      polyangiitis (Wegener's), microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss syndrome, polyarteritis
      nodosa, Takayasu's arteritis, giant cell arteritis, Behcet's disease, Henoch-Sch√∂enlein
      purpura, or CNS vasculitis. People voluntarily enroll in this Registry with the understanding
      that they will receive information about clinical studies for which they might be eligible.
      The introductory email included basic information about the study and all of the required
      elements for informed consent in a brief format. Once participants agreed to participate in
      the study, then they were directed to the online questionnaire.

      When completing the questionnaire, patients were asked a series of questions. Some of the
      follow-up questions depended on initial answers. The questionnaire content was included as an
      appendix. The online questionnaire version was thoroughly tested for usability.

      It was expected that most participants would require approximately 20-30 minutes to complete
      the questionnaire.

      The survey data is stored by the Rare Diseases Clinical Research Network Data Management and
      Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida. The data is de-identified.
      Names or other personal health information are not be collected.
