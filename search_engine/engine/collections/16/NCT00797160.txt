      an interesting potential for use in premature neonates with respiratory distress syndrome.
      Indeed, remifentanil allowed an adequate level of sedation and analgesia as well as rapid
      recovery after discontinuation. The aim of the present study was to compares the intubation
      conditions among propofol and remifentanil versus midazolam and remifentanil in premature
      neonates with respiratory distress syndrome.
