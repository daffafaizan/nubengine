      became a popular way to treat HCC. Although the wound is small and the patients can discharge
      on the next day, they have to suffer from moderate to severe pain. Nowadays Erector spinae
      plane block has been applied to many surgery as a postoperative analgesic strategy. We deduce
      Erector spinae plane block can be use as a postoperative analgesic way for patients who
      receive radiofrequency ablation of hepatocellular carcinoma. Besides, we will add contrast
      medium to evaluate the spread area of local anesthetics.
