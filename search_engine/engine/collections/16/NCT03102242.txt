      for 12 weeks with standard chemoradiotherapy with curative intent for good PS patients with
      unresectable stage IIIA/B NSCLC. Because of the consequences of progression in this
      curative-intent population, restaging CT scans will be carried out after the first 2 cycles
      of neoadjuvant therapy. Non progressing patients will complete a total of one year of
      anti-PDL1 therapy with an interruption during chemoradiotherapy. Patients with evidence of
      progression at the first restaging evaluation will proceed immediately to chemoradiotherapy
      if still eligible for curative intent therapy.
