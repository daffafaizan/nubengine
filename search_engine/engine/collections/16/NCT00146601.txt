      weeks later and again 2 weeks after that. Then patients will receive injections every 4
      weeks.

      Routine blood tests will be performed each time an injection is given.

      Patients will be required to complete a hot flash diary, recording the number and severity of
      hot flashes they experience on a daily basis.

      After every 12 weeks of treatment, patients' disease will be assessed by x-rays or scans. If
      there is no disease progression, the patient will continue to receive injections every 4
      weeks with reassessment every 8 weeks.

      Patients will continue to receive treatment as long as there is no disease progression or
      serious side effects.
