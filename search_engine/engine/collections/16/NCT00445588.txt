      I. The primary objective of this trial is to estimate the overall survival rate associated
      with this combined regimen in treating adult patients with recurrent glioblastoma multiforme.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess and estimate the toxicities. II. Tumor response rate. III. To estimate 6-month
      progression free survival. IV. To describe the pharmacokinetics of this route of
      administration. V. For the Molecular Targeted Combinations Correlative (MTC2) Study
      Initiative: To determine the relationship between tumor and blood biomarkers and clinical
      outcome of patients treated with the combination of targeted agents.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, open-label, phase II study.

      Patients receive oral erlotinib hydrochloride once daily and oral sorafenib tosylate twice
      daily on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      Tumor tissue and blood samples are collected prior to beginning treatment. Samples are
      analyzed by immunohistochemistry, gene expression, and DNA mutation and genomic analyses of
      the epidermal growth factor receptor, ras-raf-ERK, and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways to identify
      markers that correlate with patient outcomes. Blood samples are also collected on day 15 of
      course 1 for pharmacokinetic studies. Samples are analyzed by reversed-phase isocratic
      high-performance liquid chromatography with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to
      determine the concentration of erlotinib hydrochloride and sorafenib tosylate and its known
      metabolites.

      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed every 2 months.
