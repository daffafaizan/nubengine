      plasma amount in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) patients. The supplementation of glutamine in ICU
      patients has been under much debate. Another nutritional supplement, vitamin C, had a
      beneficial effect on wound healing and a reduction in infection rate. In this investigation,
      enteral glutamine and vitamin C were provided for ICU patient, and the associated changes in
      proinflammatory cytokines and clinical outcomes were investigated.

      Methods. This is a prospective double-blind randomized study for surgical ICU patients whom
      can sustain enteral feeding. The test group was provided with glutamine and vitamin C (the GA
      group); the control (C) group was provided with maltodextrin of equivalent calories as that
      provided in the GA group. Plasma glutamine, interleukin-6 (IL-6), and clinical data were
      collected and analyzed with biostatistical methods.
