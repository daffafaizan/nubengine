      smoking progression in young light smokers (YLS: 18-25 years & cpd < 5) using an 18-month
      longitudinal design and to relate these endophenotypes and progression to the genetic profile
      most highly associated with smoking progression. A number of novel predictors will be
      assessed in 128 YLS. Predictors will include individual differences (IDs) in EEG, reward
      sensitivity, attentional performance, and mood during abstinence and in response to
      standardized and to self-selected acute nicotine doses (ANIC), as well as genetically
      influenced affective traits, and smoking history. The associations of a compelling genetic
      functional variant polymorphism, rs16969968, in the alpha5 nicotinic receptor subunit will
      also be related to smoking progression and the novel predictors. The study is expected to
      provide insights into IDs in mechanisms and endophenotypes that contribute to smoking
      trajectories in YLS and thereby lead to targeted pharmacotherapy and behavioral interventions
      for at-risk YLS.
