      switch to one of darbepoetin alfa products - BCD-066 (experimental arm) or Aranesp (active
      comparator) to maintain previously achieved target level of hemoglobin (100-120 g/l).

      Patients will be treated for 52 weeks. IV iron supplementation will be provided to maintain
      serum ferritin level above 500 Âµg/l according to KDIGO Anemia Guidelines (2012).
