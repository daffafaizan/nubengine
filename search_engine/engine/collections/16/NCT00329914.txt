      of preterm delivery. Due to increasing maternal age and use of assisted reproduction the
      number of multiple gestations is larger than ever. If markers of preterm delivery can be
      identified and means of preventing preterm delivery are found, it will be possible to reduce
      the number of children admitted to hospital because of prematurity.

      Recently, two larger randomised studies investigated the effect of progesterone in singleton
      pregnancies of women who had previously delivered preterm. They both found a significant
      reduction in the preterm delivery rate in the progesterone group compared to a placebo group.

      The study will be performed as a randomized, double-blind placebo controlled study of twin
      pregnancies in Denmark and Austria. The women will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to two groups
      (progesterone versus placebo). Randomisation will be stratified per centre and according to
      chorionicity, as the risk of preterm delivery is doubled in monochorionic twins compared to
      dichorionic twins.
