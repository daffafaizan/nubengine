      of people at some point during their lives. It is associated with significant psychosocial
      morbidity, and there remains the need for efficacious and low risk therapeutic options.

      Microdermabrasion is a technique combining abrasion and negative pressure used primarily in
      the treatment of aging skin. It has also been proposed to improve acne presumably through a
      comedolytic effect. Negative pressure and abrasion may remove debris from follicular orifices
      that act as a nidus for acne lesions. Many physicians and spas use micordermabrasion as a
      treatment for acne, however, there has never been a randomized controlled trial to
      substantiate this practice.

      We propose to evaluate the efficacy of microdermabrasion in the treatment of inflammatory
      acne. We will use the Bellamed microdermabrasion system produced by Bella products or the
      Altair Diamondtome System.
