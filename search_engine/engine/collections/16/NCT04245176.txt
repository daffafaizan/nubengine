           including evaluations and follow up visits

        -  After receiving genetic testing, participants will be placed into one of two counseling
           methodology groups:

             -  Standard genetic counseling: Standard of care discussion

             -  Quantitative genetic counseling: Discussion is guided by tables and graphs.

        -  Participants will be on the research study for up to six months, with an optional
           extension to two years.

        -  It is expected that about 450 people will participate.

        -  This research study is a Feasibility Study, which is the first-time investigators are
           examining this form of genetic counseling.

        -  This is a randomized study. Randomization means being put into a group by chance. It is
           like flipping a coin. Neither the participant nor the Investigator will choose the group
           the participant is assigned to.
