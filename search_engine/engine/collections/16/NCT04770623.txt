      patients is less than 2 years. Moreover, most of the patients develop cachexia and worsening
      of performance over time. As a result, many patients are not fit for second line treatment
      when eligible. There is currently no approved consensus for third line treatment regimen and
      in most of the patients it is usually best supportive care.

      Irinotecan and docetaxel were tested as single agents or in combination with other drugs
      (e.g. FOLFIRI) in second line setting. However, the combination of these two drugs together
      was not tested before. Both agents are active in second line setting which is considered the
      last chance of the patient in view of lack of evidence in third line setting.
