      reliable and standardized objective outcome assessment and its relation to already
      established subjective patient reported outcome measures in patients suffering from lumbar
      degenerative disc disease. We want to use an existing smartphone-application that uses global
      positioning system (GPS) coordinates to measure walking distance. Applying self- measurement
      of the 6MWT before and after a therapeutic intervention, we determine objective functional
      impairment (OFI) in patients. The results of this study add to the understanding of
      achievable objective outcomes after therapeutic interventions applied to patients with DDD
      and examines patients acceptance for smartphone based self-measurement.

      Primary Objectives The primary objective is to determine the reliability and validity of the
      6-Minute Walking Test (6MWT) in patients with lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD)

      Secondary objectives are

        1. to correlate objective functional impairment (OFI) with already established
           patient-rated outcome measures (PROMs) in the sense of cross-validation.

        2. To correlate OFI, as determined by the 6MWT with OFI that is determined by another
           objective test, the TUG test

        3. to then analyze the change in OFI in patients before and after surgical intervention

        4. to determine whether patients prefer the objective (6MWT) or subjective (PROMs) repeated
           assessment of their functional condition.
