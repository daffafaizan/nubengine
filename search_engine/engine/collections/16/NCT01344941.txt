      the context of vaccination or infection. This protocol will support understanding of the
      immune response by providing a source of lymphocytes and serum from selected individuals to
      study in laboratory based investigations. Blood samples from individuals who have received an
      HIV-1 vaccine, individuals who are HIV-1-infected, and individuals who are HIV-1-uninfected
      are requested to: (1) test previously vaccinated volunteers for HIV-1 envelope-specific
      B-cell and T-cell immune activities, and (2) increase understanding of how the human immune
      system processes and responds to HIV-1 envelope proteins.
