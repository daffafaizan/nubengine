      Laboratory serum creatinine (SCr) results of all patients admitted during study period will
      be retrieved from the hospital Laboratory Information System. A preliminary screening list
      will be generated by using STATA program from the SCr results. The nephrologist will then
      determine HA-AKI and CA-AKI as per inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data collectors will
      collect all relevant data from these patients.
