      modified T cells. Genetic material is transferred into the subject's previously harvested
      autologous T cells to redirect them to target melanoma cells rather than their usual target.
      Study subjects must have histologically or cytologically melanoma stage 3/4 and their tumor
      must express HLA Class 1 allele HLA-A*0201 for NY-ESO-1/LAGE. Subjects must also have
      measureable disease on study entry, as defined by at least one lesion that can be measured in
      at least one dimension >= 10mm with spiral CT scan.
