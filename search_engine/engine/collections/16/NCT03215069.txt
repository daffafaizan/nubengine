      first onset and recognition in pregnancy, identifies a population of women who are at high
      risk for the future development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This risk of T2DM is mediated by
      the progressive deterioration of insulin secretion by the pancreatic beta-cells in the years
      after delivery, a pathologic process that current anti-diabetic therapies have not been shown
      to modify. Importantly, since very mild glycemia has deleterious but reversible effects on
      insulin secretion ("glucotoxicity"), the beta-cell dysfunction of women with recent GDM
      should have a prominent reversible component that potentially could be mitigated through the
      elimination of glucotoxicity. In this context, the sodium glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2)
      inhibitor empagliflozin is a novel anti-diabetic therapy that specifically alleviates
      glucotoxicity and thus may be able to preserve beta-cell function. Coupled with its capacity
      to induce weight loss with low risk of hypoglycemia, empagliflozin could be an ideal therapy
      for diabetes prevention in women with recent GDM. Specifically, by eliminating glucotoxicity,
      SGLT-2 inhibition could enable the preservation of beta-cell function and thereby prevent the
      development of incident T2DM in this high-risk population. Thus, a double-blind, parallel
      arm, randomized controlled trial, in which non-lactating women with recent GDM who are
      between 6 to 36 months postpartum to be randomized to either empagliflozin 10 mg daily or
      matching placebo is proposed. The duration of treatment will be 48-weeks. Beta-cell function
      will be assessed by Insulin Secretion-Sensitivity Index-2 (ISSI-2), measured on oral glucose
      tolerance test (OGTT) at baseline, 24-weeks, 48-weeks, and after a 4-week washout.
