    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The evaluation of the effect of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) as a chemopreventive agent
      for lung cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The modulation of biological markers after treatment and the correlation of these findings
      with modification of lung nodules diameters.

      II. The per-lesion analysis including the evaluation of lung nodule density before and after
      treatment, the number and size of non target lesions including solid nodules and evaluation
      of response according to modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST)
      criteria.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive acetylsalicylic acid orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 12 months.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD for 12 months.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 month.
