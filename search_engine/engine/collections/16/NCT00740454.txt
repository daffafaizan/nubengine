      rule out the diagnosis of DVT when negative. The safety of this strategy has never been
      verified in pregnant or postpartum women. It could however be limited in that clinical
      setting, because of modified hemodynamics, hampered observation conditions, lack of
      respiratory modulation, higher proportion of isolated iliac deep vein thromboses. The
      objective of the EDVIGE study is to assess the safety of this diagnostic strategy during
      pregnancy and post-partum.
