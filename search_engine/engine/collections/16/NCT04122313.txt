      treatment pathway, which includes contracture release treatment modalities such as limited
      fasciectomy, PNA and CCH injection, followed by post-operative radiation. All enrolled
      participants will undergo radiation treatment as soon as possible following contracture
      release. Radiotherapy will consist of 5 daily treatments of 300 cGy delivered to the palmar
      area followed by a 6-8 weeks break then a second 5 day course of radiation at 300 cGy, for a
      total of 3000 cGy in 10 total fractions. This dosing schedule is commonly used in the
      published literature. The data to be collected about participants, is their Southampton
      Dupuytren's score, history and clinical symptoms and photographs of their hand. This
      information will be obtained at baseline (pre-surgical intervention), at radiation treatment
      planning, approximately 6 weeks after completion of all radiation and at 1 and 2 years
      following completion of radiotherapy.
