      enrolled alcohol use disorder (AUD) patients, recruited from alcohol inpatient clinics in
      Germany, Poland and Denmark, will be randomized into one of three groups at the start of
      standard alcohol treatment: group A) stimuli-relevant AATP as usual; group B)
      stimuli-relevant ATTP in virtual reality, and group C) treatment as usual (TAU; control
      group). Treatment outcomes will be assessed at pre-treatment, post-treatment and 3-month
      follow-up. Generalized mixed-models will be applied to compare the trajectories of the groups
      over time on drinking, craving and impulsiveness outcomes.
