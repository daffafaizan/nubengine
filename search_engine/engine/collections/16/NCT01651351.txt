      at 0.04 mL/kg/min with a simultaneous administration of placebo (2.5% human albumin in normal
      saline) at 0.2 mL/kg/min (Cohort 1) or GLASSIA at 0.2 mL/kg/min with a simultaneous
      administration of placebo at 0.04 mL/kg/min (Cohort 2) on Day 1.

      Two weeks later (Day 15), the same participants received the second infusion with the
      opposite rate of GLASSIA infusion and the corresponding masking placebo infusion.
