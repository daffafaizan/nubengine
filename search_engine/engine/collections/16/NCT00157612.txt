      either use of a clinical pathway or usual care for management of nursing home acquired
      pneumonia. The clinical pathway included chest radiographs performed on-site in the nursing
      home by a mobile x-ray unit, use of hypodermocylysis (subcutaneous infusion) for
      re-hydration, administration of an oral antimicrobials, and use of pulse oximetry to assess
      oxygenation. The main outcomes were hospital admission rate and length of stay. Secondary
      outcomes included health related quality of life, rates of both infectious and non-infectious
      complications within four weeks of onset of symptoms; mortality rate of residents with
      pneumonia (death from all causes within 30 days of onset of symptoms. Time to stabilization
      of vital signs, as well as functional status at four weeks, were assessed.
