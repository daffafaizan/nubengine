      (HCL) automated insulin delivery (AID) using the Omnipod 5/Horizon HCL system with remote
      monitoring and device operation capabilities to hospitalized patients admitted to the general
      medical/surgical floorwith diabetes (type 1 or type 2) requiring insulin therapy. All
      enrolled participants will be placed on HCL insulin therapy for 10 days or until hospital
      discharge (if less than 10 days) to determine functional operability of the system and its
      effect on glycemic control in the hospital setting. This study will generate preliminary data
      to inform the design of a large multi-institution randomized controlled trial to assess
      superiority of HCL compared to standard inpatient insulin therapy.
