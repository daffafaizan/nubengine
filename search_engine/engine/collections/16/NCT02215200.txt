      under the curve (change in baseline to 12 months) in residual beta cell function (C-peptide)
      will differ between those treated with ATG and GCSF or ATG alone as compared with placebo.

      The study will also examine the effect of the proposed treatments on surrogate markers for
      immunologic and metabolic outcomes.
