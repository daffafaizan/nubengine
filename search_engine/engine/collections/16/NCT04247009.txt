      a meal containing red meat or fish in patients with RA and matched controls. The study have a
      cross-over design and each participant will have one of three meals every week and then be
      compared to themselves. In addition healthy individuals will be included for the red meat
      meal so that the response from this meal could be compared between patients with RA and their
      matched controls. Blood samples will be collected before the meal (fasting) and every hour
      until 5h. Primary outcome will be high sensitive IL-6. Secondary outcomes will be additional
      inflammation markers such as area under curve for hs-CRP and gene expression in PBMC:s
      regarding genes related to inflammation and, glucose, blood lipids and metabolomics-profile
      in serum and urine.
