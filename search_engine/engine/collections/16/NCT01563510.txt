      invasive techniques opened up a new situation for the treatment of hepatolithiasis, but it
      has not been widely applied.

      Intervention: Comparison of minimal invasive versus open operation for hepatolithiasis: a
      prospective randomized study. One hundred patients with early regional hepatolithiasis were
      selected and divided into laparoscopic operation group and open operation group randomly,
      each group contains 50 cases. Laparoscopic anatomical hepatectomy or open regular hepatectomy
      were performed respectively, combined with cholecystectomy and bile duct exploration when
      necessary. The intraoperative ultrasound and choledochoscope were used selectively.

      Results:

        1. Clinical data: previous operation history, operation time, intraoperative blood loss,
           volume of blood transfusion, complications and mortality, postoperative liver function,
           residual stones, recurrence rate, long-term curative effect and survival time were
           collected and analysed.

        2. Statistical method: univariate/multivariate analysis, logistic regression analysis,
           mixed linear regression, Cox survival analysis were used.
