      unequivocal evidence that improving glycemic control in subjects with diabetes significantly
      reduces the risk of developing the complications of diabetes (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy,
      and neuropathy). Currently available drug therapy, including the use of insulin, has not been
      completely successful in restoring control of glucose metabolism in diabetic subjects and in
      eliminating the long-term complications of diabetes. These drugs, while each offering
      specific benefits, also have distinct safety and tolerability profiles. Thus, there remains a
      need for agents with novel mechanism(s) of action.

      ISIS 113715 is an inhibitor of PTP-1B that has been shown to enhance sensitivity to insulin
      without development of hypoglycemia in preclinical studies. Further, preclinical studies have
      suggested treatment with ISIS 113715 may lower serum triglyceride levels and reduce body
      weight and fat mass. Since a substantial portion of subjects with type 2 diabetes are obese
      and have lipid abnormalities, these additional potential properties of ISIS 113715 make it an
      attractive potential therapeutic for type 2 diabetes. The aim of this Phase 2A study is to
      provide an initial assessment of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology,
      and efficacy of ISIS 113715 in combination with a second-generation sulfonylurea in type 2
      diabetes subjects not achieving sufficient glycemic control with SU alone.
