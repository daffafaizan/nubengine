      to help prevent child undernutrition and enhance the coverage of screening, referral and
      treatment of SAM/MAM, it is necessary to combine two study designs to rigorously evaluate the
      impact of the proposed intervention and to tease out the contribution of prevention and
      enhanced coverage/treatment to the overall impact on child malnutrition.

      The proposed study will therefore use two types of study designs. The first one is a repeated
      cross-sectional design that will compare select study outcomes between intervention and
      control groups at endline, after 24 months of program implementation. A repeated
      cross-sectional study design among children 0-17 months, at baseline and at study endline (on
      different children) will be used to assess the impact of the intervention on the prevalence
      of several outcomes, including the prevalence of MAM/SAM and stunting, the coverage of
      MAM/SAM screening and maternal ENA/IYCF/WASH knowledge and practices. The second proposed
      study design entails a longitudinal design whereby individual children will be recruited at
      birth and followed-up monthly until they reach 18 months of age. We anticipate needing
      approximately 5 months to recruit the required number of children (estimated at 2,040- 1,020
      in the control group and 1,020 in the intervention group). This design will allow us to
      assess the intervention's effects on the incidence, recovery and recurrence rates of MAM/SAM.
