      reduce the number of infectious complications, mortality and ICU length of stay in trauma ICU
      patients. To achieve this objective we have designed this pilot study to obtain the necessary
      data to design a bigger trial in the future.

      Other objectives include:

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of glutamine in different patients regarding their severity:
           patients with an Injury Severity Score> 25 and patients with lower plasma levels of
           glutamine.

        -  To registry the possible adverse events of the endovenous administration of glutamine.
