    
      This study is a randomized controlled trial that compares the operative outcomes and
      complications of fluoroscopic guided-percutaneous nephrolithotomy versus ultrasound-guided
      PCNL for renal stones. This study will be a prospective randomized controlled clinical trial
      with patients who have already agreed to undergo PCNL. Patients will be randomized at a 1:1
      ratio to receive either PCNL under fluoroscopic guidance or PCNL under ultrasound guidance.
      Patients will be asked to complete pre-operative, and postoperative quality of life
      questionnaires, and to allow the collection of one additional vial of blood for measurement
      of factors associated with inflammation.
