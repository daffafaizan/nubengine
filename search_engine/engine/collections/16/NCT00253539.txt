        -  Compare the effect of arzoxifene vs tamoxifen vs placebo on surrogate endpoints
           biomarkers, especially systemic insulin-like growth factor levels, in women at high risk
           for breast cancer.

        -  Compare the toxic effects, biologic effects, clinical pharmacology, and pharmacodynamics
           of these drugs in these participants.

        -  Determine the effect of these drugs on surrogate endpoint biomarkers in participants
           with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations.

        -  Determine the feasibility of a chemoprevention study in participants with a strong
           family history of breast cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Participants are
      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Participants receive oral tamoxifen once daily.

        -  Arm II: Participants receive oral arzoxifene once daily.

        -  Arm III: Participants receive an oral placebo once daily. In all arms, treatment
           continues for 6 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
           After the completion of 6 months of treatment, participants are offered the opportunity
           to continue treatment with their assigned study drug for an additional 6 months.
           Participants randomized to receive placebo are offered treatment with arzoxifene for an
           additional 6 months.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed annually.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 participants will be accrued for this study.
