    
      This is a Randomised-controlled trial .The investigators recruited 100 women who are known to
      have thin endometrium in previous IVF cycles (failed/cancelled cycles).

      They are randomised into group A (50 women) : preparation of the endometrium with Estradiol
      valerate 2mg/day (every 8 hours)(white tablets of cycloprogenova,Payer,Germany) from the
      first day of the cycle till 12th day and The investigators add placebo from the first day of
      the cycle till the day of starting progesterone (It will be stopped 3 days before embryo
      transfer).Group B (50 women): The investigators add Sildenafil citrate (Viagra,pfizer,United
      states) to the estradiol valerate. Sildenafil 50 mg will be used daily from the first day of
      the cycle till the day of starting progesterone (It will be stopped 3 days before embryo
      transfer). The embryos will be transferred depending on their age on day 3 or day 5.

      At the transfer date ,the investigators will assess the endometrial thickness, endometrial
      volume, uterine artery doppler indices (RI,PI) as well as 3D endometrial vascular indices
      (VI,FI,VFI) .
