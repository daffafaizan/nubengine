      technology. Existing standard therapy is inadequate for some people, because even after years
      of surgery many implant users does not obtain significant benefits, like improved
      understanding of spoken sentences. In many cases it seems that the speech comprehension
      deficits are linked to particular cognitive functions in cochlear implant users, including
      memory and attention. In this study we will test whether a computer-based set of "cognitive
      fitness" or "brain training" games designed to improve memory and attention will help
      cochlear implant and hearing aid users to understand speech better.

      Cochlear implant and hearing aid users will complete 10 weeks of computer-based cognitive
      training on their home computers. Half of participants will do this training immediately
      after being enrolled in the study; the other half will receive the training beginning 10
      weeks after they are enrolled. Speech comprehension and cognitive abilities will be assessed
      at baseline, 10, 20 and 30 weeks in all participants.
