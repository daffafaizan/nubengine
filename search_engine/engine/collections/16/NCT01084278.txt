    
      40 male and female subjects will be enrolled in the study and stratified into one of five
      groups based on their renal status as determined from creatinine clearance (CrCL) estimated
      using the serum creatinine (sCR) and the Cockcroft-Gault and Modified Diet in Renal Disease
      (MDRD) equations as follows: Treatment group 1 - healthy adults with normal renal function
      (CrCL/eGFR> 90 mL/min); Treatment groups 2, 3 and 4 - patients with mild (CrCL/eGFR 60-89
      mL/min), moderate (CrCL/eGFR 30 to 59 mL/min), and severe (CrCL/eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min) renal
      impairment, respectively; and Treatment group 5 - subjects with end-stage renal disease
      requiring hemodialysis. On study day 1, participants in Treatment Groups 1 to 4 will be
      administered one colchicine 0.6 mg tablet at 8 a.m. under standard fasting conditions. Blood
      samples will be collected from all participants before dosing and both blood and urine
      samples will be collected for 120 hours post-dose on a confined basis at times sufficient to
      adequately define the pharmacokinetics of colchicine and its primary metabolites. There will
      be two study periods for treatment group 5; Period 1 off dialysis and Period 2 on dialysis
      with a 14 day washout period between the two study periods. On study day 1, participants in
      treatment group 5 will be administered one colchicine 0.6 mg tablet under standard fasting
      conditions immediately following dialysis. Blood samples will be collected from all
      participants before dosing and for up to 70 hours post-dose at times sufficient to adequately
      determine the pharmacokinetics of colchicine and its primary metabolites. All adverse events
      will be evaluated by the investigator and reported in the participant's case report form.
