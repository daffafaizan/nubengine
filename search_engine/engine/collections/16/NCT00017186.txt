        -  Determine the antitumor activity of gemcitabine and epirubicin in patients with
           malignant pleural mesothelioma.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in this patient population.

        -  Determine the time to progression and overall survival of patients treated with this
           regimen.

        -  Assess quality of life in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and epirubicin IV on day 1.
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses
      beyond CR.

      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to course 3, at 3 months, and then at 1 year.

      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, and then every 6
      months for 3 years.
