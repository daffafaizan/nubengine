      before or within five days from date of transbronchial biopsies (BTB). It will include a
      noninvasive collection of exhaled breath for VOC analysis. VOC analysis will be conducted
      using two types of devices: "electronic nose" and mass spectrometry.

      200 bi-lung transplanted patients will be enrolled and divided into two groups.

        -  Group A, Acute rejection: 100 patients. Diagnosis of acute rejection retained on
           transbronchial biopsies or functional anomalies with the necessity of modifying the
           immunosuppressive regimen.

        -  Group B, control: 100 patients. Patients without respiratory functional abnormality and
           normal transbronchial biopsy.

      VOC, detected by electronic nose and identified by mass spectrometry, will be compared
      between patients with a confirmed diagnosis of acute rejection (group A) and patients without
      rejection (control group B)

      The duration of participation of each patient is 1 day. The duration of the inclusion period
      is estimated at 54 months from the first inclusion. The expected total duration of the
      research is 54 months
