      year, with non-traumatic thoracic pain in a pre-hospital setting. While the ambulance or MUG
      is transporting such a patient, he/she is asked (informed consent) if an extra blood sample
      can be taken for measuring troponin levels by the portable device of Roche (cobas h232Â®).
      This can be done during the same venipuncture needed for standard-of-care analysis of the two
      other blood samples used for troponin-T by the radiometer and the laboratory. An ECG is
      performed in the ambulance and when it is positive, a patient is diagnosed immediately with
      acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and will be to transported as fast as possible to the
      coronary care unit. The blood samples retrieved in the ambulance are transported to the lab
      and to the table top radiometer in the emergency unit. As stated before, an increasing number
      of patients with AMI are presenting without significant abnormalities on ECG. Therefore, the
      troponin-T levels in the blood sample will provide extra information to make an appropriate
      diagnosis. It is our hypothesis, that the Cobas h232 device will provide faster results and
      thus a faster diagnosis of AMI which benefit patients' outcome.
