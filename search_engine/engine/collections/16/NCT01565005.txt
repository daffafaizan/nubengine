    
      Phenotyping study on 2 different cohorts of rare disease affected patients:

        -  Group1: MCPH (including different MCPH subtypes)

        -  Group2: Fanconi Anemia (with or without microcephaly)

      Inclusion criteria:

      Common to each group:

        -  Age > 3 years

        -  Access to french "Social Security"

        -  No contraindication for MRI

      Group1:

        -  Primary microcephaly without gross malformation within or extra nervous central system

        -  OFC < -2SD at birth and < -3 SD after age 6months

        -  Mutation in one MCPH gene

      Group2:

      Proven Fanconi Anemia with:

        -  Positive chromosome breakage blood test

        -  One of the 3 following elements:

      FANCD2 positive test Fibroblast sensitivity to mitomycin Mutation in one FANC gene

      Control subjects:

        -  No antecedent

        -  Normal education

      Aims:

        1. Description of neurological, neuropsychological and radiological phenotype for each
           group

        2. Phenotype comparison:

             -  groups 1&2

             -  group1 or 2 with control subjects

             -  different MCPH subtypes within group1

             -  with or without microcephaly within group2

        3. Epidemiological data on these rare diseases in our population

      Protocol:

      Patients from both groups and control subjects will be evaluated in CIC for 1 day Â½. They
      will be examined by a child neurologist and a geneticist. All of them will have cranial MRI
      (1.5Tesla). Neuropsychological assessment will be performed (Wechsler scales) for patients
      and control subjects.
