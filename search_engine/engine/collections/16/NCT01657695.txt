      hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) receive an additional score depending on size of the tumor and
      the time spent in transplant waiting list. However, the advantage given to these patients is
      uniform and does not take into account the profound biological heterogeneity of individual
      HCCs. To make the additional score righteous, the investigators need to identify patients
      with aggressively growing HCC who require salvage transplantation while those with
      slow-growing HCC do not deserve the additional score.

      All cirrhotics with suspect HCC identified at routine US screening will be therefore enrolled
      in the prospective imaging and bio-molecular study.

      They will be subjected to two computed tomography (CT) exams at 7 weeks interval to define
      fractional tumor growth and imaging traits, baseline US-guided liver biopsy for microarray
      and histochemical characterization, serum sampling for cytokine assay. Survival, disease-free
      survival after downstaging and transplant outcome will be recorded and analyzed in relation
      with imaging and molecular data. The investigators expect to set up an accurate imaging and
      molecular diagnostic tool able to identify patients with aggressive HCC requiring urgent
      access to transplant, reliable in predicting survival, standardisable and not too expensive.
