      to treat. The current use of femoral nerve block by ropivacain pump for 48 hours provides
      considerable analgesia, but patients often experience slight motor block, inhibiting
      rehabilitation, and pain in the posterior part of the knee, innervated by the sciatic nerve.
      This study compares femoral nerve block to a new technique, where ropivacaine, ketorolac and
      adrenalin is used to infiltrate the tissue in and around the knee joint during surgery, and
      is injected by an intraarticular catheter at 10 pm on the day of surgery and again at 10 am
      the day after. Data of pain scores, analgesia consumption, adverse effects and mobilisation
      is collected for the first four postoperative days.
