      replacement therapy and will last one year (12 months).

      Participants will be asked to strictly follow the individually-prescribed eating regimen,
      which will include shakes (breakfast and lunch) and pre-packaged frozen entr√©e meals for
      dinner, two servings of fruit, and three servings of vegetables per day. Daily caloric
      allotment will be tailored for each individual (number of shakes and frozen meals) by
      calculating the average daily caloric deficit necessary to achieve negative energy balance
      (using the metabolic rate/energy expenditure data). Shakes/meals will be provided free of
      charge - fruits/vegetables will be purchased by the participants. Guidance will be provided
      regarding the use of the meal replacement shakes at school, and participants will be
      encouraged to engage in family meal sessions despite eating different foods.

      We will measure the changes in resting metabolic rate, traditional clinical risk markers (TG,
      HDL-c, LDL-c, TC, glucose, insulin), vascular function, weight-related quality of life, and
      physical activity.
