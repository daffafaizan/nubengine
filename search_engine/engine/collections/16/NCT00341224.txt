      However, no group mentoring programs have been evaluated. The purpose of this study is to
      assess the efficacy of a school-based, group-mentoring intervention designed to prevent
      aggressive and deviant behavior among early adolescents. Two successive cohorts of incoming
      6th grade students from two inner-city Baltimore middle schools and their parents will be
      randomized to comparison group or intervention group consisting of weekly group-mentoring
      sessions for youth and persuasive communication and small-group media-development projects
      for parents.
