      malignant. The clinical manifestations of OSMF comprise of white, marble-like appearance of
      the oral mucosa with loss of flexibility and formation of palpable fibrous bands extending
      from the anterior to the posterior region of the oral cavity.Other features include burning
      sensation on taking spicy food, loss of papillae of the tongue, loss of natural pigmentation
      of the lips and restricted mouth opening.

      There is no definitive treatment available for OSMF due to its complex etiology. The most
      essential component in the management of OSMF is the discontinuation of the habit of areca
      nut chewing by the patient followed by conservative or surgical treatment. Currently,
      steroids are the most commonly used drug group in managing OSMF because of their ability to
      reduce the inflammatory process and increasing the apoptosis of inflammatory cells thereby
      decreasing fibrosis. However, they are not very useful in reversing the pathology and
      restoring mucosal elasticity and can cause mucosal thinning with long term use ultimately
      resulting in worsening of the symptoms of the disease.

      Many in- vitro and in- vivo studies have been conducted to establish the anti neoplastic,
      anti inflammatory, immunomodulatory, antihypertensive, antimicrobial, anti-parasitic,
      antioxidant and hypoglycemic properties of N.sativa oil. Among all the constituents of
      Nigella sativa, Thymoquinone (Tq) is the most pharmacologically active constituent
      responsible for most of its properties. Nigella sativa has been used widely in different food
      preparations in the form of a flavoring agent or a spice. It is also recognized as 'safe' in
      the inventory of United States Food and Drug administration.
