      naturally progresses towards an increasingly pronounced insulin deficiency that leads to the
      need for pancreatic replacement, by administering insulin.

      Type 1 diabetes (T1D) requires a complete and immediate substitution of pancreatic insulin
      secretion. Currently, patients need to be involved in managing their disease by deciding how
      much insulin to administer based on the results of glucose monitoring. Artificial
      intelligence, thanks to a self-learning algorithm, enables the automation and customization
      of insulin administration. These devices, known as closed loops, bring real benefit to the
      patients included in the studies, by improving glycemic balance, by decreasing the number of
      hypo- and hyperglycemia but also by decreasing the mental load associated with the disease,
      improving their quality of life.

      These very significant benefits in the T1D treatment open the possibility of obtaining
      similar benefits in the T2D treated by the basal-bolus type insulin regimen. This study aims
      to develop a specific algorithm of T2D to meet its particular characteristics.

      The objective of this study is to collect the evolution of blood glucose levels in T2D
      patients under different conditions of their daily life: physical activity, meals, sleep,
      etc. This data will be used to develop a test bench to evaluate insulin delivery algorithms
      to treat patients with insulin-resistant T2D using a closed loop.
