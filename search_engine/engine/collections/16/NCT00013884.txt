      it is now clear that it cannot completely eradicate HIV from infected individuals. We have
      also recently begun to appreciate more fully the scope of toxicities and inconveniences
      associated with HAART medications leading to difficulties with adherence. Thus, long-term use
      of HAART may be problematic in many HIV-infected individuals. These realizations have led to
      a search for strategies to shift the focus from eradication to suppression of HIV replication
      while reducing toxicity and enhancing compliance. One approach to achieve these goals is to
      attempt to find strategies that allow for prolonged periods off HAART medications. Recently,
      Trimeris corporation has developed T-20, an inhibitor of HIV fusion to T-cells, a step
      required to spread virus from cell to cell. This new class of therapy, which has little
      recognized toxicity, could be used to allow patients to discontinue HAART medications for
      prolonged periods of time. In this intent to treat pilot study, we propose to evaluate the
      ability of T-20 to slow or prevent rebound of plasma HIV RNA when HAART medications are
      interrupted for a single 6 week period. The information obtained through this investigation
      could provide important insights into novel therapeutic strategies for HIV infection.
