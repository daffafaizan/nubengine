        1. The method of measuring non-invasive peripheral physiological parameters such as Pulse,
           Blood Pressure, Blood pH, SpO2, CO2, Hemoglobin, Blood Glucose, Hematocrit and
           additional physiological parameters is based on the color distribution of a human
           tissue. SoftTouch is a finger-mounted device incorporated a dedicated light source and a
           color image sensor similar to a digital camera. The light transverses and is reflected
           from the tissue under consideration. Analyzing the tissue color distribution of the
           sampled real-time video in the frequency color space time domain may provide certain
           information about the biomarkers and vital-signs under consideration. The current
           study's goal is to find out if the results accuracy are satisfactory compared with
           regulatory cleared devices by the FDA and other notified bodies.

        2. The Patient signals shall be recorded as is for algorithm improvement, future research
           of additional bio parameters and calibration.

        3. the device is declared calibrated if executed successfully on the entire recorded data.

        4. for non invasive blood glucose the device shall be provided to selected diabetic
           patients for the own use at home.
