    
      Multi-centre, phase II, open-label, 12-month clinical trial for patients that previously
      received a vascular-targeted photodynamic treatment (VTP) with WST09 (Tookad) and still have
      histological findings (prostate biopsies) indicating the presence of localized cancer.

      The WST09-mediated VTP procedure consists of an I.V. infusion of WST09 (Tookad) at 2 mg/kg,
      in combination with the per-cutaneous interstitial delivery of monochromatic laser light (of
      a wavelength of 763nm) via the trans-perineal implantation of illumination fibres, positioned
      in the prostatic lobes.

      In a previous Tookad trial, escalating doses of laser light were used with a fixed dose of
      WST09 (2 mg/kg) in patients with localized prostatic cancer. Patients who underwent the
      procedure but still have positive prostate biopsies (residual cancer) may benefit from an
      additional WTS09-mediated VTP procedure. Thus, the aim of this study is to treat patients
      still presenting with localized prostate cancer with a second WST09-mediated VTP procedure.
