      Transplantation Program have been treated on the research protocol, A Two Step Approach To
      Reduced Intensity Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation for Hematologic
      Malignancies from HLA Partially-Matched Related Donors (TJU 2 Step RIC, TJU IRB# 06U.328) as
      of July, 2010. While treatment on this protocol has resulted in durable responses for many
      older patients and younger, heavily pretreated patients with hematological malignancies, poor
      performance status at the time of transplant and morbidities related to cyclophosphamide (CY)
      administration in the regimen have contributed to decreased survival. In addition, disease
      relapse after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) has been a major cause of
      mortality for those patients with disease at the time of transplant.

      The objective of this research is to improve patient outcomes after treatment on the TJU 2
      Step RIC protocol by refining the approach based on outcomes observed in the initial trial.
      More thorough assessment of performance status prior to HSCT and the substitution of the
      alkylating agent Melphalan (MEL) for CY to decrease CY-related toxicity while strengthening
      the anti-leukemic intensity of the regimen for patients with poor-risk disease will be the
      major strategies used to increase the efficacy of the regimen. MEL has shown efficacy against
      myeloid malignancies when used in conditioning in RIC HSCT. Patients with AML and MDS were
      the most common group treated on the initial TJU 2 Step RIC trial and also comprise the
      largest patient group treated in the TJU Medical Oncology Program.
