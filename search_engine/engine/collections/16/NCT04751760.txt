      investigate the physiopathology of allergies. This method is achieved mainly by the ImmunoCAP
      enzyme immunoassay technique. This is an expensive test that requires a significant amount of
      blood. This is a limitation particularly in children. The time to get the results is long and
      a second consultation has to be scheduled in order to communicate the results to the
      patients. The main objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of a new specific IgE
      assay, named LuLISA, using a bioluminescence technique in urine and blood samples from
      pediatric and adult allergic population. This technique was recently published for the
      quantification of IgE against two peanut allergens and needs to be extended for the detection
      of other major allergens. A secondary objective is the evaluation of the time needed to
      obtain results.
