      Primary

        -  Determine the pathologic complete response in patients with adenocarcinoma of the
           esophagus or gastroesophageal junction treated with neoadjuvant therapy comprising
           capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and radiotherapy.

      Secondary

        -  Determine the clinical response rate in patients treated with this regimen.

        -  Determine the recurrence rate, time to progression, and patterns of failure in patients
           treated with this regimen.

        -  Characterize the toxicity profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE:

        -  Induction therapy: Patients receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14 and
           oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2
           courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Combination chemoradiotherapy: Patients then receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours once
           weekly for 6 weeks. Patients also receive concurrent oral capecitabine twice daily and
           undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5Â½ weeks in the absence of disease
           progression or unacceptable toxicity.

        -  Surgery: Patients undergo surgical resection at 4-8 weeks after completion of
           chemoradiotherapy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.
