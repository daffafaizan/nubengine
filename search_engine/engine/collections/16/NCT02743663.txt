      significant burden on the health care system (refn). No objective preschool asthma diagnostic
      tools exist, and the current gold-standard, the Asthma Predictive Index, does not provide
      information about lung function and symptom management. In this study, it is hypothesized
      that the lung clearance index (LCI), a value derived from the multiple breath washout test,
      will be the most sensitive, responsive discriminative test for preschool asthma. If it proves
      useful in the monitoring and diagnosis of preschool asthma, LCI has the potential to improve
      the clinical management and thus potentially significantly reduce hospitalization rates for
      preschool children suffering with asthma. In this unique data set, the investigators will
      also compare the relative utility of the forced oscillation technique (FOT) and preschool
      spirometry with the LCI in order to detect abnormalities amongst those children at high risk
      for preschool asthma. In addition, the impact of sleep apnea as a risk factor for and
      modifier of asthma will be investigated in this study. Furthermore, changes to the
      composition of the nasal microbiome during and after a wheezing episodes and the role of
      viral infections in wheezing exacerbations will be explored. Finally, the utility of new
      methods of diagnosing food allergy, such as the basophil activation test, will be examined in
      this Canadian cohort.
