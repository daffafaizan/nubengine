      FOLFOX in patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and non-fit for FOLFIRINOX.
      Adults fulfilling inclusion criteria and non-inclusion criteria will be randomized between a
      FOLFOX arm and a gemcitabine arm. The primary endpoint is the overall survival (OS) at 24
      months. The secondary objectives are : objective response rate and disease control rate
      (RECIST v1.1, in case of evaluable lesion), duration of response, duration of disease
      control, progression free survival (PFS), the evolution of biomarkers Ca 19-9 and CEA under
      treatment, the toxicities according to International Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse
      Events (CTCAE) version 4.0, the safety of both arms, the quality of life, the dose intensity
      (DI) of each protocol, the Quality-Adjusted Survival, and the rate and type of second-line /
      third-line regimens chemotherapy. With an expected median survival time in the control group
      of 5 months, an accrual period of 3 years and a minimum follow-up period of 2 years, a total
      of 199 patients per group are required to detect a hazard ratio of 0.75 based on a 5%
      two-sided type I error rate and a power of 80%, leading to a total number of 400 patients to
      include.
