        -  Patient could be enrolled up to 2 weeks post CRT-D implant and are followed for 12
           months post implant with follow-up visits at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months

        -  Patients will be randomized at enrollment to either Group 1 ("QuickOpt Group") or Group
           2 ("Control Group").

        -  Group 1 - The patient's device is programmed to sequential biventricular pacing mode
           with AV/PV and VV delays optimized using QuickOpt. For Group 1 patients, optimization
           using QuickOpt is performed at enrollment, 3 month, 6 month, 9 month, 12 month and at
           any unscheduled follow-up visits.

        -  Group 2 - The patient's device is programmed to either simultaneous or sequential BiV
           pacing mode as per physician's discretion. The AV/PV and inter-ventricular (VV) delays
           could be programmed empirically or optimized using any non-IEGM based method as per
           sites standard of care. However, the Group 2 patients can be optimized only once within
           the first 4 weeks post implant. Any AV/PV and VV delay optimizations performed after 4
           weeks post implant in Group 2 patients will be considered protocol deviations.
