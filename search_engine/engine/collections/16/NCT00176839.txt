      exposure to infectious agents.

      Prior to transplantation, they will receive BUSULFAN via the central venous line, four times
      a day for four days, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE via the central venous line once a day for two days,
      and MELPHALAN via the central venous line for one day. Busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and
      melphalan are given to destroy the subject's cancer. As well, these drugs will destroy their
      immune system to help ensure the new stem cells take and grow after transplantation.

      On the day of transplantation, umbilical cord blood from the donor will be transfused via
      venous line. These new cells will replace the subject's bone marrow.

      After transplantation, the subjects will receive Cyclosporin A and either MMF or MTX

      Isolation will be continued until adequate numbers of cells are present in the blood to fight
      infection. Subjects will be discharged from the hospital when medically ready. They will be
      expected to return for follow-up to the blood and marrow transplant clinic at specific dates
      as determined by physicians.
