    
      Rationale: The three big 'killers' in parturients, peripartum hemorrhage, sepsis and
      pre-eclampsia all predispose to pulmonary complications. These complications affect
      management before, during and after the primary obstetric problem has been solved. A timely
      diagnosis and thorough follow-up of pulmonary complications may benefit parturients. Lung
      ultrasound (LUS) is a point-of-care imaging bedside tool increasingly used in the critical
      care setting that may prove useful in parturients.

      Objective: To describe frequency, timing and type of pulmonary complications detected with
      LUS in critically ill parturients in a high-dependency unit (HDU), and to determine the
      association with outcome.

      Hypotheses: Pulmonary complications detected by LUS are frequent in parturients admitted to a
      HDU in a resource-limited setting, and are associated with hospital mortality.

      Study design: A prospective observational study. Study population: Critically ill parturients
      admitted to the HDU of the Princess Christian Maternity Hospital (PCMH) in Freetown, Sierra
      Leone.

      Sample size: No formal sample size calculation is performed. Based on current rates of
      admissions to the HDU of the PCMH the investigators expect to perform LUS in at least 125
      patients.

      Methods: A trained physician performs all 12-region LUS investigations. LUS is performed at
      admission, after 24 and 48 hours, and when a patient's respiratory condition deteriorates.
      LUS findings are reported using a standardized semi-quantitative visual LUS scoring method.

      Main study parameters/primary endpoints: The proportion of critically ill parturients
      admitted to the HDU of the PCMH with pulmonary complications detected by LUS, including
      interstitial syndrome, pulmonary consolidation, and pleural effusion.
