    
      Each centre put in place two methods of identification of past Tako-tsubo caes:

        -  Each local PI received a NSS list containing CHI numbers of all patients coded under
           Code I42.8, which is for "Other Cardiomyopathies" in the ICD 10 system.

        -  Each local PI also enabled a search method in their cardiac catheterisation reporting
           software in order to identify remaining cases.

      The Research Fellow travels to the designated sites to carry out the following work:

        -  Cross-check all electronic records of all CHI numbers returned from the NSS to identify
           only the Tako-tsubo cases from all cases returned under Code I42.8 to each individual
           local PI.

        -  Carry out searches in the cardiac catheterisation software of each hospital to identify
           the remaining cases.

        -  Identify an equal number of MI controls from within the Grampian area.

      We will collect clinical data off all Tako-tsubo patients retrospectively and prospectively.
      The STARR study will benefit from the unique electronic linkage of health records in
      Scotland.

      The STARR study database will be used as a stepping stone to large epidemiology and
      mechanistic studies.
