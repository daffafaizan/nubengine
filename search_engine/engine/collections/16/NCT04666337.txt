      as adjuvants for brachial plexus blockade to improve various block characteristics. Moreover,
      limited studies estimate the pons and cons of tramadol versus fentanyl as co-administrator to
      bupivacaine in Ultrasound-guided Supraclavicular Brachial Plexus Blockade.

      In our study, we aim to assess the utility of fentanyl versus tramadol as co-administrator to
      bupivacaine in ultrasound-guided supraclavicular brachial plexus blockade in upper limb
      surgeries in a prospective randomized controlled fashion. The primary outcome is to compare
      between the efficacy of tramadol versus fentanyl as adjuvants on the onset and duration of
      sensory and motor block and the secondary outcome is to compare between the efficacy of
      tramadol versus fentanyl as adjuvants on postoperative analgesia, time of the request to
      rescue analgesia, postoperative analgesic consumption, and complications.

      The patients were aged between 18 and 60, both gender, and the American Society of
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I/II. However, patients who had bleeding disorders
      got opioid analgesics or monoamine oxidase inhibitors before surgery, had a history of
      seizures, respiratory or cardiac diseases, local infections at the site where needle for the
      block is to be inserted, pregnant woman and in whom the block effect was partial and required
      supplementary anesthesia were excluded from the study.

      Patients were randomly allocated into three groups for ultrasound-guided supraclavicular
      brachial plexus block. Randomization was established using the computer-generated closed
      envelopes method.

      Group B (bupivacaine group): patients received 20 ml bupivacaine 0.5% plus 2 ml normal saline
      Group F (fentanyl group): patients received 20 ml bupivacaine 0.5% plus fentanyl (1Âµg/kg-2
      ml) Group T (tramadol group): patients received 20 ml bupivacaine 0.5% plus tramadol
      (1mg/kg-2 ml)
