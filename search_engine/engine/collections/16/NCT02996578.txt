      numbers of people compared to those who have already been diagnosed with conditions on the
      dementia spectrum (Deary et al, 2009). Hence, an active effort looking at potential lifestyle
      factor modification interventions to help maintain cognitive well-being are warranted.

      With an ageing population, the prevalence of cognitive syndromes such as Alzheimer's disease
      and Parkinson's disease increases (Vauzour, 2012). Nutritional interventions can play a role
      in successful ageing by helping to delay the onset of age-related conditions (Hendrickx,
      McEwen & van der Ouderaa, 2005; Brown, Riby & Reay, 2009; Monti, Moulton & Cohen, 2015).
      Studies have investigated the potential role of polyphenols as part of a neuroprotective
      lifestyle. Mouse model studies have looked at varying polyphenol sources such as tea (Haque
      et al., 2006; Kaur et al., 2008), blueberry (Shukitt-Hale et al., 2015; Williams et al.,
      2008), Gingko Biloba (Shif et al., 2008) and cocoa (Bisson et al., 2008) to mention a few.

      Ageing and neurodegenerative diseases are caused by neuronal death which in turn can be
      triggered by neurotoxins, neuroinflammation and specific genetic mutations (Bishop, Lu &
      Yankner, 2010). Dietary polyphenols have been observed to provide neuroprotection against
      cellular alteration by modulating the neuronal function against endogenous neurotoxins and
      inhibition of glial induced neuroinflammation (Vauzour, 2012).
