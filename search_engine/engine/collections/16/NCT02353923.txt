      on mild to moderate nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy. In this condition blood vessels in
      the back of the eye, an area termed the retina, are deteriorating. OcuStem contains
      ingredients that have previously been demonstrated in clinical trials to stimulate a type of
      cell, called "endothelial progenitor cells" to increase in circulation. Animal studies have
      shown that increasing endothelial progenitor cell numbers inhibits progression of diabetic
      retinopathy. The hypothesis of the study is that a 6 month course of OcuStem will reduce
      progression of mild to moderate diabetic retinopathy.
