      I. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of HPV testing using different methods of
      detection, including HPV Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2), HPV messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) assays
      (APTIMA) and OncoHealth HPV E6/E7 oncoprotein assay and whether they improve the screening
      performance of routine anal cytology for the detection of anal high-grade squamous
      intraepithelial lesions (HSIL) when measured against the gold standard, biopsy-proven HSIL.

      II. To determine the prevalence and risk factors for prevalent HSIL in HIV-infected women.

      III. To determine incidence and risk factors associated with anal HSIL and HPV over 2 years
      among HIV infected women undergoing semi-annual anal evaluations.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the acceptability of anal cancer screening among HIV-infected women.

      II. To collect data on quality of life and health care costs (including non-direct health
      care costs and time costs) for an economic evaluation of the cost-effectiveness of anal
      cancer screening strategies in HIV-positive women.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo screening for the detection of HSIL using anal cytology, HPV hybrid capture
      2, HPV mRNA assays, and OncoHealth HPVE6/E7 oncoprotein at baseline, at 12 and 24 months.
