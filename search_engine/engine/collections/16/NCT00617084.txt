      international, non-inferiority, open-label study with 2300 patients at 15-20 centers. The
      study is a "real world, all comers" study.

      Primary objective: to compare the Medtronic Endeavor-Resolute (Zotarolimus-Eluting stent)
      system with the Abbott XIENCE V (Everolimus-Eluting stent) system with respect to cardiac
      death, myocardial infarction (not clearly attributable to a non-target vessel), Target Lesion
      Revascularization at 1 year in a "real world" patient population.

      Study hypothesis: To determine whether the Zotarolimus-Eluting stent (Medtronic
      Endeavor-Resolute) is non-inferior to the Everolimus-eluting stent (Abbott XIENCE V) in terms
      of the primary endpoint at 12 months after stent implantation.
