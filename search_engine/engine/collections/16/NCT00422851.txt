      that addd or remove gas moles from the relatively fixed volume ME cavity change its pressure.
      Experimental results from animal studies document significant gas exchange across the
      tympanic membrane and if confirmed for humans may explain some of the paradoxical findings
      for children with poor Eustachian tube function such as the preservation of an aerated ME
      when the normal routes of gas supply are disrupted. This study measures the rates of reactive
      and inert gas exchange across the adult tympanic membrane with and without structural
      abnormalities and determines if these transfers are purely diffusive phenomena. The resulting
      data will be used to develop species-specific rate-constants that will be used as parameters
      in modeling ME pressure regulation.
