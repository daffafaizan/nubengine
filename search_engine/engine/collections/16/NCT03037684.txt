      NaV1.7 channels. In this case electrical stimulation may provoke pain already with very low
      currency intensity which normally not provoke pain in healthy subjects. This may be
      predictive for pain relief due to the sodium channel blocker lidocaine 5% patch.

      The study will characterize pain states in peripheral neuropathic pain as well as within the
      painful scar in chronic postoperative pain with regard to the involvement of NaV1.7 channels.

      In addition, the pain site in chronic postoperative pain (scar) will be characterized by
      laser-evoked potentials (LEP) and quantitative sensory testing (QST).

      Pain related questionnaires will be obtained.
