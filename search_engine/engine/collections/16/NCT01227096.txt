      Electroacupuncture was administered on the bilateral P6 acupoint after anesthesia induction,
      but prior to surgery in EAPC group. Control patients underwent sham placement of the
      electrode the arm without stimulation. The duration of cardiopulmonary bypass and aortic
      cross-clamp time was recorded. Myocardial injury was assessed by cardiac heart-type fatty
      acid-binding protein (HFAP) and cardiac troponin I (cTnI>0.40 ng/mL). 8-isoprostane ,
      C-reactive protein, cytokines were measured pre- and postoperatively.
