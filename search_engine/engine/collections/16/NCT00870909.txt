      stimulation (tDCS) in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. tDCS permit the
      application of an extremely weak continuous electrical current to the brain through an anode
      and a cathode applied on the scalp. Anodal stimulation appears to increase brain activity
      whereas cathodal stimulation has the opposite effect.

      Using anodal & cathodal tDCS the investigators aimed to treat auditory hallucinations, a
      symptoms of schizophrenia. The investigators plan to apply tDCS such that it can
      simultaneously increased activity in the frontal brain areas and reduce activity over
      temporoparietal cortex, 2 areas involved in the physiopathology of the disease. Real active
      stimulation will be compare to a sham condition in 60 patients (30 in each group). 30
      patients will be included in a French center (Hospital le Vinatier, sponsor of the study) and
      30 in Tunisia (laboratory "vulnerability to psychosis" (Pr Gaha) Ã  Monastir).
