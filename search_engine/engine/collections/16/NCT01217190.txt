      crossover study conducted in healthy adult male and female volunteers. Subjects checked into
      the study center on Day -1 of each study period at least 12 hours prior to dosing on Day 1.
      Subjects were served dinner between 8:00 pm to 8:30 pm to ensure minimum 10 hours fast prior
      to dosing in both periods. Subjects received the 2 treatments in a randomized order with a
      7-day washout between the 2 periods.

      Treatment A: single dose of ondansetron ODFS 8 mg was orally administered, allowed to
      dissolve, swallowed with saliva, followed with 240 mL room temperature drinking water

      Treatment B: single dose of Zofran ODT (containing ondansetron 8 mg) was orally administered,
