        -  Determine the disease-free survival and overall survival of patients with high-risk
           stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck treated with adjuvant
           chemoradiotherapy comprising docetaxel and cisplatin.

        -  Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.

        -  Categorize the site(s) of disease relapse in patients treated with this regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 and cisplatin IV
      over 1.5 hours on days 1, 22, and 43. Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily on days 1-5,
      8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, 36-40, and 43-45. Treatment continues in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression and then every 6 months for up
      to 3 years from registration.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study within 17.5-23.5
      months.
