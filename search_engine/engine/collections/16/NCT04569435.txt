    
      In this Phase 2a, multi-center, open label, proof-of-biology study of ANX005 will be
      administered to up to approximately 24 subjects with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) for
      up to 12 weeks.

      Induction Dose: Each subject will receive induction dosing of ANX005 on Days 1 and 5 or 6
      (5/6).

      Maintenance Dose: Each subject will receive a maintenance dose of ANX005 every 2 weeks (Weeks
      2, 4, 6, 8, and 10). Maintenance doses are expected to be completed over approximately 4-5
      hours.

      Follow-up visits will be on Weeks 12, 16, and 24. All subjects will be contacted by phone 6
      months after study completion.
