      center either in person or through a relative between 01 December 2014 and 01 August 2017
      were enrolled in the study. All patients were seen either in our center or in their homes,
      and informed consents were obtained. Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) consisting of
      detailed history and examination, drug consumption information, Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist
      Circumference (WC), Timed Up & Go test (TUG), Clock Drawing Test (CD), Activities of Daily
      Living and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living scales (ADL & IADL), Mini Mental State
      Examination (MMSE), Tinetti Gait and Tinetti Balance scores (TG &TB), 30 items Geriatric
      Depression Scale (GDS) was performed for each subject[8-16]. Additional tests like blood
      examinations or ECG were performed on the basis of necessity. Metabolic Syndrome (MS) was
      diagnosed according to WHO criteria [17].

      Data were evaluated by PASW 17. The amount of medicines that the patient used everyday (Daily
      Drug Consumption-DDC) were dependent variable. Relationships between DDC and other continuous
      variables were examined by Pearson's correlation. For categorical independent variables,
      t-tests were performed. The variables which were found associated with DDC were controlled
      for confounding variables by linear regressions. To avoid collinearity problems, variables
      that were strongly interrelated (like CD and MMSE) were not added to the regression model
      together. For all analyses, the level of significance was assumed as 0.05.
