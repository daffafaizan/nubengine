    
      The specific aims of this protocol are to: 1) determine whether dyads (comprised of an
      overweight / obese cancer survivor and an overweight / obese buddy of his or her choosing)
      lose significantly more weight (kg) at 6-months when assigned to the eHealth intervention
      compared to a wait-listed control; 2) explore between-arm differences in score changes
      between baseline and 6-month follow-up for other key outcomes including measures of adiposity
      (e.g., waist circumference [WC] and body mass index [BMI]), blood pressure, diet quality,
      physical activity, health-related Quality of Life (QoL), physical functioning and
      performance; 3) Assess the impact of the intervention on select biomarkers associated with
      cancer risk and progression, e.g., tumor TNFÎ±, insulin and IGF-1; and, 4) identify predictor
      variables associated with program efficacy, e.g., social support, self-efficacy, risk for
      depression, and dyad partner (spouse, relative, friend/neighbor).

      Cancer survivors and their selected "buddies" who are interested in participating will be
      directed to a website that describes this study in detail. If interested, they will be asked
      to complete an online screener requiring information on race/ethnicity, gender, state of
      residence and eligibility criteria. Once interested participants are assessed for
      eligibility, consented and enrolled, they will be asked to complete online questionnaires
      that assess physical activity, dietary intake, health-related quality of life, risk for
      depression, self-efficacy, social support and barriers to diet resources. Finally,
      anthropometric measures, blood pressure, physical performance and circulating biomarkers will
      be collected in participants' homes by visiting study staff (whom the project manager will
      deploy after checking for a mutually convenient time for the 2-person dyad.
