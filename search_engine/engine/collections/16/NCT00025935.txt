      Irritability is a common and impairing clinical presentation in youth (Collishaw et al 2010,
      Leibenluft 2011, Peterson et al 1996). Despite its significant public health impact, the
      clinical course and pathophysiology of irritability remains poorly understood. Chronic and
      severe irritability is the primary symptom of the new DSM-5 diagnosis, disruptive mood
      dysregulation disorder (DMDD) (APA 2013), is an associated symptom of other pediatric
      disorders including Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) (Ambrosini et al 2013,
      Burke et al 2014, Jensen et al 2007, Shaw et al 2014, Stoddard et al 2014), and can be a
      clinical precursor to Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders. In addition,
      irritability is a trait distributed continuously in youth (Stringaris & Taylor 2015), thereby
      fitting well within the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Research Domain Criteria
      (RDoC) initiative (Insel et al 2010).

      Clinically impairing irritability in children and adolescents began to gain more attention as
      interest grew in the diagnosis of pediatric bipolar disorder (Baroni et al 2009, Biederman et
      al 1998, Carlson 1998, Leibenluft et al 2003, Nottelman 2001). Beginning in the 1990s, child
      psychiatry researchers suggested that while pediatric bipolar disorder can present with
      distinct episodes of mania or hypomania as in adults, the more typical pediatric presentation
      was chronic, severe irritability and hyperarousal symptoms. However, data collected under
      this protocol comprise a series of longitudinal (Deveney et al 2015, Stringaris et al 2010),
      family (Brotman et al 2007), behavioral (Dickstein et al 2007, Rich et al 2008b), and
      pathophysiological (Adleman et al 2012, Adleman et al 2011, Brotman et al 2010, Rich et al
      2007, Thomas et al 2014, Thomas et al 2012, Thomas et al 2013, Tseng et al 2016) studies that
      differentiated classically defined episodic pediatric bipolar disorder from chronic
      irritability without distinct manic or hypomanic episodes [see (Leibenluft 2011) for review].
      These findings are consistent with reports from other groups and meta-analyses (Althoff et al
      2014; Copeland et al 2014; Fristad et al 2016; Vidal-Ribas et al 2016).

      Among the several strands of research designed to differentiate pediatric bipolar disorder
      from chronic irritability, longitudinal studies provide the strongest evidence that these two
      phenotypes are distinct. Children with chronic irritability are at elevated risk for later
      depression, but not manic episodes (Althoff et al 2014, Brotman et al 2006, Leibenluft et al
      2006, Stringaris et al 2010, Stringaris et al 2009, Vidal-Ribas et al 2016). Thus, youth with
      MDD (with and without prior DMDD) are an important comparison group to explore, and we are
      examining the developmental trajectory, phenomenology, behavioral correlates, and underlying
      neural mechanisms of chronic irritability and MDD in youth. Further, because irritability and
      ADHD symptoms are highly comorbid in youth (e.g.,Brotman et al., 2006; Costello et al., 2003;
      Shaw et al., 2014), participants with ADHD are an important comparison group in our work on
      irritability.

      The current translational model of irritability emphasizes the role of abnormal threat and
      reward processing, but also underlines the relevance of environmental factors in the
      emergence and maintenance of irritability. More precisely, it is assumed that irritable
      children experience environments, where rewards and punishments are inconsistently delivered
      leading to unintentional reinforcement of disruptive behavior through the parents. Reasons
      for this inconsistent parent behavior could be manifold spanning instrumental learning
      deficits and exaggerated responses to threat and frustrative non-reward in the parents
      themselves as well as lack of knowledge regarding learning principles (Soenens et al., 2006;
      Sanders et al., 1999) and increased levels of stress (Kiff et al., 2011). These factors might
      contribute to instrumental-learning deficits in the children increasing frequency and
      intensity of temper outbursts. Heightened levels of chronic irritability, another symptom of
      DMDD, might be more associated with features of the parent-child interaction. There is a rich
      literature within the framework of attachment theory (Ainsworth et al. 2015, Bolwby, 2008)
      showing that behavior of children with anxious-resistant insecure attachment is characterized
      by a general angry tone and is also associated with increased amygdala responses to negative
      social scenes (Vrticka et al., 2012). In addition, it was also shown that highly irritable
      infants are less sociable in terms of being less responsive and more fearful towards others
      and displaying an angry emotional tone in general as toddlers when they had been insecurely
      attached and more sociable when they had been securely attached (Stupica et al, 2011). Adding
      another layer of complexity, it is also conceivable that inconsistent parent behavior
      diminishes parent s perceived trust-worthiness. This could be of relevance as recent studies
      showed that persons are less willing to delay rewards an action bound to increase levels of
      frustration if their interaction partner is perceived as little reliable (Michaelson, 2013,
      Front Psychol; Michaelson & Munakata, 2016 Dev Science).

      The overall goal is to gain a clearer understanding of the environmental factors contributing
      to irritability in order to inform treatment and improve the outcome for children. As part of
      this overall goal, we plan to collect information on numerous environmental factors. First,
      we plan to investigate parents of youth with DMDD enrolled in this study and subthreshold
      DMDD enrolled in this study in order to determine clinical, behavioral, neuropsychological,
      neurophysiological and neuroanatomical features of the parents that contribute to the
      symptomatology in the children and adolescents. Further, we plan to examine parent-child
      interaction and its influence on irritability observed in the youth. Second, we plan to
      investigate the role of environmental stressors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, on youth s
      irritability symptoms.

      Study population:

      There are 6 separate populations being studied in this protocol:

        1. Children and adolescents between the ages of 7-17 years old who meet criteria for DMDD
           or subthreshold DMDD.

        2. Parents of children and adolescents, who meet criteria for DMDD or subthreshold DMDD and
           are enrolled in 02-M-0021, and are 25 59 years old will be studied.

        3. Healthy volunteer children and adolescents between the ages of 7-17 years old.

        4. Healthy volunteer adults between the ages of 18-25 years old.

        5. Children and adolescents between the ages of 12-17 years old who meet criteria for major
           depressive disorder (MDD).

        6. Children and adolescents between ages of 8-17 years who meet criteria for
           attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) who do not have a mood disorder.

      Design:

      For children and adolescents with full or subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD, this study is an
      outpatient characterization and longitudinal follow-along design. Once determined to be
      eligible, individuals come for an initial assessment, and then return at varying intervals
      until age 25 for clinical interviews, behavioral tasks, and structural and functional MRI.

      For healthy volunteer children, adults and parents of healthy volunteer children, this study
      is an outpatient cross-sectional study that includes clinical interviews, behavioral tasks,
      and structural and functional MRI.

      For all individuals, genetic material from saliva or blood is obtained under protocol
      01-M-0254.

      Outcome measures:

      There are two primary outcome measures. First, this study will examine associations between
      irritability and clinical, behavioral, genetic, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological
      variables in individuals with full or subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD, ADHD, BD (see protocol
      00-M-0198) (Leibenluft et al 2003), anxiety (see protocol 00-M-0192), and healthy volunteers
      (see protocol 00-M-0198). Second, this study will examine between-group differences in
      clinical, behavioral, genetic, neuroanatomical, and neurophysiological variables in
      individuals with full or subthreshold DMDD and/or MDD, ADHD, BD (see protocol 00-M-0198)
      (Leibenluft et al 2003), anxiety (see protocol 00-M-0192), and healthy volunteers (see
      protocol 00-M-0198).
