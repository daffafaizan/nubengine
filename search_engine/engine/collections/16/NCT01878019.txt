      morphine and codeine, reduce pain by binding to opiate receptors in the brain. Another
      chemical, naloxone, can block the effect of these drugs. In this study, we are looking at
      brain responses to a pain-relieving cream and whether naloxone blocks the effect of the
      cream. We will compare the results of people with chronic pain (fibromyalgia) to those of
      people without chronic pain.

      Design:

      The study compares MRI response to painful stimulation between people with fibromyalgia and
      healthy volunteers under two conditions: 1) naloxone, 2) placebo.

      Outcome measures: Pain ratings and pain-related MRI responses are compared between people
      with fibromyalgia and healthy volunteers
