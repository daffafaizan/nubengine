      pulmonary nodules. We have successfully completed and published a phase I/pilot study with 25
      patients demonstrating safety and optimal procedural workflow for combining image-guidance
      with VATS. This phase II clinical study will further expand upon the safety and feasibility
      of this procedure. Additionally, this data will be used to design a phase III comparison
      study between iVATS and standard VATS.
