      whether cherry polyphenols improve peripheral vascular function and cerebral perfusion
      resulting in improved task related brain activation and cognitive function. 30 healthy
      elderly men and women 60-85y years will be recruited to complete 8-week supplementation with
      MC concentrate or an isoenergetic cherry placebo concentrate. Participants will be pair
      matched for age, sex, and cognitive function (Adenbrooke's Cognitive Examination III,
      ACE-III) and then randomised using a sealed envelope system to receive either placebo or
      cherry.
