      study will be treated with induction regimen followed by chemo radiotherapy. Within the
      induction period there are three cycles (Docetaxel + Cisplatin) every 21 days, with follow-up
      post-induction at day 21 after cycle three. This is followed by chemoradiotherapy consisting
      of radiotherapy for six weeks and cisplatin every week for four weeks. The post-consolidation
      follow up is at eight weeks after end of chemoradiotherapy.
