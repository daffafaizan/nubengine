      HPV-specific antibodies is low and increases only after numerous surgery procedures.
      Therefore the application of this vaccine to patients with RRP can stimulate increased level
      of antibodies in the blood as well as presence of virus-specific neutralization antibodies on
      the surface of upper aero digestive tract and neutralize viruses shed from new papillomas and
      in this way protect patient from spreading of the infection as well as to facilitate the
      decrease of load of infectious virus shed from the lesion. This can possibly lead to the
      inhibition of growth of the papillomatous lesion.
