      oral health is a priority for cardiac patients, it is necessary that they attend dental
      clinics for regular follow up.

      This cross sectional study was carried out with 42 CHD and 42 healthy children who applied to
      Istanbul University, Faculty of Dentistry, Department of Pedodontics. Gender, age, general
      health and medications, and caries scores (dfs/DMFS) were recorded. Unstimulated saliva was
      collected from the participants and were assessed for the salivary secretion rate, salivary
      buffering capacity, pH, protein levels, superoxide dismutase (SOD), ferric reducing
      antioxidant power (FRAP), the thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS), protein
      carbonyl, protein thiols, total sialic acid.
