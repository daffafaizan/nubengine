      O2 and CO2 inspired and expired fractions. This measurement is usually used to estimate
      energy expenditure and which energetic substrate is preferentially used in resuscitation
      patients. Litterature demonstrated in a mouse model that the formation of hemorrhagic shock
      was associated with a change in RQ due to VCO2 and VO2 imbalance. RQ was able to distinguish
      anaerobic metabolism and corrected itself with correction of shock. Recently in Litterature
      showed a link between lactate production, cardiac output and the evolution of the RQ measured
      by indirect calorimetry in a resuscitation patient. Also, these authors raise the question of
      a possible use of the RQ in intensive care as an early non-invasive marker of anaerobic
      metabolism that can replace the invasive ones usually used (arterial lactate, venoarterial
      PCO2 gradient, venoarterial PCO2 gradient/ arteriovenous O2 content difference, ScVO2).
      However, the measurement of inspired and expired fractions in O2 and CO2 is part of the
      systematic monitoring of the intubated-ventilated patient in the operating room. The
      measurement of the VO2, VCO2 and the RQ could therefore be done from these fractions inspired
      and expired in O2 and CO2 by the following equation:

      RQ = (FeCO2-FiCO2) / (FiO2-FeO2) The main objective of our work is to demonstrate the ability
      of the RQ, measured indirectly from the anesthesia ventilator, to predict the occurrence of
      anaerobic metabolism in patients operated of major non-cardiac surgical operation in the
      operating room. Secondly, the objective is to evaluate the association between the variations
      of the RQ, EtCO2, Dc, ScVO2, venoarterial PCO2 gradient, venoarterial PCO2
      gradient/arteriovenous O2 content difference and lactate levels at different times during the
      surgical procedure and depending on the occurrence of postoperative complications.
