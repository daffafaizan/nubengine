    
      This is a Long Term Follow Up study to eRADicAte, an open label study designed to examine the
      effects on concurrent administration of Radium Ra 223 dichloride and Abiraterone Acetate plus
      Prednisone in subjects with symptomatic castrate resistant prostate cancer and with bone
      metastases.

      31 subjects completed all study visits in the eRADicAte study, and were thus evaluable. All
      31 subjects will be asked to participate in this Long Term Follow Up study which will
      evaluate overall survival, subsequent additional prostate cancer therapies and medications,
      radiographic changes and SSE's (Symptomatic Skeletal Events), incidence of bone marrow
      failure, and diagnosis with secondary malignancies.

      Living subjects will be evaluated at least 12 weeks after their last dose of Radium Ra 223
      dichloride and at each subsequent clinic visit. Deceased subject's data will be obtained
      retrospectively, from 12 weeks after the eRADicAte End of Treatment visit and prospectively
      through the date of death. The total duration of the study is expected to be 48 months
