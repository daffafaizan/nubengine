      admitted to the hospital with COPD exacerbations is associated with better clinical outcomes
      and at acceptable risk of adverse effects compared to a low-dose corticosteroid regimen. Our
      hypothesis is that high-dose corticosteroids is associated with a decreased rate of treatment
      failure, shorter length of hospital stay, and improved quality of life with similar risk of
      adverse effects. The study population includes patients ≥ 40 years-old with a ≥ 10 pack-years
      smoking history and a diagnosis of COPD, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis who present to the
      emergency room with increased dyspnea, increased sputum, or increased cough that requires
      admission to the hospital. We will perform a prospective, randomized, double-blinded study to
      determine if a high-dose corticosteroid regimen, which is already in use in clinical
      practice, decreases treatment failure compared to a low-dose corticosteroid regimen that is
      based on national consensus guidelines.
