      right and left middle cerebral artery during the first 12 h after return of spontaneous
      circulation (ROSC). The highest value of DFV and the lowest of PI will use for the
      statistical analysis. Cerebral Performance Category evaluate neurologic outcome at hospital
      discharge.

      Data provided by early TCD after ROSC are associated with neurological outcome. The use of
      these data could lead to the development of therapeutics improving cerebral perfusion in
      patient resuscitated from an OHCA.
