      cases from a study that was conducted in the early 1990's. The purpose of the initial study
      was to examine the role that lead and other exposures, including mercury and solvents, play
      in the etiology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).

      Study population: The study involved 110 ALS cases and 256 population based controls,
      recruited in New England between 1993 and 1996. Data collection involved an interview, blood
      collection, and measurement of bone lead using x-ray fluorescence.

      Design and outcome parameters: The results of this study suggested that lead exposure was a
      risk factor for ALS. Compared to controls, cases were more likely to have occupational lead
      exposure, and both blood and bone lead levels were higher in cases. We are presently
      analyzing data on other neurotoxic exposures including mercury, solvents, and pesticides. In
      order to investigate prognosis, we would like to determine the date of death by searching the
      National Death Index. This information will enable us to evaluate the relationship of
      neurotoxic exposures to ALS prognosis.
