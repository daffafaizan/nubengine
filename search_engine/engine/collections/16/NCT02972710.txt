      Therapy and Athletic Training, Northern Arizona University, Flagstaff AZ. The investigators
      aim to test a maximum of 76 participants in this study. A phone screening will determine
      initial eligibility. If the participant meets the inclusion criteria and is not excluded
      after the phone screen, an appointment will be scheduled. Final eligibility will be
      determined in the initial session after the participant completes the outcome measures and is
      evaluated by a licensed physical therapist.

      Participants will be involved in the study over a 4 week period. Each participant will be
      asked to attend 4 sessions, with one week in between each session as follows: Week 0 =
      baseline assessment and treatment 1; Week 1= treatment 2; Week 2 = treatment 3; and week 4 =
      follow-up assessment.

      After completion of the baseline assessment, qualified participants will be randomly assigned
      to either a supine or prone thoracic spine thrust manipulation intervention.
