    
      This study is a randomized, single-blind, prospective, multi-center post market evaluation.
      Subjects will be screened for study eligibility and asked to complete written informed
      consent prior to any study specific testing assessments. After completing written informed
      consent, a total of 386 subjects will be randomized on a 1:1 basis to receive VT ablation
      treatment using either the Niobe ES or standard manual catheter ablation treatment using
      commercially available products. This will be the largest randomized VT study comparing
      outcomes from RMN to manually guided catheter ablation procedures. Subjects will be
      randomized according to a computer-generated randomization scheme. Randomization will be
      blocked at the study site level and subjects will be blinded to group assignment. Since
      quality of life measurements will be collected during follow-up, this study is single-blinded
      in order to mitigate patient bias. Clinical evaluations will not be masked to the treating
      physician.
