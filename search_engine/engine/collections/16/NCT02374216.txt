      will then be informed of the design of the study through the reading of the Form for Patient
      Information and the Informed Consent in Swedish and verbally.

      All dental implants to be inserted will be included in the study. Some surgical, implant,
      loading, prosthetic variables of the study will be decided according to the surgeon's
      criteria and patient's decisions.

      Data will be collected in specific forms, and will be categorized as surgical,
      implant-specific, patient-related, anatomic, loading conditions, prosthetic, and
      complications.

      Besides descriptive statistics, Kaplan-Meier analysis will be used to estimate implant
      survival/failure rates (an estimator for estimating the survival function from lifetime
      data), and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models will be used to identify prognostic
      variables.
