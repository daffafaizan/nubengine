      of frailties in elderly patients with renal impairment.

      In this context, the objective of this study is to describe in a French university hospital
      the reasons for the use of geriatricians by nephrologists, the modalities of geriatric
      evaluation and the socio-demographic and medical characteristics (including geriatric
      syndromes) of very elderly patients with renal insufficiency, and then to become so at one
      year.

      Secondary objectives :

        -  describe the modalities of the geriatric evaluation

        -  describe the socio-demographic, medical characteristics (including fragilities and/or
           geriatric syndromes) of elderly patients with renal insufficiency

        -  describe how to become one year old.

      Origin and nature of the data collected:

      - Socio-demographic, medical and geriatric data (see attached document) based on geriatric
      assessment medical records (reports of external geriatric consultation and/or intervention by
      the mobile geriatric team).

      The approximate duration of the study will be 9 months. This time includes the time required
      for statistical analysis and writing an article.
