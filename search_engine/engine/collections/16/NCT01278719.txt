    
      The present study involves two parts. A case control study wherein the association of nasal
      polyps with various risk factors like smoking, wood stove exposure, allergic rhinitis, non
      vegetarian diet intake, rhino sinusitis, deviated nasal septum, occupational dust exposure
      and eosinophilia.This will be studied individually for antrochoanal and ethmoidal nasal
      polyps.Again the same will be studied with respect to the recurrent and non recurrent polyps.

      A descriptive study focuses on the nasal polyp occurrence with respect to the age, sex,
      religion, socioeconomic status, urban or rural preponderance,overcrowding, aspirin
      intolerance, family history etc.

      The results will be studies after calculating the odds ratio and the chi square test for
      whatever data is available. Interpretation will be performed subsequently.

      Gene expression profiling would be performed to study the differences in gene expression
      levels between AC and EP s with respect to risk factors and morphological
      characteristics.Mutational analysis will be performed to identify mutations in selected
      genes.
