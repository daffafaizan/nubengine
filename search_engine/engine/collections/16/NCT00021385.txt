      or refractory stage III or IV ovarian cancer treated with squalamine lactate and carboplatin.
      II. Determine the safety profile of this regimen in these patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 15-30 minutes on day 1 and squalamine lactate
      IV continuously on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at approximately 1 month.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 45 patients will be accrued for this study.
