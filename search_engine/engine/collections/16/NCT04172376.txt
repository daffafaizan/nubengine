           according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria in 14 major neurosurgical centers
           across the country to establish a multi-center clinical database of spontaneous small
           basal ganglia hematoma with data maintenance and update.

        2. Random allocation of the patients enrolled into control group (conservative treatment
           with conventional drugs) or intervention group (minimally invasive puncture aspiration
           plus rt-PA); long-term follow-up for 6 months to compare the recent and long-term
           mortality rate, disability rate and related complications of the two groups.
