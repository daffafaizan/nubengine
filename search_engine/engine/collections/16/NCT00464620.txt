      Treatment: Subjects take Dasatinib twice daily by mouth for 28 days per 28 day cycle.

      Subjects will be seen for interim medical history, physical exam and laboratory studies prior
      to each cycle. Subjects will undergo tumor imaging every 2 months (8 weeks) for the first 6
      months and approximately every 3 months thereafter while on treatment.

      A blood sample for collection of specimens with which to later study serum level of Dasatinib
      and effects on biomarkers of drug activity will be obtained approximately 2 to 4 weeks after
      the start of treatment.

      Central collection of archival tumor with which to later study the frequency of expression
      and/or mutation of kinases inhibited by dasatinib will occur.

      Subjects will be followed for approximately every 3 months until 2 years from registration
      and then approximately yearly until 5 years from registration.
