      The presently available oral anticoagulants have a very narrow therapeutic range but the
      interindividual demands to achieve therapeutic anticoagulation (=loading dose) varies
      greatly. Overanticoagulation is a major cause of bleeding complications, whereas insufficient
      anticoagulation is associated with thromboembolic disease and possibly prolonged hospital
      stay. A model to predict the loading dose with phenprocoumon (MarcoumarÂ®) is therefore highly
      desirable.

      In a retrospective analysis of 300 inpatients (152 medical, 148 orthopedic patients) of the
      Cantonal Hospital of St. Gallen our group identified clinical predictors for the loading dose
      of phenprocoumon and two dosing algorithms were developed (Good AC, Henz S. A clinical
      algorithm to predict the loading dose of phenprocoumon. Thromb Res. 2007;120(6):921-5.).

      In order to validate the safety and efficacy of these dosing algorithms we plan this
      prospective interventional study with three equally sized arms: dosing according to algorithm
      1, dosing according to algorithm 2 or dosing according to the estimate of the physician
      (control).
