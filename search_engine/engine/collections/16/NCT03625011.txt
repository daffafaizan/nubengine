      undergoing T/As from a regional healthcare organization. Patients will be receiving either
      one gabapentin dose (15mg/kg up to 600mg) or placebo preoperatively. Both control and test
      group will receive the standard narcotic regimen intraoperatively. Additionally, young
      children will receive instruction for Tylenol and Motrin postoperatively while teenagers will
      receive a narcotic prescription. Outcome measurements include: mean Tylenol mg/kg, Motrin
      mg/kg and narcotic mg/kg use. Additional measurements: Mean time to first analgesic. Phone
      interviews with the research nurse for three days postoperatively will elicit pain scores at
      12, 24 and 48 hours postoperatively.
