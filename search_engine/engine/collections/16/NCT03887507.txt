      therapy group(B). The last one is based on balance exercises targeting core stability, Bobath
      concept and sensory strategies. In the Vojta group 5 sessions will be conducted for a
      duration of 2 weeks and the same will be realised on the standard group. In addition, during
      the study, a daily activity shall be prescribed in both groups: Vojta exercise during 20
      minutes for group A and walking for 20 minutes in group B.
