      study. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of humidified oxygen and not
      humidified nasal catheter (12-24 hours/day) on the nasal epithelium of patients with chronic
      respiratory failure by non-invasive tests in 36 volunteers, of both sexes aged ≥ 18 years
      with a medical indication for the use of home oxygen via nasal cannula on: (1) nasal
      mucociliary transport through the saccharin test, (2) the physical properties of nasal mucus
      by simulated cough machine and contact angle, (3) cellularity via nasal and total count
      differential white blood cell nasal lavage, (4) ph nasal lavage and exhaled breath condensate
      (5) quantification of cytokines in nasal lavage and (6) quality of life questionnaire with
      rhinosinusitis (SNOT20). Assessments will be performed at baseline, 12 hours, 7 days, 30
      days, 12 months and 24 months of use. Volunteers will be recruited from three Basic Health
      Supervision of Cathedral Health, City Health Department, City of São Paulo.
