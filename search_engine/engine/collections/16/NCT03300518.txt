      responders in the process of ovarian simulation. Poor response to ovarian stimulation causes
      high cycle cancellation rate and extremely low pregnancy rate.

      More attention has been paid to the potential interest of steroid pretreatments in GnRH
      antagonist cycles; not only for scheduling the GnRH antagonist cycles, but also for
      synchronizing the follicular growth which may result in more oocytes retrieved. But available
      clinical results are controversial.

      Previous studies have shown that utilizing the natural negative feedback of the
      hypothalamus-pituitary-ovary axis induced by estradiol valerate pretreatment effectively
      prevented inter-cycle increases in follicle-stimulating hormone, improved follicle
      synchronization, and resulted in a more coordinated follicular development, leading to the
      recovery of more mature oocytes. However none of the randomized controlled studies compared
      estradiol valerate pretreatment or not on treatment outcomes, ongoing pregnancy rate,
      directly on poor response patients using estradiol valerate pretreatment in GnRH antagonist
      protocol.
