      (placebo, Caf tablets, coffee and decaffeinated coffee) each separated by 2-7 days. Before
      the first meeting they refill caffeine, physical activity and medical questionnaires. The
      investigators recruited only men who were healthy non-smokers with no comorbidities and the
      daily caffeine consumption was under 400 mg. Before each meeting participants had to comply
      guidelines outlined included fasting for 8 hours, avoiding intense physical activity 14 hours
      and moderate exercise 2 hours before measurements. The meetings conducted in the morning when
      the first session included anthropometric measurements (weight, height and waist
      circumference) and body composition measurements using Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis (BIA)
      and a digital caliper. Each session began with a measuring resting blood pressure and heart
      rate (Polar telemetric systems), after that participants were given randomly placebo or Caf
      tablets or coffee or decaffeinated coffee, waiting half an hour and then measuring the RMR
      and respiratory exchange ratio (RER), for half an hour using indirect calorimetry (canopy
      system). Then again measured blood pressure and heart rate at rest.

      The sample size was calculated for 16 participant in each group, according to an expected
      change of 3% at RMR values between the groups with the power of 80% and significance of 0.05
      . standard deviation (SD).
