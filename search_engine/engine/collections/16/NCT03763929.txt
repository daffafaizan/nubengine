    
      This is a multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial of
      intravenous trans sodium crocetinate (TSC) initiated by emergency medical service (EMS)
      responders in the field within 2 hours of symptom onset in 160 subjects with acute stroke.
      The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      field-initiated TSC in improving the long-term functional outcome of subjects with acute
      stroke.

      Subjects with acute stroke will be identified and screened in the ambulance by (EMS)
      responders who have received training in basic and advanced cardiac life support, stroke
      recognition, and specific procedures relevant to the proposed study. The EMS responders will
      contact a Study Neurologist, who will enroll eligible stroke patients into the study. Effort
      will be made to obtain prospective informed consent in the ambulance when deemed to be
      feasible. If not feasible, subjects will be enrolled under regulations for exception from
      explicit informed consent (EFIC) in emergency research circumstances, after public disclosure
      and community consultation. Written informed consent to continue in the study is obtained
      from subjects or their legally authorized representatives as soon as possible after hospital
      arrival.

      EMS responders will deliver the single, field, bolus dose of study agent, TSC at 0.25 mg/kg
      or matched placebo, followed after hospital arrival by standard of care (SOC). No additional
      study drug will be administered in the hospital. Follow-up assessments will be performed at
      Emergency Department (ED) arrival, 24 hours, 48 hours, Day 4, Day 30, and Day 90. The study
      will be performed at up to 30 receiving hospital sites in Los Angeles County, CA, and central
      Virginia.
