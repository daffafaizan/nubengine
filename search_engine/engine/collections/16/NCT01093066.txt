      optimal TURB using a standardized procedure. The TURB will always try to be optically
      complete.

      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy for 3 months with the intensified MVAC (6 cycles administered every
      2 weeks): METHOREXATE: 30 mg/m2 D1 - VINBLASTINE: 3 mg/m2 D2 - ADRIAMYCINE 30 mg/m2 D2 -
      CISPLATINE 70 mg/m2 D2. + G-CSF: 5 Âµg/kg from D4 to D10 New maximal standardized TURB at the
      end of the chemotherapy. In case of a lesion localized at the bladder dome, and if a maximal
      TURB appears to be unsafe, a partial cystectomy without lymph node dissection will be
      performed.

      If a complete response is obtained (no tumor cells in the bladder muscle on the last TURB), a
      surveillance will be proposed without any further treatment.

      Otherwise (tumor cells in the bladder muscle at the second TURB), a radical cystectomy will
      be done.

      If the balder is spared, the follow up will be as follow: clinical examination, CT, bladder
      endoscopy and urinary cytology every 6 months. The possible non muscle infiltrative bladder
      relapses will be treated according
