    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the best overall response rate (BORR = complete response + partial response) of
      the combination of pembrolizumab and imatinib for treatment of melanomas harboring c-Kit
      mutation or amplification.

      II. To evaluate the safety and adverse effect profile of the combination of pembrolizumab and
      imatinib in patients with melanomas harboring c-KIT aberrations (mutations or
      amplifications).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the median time to progression (TTP), progression free survival (PFS), and
      overall survival (OS).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Assessment of programmed cell death ligand (PD-L)1 expression in melanoma patients with
      c-KIT aberrations before and after combined therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and imatinib
      mesylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and every 9 weeks
      for 1 year, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.
