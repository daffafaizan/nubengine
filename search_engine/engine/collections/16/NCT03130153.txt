    
      Objective: To compare the post dental extraction healing among subjects who took simple
      analgesic tablets dissolved in water versus those who used saline rinses post operatively.

      Methods: A study will be done among patients who underwent dental extractions at AKHSP dental
      clinic, Karachi, Pakistan. Carious, periodontally mobile, traumatized or broken down teeth
      among 20-70 years old in either gender will be included.

      In addition to the routine prescription of antibiotics and oral analgesics, the hypertensive
      subjects (n=20) will be advised to take dissolved Aspirin tablet as an oral care while
      non-hypertensive will be divided into two sub groups (n=20 each), advised saline mouth rinses
      or dissolved Aspirin for 5 days, respectively.

      The outcome (healing of the extraction socket) will be evaluated 7 days from the day of
      extraction on an ordinal scale.
