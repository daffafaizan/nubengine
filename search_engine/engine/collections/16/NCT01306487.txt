    
      Macular hole patients were evaluated by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)
      to determine the integrity of the microstructures of the foveal photoreceptors. The inner
      segment/outer segment (IS/OS) junction, the external limiting membrane (ELM), and the cone
      outer segment tips (COST) line were determined preoperatively, and at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months after the MH surgery. The correlation between the integrity of the foveal
      photoreceptor microstructures and the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was determined.
