      Ectoin® Mouth and Throat Spray Althaea Honey (ERS09) compared to the well-established
      comparator spray EMSER® Hals- und Rachenspray (both medical devices) in the symptomatic
      treatment of sore throat due to acute pharyngitis and dry cough.

      The principle mode of action of ectoine is based on the physical interaction of the
      compatible solute with water and the resulting stabilizing effects of the ectoine hydro
      complex on the epithelial tissue treated. Althaea has so-called mucilaginous effects, that
      means generally a shielding of the irritated mucus membranes by thin polysaccharide layers.
      Such mucilaginous polymer layers lead to rehydration, coating of peripheral sensory
      receptors, and therefore to a reduction of throat irritation and dry coughing. Honey acts
      predominantly as demulcent with its viscous liquid constitution based on mainly fructose and
      glucose. The combination of all three substances may result in a multi-modal treatment of the
      symptoms of sore throat and dry cough.

      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment groups:

        -  treatment with ERS09

        -  treatment with comparator (EMSER® Hals- und Rachenspray)

      Patients' symptoms will be documented by the physician in investigator questionnaires at
      visits 1, 2 and 3. At visit 1 the patients will receive a patient diary for daily
      documentation of their symptoms. In addition, patients and investigators will be asked to
      evaluate the overall effectiveness and tolerability of ERS09 spray at visit 3.
