      infections. Although flu was primarily considered as limited to the respiratory system,
      clinical reports suggest its association with organ involvement outside of the respiratory
      tract.

      The aim of the study is to describe extra-pulmonary complications due to influenza virus and
      RSV in hospitalized patients from November 2018 to April 2019 and November 2019 to April 2020
      in a French university hospital.
