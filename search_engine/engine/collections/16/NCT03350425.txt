      for eligibility. Eligible patients will be approached and informed by their treating
      physician. If a patient agrees to participate in the study and to sign an informed consent
      form, basic data regarding vaccination history, underlying disease, etc. will be entered or
      electronically imported into the study eCRF. Pneumococcal antibody titers will be drawn at
      baseline and every 3 months. For newly vaccinated patients baseline titers will be drawn 4
      weeks after the vaccination. DZIF CTUs will coordinate titer assessment schedules and inform
      the participating physicians of upcoming blood samplings. The samples will be taken on
      dialysis days and thus constitute only a minimal additional burden for both patients and
      physicians. DZIF CTUs will actively follow up on study patients for 2 years after enrolment.
      This follow-up will include validation of all hospitalizations and deaths documented in an
      electronic registry database to assess whether the primary endpoint (pneumonia) occurred.
      Additionally, dialysis units will be contacted every 6 months to assess if pneumonia
      occurred, which did not require hospitalization. DZIF CTUs will document titer assessment
      results in the eCRF. Titers will not be disclosed to the attending physicians because
      revaccination due to knowledge of titers would produce bias. All therapies and diagnostics
      including vaccinations will be administered solely as part of clinical routine and as
      recommended by appropriate guidelines (e.g. RKI STIKO recommendations).
