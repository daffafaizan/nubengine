      Delivery System is a permanent implant to the left atrial appendage for percutaneous
      insertion. LLA (Left Atrial Appendage) occlusion appears to be a feasible option for stroke
      reduction in AF patients at high risk for stroke, who are contraindicated for anticoagulation
      or who suffered a stroke despite OC. This study will evaluate safety and performance, using a
      study design which is based on inputs from pre-clinical testing, the risk analysis and data
      available from other LAA (Left Atrial Appendage) devices.
