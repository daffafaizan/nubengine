    
      This is a qualitative descriptive study using purposive sampling to form the four focus
      groups to encourage diversity in diagnosis (immunodeficiency, malignancy, bone marrow failure
      and inherited metabolic diseases), age and location. Each group will participate via
      conference call due to difference in location. There will be semi-structured questions for
      each group but also allow flexibility by participants themselves.
