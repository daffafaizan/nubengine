      It is known to increase apnea time for apneic patients including children. However, high-flow
      nasal cannula is known to be ineffective when the patient's mouth is kept open.

      When trying to intubate the patient during induction of anesthesia, the patient should be
      apneic with administration of neuromuscular blocking agent, and the mouth should be open for
      introduction of laryngoscope.

      We designed a prospective randomized controlled study to evaluate the effect of high-flow
      nasal oxygenation in the aforementioned setting for trying to intubate the patient.
