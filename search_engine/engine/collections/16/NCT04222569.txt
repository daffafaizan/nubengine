      (ICU). After resolution of acute illness, separating the ventilator from the patient may be
      specially challenging. Before extubation, it is recommended to perform a spontaneous
      breathing trial (SBT) to evaluate the ability to sustain breathing with minimal or no
      support.

      The way to carry out this step of the weaning process present important variation across
      regions of the world. Two techniques are preferentially used : the T-piece trial (oxygen
      supply without positive pressure) and low pressure support ventilation (PSV) from 6 to 10
      cmH2O according to the airway humidification device.

      The best strategy for successful weaning remains unknow, especially about specific subgroups
      of respiratory and neurological diseases.

      Our aim is to assess which spontaneous breathing trial would best reproduce post-extubation
      inspiratory effort. We compare T-piece trial, PSV 7 cmH2O without positive end expiratory
      pressure (PEEP) and PSV 0 cmH2O without PEEP. Five specific profiles are evaluated : chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), severe brain injury, blunt thoracic trauma, post
      abdominal surgery and miscellaneous.

      The hypothesis is that T-piece trial and PSV 0 CPAP 0 trial are the best for mimic
      inspiratory effort after extubation. However, we could highlight various results according to
      different subgroups of ICU patients. The final aim is to determine a personalized wean trial
      for each.
