      10% of Americans. Onychomycosis may be a precursor to many complications like ulcers, or skin
      infections, which may rarely result in amputation. Current treatment options have relatively
      limited long-term success and recurrence is common.

      The researcher can determine that the laser therapy can heat the nail and destroy and
      decrease the fungus infecting the nail to improving the appearance of the nail.
