      pharmacodynamics of pyrimethamine in intermediate / high-risk / relapsed or
      azanucleoside-refractory MDS within the confines of a phase I study.

      Pyrimethamine self-administered by participants orally once per day in morning with food.
      Phase 1 study will start at dose of 50 mg once per day. (NOTE: For participants at dose level
      of 50mg, the dose reduction, if needed is 25 mg.)

      Intra-patient dose escalation is permitted (not beyond the highest dose allowed) if Complete
      Remission/Response (CR) is not reached in week 1 of Cycle 3 and there is no significant
      toxicity. (NOTE: In this study, the term "intra-patient" indicates within each participant
      and not between different participants; i.e., dose escalation will be done within each
      individual participant.) The decision to escalate intra-patient doses will be based on safety
      and dose tolerance assessments made at the end of one treatment cycle (28 days of continuous
      drug administration) for all 6 participants. Dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is defined as the
      occurrence of two consecutive grade 2 or 3 serious adverse events (SAEs) not recovered within
      24 hours at a given dose. MTD will be defined as the dose where no DLT is observed among
      three consecutive participants, or no more than one DLT among six participants. Participants
      will be treated initially for one 28-day cycle followed by a toxicity evaluation - Toxicity
      and adverse effect assessments will be made on Day 1 and Day 28 of every cycle of therapy.
