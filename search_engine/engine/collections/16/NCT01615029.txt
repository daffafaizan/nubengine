      participants are enrolled into cohorts at increasing dose levels of daratumumab in
      combination with Len/Dex in 28 day treatment cycles. Part 2, the cohort expansion part of the
      trial, will further explore the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) (or the maximum tested dose) of
      daratumumab as determined in Part 1.
