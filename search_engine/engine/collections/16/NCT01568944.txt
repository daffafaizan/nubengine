      periodontitis has been designed. This is an interventional study involving scaling and root
      planing and two arms: 1. treatment with PO amoxocillin/metronidazole plus chlorhexidine oral
      rinse; 2. no antibiotics or oral rinse. It is expected that the antibiotics plus
      chlorhexidine will prevent the dendritic cell response to infection (bacteremia) elicited by
      scaling and root planing.
