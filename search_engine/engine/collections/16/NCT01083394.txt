      for lower extremity vascular disease. Advances in percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA)
      and stenting have provided new options for the treatment of the disease in this arterial
      segment. Restenosis after PTA occurs in 40-60% within one year. A novel attempt to reduce
      restenosis is the use of paclitaxel eluting balloons (PEB). First clinical studies suggest
      that the use of PEBs during percutaneous treatment of femoropopliteal disease is associated
      with significant reductions in late lumen loss and target-lesion revascularization. There is
      no randomized comparison of these treatments in patients with in stent restenosis of the
      superficial femoral artery. Thus, the aim of this study was to compare the efficacy of PTA
      with conventional balloon or PEB for in stent restenosis in the SFA in terms of reduction of
      diameter stenosis at follow-up angiogram.
