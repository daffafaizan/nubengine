      Subjective evaluation of swallowing was assessed with 'Swallowing Impairment Score' and 'MD
      Anderson Dysphagia Inventory'. Fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing (FEES) was
      applied for objective evaluation. Also, functional oral intake scale (FOIS) and functional
      outcome swallowing scale (FOSS) were used for swallowing assessment. Voice evaluation was
      assessed with videostrobolaryngoscopy (VSL) and 'The Multi-Dimensional Voice Program (MDVP)'
      was used for capturing and analyzing the voice samples. All evaluations were performed
      preoperatively and on 1st day, 2nd week and 6th months postoperatively.
