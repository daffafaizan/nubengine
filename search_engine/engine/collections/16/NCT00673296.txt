      fibrovascular proliferation will receive intravitreal injection of bevacizumab (1.25 mg in
      0.05 mL) and C3F8 (0.2-0.3 mL) during the same setting. Before intravitreal injection, all
      patients should either have complete panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) treatment or PRP to
      the peripheral retina. After treatment, patients will maintain a prone position for three
      days and be followed at regular interval. After vitreous clear-up, further supplementary PRP
      extending beyond equator will be done. Snellen best-corrected visual acuity measurements,
      intraocular pressure, slit-lamp examination and non-contact lens biomicroscopic examination
      will be performed before treatment and at each follow-up visit. Data including the extent of
      premacular hemorrhage, and the interval between the treatment and clearing of premacular
      hemorrhage will also be recorded.
