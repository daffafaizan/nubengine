      pregnant (gestation week 17±2 group and gestation week 39±2 group 408 cases in each group)
      and 408 lactating women (post-natal lactation day 42±7 group) from a total of 4 sites in 3
      typical areas (1 coastal regions, 2 inland regions and 1 lake regions) in China to study the
      correlation between DHA intake and DHA concentrations in blood and breast milk. Investigators
      are mainly physicians majoring in gynaecology and obstetrics, etc. During visits, the study
      physician will record the patient's social demographic data, disease and relevant medication
      history, review her medical records, assess DHA intake by the DHA Screener, and determine DHA
      concentrations in erythrocyte membrane, plasma and breast milk, so as to validate the
      feasibility of DHA Screener as DHA intake assessment tool for determining DHA concentrations
      in the body.
