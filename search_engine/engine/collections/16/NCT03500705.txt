      with their less-affected upper limb. The mirror and strength training group observed the
      reflection of the training limb in a mirror, the strength training only group exercised
      without a mirror entirely. Patients were referred through Hospital Health Professionals.
      Prior to trial commencement all participants were given comprehensive trial information and
      provided signed written informed consent. A total of 32 participants were recruited. After a
      warm-up participants performed 4 sets of 5 maximal isometric elbow extensions with their
      less-affected upper limb, three days per week, for four weeks. Patients received outcome
      assessment prior to the beginning of the intervention, directly after it and at three-month
      follow-up assessment. All assessments were carried out by a blinded Chartered Physiotherapist
      specialising in stroke rehabilitation. Patients were assessed using established outcome
      measures for upper limb isometric strength, motor function, muscle tone, and self-perceived
      participation.
