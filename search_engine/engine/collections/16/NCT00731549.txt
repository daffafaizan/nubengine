    
      This will be an open-label, uncontrolled study which will enroll subjects from Phase 4 of
      Study 31-07-246 and Phase 3 of Study 31- 07-247 and new subjects not participating in Studies
      246/247. The treatment history of subjects prior to enrollment in the open-label study will
      vary according to the design of the pivotal double-blind study (i.e., 31-07-246 or
      31-07-247).

      This open-label study will be comprised of phases similar to the pivotal double-blind studies
      (i.e., Studies 246/247): a screening phase (if applicable), a conversion phase (Phase 1, if
      applicable), an oral stabilization phase (Phase 2), and an IM depot open-label maintenance
      phase (Phase 3). Phase 3 will be a 52-week treatment period with a 26-week follow-up period.

      During Phase 3 (the open-label maintenance phase) oral aripiprazole rescue medication will be
      allowed for subjects who do not meet stability criteria or meet the criteria for impending
      relapse/exacerbation of psychotic symptoms.
