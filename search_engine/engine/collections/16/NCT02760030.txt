      I. To determine treatment failure-free survival (TFFS) rate at one year of combination
      therapy with pure estrogen antagonist, fulvestrant and cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK)
      inhibitor, palbociclib as primary endocrine therapy in patients 70 years or older with newly
      diagnosed non-metastatic hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2
      (HER-2) negative breast cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine 1- and 2-year progression free survival. II. To determine safety and toxicity
      of this combination in the population of patients 70 years or older.

      III. To determine whether longitudinal changes in geriatric assessment measures correlate
      with tolerability of this regimen.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive fulvestrant intramuscularly (IM) on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive
      palbociclib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.
