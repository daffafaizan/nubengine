      coarctation and VSD and have had their surgical repair at Children's Healthcare of Atlanta
      between the dates of January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2005. The data collected will be
      surgical data such as type of repair, and the time the patient required cross clamp,
      circulatory arrest and cardiopulmonary bypass while in the operating room for the repair(s).
      We would also like to gather post-operative information such as time the patient required
      ventilation, whether they required a re-operation during the same admission, along with
      intensive care hours and hospital length of stay.
