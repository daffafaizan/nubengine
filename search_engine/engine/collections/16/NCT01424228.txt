    
      In this phase IV trial a total of 340 subjects (170 subjects per treatment group), with
      chronic constipation, are planned to be randomly assigned to double-blind treatment.

      The trial duration for a subject can be 26 to 28 weeks in total, including a 2- to 4-week
      run-in phase followed by a 24-week double-blind treatment phase. The patient will complete an
      e-diary.

      Adult subjects (≥18 to <65 years of age) will take 2 mg prucalopride or matching placebo
      throughout the entire 24-week treatment period. Elderly subjects (≥65 years of age) will
      start at a dose of 1 mg prucalopride or matching placebo. In case of insufficient response
      the daily dose has to be increased to 2 mg (i.e. changed to 2 mg prucalopride or matching
      placebo).
