      pronounced rise in obesity-related disorders, especially type 2 diabetes. Weight loss
      achieved through lifestyle changes improves diabetes, but is very difficult to maintain over
      time. In contrast, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery can induce long-term weight loss
      and remission of diabetes. Surprisingly, the resolution of type 2 diabetes occurs within days
      after surgery and before significant weight loss. The resolution of diabetes must therefore
      be explained by a response to the surgical alterations of the stomach and intestines:
      restriction in gastric volume and bypass of the stomach, duodenum and proximal jejunum.

      Severe insulin resistance in muscle and liver is the common defect in obesity and type 2
      diabetes and may be improved or even reversed shortly after the operation. The aim of this
      study is to examine the acute changes in insulin sensitivity of muscle and liver by using
      hyperinsulinaemic euglycaemic clamp combined with glucose tracer to assess hepatic glucose
      production. Insulin signaling pathways will be studied in biopsies from muscle and
      subcutaneous fat as to explain the molecular basis of the changes in insulin sensitivity
      after RYGB.

      Insulin secretion will be evaluated in response to oral glucose as well as iv
      glucose-glucagon.
