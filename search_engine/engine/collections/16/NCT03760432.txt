      together. Another variation in technique involves the use of mitomycin-C (MMC), which is
      effective in reducing corneal haze after the laser surface ablation. Use of MMC during the
      laser custom CXL was associated with better outcomes, but in separate trials that could not
      be directly compared. This study will use OCT measurements to evaluate the magnitudes of
      direct and indirect laser actions after the procedure.
