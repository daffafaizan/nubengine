      endoscopy. Although air has previously been the standard gas used, CO2 is increasing
      preferred in adult endoscopy centers, due to reports of decreased post-procedural abdominal
      discomfort compared to air. Few published studies in children demonstrated decreased
      abdominal discomfort with use of CO2, but safety concerns for its use in pediatric endoscopy
      remain.

      This is a Double-blinded, prospective, randomized study of all pediatric patients undergoing
      procedures involving upper endoscopy in the Childrens Hospital & Medical Center.
      Randomization will be for patients undergoing upper endoscopy related procedures. Patients
      will be randomized 1:1 for air or CO2. Vital signs will be recorded before the procedure,
      throughout the procedure and after the procedure until fully awake. While in the procedure
      room, end-tidal CO2 level will be continuously recorded.
