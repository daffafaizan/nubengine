      221 millions cases were estimated in 2010, the prevalence would be 366 millions in 2030. It
      is well recognized that regular consumption of fruits and vegetables can lower the incidence
      of chronic diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and inflammatory
      diseases. Recently, Drs Desjardins, Abrams and Marette's research team discovered a high
      amount of a sesquiterpene in berries. This molecule is recognized for its ability to improve
      glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity, and to lower pro-inflammatory profile of obese
      mice. The aim of this study is to determine the effect of a polyphenol rich berries extract
      mix on insulin sensitivity, glucose tolerance, pancreatic Î²-cells function, lipids and
      inflammatory profile, and oxidative stress markers, on human obese subjects that have insulin
      resistance.
