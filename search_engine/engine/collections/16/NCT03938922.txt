      clinic: a screening visit, a randomization visit, 1 followup visit, 1 end of treatment visit,
      and 1 end of study visit.

      Patients will be allowed to adjust their dosing, based upon protocol specifications. Rescue
      medications will be provided to all patients to ensure they move their bowels on a regular
      basis.
