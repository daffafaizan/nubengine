      in the anterior regions of the maxilla or mandible will be treated with the Eztetic dental
      implant(s). Qualified patients will be those with one or more edentulous area in the anterior
      maxilla or mandible needing a single (restored as a single crown; if in the pre-molar region,
      it is recommended implant be splinted to another tooth or implant; no 2 adjacent edentulous
      sites). Qualified patients should have presence of posterior teeth or a stable posterior
      occlusion. All implants will be placed in a single-stage manner. A provisional abutment will
      be placed and a temporary crown will be placed (cemented or screw-retained) out of occlusion
      at implant placement surgery visit. Impressions for permanent prosthesis fabrication will
      take place at 6 weeks and prosthesis placement will take place at 2 months. Final prosthesis
      insertion will take place no later than 6 months following implant placement surgery.
      Resonance frequency assessment procedures will be done at implant placement surgery and at
      prosthesis insertion. Implant survival will be the primary study endpoint. Crestal bone
      regression will be the secondary study endpoint. Enrollment will continue until 20 patients
      have completed final prosthetic treatment at study center.
