           predominant thalassemia mutations in the Iranian population, as well as alternative
           highly variable erythroid specific polymorphisms. To determine how informative this
           panel is, these reagents will be applied to samples collected from patients homozygous
           for the disorder, and compared to patients with thalassemia trait and normal Iranian
           donors.

        -  In the second phase, we propose to serially measure and compare erythroid lineage
           chimerism with overall genomic chimerism following transplant. Samples will be collected
           from participants before and at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 12 months following transplant and
           cryopreserved. Peripheral blood from the stem cell donor will also be collected and
           cryopreserved. Participants will undergo myeloablative or nonmyeloablative transplant.
