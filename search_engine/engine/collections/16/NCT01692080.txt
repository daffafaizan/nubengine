    
      The Asthma Program will consist of six screenings and three camps each year, for two
      consecutive years. Screenings will be conducted in areas where populations are known to be at
      increased risk for asthma and its complications, such as inner-city, lower socioeconomic,
      African-American populations. Screenings will be conducted at churches or schools in these
      areas one month prior to each camp in an effort to identify children with undiagnosed or
      uncontrolled asthma and refer them to the camps. Camps will also be conducted in areas where
      populations are known to be at increased risk for asthma and its complications to improve
      ease of access. Asthma and smoking cessation education will be provided at each camp to
      children and caregivers. Baseline data will be collected at each camp and assessed.
      Longitudinal clinical outcomes will be assessed in children attending multiple camps.
