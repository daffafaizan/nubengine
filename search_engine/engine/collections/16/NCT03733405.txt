      transitioning the patient to well-women care. The American Congress of Obstetrics and
      Gynecology has recently highlighted the importance of this "fourth stage" of pregnancy
      suggesting earlier and more comprehensive visits compared to the standard 6-week postpartum
      visit. Specifically they describe that "all women should ideally have contact with a maternal
      care provider within the first three weeks postpartum" however this is largely derived from
      expect opinion and retrospective data. The current rate of postpartum visit attendance is as
      low as 66%, especially in women with scant prenatal care. In the investigators
      government-funded clinic, the postpartum clinic attendance in 2017 was 69% and many of the
      patients have co-morbidities, notably a 25% rate of psychiatric illness. Additionally, in
      this population, the investigators have identified a high rate of Emergency Department (ED)
      usage (8.7%) within 30 days of delivery suggesting that perhaps an earlier routine visit is
      ideal and can prevent the use of the ED. The aim therefore is to evaluate the utility of an
      early postpartum visit at two weeks in addition to a standard six-week visit with a
      randomized control trial.
