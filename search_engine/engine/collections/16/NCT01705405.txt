      goal is to provide an innovative medical device that merges intra-operative ultrasound and
      endoscopic images.

      We have already achieved the proof of concept of a device that merges ultrasound and
      endoscopic images. The objectives of this clinical trial are to accompany the maturation of
      the fusion device and to make the initial assessments of its Medical Service.

      The main difficulty is to visualize markers (surgical needles) under both modalities , in
      order to merge them.
