      which they received HBO2, 1.5 atmospheres absolute (ATA), or sham intervention (1.2 ATA, room
      air) for post concussion syndrome (PCS).

      The study is to provide a rationale for the selection of outcome assessments to serve as
      primary and secondary endpoints for a pivotal randomized clinical trial of hyperbaric oxygen
      for the treatment of PCS. The participants will undergo a comprehensive battery of symptom
      and quality of life assessments. The distribution of response, change in response over time,
      homogeneity of variance across subgroups, and relationships between outcome measures will be
      compared by treatment assignment with a cohort from a study of similar design among a normal
      study population.
