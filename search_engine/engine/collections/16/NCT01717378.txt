      database that actively collects and stores data from willing volunteers who visit its
      website. The UCSF Registry is a cornerstone of the UCSF Recruitment Service (RS). Both the
      Registry and the RS are among several initiatives implemented by the UCSF Clinical &
      Translational Science Institute.

      The chief purpose of the RS is to facilitate the enrollment of research participants into
      UCSF clinical studies. The primary function of the Registry is to expand the pool of
      potential clinical research volunteers. The Registry stores self-reported identifiable health
      information in a searchable database that is compliant with the privacy requirements of the
      Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This information is then used by
      the RS for the future identification and recruitment of potentially eligible participants for
      specific UCSF studies.

      Registry participants whose data matches the major eligibility criteria for a specific study
      will be sent recruitment materials about the study. Contact information for the investigator
      or RS staff will also be included in the e-mailing. Participants are then free to choose
      whether to respond or ignore the study recruitment information.
