    
      This is a non-randomized, non-inferiority trial that has been created to compare results of
      achalasia procedures including but not limited to: POEM + Partial Fundoplication (PF), POEM
      and Laparoscopic Modified Heller Myotomy + PF and POEM + Peroral Plication of the esophagus.
      Using a set of consistent evaluation tools for patients undergoing treatment for achalasia
      allows a standardized evaluation and comparison of these groups of patients. The long term
      and comparative POEM procedure outcomes are not currently known. Patients undergoing POEM,
      fundoplication, and/or laparoscopic myotomy report having varying degrees of symptoms of
      reflux, dysphagia, and pain. Providers also note varying degrees of esophagitis by endoscopy,
      reflux by impedance or pH scoring, and recurrence by repeat manometry. Many of these issues
      can be quantified using pH probe testing, upper GI endoscopy, high resolution manometry, CT
      scans, Endoflip device and esophagrams. There are various validated questionnaires that have
      been used to assess problem areas of reflux, dysphagia, and pain such as the Promis Global
      Health Score, Ekhardt Score, Mayo GER Score, Modified Dysphagia Questionnaire-30 Day, Zubrod
      Score, and pain scale. Each of these symptoms, tests, and questionnaires contributes to the
      provider's understanding of the patient's postoperative outcome.
