      trial at Department of Reproductive Science, University of Naples Federico II. All women
      included in the study will provide a written informed consent to participate in the study
      before the randomization.

      Women with TVU CL â‰¤25mm who will meet the inclusion criteria will be counselled by an
      obstetrician regarding the risk of SPTB as per standard of care. The patient will be given
      ample time to have all questions addressed and consider participation. If the patient agrees
      to participate in the study, the informed consent form will be signed and a copy will be
      given to the patient. Women who are eligible and consent to participate in the study will be
      randomly assigned to one of two groups: cervical cerclage (i.e. intervention group) or
      standard obstetric management (i.e. control group).

      Investigators planned subgroup analyses according to different CL cutoffs (i.e. <=15 and <=10
      mm); type of suture; and according to prior history of cervical surgery (i.e. LEEP or cone
      biopsy).
