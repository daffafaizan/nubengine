      curative for patients with various immunodeficiencies, including those with ongoing
      infections. However donor availability remains a limiting factor in the application of this
      treatment modality. The use of haploidentical donors has in the past been fraught with a
      greater rate of complications related to both higher rates of GvHD and delayed
      immunorecovery. Newer transplant regimens appear to have diminished these risks and improved
      outcomes. We propose using a subablative conditioning regimen followed by post-transplant
      cyclophosphamide for patients with CGD who do not have an HLA matched donor but whose
      circumstances necessitate the use of a potentially curative, albeit high-risk treatment
      modality.
