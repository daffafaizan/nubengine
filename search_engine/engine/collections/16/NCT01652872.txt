    
      The study is a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group study designed
      to describe the benefits and potential risks of a new treatment strategy using a fixed dose
      of darbepoetin alfa in subjects with CKD and not on dialysis. Anemic subjects without recent
      use of an erythropoiesis stimulating agent (ESA) will be randomly allocated 1:1 to treatment
      with a fixed dose of darbepoetin alfa or to treatment with darbepoetin alfa using a Hb-based
      titration strategy, which has been the conventional dosing strategy. In the Hb-based
      titration group, darbepoetin alfa doses will be titrated to maintain Hb â‰¥ 10.0 g/dL. This
      study aims to estimate the incidence of RBC transfusions (administered as deemed clinically
      necessary) in each group and the difference in incidence of RBC transfusions between the 2
      groups. In addition, multiple aspects, such as cumulative darbepoetin alfa dose, total number
      of units of transfusions, Hb concentration, Hb-related parameters (eg, Hb variability,
      excursions, rate of change), and adverse (eg, cardiovascular) events, will also be considered
      in order to determine a preferred dosing regimen. Treatment group, darbepoetin alfa doses,
      and protocol specified Hb concentrations will be blinded to the investigator, subjects and
      study team. Subjects will be followed for approximately 2 years from the date of
      randomization.
