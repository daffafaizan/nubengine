      90 monoclonal antibody MN-14 (Y90 MOAB MN-14) plus peripheral blood stem cell rescue in
      patients with stage IV breast cancer. II. Determine the pharmacokinetic profile of Y90 MOAB
      MN-14 in the blood, normal organs, and tumors of this patient population. III. Determine the
      antibody response to Y90 MOAB MN-14 in these patients. IV. Determine the antitumor effect of
      this regimen in these patients. V. Determine the radiation absorbed dose to normal organs and
      tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF)
      subcutaneously (SC) with or without chemotherapy on days -28 to -14 and peripheral blood stem
      cell (PBSC) collection on days -14 to -11. If an adequate number of CD34+ cells are not
      harvested, bone marrow may be collected. Patients receive pretherapy imaging with indium In
      111 monoclonal antibody MN-14 IV for up to 40 minutes on day -7 followed by whole body
      imaging on days -7 to 0. Patients receive yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody MN-14 (Y90 MOAB
      MN-14) IV for up to 40 minutes on day 0. PBSC or bone marrow is reinfused on days 6 to 14,
      depending on antibody clearance. Patients receive G-CSF SC or IV until blood counts recover.
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB MN-14 until the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2
      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for 2 months,
      monthly for 6 months, and then every 6 months for 5 years.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years.
