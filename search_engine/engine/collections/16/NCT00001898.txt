      of the NHGRI has been a leader in developing. This technology for genome-wide expression
      analysis, DNA microarray hybridization, is the focus of our protocol. We will access tissue
      banks collected by our collaborators that contain excess tissues obtained during routine
      clinical care. Specimens will be processed for large-scale gene expression analysis and DNA
      copy number determination using DNA microarrays. The development and analysis of this gene
      expression and gene copy number database are the primary purpose of this study. Currently
      available and new bioinformatics tools will be applied to the data for the characterization
      of disease subsets (e.g., early vs. advanced stage cancer) as well as to mine the data for
      specific genes which are linked to given disease states.
