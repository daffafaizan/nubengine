      having consumed their normal breakfast. Over the morning they will reported their mood by
      responding to one hundred millimetre visual analogue scales anchored with the words:
      Composed/Anxious; Hostile/Agreeable; Elated/Depressed; Unsure/Confident; Energetic/Tired;
      Confused/Clearheaded. These dimensions of mood came from the factor analysis that formed the
      basis of the Profile of Mood State questionnaire. An overall measure of mood will be
      calculated. .

      Randomly they will receive either a 150ml glass of water, or an equivalent volume of water
      containing electrolytes (in total 150mg sodium chloride and 45mg potassium chloride (Gatorade
      G2 Low calorie (34 kcal) Thirst Quencher, Pepsico). This drink will be consumed for a first
      time after 50 minutes, and a second time after 140 minutes. A estimate of habitual salt
      preference will be gained by responding to questions concerning the adding of salt to meals
      and a preference for salty foods.

      Study 2: One hundred and twenty young adults will be recruited. A second study attempts to
      replicate the first in a double-blind trial where the taste of salt was hidden by using a
      capsule. . Participants will be assigned to one of four experimental conditions; 1) swallowed
      placebo capsules; 2) swallowed capsules containing electrolyte (300mg sodium chloride); 3)
      received placebo capsules and plain water; 4) received capsules containing electrolyte and
      plain water. Each drink will be 150ml of water. The allocation of the type of capsule will be
      carried out double-blind, determined by computer generated random numbers.

      Otherwise the procedure will be identical to study one.
