      the safety and efficacy of a high-throughput drug sensitivity assay to predict targeted
      therapies for patients who have GBM that has recurred or progressed following prior radiation
      therapy and TMZ. The underlying hypothesis is that treatment of patients with up to 3 lead
      candidates identified from individualized CSC/ HTS assays will safely (1) delay disease
      progression, and (2) increase survival. There is an abundance of literature strongly
      supporting the importance of a regimen for targeting CSCs and preventing tumor recurrence, as
      an additional strategy to improve the overall prognosis of cancer patients.
