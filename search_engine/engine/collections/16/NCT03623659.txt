    
      Zona pellucida (ZP) manipulation, termed "assisted hatching" (AH), has been introduced in
      order to favor embryo hatching and ultimately improve assisted reproductive technology
      success but with poor proofs of safety and biological plausibility.

      Vitrifying and warming of blastocysts may impair the successful hatching process of the
      embryo out of its ZP and its following implantation into the uterus. Theoretically, AH may
      facilitate the hatching process and subsequently increase implantation rates.

      In this prospective randomized controlled trial (RCT), the hypothesis is to test whether the
      application of a partial AH to vitrified/warmed blastocysts might affect patients' delivery
      rate.

      Patients with vitrified blastocysts will be randomized at the time of blastocyst warming to a
      study group (with AH) or a control group (without AH). AH will be performed at the expanded
      blastocyst stage using a laser technique and a laser opening will be initiated at the 1
      o'clock position. Consecutive laser shots will be applied to reach the 5 o'clock position of
      the blastocyst. The blastocysts will then be cultured at least 2 h and subsequently
      transferred into the patient's uterus.
