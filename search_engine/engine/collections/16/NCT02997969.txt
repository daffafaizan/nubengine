    
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity to DNA-HIV-PT123 (an
      HIV clade C DNA vaccine) and to Bivalent Subtype C gp120/MF59 in healthy, HIV-uninfected
      adults.

      The study will enroll healthy, HIV-uninfected participants aged 18 to 40 years. Participants
      will be randomly assigned to one of 6 groups. Each group will receive experimental vaccine
      and protein and/or placebo at 4 study visits. Participants in Groups 1-3 will receive all
      injections via needle and syringe. Participants in Groups 4-6 will receive the DNA vaccine
      via Biojector, and protein and/or placebo via needle and syringe.

      Participants in Groups 1 and 4 will receive the DNA vaccine at months 0, 1, 3, and 6 and the
      protein at months 3 and 6. Participants in Groups 2 and 5 will receive the DNA vaccine and
      the protein at months 0, 1, and 6 and placebo at month 3. Participants in Groups 3 and 6 will
      receive placebo at months 0, 1, 3, and 6.

      Study visits will include a physical examination, an interview and/or questionnaire, HIV
      testing and HIV risk-reduction counseling, and urine and blood collection. Participants may
      optionally choose to provide rectal fluid, cervical fluid, or semen samples.
