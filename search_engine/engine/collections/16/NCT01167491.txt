      and protein) and qualitative (DNA, signaling and cellular activation) analysis of the DAP12
      signaling pathway in WG patients with localized (group 1; n=30) or diffuse WG (group 2; n=30)
      by comparison with patients with micro polyangitis (group 3; n=30), or with sarcoidosis (
      group 4; n=30), and healthy blood donors (group 5; n=30). Blood samples will be collected
      during a routine medical visit. These results may help to design future therapeutic
      strategies based on modulation of specific intra-cellular pathways involved in the disease.
