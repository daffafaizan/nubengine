      treatment for exudative age-related macular degeneration acting on vascular
      hyperpermeability.

      The optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomography angiography represent novel
      and non-invasive diagnostic techniques that allow a detailed and quantitative analysis of
      retinal and vascular features.

      The study evaluates the changes in optical coherence tomography and optical coherence
      tomography angiography parameters at baseline and after three monthly injections of
      Bevacizumab in exudative AMD.
