      The decision to discontinue natalizumab therapy is often raised in patients defined as
      high-risk for PML despite good clinical efficacy. During the therapy cessation period
      following large phase III trials, a return to the prestudy disease activity was reached by
      four months post-discontinuation. Shorter therapy was associated with a trend for a more
      severe disease activity pointing to a possible 'rebound' effect after natalizumab
      discontinuation.

      This study focuses on two different approaches: an immediate versus a step-wise/tapered down
      natalizumab discontinuation protocol, both with reinstitution of a different disease
      modifying therapy (DMT) within 1-6 months from the last natalizumab infusion.
