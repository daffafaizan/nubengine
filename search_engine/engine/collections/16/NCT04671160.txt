      Among them deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are the most significant factors
      increasing morbidity and mortality in ICU patients. Use of anticoagulant prophylaxis aims to
      prevent these dangerous complications. Most commonly used anticoagulant prophylaxis agents
      are low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). LMWH therapeutic efficiency is measured with
      activity of anti-Xa factor, that should range between 0.2 and 0.4 IU/mL in order to prevent
      thrombotic complications. Due to grave general condition, critically ill patients may often
      develop acute kidney injury (AKI), that requires renal replacement therapy (RRT). Because of
      haemodynamic instability the safest therapeutic choice seems to be continuous veno-venous
      hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF). This RRT mode removes particles in the size of few daltons even
      up to 10 kilodaltons (kDa) such as metabolic product waste, ions, hormones etc. LMWH with
      average molecular weight of 4.5 kDa and fondaparinux with average molecular weight of 1.7 kDa
      may be removed during CVVHDF resulting in insufficient activity of anti-Xa factor thus
      increasing the risk of thrombotic complications in critically ill patients.
