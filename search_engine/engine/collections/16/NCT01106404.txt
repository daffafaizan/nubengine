      designed to gather clinical information on subjects' experiences with the use of the new
      feature of the RestoreSensor implantable neurostimulator. Current spinal cord stimulators for
      chronic intractable pain stimulate targeted nerves along the spine using electrical impulses.
      The stimulation interferes with the transmission of pain signals to the brain replacing
      painful sensations with a tingling sensation called paresthesia. Variation in the intensity
      of neurostimulation with body position is a challenge for some patients implanted with
      conventional spinal cord stimulation systems because positional changes may result in
      overstimulation or understimulation. Patients need to manually adjust their stimulation using
      the patient programmer to maintain their comfort level during position changes. The
      AdaptiveStim feature of the RestoreSensor neurostimulator was developed to address this
      challenge by improving pain relief and/or convenience relative to manual programming
      adjustments.
