      determine the impact of structured weight loss (MOVE program) on GERD symptoms in overweight
      and obese veterans enrolled in a MOVE program. Successful weight loss will be defined as loss
      of 10% or higher baseline weight at 6 months follow up. Cases will be defined as subjects who
      achieved successful weight loss and controls as those who did not. GERD symptoms in subjects
      who lose weight (cases) will be compared to those with no weight loss (controls). Validated
      GERQ, RDQ and QOLRAD questionnaires will be used to assess prevalence of GERD symptoms, QOL
      and impact of weight loss on these symptoms. All MOVE participants will complete a validated
      GERQ, RDQ and QOLRAD questionnaires at baseline MOVE clinic visit and RDQ and QOLRAD during
      their follow up visits. Patient's total RDQ scores at baseline and follow up visits will be
      used to determine change in frequency and severity of GERD symptoms with weight loss,
      similarly change in the total QOLRAD questionnaire scores from baseline will be used to
      assess change in HRQOL with weight loss. Apart from information provided in MOVE!23, GERQ,
      RDQ and QOLRAD questionnaires, relevant information pertaining to obesity and GERD
      association will be obtained from patient's computerized medical records.

      The impact of weight loss on GERD symptoms will be assessed. The impact of weight loss on QOL
      and GERD medication usage among MOVE participants will be assessed.
