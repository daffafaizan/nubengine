    
      STUDY DESIGN: Open, multicentre, prospective, parallel-group, randomized controlled study
      comparing the effect of an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) vs standard
      antihypertensive treatment without ACEI, in the progression of renal disease in elderly
      patients with non-proteinuric 3-4 stage chronic renal disease.

      Elderly patients (> 65 years) with moderate-severe non-proteinuric chronic renal disease
      (estimated Glomerular Filtrate Rate between 19-59 ml per minute per 1.73 m2 using the Chronic
      Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration Group equation) and urine-creatinine rate < 30
      mg/g, will be included. They will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ACEI or
      standard antihypertensive treatment. Patients will be followed up for 3 years.
