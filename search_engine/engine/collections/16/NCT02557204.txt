      that required nasogastric tube insertion, will be randomized by means of a computer-generated
      randomization order into four groups: Conventional group (Group C), head in the lateral
      position group (Group L), endotracheal tube assisted group (group ET) and video laryngoscope
      group (group MG).

      Success rate of the selected technique (first attempt, second attempt and overall), duration
      of insertion for selected technique, complications such as kinking and mucosal bleeding will
      be noted.
