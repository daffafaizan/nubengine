      often complain of vertigo and dizziness, as well as balance problems, causing an important
      impact on health-related quality of life. The objective of this study was to investigate the
      effects of manual therapy combined with physical therapist-directed vestibular rehabilitation
      in patients with unilateral peripheral vestibular hypofunction. The design of this study is a
      randomized controlled trial with two groups (experimental and control groups). The impact of
      dizziness on daily function and quality of life (Dizziness Handicap Inventory), the fear of
      falling and the balance confidence (Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale-16 items),
      postural control (stabilometric platform) as well as the intensity (visual analogue scale)
      and number of the vertiginous crisis will be determined. The intervention period will last
      four weeks. Participants of the experimental group will receive 4 sessions of manual therapy
      together with physical therapist-directed vestibular rehabilitation, while participants of
      the control group will receive home-based vestibular rehabilitation. Outcome measurements
      will take place at baseline, immediately after the intervention, one month and six months
      after the intervention. Within-group and between-group data will be analyzed and interpreted.
