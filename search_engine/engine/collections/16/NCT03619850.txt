    
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label, multicenter, study of the safety (compared to iron
      sucrose), efficacy, and PK/PD of ferumoxytol (7.0 mg Fe/kg x 2 [max 510 mg/dose]) in
      pediatric subjects with iron deficiency anemia (IDA) and CKD. There will be a total of
      approximately 125 subjects randomized to treatment in a 2:1 ratio to either ferumoxytol or
      iron sucrose.

      Total subject participation in the study will be up to 7 weeks, which includes a 2-week
      Screening Period and a 5-week Treatment Period.

      Subjects receive the following:

      • Two IV infusions of ferumoxytol 7.0 mg Fe/kg (max 510 mg/dose), the first administered on
      Day 1 and the second 2-8 days later

      OR

      • Iron sucrose (Venofer®): For Hemodialysis Dependent (HDD) patients: 2 mg Fe/kg,
      administered on consecutive dialysis sessions, for 10 doses (max 100mg/dose with a total max
      treatment course of 1000mg) For Non-hemodialysis Dependent (NDD) or Peritoneal Dialysis De
      pendent(PDD) patients: 4 mg Fe/kg, administered up to 3 times/week, for 5 doses (max
      200mg/dose with a total max treatment course of 1000mg).
