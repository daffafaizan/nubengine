      assignment will be determined by opening an opaque envelope. Patients will be randomized to
      one of four groups.

      All subjects will receive a maintenance infusion of 125 mL Lactated Ringers (LR) solution
      throughout the study. For patients in Groups A or B, an intravenous bolus of 1000 mL LR will
      be initiated when the patient is positioned for epidural placement. The bolus will be
      administered through a free-flowing wide open intravenous catheter until complete.

      Patients in Groups C and D will not receive any additional fluid bolus and will only receive
      the maintenance infusion of 125 mL LR during the study period. Blinding will be maintained by
      the Labor and Delivery nurse by covering up the LR bolus fluid bag.

      If the patient is randomized to groups B or D, the dose of oxytocin currently being
      administered will be halved and not increased for the duration of the study period (60
      minutes after the initiation of CSE).
