      obstacle to full implementation country-wide. The Home-based AIDS care program (HBAC) pilot
      project was designed to deliver and monitor ARV and tuberculosis (TB) medications at the
      homes of 1,000 people with HIV living in a rural area of Uganda. In addition, the cost and
      complexity of frequent laboratory monitoring of viral load and CD4 cell counts is a major
      impediment to widespread use of ARV therapies in Uganda and other resource-limited settings.
      Nested within the Home-Based AIDS Care (HBAC) project, is a randomized study of strategies
      for monitoring ARV therapy that involves 3 arms: 1) Quarterly CD4 cell counts, viral loads
      and home visits by trained lay persons; 2) Quarterly CD4 cell counts and home visits; and 3)
      Home visits alone.
