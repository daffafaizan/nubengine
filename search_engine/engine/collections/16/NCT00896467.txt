      Primary

        -  To compare the psychological and emotional consequences in patients who underwent
           first-line antitumor treatment (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) for metastatic disease
           while participating in a phase II or III randomized clinical trial vs patients who
           underwent standard first-line treatment off-trial.

      Secondary

        -  To measure and compare the temporal variation of psychological and emotional
           consequences during and after completion of or stopping of treatment.

        -  To measure and compare the degree of knowledge of the implications of participating in a
           clinical study vs the benefits of standard off-trial treatment and evaluate the impact
           on psychological and emotional experience.

        -  To evaluate the relationship between the use of adjustment strategies and emotional
           regulation and psychological and emotional experiences in both of these situations.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients complete four questionnaires, including assessment of symptoms of anxiety and
      depression (HADS), quality of life (QLQ-30), adjustment strategies (WCC), and regulation of
      emotional behavior (ERQ), during their first course of treatment, after the first evaluation
      of treatment effectiveness, and one week after completion of treatment. During their first
      evaluation, patients also complete a questionnaire on the modalities of randomized clinical
      trials and their impact on care (ICEC-R).
