      I. To compare the change in endometrial cell proliferation, as measured by the percentage (%)
      of Ki-67 positive cells, in participants with endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia who
      undergo 4 weeks of treatment with megestrol acetate + metformin or megestrol acetate alone
      prior to hysterectomy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To measure the changes in protein expression in the endometrial intraepithelial neoplasia
      lesion, using immunohistochemistry (i-vi) in subjects treated with megestrol acetate +
      metformin compared to those treated with megestrol acetate alone.

      i. Estrogen receptor (ER) and progesterone receptor (PR) ii. PTEN/PAX2 expression iii.
      Markers of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway (phosphor-acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), p(Ser473)-Akt,
      phosphor-S6K, p4EBP1) iv. Markers of cell death (TUNEL, cleaved caspase-3) v. Markers of
      intratumoral insulin signaling (Phosphorylated insulin receptor (pIR) and insulinlike growth
      factor-1 receptor (total and phosphorylated IGF1R), vi. Mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency
      (baseline only).

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:

      I. To explore whether baseline Ki-67 expression and other clinical characteristics are
      associated with treatment response.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Prior to standard of care surgery, patients receive megestrol acetate orally (PO)
      twice daily (BID) for 21-35 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      ARM II: Prior to standard of care surgery, patients receive megestrol acetate PO BID and
      metformin hydrochloride extended-release PO BID for 21-35 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 30 days.
