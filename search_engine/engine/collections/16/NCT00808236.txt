      after resuscitation from cardiac arrest has been shown to improve neurologically intact
      survival. Studies in dogs and rodents have demonstrated improved outcomes when cooling is
      initiated intra-arrest.

      The RhinoChill is a non-invasive cooling device through which rapid cooling is achieved via
      the intranasal delivery of an evaporative coolant into the nasopharynx. Due to its
      non-invasive and portable nature, the RhinoChill can be used to begin cooling earlier than
      other cooling devices.

      Studies performed using the RhinoChill in a porcine model of cardiac arrest suggest that
      cooling with the RhinoChill prior to the first defibrillation attempt facilitates
      resuscitation and improves resuscitation rate and neurologically intact survival.

      This study is being performed to assess the feasibility of using the RhinoChill device in the
      pre-hospital setting to improve resuscitation from cardiac arrest.
