      and commitment therapy (ACT) intervention on distressed family caregivers of people with
      dementia (PwD) compared to the control group. A total of 24 family caregivers of PwD who meet
      the inclusion criteria will be recruited and randomized to either the intervention or control
      group. Caregivers assigned to the intervention group will receive individual ACT sessions
      guided by a trained coach for one hour per week over 8 weeks through Zoom videoconferencing
      with supplemental psychoeducation materials provided. Caregivers assigned to the control
      group will receive care as usual with psychoeducation materials provided. Outcomes regarding
      caregivers' mental health will be collected at three time points (i.e., pretest, posttest,
      and 1-month follow-up) and compared between groups over time. Exploratory hypotheses are that
      the ACT group will show decreases in caregivers' psychological distress and burden and
      improvements in QoL and engagement in meaningful activities at posttest and 1-month
      follow-up, compared to the control group. Also, the project will evaluate the feasibility of
      recruitment, adherence, and retention of caregivers and explore caregivers' experiences in
      the ACT intervention through semi-structured interviews at posttest. As part of the pretest,
      we will also explore caregivers' perceived impacts of COVID-19 on daily lives.
