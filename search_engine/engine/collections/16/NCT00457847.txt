      surgery. Pulmonary edema, which is an abnormal build-up of fluid in the lungs, and hypoxemia,
      which is low blood oxygen levels, are two common symptoms that individuals with PGD
      experience. Treatment for this condition is often expensive, and it is the leading cause of
      death following lung transplant. Many potential donors and recipients are considered
      unsuitable for lung transplant because of concern for the development of PGD. Therefore, the
      ability to accurately predict which individuals are at risk for developing PGD may allow more
      lung transplants to be performed. Specific characteristics in both lung donors and recipients
      may play an important role in determining the risk of PGD. For example, genetic variations in
      how the body deals with harmful chemicals called oxidants may be associated with the
      development of PGD. The purpose of this study is to identify the specific genetic biomarkers
      in donors and recipients that put individuals at risk for developing PGD following a lung
      transplant.

      This study will enroll individuals who are undergoing lung transplantation. Blood samples
      will be collected from lung donors and from participants prior to surgery, immediately
      following surgery, and 24 hours after surgery. Study researchers will monitor participants
      for 72 hours following surgery for symptoms of PGD. There will be no additional study visits.
