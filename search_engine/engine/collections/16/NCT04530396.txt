    
      Randomized, double-blind (blinded for the trial subject and the study physician), placebo
      controlled, multi-center clinical trial in parallel assignment of efficacy, immunogenicity,
      and safety of the Gam-COVID-Vac combined vector vaccine against the SARS-CoV-2-induced
      coronavirus infection in adults in the SARS-СoV-2 infection prophylactic treatment.

      The trial will include 40,000 volunteers aged 18+. After screening, they will be randomized
      (3:1) into two groups - a reference group of 10,000 volunteers receiving placebo and a study
      group of 30,000 volunteers receiving the Gam-COVID-Vac combined vector vaccine against the
      SARS-СoV-2-induced coronavirus infection.

      The trial subjects will be randomized into five age strata: 18-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, and
      60+ years.

      The PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection at the visit is performed during screening and
      before the second administration of the vaccine/placebo

      Each subject will participate in the trial for 180±14 days after the first dose of the study
      drug/placebo and will have one screening visit and five on-site visits to the study physician
      during the said period. The study drug/placebo will be administered intramuscularly during
      vaccination visits 1 and 2 (day 0 and day 21±2). Subsequent observation visits 3, 4, and 5
      will be made on days14±2, 28±2, 35±2,42±2, and 180±14 respectively. During the observation
      visits, vital signs will be assessed in all trial subjects and changes in the subjects'
      condition and wellbeing compared to the previous visit will be recorded. Observation visits
      may be remote, through the telemedicine consultation (TMC).

      Additionally, the trial subjects will be able to have remote consultations with the physician
      through the TMC.

      Blood samples will be taken from certain subjects during the following visits to assess the
      immunogenicity parameters listed below:

      Virus-neutralizing activity (300 subjects) ×3 Interferon gamma (107 subjects) ×3 CD4 and CD8
      cell count and ratio (50 subjects) SARS-CoV-2 glycoprotein-specific antibodies titer (9,520
      subjects) ×3 Determination of the titer of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocleocapsid protein-specific
      antibodies(9,520 subjects) ×3

      Blood sampling will be performed on the day of injecting the first dose of the study
      drug/placebo immediately prior to the study drug administration Blood sampling for
      immunogenicity parameters assessment will be only carried out in specially selected study
      centers.

      Blood samples will be taken from 9,520 trial subjects. All four immunogenicity parameters may
      be assessed in one trial subject.

      Trial subjects data will be collected using electronic case report forms and electronic
      questionnaires to be filled by trial subjects.
