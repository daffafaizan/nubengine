      them happens as result of a treatment limitation. Ensuring end-of-life quality is important,
      not only because is a moral duty of all caregivers, but also to prevent negative effects in
      close relatives of dead patients.

      In an assessment of quality of in-hospital deaths involving 3793 patients, only 35% of the
      deaths were judged to be of acceptable quality by the nurses.

      Assessment tools have been developed recently on this topic. Most studies have focused on the
      perception of end-of-life quality by close relatives, particularly through the CAESAR scale
      in the most recent one.

      The main purpose of this multicentric study is to evaluate the perception of the quality of
      the end-of-life in intensive care units seen from the side of the caregivers, in relation to
      the new French legislative framework.
