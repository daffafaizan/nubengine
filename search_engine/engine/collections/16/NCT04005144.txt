    
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of brigatinib in combination with binimetinib in
      stage IIIB or IV anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or ROS1 rearranged non-small cell lung
      cancer (NSCLC) and the recommended phase 2 dose.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine preliminary efficacy of brigatinib in combination with binimetinib in any
      line of treatment.

      II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic parameters of brigatinib in combination with
      binimetinib.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (ctDNA) utility in evaluating
      treatment response.

      II. To evaluate the blockade of downstream signaling indicating response or resistance to
      treatment of immunohistochemistry (IHC) for phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Protein
      kinase B (AKT)/Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway activity evaluation.

      OUTLINE: This a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive brigatinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) and binimetinib PO twice daily (BID)
      on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days and then every 6
      months for 12 months.
