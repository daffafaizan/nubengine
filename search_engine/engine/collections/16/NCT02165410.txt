      (STS) in autism by brain imaging modalities, including positron emission tomography (PET),
      functional MRI and diffusion MRI. These results suggest that brain imaging abnormalities
      within the STS could be the first step in the cascade of neuronal abnormalities found in
      autism.

      STS is known as a key area for social cognition and is involved in various stages of social
      interaction, from visual and auditory perception (perception of eyes, facial and body
      movements, and perception of human voice) to the more complex process of social cognition
      (theory of mind, understanding emotions and mentalizing) The anatomical and functional
      abnormalities within the STS described in autism could account for the social difficulties
      experienced by persons with autism, both clinically observed and objectified by studies on
      visual social perception.

      The individual detection results found in PET, that is to say a reduction of rCBF in the
      superior temporal sulcus (STS), could be reproduced with ASL and used to predict the
      diagnosis of autism in children with the same level of sensitivity and specificity as with
      PET. The individual detection of decreased rCBF in the STS could be a useful biomarker in
      autism using MRI, a method more accessible and much less invasive than PET. A MRI biomarker
      in autism could allow individual analysis, as well as contribute to early diagnosis and
      objective evaluation of the efficacy of new therapeutic strategies.

      The rCBF data measured by MRI-ASL will also be correlated with both clinical (Autism
      Diagnostic Interview - ADI-R) and behavioral data of the social perception measured by the
      eye-tracking method. In addition, we will study the impact of these temporal anomalies on
      brain connectivity MRI method of diffusion tensor. We will also describe the abnormalities
      present in the very early development of autism.
