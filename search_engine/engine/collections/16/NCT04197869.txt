      standardized questionnaire will be distributed to all patients prior to surgery at their
      pre-operative visit. The patients in the experimental group will have follow up via phone
      call, 3-4 days prior to surgery to assess for medication compliance or any side
      effects/complications. Patients will record if they are taking their Miralax as prescribed
      daily. They will also record their bowel movements and pain levels during evacuation. Prior
      to surgery, in the pre-operative area, medication compliance will be assessed once again.
      Post operatively all patients will take polyethylene glycol for seven days, once a day. They
      will maintain a bowel diary, which will record bowel movements, stool type and pain with
      evacuation. The primary objective is to determine if the preoperative use of polyethylene
      glycol decreases time to first bowel movement after robotic sacral colpopexy. Secondary
      outcomes include pain with first bowel movement, stool consistency and daily pain levels.
