      National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data indicates that 16.5% has a BMI
      greater than or equal to 85% < 95% and 17.1% has a BMI greater than or equal to 95%. The
      quality of life of children who are obese has been shown to be lower than that of children
      with cancer. Health related quality of life measurements have emerged as an important health
      outcome in clinical trials, clinical practice improvement strategies, and healthcare services
      research and evaluation. We have conducted a behavioral nutrition and exercise program since
      2003. The name of the program is Teens, Empowerment, Exercise, Education, Nutrition (TEEEN)
      Program. We meet once a month on a Saturday afternoon for four hours. During this time we
      cover: registration (monitoring of sedentary activities and liquid choices; motivational
      interview, exercise testing); exercise; educational interactive lectures; didactic games and
      projects. We have noticed that participants seem to have a better quality of life after
      participating in the program compared to baseline. We would like to objectively quantify this
      subjective finding. We will be using the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory Version 4.0
      (PedsQL(TM)4.0) questionnaire which has been validated in the pediatric population. We will
      have an intervention and a control group. Both participants and their caretakers will be
      given a questionnaire at the beginning and at the end of the study.
