    
      This is an open-label, single institution, Phase I 3+3 dose escalation study to describe the
      safety and tolerability of afatinib in patients with brain cancer having failed prior therapy
      and to determine the recommended phase II dose.

      Eligible patients will receive afatinib in treatment cycles of 28 days that will consist of
      afatinib administered orally by mouth once every four days. Patients will be assigned to the
      dose level open at the time of their enrollment. Patients will continue dosing of afatinib
      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or treating
      physician determines it is in their best interest to stop. Guidelines for modifying study
      drug doses is provided for the management of adverse treatment effects.

      All patients will have regular evaluations for assessment of safety parameters as detailed in
      the study flow chart. Lumbar puncture and blood draw for assessing afatinib levels will occur
      as detailed in the study flow chart.

      Neurological imaging and assessment for response will be performed approximately every eight
      weeks. Tumor response will be assessed according to Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology
      (RANO) Working Group criteria.

      An end of treatment evaluation will occur when a patient permanently discontinues study drug,
      as detailed in the study flow chart. Patients will then be followed every four months for
      survival.
