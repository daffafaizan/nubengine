      (PD). The overall goal of this proposal is to use a novel metabolomics platform, based on
      near infrared biospectroscopy, to detect oxidatively modified blood plasma constituents.
      These spectral findings can be used to model the degree of oxidative stress with a modeled
      "stress index" that may distinguish PD cases from healthy elderly controls.
