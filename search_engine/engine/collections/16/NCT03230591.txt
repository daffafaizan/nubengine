           Alfa on LV diastolic function and flow in patients with Fabry's cardiomyopathy using LV
           2D strain, diastolic stress echocardiography, LV vortex flow and CMR.

        2. Primary / Secondary Endpoint 1) Primary endpoint:

             -  Change from baseline in peak exercise E/E' by diastolic stress echocardiography,
                global longitudinal strain and LV vortex flow parameters at 1 year 2) Secondary
                endpoints:

             -  Changes from baseline in extracellular volume by CMR (T1 mapping) at 1 year follow
                up

                  -  Changes from baseline in evaluation of the degree of the resting LV diastolic
                     function

                       -  Changes from baseline in other echo-parameters; LV mass index, reduction
                          of peak exercise E/E prime at 1 year follow up

                            -  Changes from baseline in quality of life using questionnaire ⑤
                               Change from baseline in peak VO2, exercise time, AT by diastolic
                               stress echocardiography at 1 year follow up ⑥ Change in T1 baseline
                               (myo, ms) & T1 baseline (blood, ms), T1 postcontrast (myo, ms) & T1
                               baseline (blood, ms) by CMR

        3. Study Methods 1) Study Design: This is an observational study. No treatment or
           intervention will be assigned to the subjects. All patients will receive full standard
           of care concomitant medication for the treatment of their cardiac condition. 25 patients
           with genetically confirmed Anderson-Fabry disease who have a plan to start ERT with
           Agalsidase Alfa will undergo 2D strain, diastolic stress echocardiography, LV vortex
           flow analysis, and CMR at baseline and after 1 year of treatment with ERT with
           Agalsidase Alfa for follow-up.
