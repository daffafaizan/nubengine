    
      Over recent years, the importance of the sense of self and personal identity in
      psychopathology and its treatment has been highlighted. Several studies inspired in the
      Personal Construct Psychology framework have found a variety of identity characteristics in
      clinical conditions such as depression or eating disorders, but the evidence in schizophrenia
      and other psychotic related disorders is scarce.

      In addition, current psychological models of positive and negative symptoms highlight the
      influence of neurocognition, social cognition and self-concepts in the development and
      maintenance of psychotic experiences. Despite the recognized need of person-centered
      approaches to understand psychopathology processes in psychosis, psychological models for
      explaining psychotic symptoms have not explored sufficiently the role of this kind of
      person-centered measures.

      Aim

      1. To examine the influence of the structure of personal identity and other relevant
      cognitive factors in positive and negative symptoms

      Hypotheses

        1. Positive symptoms will be influenced by dichotomous thinking style and construction of
           self as measured with the RGT.

        2. Negative symptoms will be affected by the richness of the construct system as measured
           with the RGT.
