      overweight/obese adults. Subjects were randomized into 3 groups: Whey protein only consumed
      as 20 grams per serving three times per day (total 60 grams per day) (WP); Whey protein and
      resistance exercise training (WP-RT); and Whey protein and combined exercise training
      (P+RISE). All outcomes, including the primary outcome of visceral fat was measured at
      baseline (week 0) and post-intervention (week 17) in all study subjects.
