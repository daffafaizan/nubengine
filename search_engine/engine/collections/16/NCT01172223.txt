      America, corresponding to an age-corrected annual incidence of 100 to 120 per 100000 females.
      Approximately 30-40% of all patients treated with curative intent will develop metastatic
      disease. Perioperative systemic treatment has made a major impact on relapse-free and overall
      survival of women with early-stage breast cancer [ , ] with therapeutic strategies being
      based on the endocrine responsiveness and the estimated risk of relapse defined by tumor
      size, axillary lymph node involvement, histologic and nuclear grade, lymphatic and/or
      vascular invasion, HER2/neu-overexpression and age [ ]. Perioperative therapy has
      traditionally been administered postoperatively, but chemotherapy is increasingly utilized in
      the preoperative setting as it can significantly improve the rate of breast conserving
      surgery, and new regimens can be evaluated rapidly and more precisely.
