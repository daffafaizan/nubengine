      combinations of rituximab and purine nucleoside analogues (fludarabine, cladribine, and
      pentostatin), offer the possibility for improved survival, but all patients will eventually
      relapse. Patients with relapsed or refractory disease will only experience diminishing
      benefits with additional lines of therapy. In addition, patients with high-risk CLL have poor
      responses to even first-line therapies. Lenalidomide and dasatinib have non-overlapping
      proposed mechanisms of action. Single agent phase II studies with lenalidomide and dasatinib
      have demonstrated responses in heavily pretreated and high-risk patients. For these reasons,
      we propose to treat patients with relapsed and/or refractory CLL to purine nucleoside
      analogue therapy with combination lenalidomide and dasatinib.
