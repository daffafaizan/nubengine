      rTMS therapy immediately following PT treatment session. Secondary outcomes will be
      exploratory, documenting differential clinical effects of two 'active' rTMS compared to
      'sham' rTMS, to investigate ability to improve motor and functional recovery outcomes.
      Outcome measures will be a combination of assessments regularly conducted during PT treatment
      sessions validated in people with PD (these will doubly serve as our study measures) and
      several PD oriented outcomes.
