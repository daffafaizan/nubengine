      ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWFA).

      DESIGN: Prospective observational case series. METHODS: This study enrolled normal eyes with
      best corrected visual acuity ≥ 20/20, refractive error < 3.00D, and without visible retinal
      pathologic changes under a slit lamp-based condensing lens. Demographic and clinical data
      such as age, sex, and reasons for undergoing FA were collected. The far peripheral retina was
      detected by UWFA. The fundal fields obtained using the Heidelberg ultra-widefield lens in a
      single shot and in montage images were compared with those acquired using the Heidelberg
      conventional 55° lens. The signs at the peripheral retina detected by UWFA were described and
      grouped. Ciliary body thickness (CBT) at 3 mm (CBT1) and 2 mm (CBT2) posterior to the scleral
      spur was measured by ultrasound biomicroscopy.
