      for about a quarter of neonatal deaths. Contaminated hands likely play a role in transmitting
      pathogens to a neonate, therefore handwashing with soap has the potential to interrupt
      transmission and improve neonatal health. The primary objective of this study is to develop
      and evaluate a scalable, cost-effective handwashing promotion program to improve handwashing
      behavior among mothers and caregivers of neonates. The investigators will first conduct a
      qualitative study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a set of interventions. The
      investigators propose to evaluate the impact of the intervention components, designed as
      three progressively intense interventions, using a randomized controlled trial with elements
      of a stepped wedge design. The study will be conducted in Meru County, Kenya, enrolling a
      total of 800 pregnant women who seek non-emergency antenatal care at a government health
      facility during a 1 year period. Clinic based health care workers and community health
      volunteers will disseminate the intervention using an interactive storytelling approach. The
      focus of the interactions between the health care workers and volunteers and the participant
      will be on addressing barriers to handwashing through interactive question and answer
      sessions, rather than a didactic, educational session. The investigators will assess the
      impact of interventions on observed maternal and caregiver handwashing behavior and estimate
      the cost effectiveness for each intervention.
