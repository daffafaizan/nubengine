      will undergo cognitive and neurobehavioral testing and also will have baseline labs drawn and
      will meet with a Johns Hopkins nutritionist trained in modified Atkins diet for education.
      The labs are standard of care for diet initiation to rule out contraindications to the diet.
      Participants and/or their caregivers will keep a daily diet log and will be asked to download
      the free Carb Manager application onto their smartphone. They will send the logs and data
      back weekly. Participants will be given urine ketone strips and asked to use and record in
      their diet log twice weekly. Participants will have blood and urine samples collected locally
      every 3 weeks and sent back to study team to measure Beta-hydroxybutyrate, metabolic studies
      and methylation. Participants will return to Baltimore at the end of 12 weeks for a one day
      visit to repeat the cognitive assessment protocol, neurobehavioral measures, and repeat the
      initial and follow up lab tests.
