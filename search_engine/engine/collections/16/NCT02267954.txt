      version of a fast food restaurant menu. We ask participants to identify the differences
      between the menu board and a typical menu board at that location. Individuals list the
      differences that they find and have a chance to win a prize if they identify the most
      mistakes among participants recruited that day. The differences created will remain constant
      (e.g., featuring Pepsi products instead of the typical Coca-Cola offerings, including items
      from other restaurants on the menu), including changes to calorie labels and price labels.
      Additionally, we recruit participants in a variety of locations to test for differences
      between demographics (e.g., income groups, education levels, and BMI levels).
