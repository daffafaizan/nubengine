      fifth leading cause of death in people aged 15 to 59 years old. Upper extremities problem is
      still faced with poor prognosis for recovery. Cognitive sensory motor training therapy
      (Perfetti's technique) might be better helped for recovery of upper extremity function in
      stroke than conventional therapy.
