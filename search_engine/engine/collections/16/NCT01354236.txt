      a result, they introduced accompanying and preventive measures to reduce linguistic and
      cultural risk factors that may impede educational engagement and vocational decisions. Since
      2006, the dropout rate has overall declined. However the proportion of early school leavers
      who remain without any specific occupation is still alarming.

      This study aims to identify psychosocial risk - and protective factors of secondary school
      dropout in order to deliver solid insight on how to tailor early detection and intervention
      programs.

      In the light of prior findings, the investigators hypothesize that school dropouts have
      significantly more mental health problems than their peers who go to school. They are also
      more likely to report a poor socio-economic background, negative school experiences and
      difficulties in family functioning.

      To test those hypotheses, the investigators will have an exploratory case control
      study.Recruitment of cases will be prospective, from an exhaustive population of dropouts and
      recruitment of matched controls will be done by random sampling. Data will be collected using
      self-report questionnaires on mental health, family life and problematic internet use as well
      as a structured clinical interview to consider psychiatric diagnosis according to the
      criteria of DSM IV.
