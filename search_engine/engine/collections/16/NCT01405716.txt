      mindfulness meditation. Mindfulness meditation provides a potentially safe, effective,
      nonpharmacologic, noninvasive, simple method for pain relief and increased function that
      could be used for the frailest older adult. This experimental study is designed as a
      randomized, education controlled clinical trial of a mind-body program for older adults with
      chronic low back pain. A sample of 300 independent, community-dwelling adults 65 years of age
      and older will be recruited. After determining eligibility, study participants will give
      written informed consent and will be randomized to either the mindfulness-based stress
      reduction (MBSR) program or the health education control program. Participants in the
      mind-body group will receive the intervention of eight weekly 90-minute mindfulness
      meditation sessions that are modeled on the MBSR program. Controls will receive an 8-week
      health education program based on the 10 Keys(TM) to Healthy Aging. After completion of the
      8-week program, participants in both programs will be asked to return for 12 monthly booster
      sessions. Prior to initiating the program, immediately after the last program session, and 6
      & 12 months later, the following parameters will be assessed: (1) physical function, (2) pain
      severity, (3) neuropsychological performance, (4) measures of mindfulness, (5) demographic
      factors, and (6) biomedical factors.
