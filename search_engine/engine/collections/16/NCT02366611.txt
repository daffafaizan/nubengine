    
      The goal of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of tDCS as a novel pain relief
      modality for odynophagia due to mucositis in patients with locally advanced head and neck
      cancer undergoing definitive radiation therapy or chemoradiotherapy. Participants will be
      randomized into one of two arms: (1) Treatment: radiation/chemoradiotherapy standard of care
      + tDCS neuromodulation or (2) Control: radiation/chemoradiotherapy standard of care only.

      Patients in the treatment arm will undergo tDCS stimulation on the day of their
      radiation/chemoradiotherapy appointments, prior to receiving treatment when doing tDCS
      session in clinic or after to receiving treatment when doing tDCS session at home. This will
      occur daily (5 days per week) during the second and third weeks of therapy, three times per
      week during the fourth and fifth weeks, and twice per week during the sixth and seventh
      weeks.

      Patients will also have EEG and fNIRS recordings during the study. This will occur at the
      pre-study visit, the first stimulation appointment, the third week, the 7th week, and during
      the follow-up appointments (one-week and one-month).
