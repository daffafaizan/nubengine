        -  Compare the inhibition of growth of human prostate cancer cell lines by serum from
           patients with prostate cancer before and after being fed a low fat, high fiber diet.

        -  Determine the underlying mechanism through which a low fat, high fiber diet affects the
           growth of prostate cancer cell lines.

        -  Determine whether a low fat, high fiber diet inhibits the growth of prostate cancer cell
           lines through androgen-dependent and/or androgen- independent mechanisms in these
           patients.

        -  Determine the growth factors, hormones, and/or binding proteins that may be responsible
           for affecting the growth of prostate cancer cell lines in these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive a low fat, high fiber diet daily for 3 weeks.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive a control diet containing the standard amounts of fat and
           fiber.

      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients (20 per arm) will be accrued for this study within
      6 months.
