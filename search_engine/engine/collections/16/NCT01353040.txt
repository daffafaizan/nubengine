      single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus. In general, the mortality rate associated with
      Marburg virus outbreaks has ranged from 23% to 88%, with the highest death rates seen in more
      recent epidemics. No vaccine or effective therapy is available for Marburg hemorrhagic fever.
      AVI-6003 is an experimental combination of 2 phosphorodiamidate morpholino antisense
      oligomers with positive charges on selected subunits (PMOplusâ„¢). These oligomers specifically
      target viral messenger RNA encoding 2 Marburg virus proteins thought to be important in viral
      replication and host immune suppression. The present study is designed to characterize the
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of escalating single-administration doses of
      AVI-6003 in healthy human subjects.
