      early may eliminate obesity-related morbidity. Evidence supports use of monetary incentives
      to encourage weight-loss; questions remain about the efficacy of contingency management on
      weight loss maintenance.

      "Lose 2 Win" contests in which participants who achieve weight-loss goals are eligible for
      cash prizes, appear well-suited for implementation on campuses. Our objective in this
      two-phase trial is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of Lose 2 Win for
      weight-loss maintenance among college students.
