      early detection of ischemia and prompt use of accepted therapies in order to prevent
      postoperative myocardial infarctions (PMI) in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
      Specifically, it aims to validate the safety and efficacy of wireless remote real-time ECG
      ST-monitoring in the reduction of the incidence of PMI. It extends two pilot feasibility
      studies into the postoperative period using wireless remote ST-monitoring for early detection
      of myocardial ischemia followed by preventative strategies. It is anticipated that this
      research will improve postoperative care by adopting generalizable and practical strategies.
