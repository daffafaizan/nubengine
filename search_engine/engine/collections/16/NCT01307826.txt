      painful shoulder. The therapeutic methods applied in the treatment of painful shoulder
      syndrome include among others oral pharmacotherapy, joint injections, kinesitherapy,
      ultrasound, electrotherapy, laser. Manual therapy, chiropractic and surgery could also be
      used. Attempts have also been made to apply classical massage in treating painful shoulder,
      although it is not often used due to its low effectiveness.This study compares classical
      massage and massage based on the tensegrity rule which is not commonly known.
