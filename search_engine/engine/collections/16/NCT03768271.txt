        -  usual lab parameters

        -  plasma, serum and urines

        -  peripheral X-Rays, Ultrasounds and MRI at different time points Those visits have non
           interventional character (no therapeutic decision will be taken) Those collected data
           will allow submissions of many research projects to the scientific committee of the
           cohort.
