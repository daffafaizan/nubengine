    
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, dose-ranging study followed by a
      placebo-controlled, double-blind, repeated-dose extension to evaluate the effectiveness and
      safety of anti-TNF chimeric monoclonal antibody (cA2) compared to placebo in the treatment of
      patients with active Crohn's disease. The primary efficacy outcome of the study is a
      comparison of the proportion of patients achieving a clinical response at the 4-week
      evaluation. Clinical response is defined as a reduction from baseline in the Crohn's Disease
      Activity Index (CDAI) score of at least 70 points. Additional measurements of effectiveness
      include the clinical response over time, the time to loss of response, clinical remission
      over time, and changes in the Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Inflammatory Bowel
      Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ), Crohn's Disease Endoscopic Index of Severity (CDEIS) scores and
      C-reactive protein values.
