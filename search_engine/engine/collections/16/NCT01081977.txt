      blood volume transfusion to the neonate and 30-35 mg increase in iron stores at birth(5).The
      neonatal benefits include higher hematocrit (Hct), higher red blood cells flow to vital
      organs, better cardiopulmonary adaptation, additional iron stores and less anemia in later
      infancy(6).It is evident from different studies that no adverse effects of DCC have been
      noticed in mothers as well as in their neonates(7). The beneficial effect of delayed cord
      clamping is not only observed in term infants but it has a positive impact on preterm and
      small for gestational age (SGA) infants too. The requirement of packed cell transfusion in
      first six months has significantly reduced as noticed from different studies(8).It is also
      associated with lower risk of intraventricular hemorrhage and late onset sepsis in preterm
      infants(9).

      The practice of early cord clamping (ECC) is commonly following in our maternity units. It is
      believed that it reduces the risk of post partum haemorrhage (PPH) and duration of third
      stage of labour. But at the same time it does not provide any benefit to the
      neonate(4).Conversely it increases the possibility of fetomaternal transfusion, hypovolemic
      damage, neonatal anemia, respiratory distress syndrome and type 2 diabetes in later
      life(5).The risk of iso immunization in rhesus negative mothers are also increased with
      ECC(10).
