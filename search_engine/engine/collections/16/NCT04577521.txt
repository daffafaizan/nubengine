      study. The patients with grade II and III (Kellgren Lawrence classification) osteoarthritis
      of the knee attending outpatients were planned to enroll the study. Patients between the age
      18-80 years who did not achieve remission of pain despite receiving the first-line treatment
      for gonarthrosis including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs medication, activity
      modification and ice, were planned to included in the study. A single dose of HA will be
      injected into the target knee joint. Clinical evaluation will be done using the Western
      Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) and the short form-36
      questionnaires (SF-36 v2) at baseline, 3 months and 6 months by a clinical secretariat.
