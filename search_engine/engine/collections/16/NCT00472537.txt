      years the use of a prosthesis in the repair procedure has proved very effective in preventing
      a new hernia. A retromuscular mesh placement seems to have superior results. The mesh may be
      placed retromuscular through an open surgical procedure or through a laparoscopic procedure
      in an intra-abdominal position. Both procedures are highly standardized. A heavy weight mesh
      is used in the open procedure, fixed in the midline only, and a composite mesh is used
      intraabdominally and fixed only with titanium tackers.

      SF-36 is used to assess the quality of life, and its subscale BP (bodily pain) is used as
      primary outcome 3 weeks postoperatively. Secondary endpoints are return to daily life, pain,
      complications, recurrence, patient satisfaction and cosmetic outcome.

      Subjects are assessed at 1,3,8 weeks post operation and after 12 months.
