      After 3 months of blanking-period, patients off antiarrhythmic therapy freedom from atrial
      arrhythmia (including atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter and atrial fibrillation) will be
      divided into Hybrid group and Surgical group randomly and equally. Patients of Hybrid group
      will receive transcatheter endocardial electrophysiological mapping and catheter ablation
      after randomization subsequently. In followed 2 years, cardiovascular risk control will be
      recommended to 2 groups' patients.

      During the 2-year follow-up, 7d-Holter will be used to monitor patients' rhythm and cardiac
      conditions will be confirmed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE). Physical examination
      and examinations mentioned above will be performed in 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, 18
      months, 24 months and suspected recurrence.
