      development of tachyphylaxis to the continued daily administration of TPTD beyond 6 months,
      cyclic therapy might be optimal. Since Denosumab (Prolia) is a potent antiresorptive agent
      with a rapid off-effect, it might be the optimal agent to help maximize bone gains with
      cyclic TPTD/antiresorptive therapy. Our primary hypothesis is that the increment in bone
      density of the spine by DXA will be greater in women randomized to receive the cyclic
      sequential regimen (three separate 6 month cycles of daily subcutaneous TPTD, each followed
      by one subcutaneous injection of Denosumab) compared with daily sequential therapy (18 months
      of daily subcutaneous TPTD followed by Denosumab therapy for 18 months).
