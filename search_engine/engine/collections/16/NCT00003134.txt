      recurrent glioma. II. Assess the toxicities of irinotecan in these patients. III. Correlate
      the pharmacological parameters with toxicity and response to therapy.

      OUTLINE: This is a two arm study. Patients are stratified according to prior nitrosourea
      administration. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms, with only 1 arm being open at any time.
      Patients assigned to arm I receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
      This is followed by a 2 week rest and continues for a maximum of 6 courses. Patients assigned
      to arm II receive irinotecan on day 1 every 3 weeks for up to 12 courses. Patients in both
      arms who received prior nitrosoureas receive reduced starting doses of irinotecan. The
      dosages may be increased once per patient after the first course if toxic effects are
      acceptable. Arm I closed as of 10/98, Arm II open as of 10/98. Patients are followed every 3
      months for the first year, every 6 months for the next 4 years, then annually until death.
