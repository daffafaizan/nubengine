      care practices to compare influenza vaccination rates in intervention and control sites.
      Intervention sites will use a package of newly developed and evidence-based techniques that
      will be tailored to their practice structure and culture, called the 4 Pillars Immunization
      Toolkit, in addition to receiving donated vaccine for early season vaccination. Control
      practices will not receive such assistance but will receive the intervention in the second
      year.
