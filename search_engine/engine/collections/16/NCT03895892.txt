      has the potential to improve athletic. To attain such state, individuals must restrict
      carbohydrate intake to a maximum of 50g/ day or 10% while keeping protein intake moderate.
      One of the biggest challenges to achieve and maintain ketosis is complying with the diet due
      to its restrictive nature. Consequently, manufacturers have developed supplements that can
      induce a state of ketosis acutely (~1 hour). Unfortunately, there is very little evidence
      supporting the use of these supplements to enhance athletic performance. Hyperketonemia
      (blood ketone concentration > 0.2 Mm) seems to elevate the rate of utilization of ketone
      bodies. These changes in substrate utilization may allow athletes to preserve, something that
      would be advantageous for exercise performance. Ketone salts have been shown to elevate the
      concentration of ketones in blood and as such they may allow the body benefit from the
      apparent sparing of carbohydrates. Manufacturers now provide ketones salts combined with
      other ingredients such as caffeine. However it is unknown whether or not the addition of
      these ingredients has any positive or negative effect on athletic performance. Caffeine alone
      has been shown to improve athletic performance in several studies. Therefore, the purpose of
      this study is to compare the effectiveness of a caffeine free ketone salt supplement vs a
      caffeinated ketone salt supplement and their effects on a 20km time trial and a 30 second
      all-out Wingate test.
