      Proctectomy (ETAP) is not meaningfully inferior to Standard Laparoscopic TME for low lying
      rectal cancer requiring manual colo-anal anastomosis. The secondary objective will evaluate
      conversion rate, mini invasive level of abdominal approach postoperative morbidity, In
      hospital length of stay, Mesorectum macroscopic assessment, Functional urologic and sexual
      results, Fecal Continency, global QoL, stoma-free survival, disease-free survival at 3 years.
      Patients with non metastatic rectal adenocarcinoma requiring coloanal anastomosis will be
      considered for the study. Based on the non-inferiority hypothesis, the population estimated
      in this study at 226 patients, 113 for each arm. Inclusion period will be 3 years, the study
      will be running for 6 years.
