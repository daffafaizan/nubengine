      determine whether daily antimicrobial prophylaxis is superior to placebo in preventing
      recurrence of urinary tract infection (UTI) in children with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR).
      Eligibility criteria are described elsewhere. Patients were randomly assigned to treatment
      for 2 years with daily antimicrobial prophylaxis (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) or placebo.
      The study was designed to recruit 600 children (approximately 300 in each treatment group).
      The protocol encouraged prompt evaluation of children with UTI symptoms and early therapy of
      culture-proven UTIs. It was expected that approximately 10% of children will have to
      discontinue study medication due to allergic reactions. Assuming a 20% placebo event rate and
      10% non-compliance rate, the study has 83% power to detect an absolute 10% event rate in the
      antimicrobial prophylaxis group. If the placebo event rate is instead 25%, power is 97% to
      detect an absolute 10% event rate in the treated group, even if non-compliance is as high as
      15%. The primary analysis is intention-to-treat with missing outcome data analyzed as UTI.

      In addition to collecting follow-up data on urinary tract infections, renal scarring and
      antimicrobial resistance, quality of life, compliance, safety parameters, utilization of
      health resources, and change in VUR were assessed periodically throughout the study.
