      The first three patients will receive chemotherapy at the dose level 1 for 6 weeks (first
      three cycles). The dose will be escalated for the next patients by one dose level if none of
      the three patients at a dose level experience a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during the first
      six weeks. If one of the three patients has a DLT, an additional three patients will be
      enrolled at this dose level and the dose will be escalated if no additional patients
      experience a DLT. Otherwise, the dose escalation will be stopped, and the last dose will be
      regarded as the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). An intra-individual dose escalation is not
      planned.

      Expanded cohort:

      The MTD cohort will be expanded to a total of 16 patients.
