      obstructive azoospermia. Controversy exists regarding the efficacy of preoperative hormonal
      manipulation in patients with hypogonadism. However, it is possible that hormonal therapy
      increases intra-testicular testosterone levels, and with a rise in serum testosterone, sperm
      production and surgical success with microTESE improve.
