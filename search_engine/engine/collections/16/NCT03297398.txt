    
      Study SAR-202 is a phase 2 multicenter, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial to evaluate
      the effect of OPK-88004 doses (OPK-88004 15 mg, or OPK-88004 25 mg) on serum PSA compared to
      placebo in men with BPH. Approximately 115 men with BPH will be enrolled in the study,
      randomized 1:1:1 across three arms (placebo, OPK-88004 15 mg, or OPK-88004 25 mg). The trial
      will be conducted at approximately up to 35 sites within the US.

      The study duration for individual subjects will be up to 24 weeks and will include three
      phases:

        -  a screening period (up to 4 weeks, including 1-week washout if required),

        -  a treatment period (16 weeks), and

        -  a follow-up period (4 weeks) Subjects will be randomized and receive their first dose of
           study drug at visit 2. They will begin the once daily oral dosing regimen and return
           every 4 weeks to the study site during the 16-week treatment period. Assessments during
           the study period will include vital signs, laboratory testing, weight, adverse events
           (AEs), concomitant drugs, and study drug compliance. Efficacy assessments will include
           serum PSA, LBM and fat mass by DXA scans, uroflowmetry parameters, PVR (by ultrasound),
           and assessment of symptoms by IPSS.
