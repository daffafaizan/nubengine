    
      The Primary objective is:

      * Overall survival in patient with non metastatic osteosarcoma of the extremities treated
      with different chemotherapy approach (5 drugs vs 3 drugs), according to the expression of
      ABCB1/P-glycoprotein

      The Secondary objectives are:

        -  to assess the survival in patient who over express ABCB1/P-glycoprotein, with
           chemotherapy protocol based on all the 5 available active drugs (Methotrexate,
           cisplatinum, doxorubicine, ifosfamide and mifamurtide)

        -  to assess the survival in patient who do not over express ABCB1/P-glycoprotein
