    
      Aim 1: To demonstrate the feasibility of recruiting and randomizing adolescents with
      depression to a research protocol involving MBT and tDCS. The investigators expect that
      adolescents will be willing to enroll in a randomized trial involving MBT and tDCS.

      Aim 2: To test the tolerability of MBT and tDCS in adolescents. The investigators expect that
      MBT will be well-tolerated and that active tDCS will show no difference in tolerance compared
      to sham stimulation.

      Aim 3: To examine whether tDCS can enhance the effects of MBT. The investigators expect the
      MBT + tDCS group will show greater reduction in depressive symptoms compared to the MBT +
      sham stimulation group.

      Aim 4: To examine the mechanisms of MBT +/- tDCS treatment. The investigators expect that
      depression symptom improvement will be associated with decreased rumination, improvements in
      emotion regulation, increased task-based and resting state DLPFC-DMN and DLPFC-amygdala
      connectivity, as well as increased DLPFC activation and reduced amygdala activation during
      rumination and emotion processing tasks. The investigators also expect reduced alpha
      asymmetry and reduced LPP amplitude during emotion regulation and emotion processing. The
      investigators expect these changes will be greatest in the active tDCS + MBT group.
