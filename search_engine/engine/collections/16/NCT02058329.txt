      discharged to home will be enrolled after obtaining consent. Patients will be randomized into
      the intervention group and the usual standard of care group.We will be recruiting a total of
      100 patients , with equal numbers for each group.All patients will undergo an initial
      assessment by a Geriatric fellow prior to discharge . The intervention group will be seen at
      the time of discharge in the hospital and at home at 1, 3, and 6 months post hip fracture.
      The control group will be seen at the time of discharge in the hospital and then again at 6
      months for follow up. The two groups will then be compared for multiple known complications
      post hip fractures well as mortality.
