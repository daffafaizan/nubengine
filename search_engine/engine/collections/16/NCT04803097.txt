      surgery and primary IOL implantation at the Eye Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University
      between 2016 and 2019. Took Digital retro-illumination photographs of pediatric eyes at
      baseline and 6 months, 12 months, and the last visit postoperatively. Compare the capsular
      outcomes of the posterior capsule opening (PCO) area and visual axis transparent area at
      those time points, and analysis the correlations between the PCO area and influential
      factors, such as age at surgery, axial growth, and follow-up duration.
