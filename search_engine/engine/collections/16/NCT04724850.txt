      retrospectively and prospectively from all patients diagnosed with COVID-19 without hospital
      admission in our community from the start of the pandemic and for one year from the start of
      the study.

      These data will be obtained mainly from the clinical history and collected in the data
      collection notebooks and electronic base designed for the study for subsequent analysis. The
      data collection period will be one year, estimating a sample of 5,000 patients.

      In addition, patients included in the study prospectively will be asked for consent to
      collect a blood sample for freezing and storage in the Biobank of Extremadura and subsequent
      use to determine biomarkers and genetics.

      The present study will be carried out in accordance with the observational National
      Post-Authorization Study (EPA) for medicines for human use proposed by Valdecilla Health
      Research Institute (IDIVAL), the main objective of which is to determine the effectiveness of
      the pharmacological treatments currently used in COVID-19.
