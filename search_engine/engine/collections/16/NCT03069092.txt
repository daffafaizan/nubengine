      aerobic and resistance exercise, or a no exercise control group for 1 year. Participants in
      all four groups will receive healthy diet and lifestyle education sessions and will track
      their daily steps, body weights, and food intake throughout the 1-year intervention. They
      will also complete baseline, 6-month, and 12-month physical examinations, which will include
      assessments of blood pressure, blood lipids, body composition, and aerobic and muscular
      fitness.
