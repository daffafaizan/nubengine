    
      This is a randomized, open-label, phase III, multicenter, global study evaluating the
      efficacy and safety of Letrozole in heavily pretreated recurrent ovarian cancer patients in
      comparison to physician' choice chemotherapy.

      Subjects who meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be
      randomized in a 1:1 ratio to one of the two arms, as follow:

      Arm A: Letrozole 1 tablet (2,5 mg) orally once a day in 28-day cycles Arm B: Pegylated
      Liposomal Doxorubicin 40 mg/m2 d1q28 or Topotecan 4 mg/m2 d1,8,15q28 or Gemcitabine 1000
      mg/m2 d1,8,15q28 or Paclitaxel 80 mg/m2 d1,8,15q28 In case of objective response and
      acceptable toxicity, no maximum number of cycles of treatment is defined.

      The aim of the study is to assess the activity of Letrozole in women with recurrent
      epithelial ovarian cancer, heavily pretreated.
