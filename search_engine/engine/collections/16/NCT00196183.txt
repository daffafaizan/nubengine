      fibrillation (AF). However, discussion about the best ablation strategy is still ongoing.

      In patients with paroxysmal AF, it has been reproducibly demonstrated that curing rates of
      approximately 65-70% can be achieved with the electric isolation of pulmonary veins (PV)
      eliminating the initiating triggers of AF episodes. Recently, a new catheter ablation
      approach targeting in both atria fractionated, complex electrograms during ongoing AF and
      modifying thus the substrate maintaining AF has been described. The first describer of this
      technique reports curing rates of 92%. We want to compare in a randomized prospective study
      the treatment by PV isolation alone with a combined approach of PV isolation together with
      ablation of fractionated complex electrograms in patients with paroxysmal AF. Study endpoint
      is the achievement of stable sinus rhythm as assessed by 7 days holter ECG in the absence of
      antiarrhythmic drug treatment.
