platelet sequestration in man . i. methods .current methods of labeling platelets with chromium usingethylenediamine tetraacetate (edta) as an anticoagulant were found tocause rapid hepatic sequestration of nearly all the transfused plateletsabout 50 returned to the circulation but then were partially destroyedin the spleen . less than one-third survived . evidence is presentedwhich indicates that edta is injurious to platelets .when an acid-citrate medium that buffered plasma at ph 6.5 was used asan anticoagulant, 36 to 85 of the labeled platelets survived (average,62 ), and marked temporary sequestration did not occur . studies inthrombocytopenic persons showed that circulating platelet cr activitymeasures the true survival of such transfused platelets .the survival and sequestration of platelets were studied in normalsubjects . the survival data support the concept that platelets diechiefly by a process of senescence . external scintillation scanning ofthe various organs suggests that normally the majority of platelets isdestroyed in the liver .
