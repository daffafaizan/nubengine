3230. cerebral hemodynamics, blood gases, and electrolytesduring breath-holding and the valsalva maneuvercontinuous recordings of arterial andinternal jugular blood oxygen tension, oxy-gen saturation, carbon dioxide tension,ph, sodium and potassium, together withpeco2, blood pressure, andelectroencephalogram were obtained to compare theeffects of inspiratory and expiratorybreath-holding and the valsalva maneuver onthe cerebral circulation and cerebraloxygen availability in man.  during the inter-val of tolerated breath-holding for69 seconds or less, jugular venous oxygen tensionwas increased owing to increasedcerebral blood flow resulting from an increaseof arterial carbon dioxide tension.there was a statistically significant correlationbetween changes in jpo2 and paco2,which proved to be more or less linear forboth increases and decreases of paco2 4 mm.above and below control levels.  nothreshold was found for changes in paco2altering effective cerebral perfusion andcerebral venous po2, extremely smallchanges in paco2 (less than 1 mm. hg)altered cerebral oxygen availability within10 to 20 seconds.  during the valsalvamaneuver a consistent reduction of jugularoxygen tension was found associatedwith the sudden fall in arterial bloodpressure and reduction of arterial carbondioxide tension.  the rapid changes incerebral hemodynamics and cerebral oxy-gen availability during the procedureare briefly discussed.
