chromosomal patterns in cancer patients during treatment .radiation damages the chromosomes of human cells, and throughshort-term cultures of white blood cells some of this damage can beassessed . patients with cancer were selected for this study because ofthe large portions of the blood-forming tissues irradiated in the courseof treatment . chromosomal damage may be quantitative with variationsfrom the normal number of 46, or qualitative, thereby showing structuralaberrations . counting the chromosomes in cells from cultures grownprior to therapy and at intervals during treatment enables us todetermine the variation .stained preparations examined microscopically allow us to recognizethese abnormalities which are apparent before, during, and afterradiotherapy . the damage appears to be largely random in thechromosomes affected in the different cancers, and the specificaberrations differ from cell to cell . however, there does seem to besome correlation between the appearance of persistent aberrantchromosomes and their frequency . while the peak incidence or /plateau/may remain unchanged, the frequency may change .
