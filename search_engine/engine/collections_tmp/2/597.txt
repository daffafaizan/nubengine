effect of testosterone propionate and growth hormone ongrowth and chemical composition of muscle and othertissues in hypophysectomized male ratsthe effect of testosteronepropionate and growth hormone on thegrowth of muscle, bone, pelt, viscera andseminal vesicles was studied in hypophysectomizedmale rats.  testosterone (0.1 mg/day)stimulated growth in the levator ani muscleand seminal vesicles but had no effect on theother tissues studied.  growth hormone (0.1mg/day) accelerated growth in all tissuesexcept the seminal vesicles.  testosterone didnot enhance the growth-promoting effect ofgrowth hormone in any tissue except thelevator ani muscle.  growth hormone stimulateddeposition of myosin, sarcoplasmicproteins, collagen and alkali-soluble proteinsin the thigh muscle of hypophysectomizedrats.  the composition of the muscle in treatedand control hypophysectomized rats was thesame as that in normal rats.  growth hormonealso increased the collagen, keratin-clastinand globular protein content of the pelt.  theeffect of growth hormone on the proteins ofmuscle and pelt was not enhanced by testosterone.testosterone given alone had no effecton the chemical composition or content of themuscle and pelt in hypophysectomized rats.
