studies on aging with horse crystalline lens gel as a contribution tobiomorphosis of the mammalian crystalline lens .the effects of biomorphosis -dash the continuous material change inthe chemical composition of the organs and tissues -dash are studied onthe horse crystalline lens in respect of its amino acid content subjectto substantial variations in the course of life . it is shown byelectrophoretic and paperchromatographic methods that the qualitativecomposition of horse crystalline lenses remains quite the same, but thatwithin the individual age stages there occur quantitative variationsbetween the individual amino acids .
