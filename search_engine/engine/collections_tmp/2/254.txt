specific suppression of tumor growth by isolated peritoneal macrophagesfrom immunized mice .methods were presented by which macrophages may be isolated from theperitoneal cell population of mice . these cells, and for comparisonperitoneal lymphocytes and lymph node cells, were tested for immunologicactivity by injecting a mixture of the test cells and tumor cellssubcutaneously into irradiated mice . each cell type, when obtained fromimmunized mice, was capable of suppressing the growth of the specifictumor cells . the results are discussed with respect to a possiblespecific immunologic function for macrophages in graft rejection .
