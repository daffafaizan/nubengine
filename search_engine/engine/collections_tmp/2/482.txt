2529. repair of damage induced by a monofunctional alkylating agent in atransformable, ultraviolet-sensitive strain of bacillus subtilisa uv sensitive, transformable strain ofb. subtilis (uvr-) was unable to carry outhost cell reactivation of the virulentbacteriophage spo1.  the ratio of the slopes(kuvr-/kuvr+) of the uv inactivation curveswas 6-8 for cells or for whole phage, and 2for indole+ transforming dna or forspo1 phage dna measured in a transformingsystem.  whole phage inactivated withnitrogen mustard showed greater survival onuvr+ cells than on uvr-; there was no suchdifference for whole phage inactivated withmethyl methanesulfonate.  whole uvr+ cellsrecovered from uv induced damage, asdetermined by an increase in extractabletransforming activity during a period ofincubation in which net dna synthesis didnot occur.  uvr- cells were unable to reco-ver from uv induced damage but they didrecover from methyl methanesulfonateinduced damage in similar experiments.density labeled (h2n15) methyl methanesul-fonate treated uvr+ cells incubated in (h1n14)medium containing (h3) thymidine show-ed a 3-fold increase in extractable transformingactivity, with no formation of newdna molecules as determined by pyknometricanalysis.  the repair of damage in-duced by uv irradiation differs by at least onestep from the repair of damage in-duced by methyl methanesulfonate.
