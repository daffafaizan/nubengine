some speculations on the nature and significance of developmentallysmall kidneys (renal hypoplasia).renal hypoplasia may take several forms.among these the best known is perhapsrenal dysplasia in which the parenchymais maldeveloped.  other forms of hypoplasiain which the renal parenchyma is normallyformed but merely diminished in amount,do exist and may have severe clinicalconsequences.  the finding at postmortemexamination of anatomically small kidneysin children who suffered excessive orunexplained dehydration has prompted thethought that renal tubular insufficiency mayresult from renal hypoplasia.
