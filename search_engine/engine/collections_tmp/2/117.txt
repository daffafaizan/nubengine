current techniques in the surgical approach to aortic and mitralvalvular disease .1. the aortic and mitral valves can be operated upon successfully andtotally replaced with a prosthetic device of the ball-valve type withgood long-term results . seventy-four cases are reported .2. in aortic valvular disease the outcome in the immediatepostoperative period is influenced primarily by the presence of calcificaortic stenosis as well as the presence or absence of disease in thecoronary arteries .3. we have significantly decreased the appearance of a low-outputsyndrome postoperatively in patients who are suffering from severemitral disease by leaving the papillary muscle-chordae tendineae-muralleaflet relationship intact . we feel this adds strength to eachcontraction .4. there have been no late deaths in the follow-up period to date(thirty months) in any patient with replacement of aortic or mitralvalves with the ball-valve prosthesis .
