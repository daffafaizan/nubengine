1044. an investigation of lymphocyteproduction in guinea-pigbone marrowevidence from a variety of experiments indicatesthat lymphocytes are produced inguinea-pig bone marrow.  under certain conditionsthe numbers produced appear tobe considerable.  during recovery from irradiationthere are numerous telophasesin marrow smears which appear to be forming smalllymphocytes.  moreover, manylymphocytes are still found in shielded bone marrowafter the rest of the body, in-cluding the conventional lymphoid tissues, hasreceived lethal or supra-lethal irra-diation.  almost 50% of these cells are formedafter the irradiation.  finally, whenbone marrow is cultured in the peritoneal cavityof a host whose own lymphocyteproduction has been suppressed by irradiation,small percentages of newly-formedsmall lymphocytes are found in this marrow.
