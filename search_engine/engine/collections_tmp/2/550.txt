control of idiopathic hypercalciuriathe paper discusses the causes of hypercalciuria and describes15 cases of different origins all of which presented similarlywith renal stones.  the diagnosis of idiopathic hypercalciuriawas made by exclusion.  the effects of dietary restriction ofcalcium, sodium bicarbonate, cortisone, sodium phosphate,sodium phytate, and cellulose phosphate were demonstrated bycalcium and phosphorus balance techniques.  all were shownto have some urinary-calcium-lowering effect.  finally, achlorothiazide derivative--namely, bendrofluazide--was alsodemonstrated to have a hypocalciuric effect, and the mode ofaction is discussed.
