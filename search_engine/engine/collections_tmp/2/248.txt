lung scanning with colloidal risa .the use of colloidal risa injected intravenously in a particle size of10.50 microns followed by lung photoscanning offers a practical,atraumatic method of visualizing pulmonary artery occlusions in the dogthe fact that the particles have a relatively short biologicalhalf-life appears to decrease the radiation dose delivered and theduration of occlusion of pulmonary capillaries as compared to ceramicmicrospheres . work is in progress to apply this technique to the studyof pulmonary artery occlusion in the human .
