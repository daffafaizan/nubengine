2281. inhibition of active transport of sugars through rat intestine in vitro.ii. action of mepacrine, atractyloside and seleniteit is shown that mepacrine, atractyloside and selenite, which had been regardedas inhibitors of intestinal absorption of glucose, are inhibitors of activetransport of sugars in sacs of everted jejunum of rat (wilson and wiseman'smethod).  mepacrine 5 x 10 -3 m and 10 -2 m inhibit, by 85% and 100%respectively, the active transport of galactose.  with atractyloside 10 -5 mand 10 -3 m, the inhibitions were 77% and 100% and, with selenite 10 -4 m and10 -3 m, about 70%.  in general the inhibitors are effective within orders ofmagnitude which are similar in vivo and in vitro.  atractyloside is rather moreeffective in vitro than in vivo, and mepacrine rather less.  it is easier toachieve total inhibitions of the active transport of sugars in vitro than ofintestinal absorption from isotonic solutions in vivo.
