pathology of schistosoma japonicum in the taiwanese monkey(macaca cyclopis).  i.  comparison of formosan and japanese strains.ii.  effect of passing the formosan strain through japanese snails.i.   nearly equal recovery rates of adult wormsfrom taiwanese monkeys (macacacyclopis) infected with formosan or japanesestrains of sch. japonicum were recorded.worm recovery rates from the monkeyswere low when comparison wasmade with the highly susceptible laboratoryrabbit, signifying only partial susceptibility.formosan strain granulomas inthe liver contained fewer eggs butwere considerably more severe and extensivethan japanese strain granulomas.the possibility that the large, atypical granulomascould be reactions to young,degenerating formosan worms is discussed.an alternative hypothesis to explainthe dissimilar reactions, that formosan straineggs are stronger tissue irritantsthan those of the japanese strain, is proposed.ii.   the formosan strain of sch. japonicumwas passed through the japanese snailintermediate host (oncomelania nosophora)for 4 consecutive generations.  progressivelyrising rates of snail infection andmortality were recorded.  the resultantlaboratory strain of formosan schistosomewas used to infect taiwanesemonkeys.  monkeys infected with the naturalformosan strain and natural japanesestrain served as controls.  worm recoveryrates were similar in the 3 groups.granulomatous responses in the liver producedby the laboratory strain were comparedwith the large atypical granulomas ofthe natural formosan strain and theconventional granulomas of the natural japanesestrain.  the new formosan strainappeared altered toward characteristics possessedby the japanese strain.
