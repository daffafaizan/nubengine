acid catabolic enzyme activity in relationto accessory limb and cancer initiation in amphibiacathepsin and acid phosphatase were determined in livers and kidneysof adult rana pipiens and triturus viridescens.  organ-specific and species-specific differences in distribution of these enzymes were found, as well asconsiderable differences in the effect triton x-100 on the two enzymes.a heterogeneous population of lysosomes in respect to enzyme content andstability is deduced.we have found positive correlations between catheptic activity of theimplant and host tissue dissociation, and between acid phosphatase andinducibility, as features of the phenomenon of implant-induced accessorylimb formation in urodeles.  further, we have found a positive correlationbetween catheptic activity and resistance to virus-induced renal adenocar-cinoma development in rana pipiens.
