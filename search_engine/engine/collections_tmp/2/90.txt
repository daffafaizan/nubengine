use of a cross-circulation technique in studying respiratory responsesto co .the effect of hypercapnia and hypocapnia on ventilation wasinvestigated in cross-circulated dogs in which the recipient dog's headand neck regions were perfused by blood from a donor dog . hypercapniaof the donor dog was produced by administering co -o -n gas mixtures inthe inspired air . hypocapnia was produced by hyperventilating the donordog with the aid of a respiratory pump . when the donor dog washyperventilated, the ventilation of the recipient was maintained at orjust below its resting level and it was independent of the arterial pcoof the donor . the donor dog was apneic when the artificialhyperventilation was suspended and this response was not abolished byvagotomy . bilateral vagotomy caused an increase in ventilation in therecipient when its head was perfused by hypocapnic blood . bilateralremoval of the carotid receptors did not influence the response to coqualitatively although there was some reduction in the ventilation ofthe recipient to cephalic hypercapnia . the ventilation of the recipientdog was best correlated to the ph and pco of its cerebrospinal fluid inboth hypercapnic and hypocapnic states .
