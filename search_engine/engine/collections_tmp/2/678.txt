the role of age and x-irradiation on kidneyfunction in the mousefemale mouse kidneys show a decline with respect to age in the ability toconcentrate the urine during a 24-hour water fast.  x-irradiation early inlife has no measurable long-term effect on this process.kidney cortex slices of old female mice can concentrate p-aminohippuricacid against a concentration gradient equally as well as slices from youngmice.  there is no loss in this ability by cortex slices from young or oldfemale x-irradiated mice.it is uncertain whether compensatory renal hypertrophy after unilateralnephrectomy declines with age in nonirradiated mice.  x-irradiation doescause a reduction in the degree of compensatory renal hypertrophy in the agingmouse.  this reduction may represent a loss in the ability of kidney cells toundergo cell division.the administration of testosterone propionate to old mice during compen-satory renal hypertrophy results in an increased hypertrophy.  the increase isrelatively the same for irradiated and nonirradiated mice, indicating the lackof a long-term effect of x-irradiation to reduce the ability of a targetorgan to respond to a hormone.the over-all conclusion of this study, with respect to "radiation-inducedaging," is that x-irradiation of the female swiss mouse early in life does nothave a pronounced effect on kidney function late in life but may have a long-term effect on those processes concerned with cell division.
