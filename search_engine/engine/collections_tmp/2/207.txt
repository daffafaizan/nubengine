establishment of a cell line in vitro from a case of human lung cancer .1) one cell line has been established from the pneumonectomizedspecimen of a case with lung cancer, which was diagnosed asundifferentiated cell carcinoma and partially adenocarcinoma by itshistological findings and was characterized with intracytoplasmic fatdroplets in them .2) the morphological changes of the cells were repeated but they havebeen stabilized to their epithelial shapes after the 35th transfer . thecell atypy of the culture was remarkable . phagocytosis of the cell linehas not been observed . it was characterized that the intracytoplasmicdroplets found in the original cancer cells have been maintained in thecultured cells, even in their mitotic stage, throughout the culturalcourse .3) concerning the chromosomal constitution diploid cells were only 15per cent . the range of chromosome number did not show sharp peak,forming two groups of near diploid and near tetraploid ranges .4) transplanting the cell to cheekpouches of golden hamsters, theimplanted cells grew from the inoculum of 10 cells in conditioned animalbut did not show the invasiveness to neighbour tissue and metastasis toother organs .
