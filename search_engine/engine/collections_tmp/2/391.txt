1671. the use of 99m tc pertechnetate in cardiac scanningtechnetium 99m pertechnetate has been utilizedin the aas' laboratory for scanning thecardiac blood pool.  the delineation of the heartpool and surrounding vasculatureis comparable to that obtained with the standard131 i compounds now in use.  in theauthors' hands 99m tc had the following advantagessince they routinely utilized99m tc for brain and thyroid scans, it is available,eliminating the purchase andshelf decay of other materials.  three to 5 mc quantitiesmay be administeredwith relatively low patient radiation dosage.  theassociated high count rate permitsrapid scanning.  the identification of pericardial effusionsis enhanced by the radio-activity in the stomach which in some cases becomesabnormally separated fromthe cardiac blood pool.
