relationship of maximal tubular phosphatereabsorption to filtration rate in the doga maximal renal tubular rate of reabsorption of phos-phate (tmp) has been demonstrated in the normal dog.  inthe dog, as in the man, considerable variability in the tmpoften occurs.  while some of this variability remains unex-plained, a direct relationship between glomerular filtrationrate (gfr) and tmp can be demonstrated when the gfr isvaried over a wide range.  this relationship suggests thatglomerular intermittency may exist in the dog.
