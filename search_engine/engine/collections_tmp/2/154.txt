studies on the kinetics of transplantation immunity .using the parameter of the number of tumor cells necessary to produces.c. tumors in allogeneic animals at varying intervals after antigenicstimulation, immunity was found to be in force as early as 2 days afterprimary antigenic stimulation . it reached a peak at 8-10 days and hadlargely subsided by the end of a month . this method was also applied tothe quantitative study of the onset, degree, and duration of immunityelicited by skin grafts . the results obtained with inocula of largenumbers of tumor cells (10 percent) were comparable to those obtainedwith massive skin grafts .the differences in the degree of antigenic stimulation resulting fromdifferent routes of inoculation were studied . it was found that theintradermal (i.d.) route of inoculation resulted in a more intenseantigenic stimulation than the s.c. route . when both routes ofinoculation were used simultaneously the pattern of growth of the s.c.tumor was influenced by the i.d. inoculation.. an i.d. inoculum given 24or 48 hr earlier caused marked suppression of growth of the s.c. tumor,while when an i.d. inoculation was preceded by an s.c. inoculation,although there was an appreciable effect on the growth size, the growthcurves of the 2 tumors were always parallel .there was no correlation between cytotoxic activity and the degree ofimmunity in force at a given time .
