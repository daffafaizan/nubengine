distribution of transfused tritiated cytidine-labeled leukocytes and redcells in the bone marrow of normal and irradiated rat .in normal rats and after total body irradiation with 550 r of x-rays,the fate in the bone marrow of labeled nucleated and red cells oftransfused peripheral blood was observed autoradiographically .labeled nucleated cells, most of which were lymphocyte-like cells,readily migrated into the marrow parenchyma in normal animals (2 cells/1,000 parenchymal cells/hr.) . following irradiation to at least 27-51hr., this migration appeared to be relatively increased . beyond thistime, parenchymal areas were more difficult to be defined as such .labeled red cells were rarely observed to enter parenchyma despite thepresence of nonlabeled erythrocytes within the parenchymal structureafter irradiation .the vascular bed following irradiation increased greatly as theparenchyma diminished to a minimum of less than 10 percent control at 75hr . despite these changes in the architecture of the marrow, theaverage density of labeled cells per area of marrow corresponded tovalues expected on the assumption of a free-flowing circulation . thetechnique used at present did not allow us to distinguish, at all times,between a free-flowing circulation through intact sinusoids or throughareas in which the sinusoidal wall, as such, was destroyed .
