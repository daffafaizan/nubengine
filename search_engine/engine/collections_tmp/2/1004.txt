congenital extrahepatic biliary atresia.  a successful operated case onductus hepaticus obstruction.the author briefly reviews the history andthe anatomical manifestations and thegenesis of congenital extrahepatic biliary atresia,and its associations with otherabnormalities.  he collected 957 cases in theliterature from ladd's first successfuloperated case up to the end of the year 1961.in publications he found 177 theoreticallycorrectable cases and 124 which wererecovered.  in 1 of 2 personal caseshe performed successfully a hepatico-duodenostomyin a 7-week-old girl.  fouryears later the girl had developed normallyand she was absolutely without symptomsand signs.  the author, discussing thedifferential diagnostic problems, stressesthe diagnostic value of the gradually increasingdirect serum bilirubin, proposingthe term 'ex juvantibus differentiation' alludingto the differential diagnostic evaluationof the time which passes until the surgicalexploration; he also emphasizes theneed of early-latest up to the age of 8 weeksperformed-surgical exploration.according to him the administration of vit. kis advantageous.  he supposes the causeof the postoperative dehiscence of the operativewound lies in the metabolic changesas a result of icterus.  the author in his owncase, the relieved drainage of thebilio-digestive anastomosis solved by the helpof a polyethylene nasal tube andwhich could be most safely removed by thesurgeon.  with statistical data of otherauthors and personal cases, the author pointsout that the correctable cases occurin 19.8% of all the cases.  one may hope forsuccessful operations on an averagein 10.2% of all the cases and 50.8% of the correctableones.  fatal complications,the author believes, can be reduced by early surgery.
