7839.cortical ph and the blood-brain barriera method was described for measuringthe ph, dc and ac potentials concurrentlyon the cerebral cortex of the adult cat,under conditions of controlled ventilation.kittens and rabbits were also studied.the cortical ph response to i.v. nahco3was acidic and was accompanied by adc negativity, while the blood became alkaline.such an acidic response was present inthe rabbit and kitten.  it was not presentin a number of other tissues in the cat,including the dura.  the cortical acidicresponse was not affected, qualitatively,by i.v. acetazolamide, prolonged hypoxiaor 10% (v/v) co2.  it was reduced reversiblyby 20% (v/v) co2.  it was not affectedby removal of the arachnoid membrane.the cortical ph response to an i.v. nh4+salt solution was complex.  nh4c1 did notproduce an alkaline response.  the corticalph response to an alkaline or an acidicsodium phosphate solution was augmentedbut not changed in its direction followingtreatment of the cortex with n-butanol.the results were interpreted in terms ofa restriction of hco3- by the blood-brainbarrier, through which co2 can pass.  thisrestriction is probably non-specific forinorganic ions, and perhaps for othersubstances.  it does not appear to be relatedto a low cerebral extracellular space,and is independent of substantial oxidative metabolism.
