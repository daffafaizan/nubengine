effect of abdominal operation on glucose tolerance and serum levels ofinsulin, growth hormone, and hydrocortisone.abdominal operations of moderate severity arefollowed by high fasting blood-glucose levels and a reducedtolerance to intravenous glucose which persistsfor at least 72 hours after operation.  fasting plasma-insulinlevels are raised after surgery.  intravenous glucoseproduces much higher levels of serum-insulin andgrowth hormone in the immediate postoperative period.corticotrophin infusion increases the plasma-hydrocortisonelevels and reduces glucose assimilation to agreater extent than operation, but has no effect on serum-insulinor growth-hormone levels.
