serologic epidemiologic studies with m. pneumoniae. i. demonstrationof an hemagglutinin and its inhibition by antibody.a new direct, specifichemagglutination reactionwith live m. pneumoniae is described.this requires the presence of a natural antibodyfor the red cell in thehorse serum employed in thediluent.  although vervetmonkey erythrocytes generallyhave been employed,human and rabbit cells may beused.  hemagglutinationcan be inhibited by specific antibodybut heat inactivationof the sera is required,whether they be human oranimal in origin.  antibodiespersist for many years andare passively transferred tothe fetus.  a micro variationhas been devised.  the testis useful for diagnosticand epidemiologic studies and,in reverse, can be utilizedfor the rapid serologicidentification of new isolates.the method is limited,at present, to m. pneumoniae.
