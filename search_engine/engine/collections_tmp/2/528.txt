2127. selenium toxicity in domestic animalsthe article, with an extensive bibliography, is a compendium of availableinformation on selenium toxicity in domestic animals.  literature revealsevidence of organically bound se being more biologically active, when givenorally to domestic animals, than inorganic se salts.  there is also variationin toxicity of organic se analogs.  when exposed to ruminal digestion, there isconsiderable reduction of se salts to the relatively biologically inactiveelemental se; which may result in fecal excretion of se, as such, to as muchas 40% of a single oral dose.  fluorine, molybdenum, chromium, vanadium,cadmium, zinc, cobalt, nickel and uranium increase se toxicity.  arsenic andtungsten give some protection against it.  bromobenzene, benzene, andnapthalenemobilize tissue se and stimulate its excretion.  since se preparations designedfor topical application in treatment of skin disease have been available forusein both man and dogs, the literature has reported cases of poisoning frommisuseof such preparations.  selenium, properly used, can be a valuable therapeuticagent, though certain salts of se must be regarded as potentially toxic.however, there is considerable latitude between therapeutic and/or nutritionaland toxic doses of these salts.
