compensatory renal enlargementhypertrophy versus hyperplasiaafter unilateral nephrectomy in the mouse, the compensatory growthof the remaining kidney is characterized by an increase in rna andprotein synthesis within the first hour.  dna synthesis remains un-changed for about 18 hours and then rises to a maximum at 48 hours.  bythe end of the fifth day, when dna synthesis has passed its peak and isin decline, cellular hyperplasia has accounted for only one-fourth of theincrease in kidney weight.  thus it is shown that cell hypertrophy is boththe primary and the predominant response in the early phase of compen-satory renal enlargement.
