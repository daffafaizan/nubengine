relationships of growth hormone, steroids and relaxin in thetransformation of pubic joint cartilage to ligament inhypophysectomized micethe histological changes occurringin the pubic joint of hormonallytreated intact or hypophysectomized micehave been studied.  estrogen treatment resultedin bone resorption and transformationof the cartilage caps of the pubic bones tofibrocartilage in intact mice but not in hypophysectomizedmice.  furthermore, relaxinfailed to influence the appearance of the pubicjoint of estrogen-primed hypophysectomizedmice, whereas it induced the development oflong interpubic ligaments in intact mice.when growth hormone (sth) was administeredto hypophysectomized mice, the pubicjoints responded to estrogen with bone resorptionand transformation of the cartilage capsto fibrocartilage.  sth treatment also restoredthe ability of the pubic joint of hypophysectomizedmice to proliferate long interpubic ligamentswhen estrogen and relaxin were administered.progesterone specifically inhibitedligament formation due to relaxin injectionwithout altering the histological changesassociated with estrogen treatment, both inintact mice and in sth-maintained, hypophysectomized mice.
