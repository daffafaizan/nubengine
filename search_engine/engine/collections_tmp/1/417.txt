896. studies on blood viscosity and its significance in anesthesiathe principles for measuring blood viscosityhave been discussed.  although blooddoes not behave in a newtonian manner,the data obtained in in vitro measurementare useful.  a modified simple method formeasuring blood viscosity relative to nor-mal saline has been described.  there isessentially no difference in viscosity be-tween fresh blood and heparinized blood and between plasma and serum.viscosity varies with the quantity and nature of proteinsin plasma and the cellular concentra-tion.  halothane and thiopental sodium reduceblood viscosity and seem to be indicat-ed in conditions in which there is hemoconcentrationand a tendency for red bloodcells to aggregate.  cyclopropane, hypothermia,and norepinephrine tend to raiseblood viscosity and would seem to be contraindicatedwhen the microcirculation is failing.
