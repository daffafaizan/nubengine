1377. establishment of a tissue culture strain jtc-14 from actino-mycin-induced ascites sarcoma, and its biological characterscell line jtc-14 has been maintained for morethan 2 yr. and subcultured 93 times.cells from the 10th subculture on subcutaneousinjection into mice produced tumorsidentical with those produced by the originalcells.  judged by the time taken to killmice on intraperitoneal injection the tissueculture cells were not as malignant asthe original tumor cells.  after passage inanimals the cells were easily re-establishedin culture in vitro.
