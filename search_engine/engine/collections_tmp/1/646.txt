studies on mycoplasma pneumoniaeinfection in swedensera from 107 cases of pneumonia and 132 cases of milder respiratoryinfection were examined by the cf test against m. pneumoniae antigen.thirty-five patients with pneumonia and 2 patients with bronchitis hadserologic evidence of m. pneumoniae infection.  all cases which had asignificant antibody rise with the cf test also showed a correspondingrise with the fluorescent antibody test.  m. pneumoniae was isolatedfrom 10 of 18 serologically positive cases.  cold agglutinins were demon-strated in 17 of 37 cases (46 per cent) with m. pneumoniae infection.m. pneumoniae infections occurred during all seasons of the year andwere most common in older children and young adults.  the clinicalfeatures of the cases with m. pneumoniae infection in this study re-semble those described in similar investigations in other countries.
