maternal separation in the rhesus monkey .the present study involved separation of eight monkey mother-infantpairs for a period of two weeks and measurement of the behavior of theinfants before, during and after reunion with their mothers, and of themothers before and after reunion . all infants showed emotionaldisturbance in response to separation and drastic decreases in play andother complex social behaviors while separated .it is clear that infant-mother separation produces emotionaldisturbance in both human and macaque infants and that the patterns ofresponses following separation are similar in both species . the resultsobtained in studies of monkey infant-mother separation indicate thatsheer physical separation is the crucial aspect of maternal separationfor monkeys . undoubtedly other factors associated with separation fromthe mother are vitally important for human children, and may account inpart for the absence or rarity of the detachment stage (as seen in humanresponse pattern) in separated monkey infants . the overall results showconsiderable similarity in the responses of human children and infantmonkeys to separation from the mother .
