pneumoencephalographic changes in the cavum septi pellucidi and theirclinical significance.the pneumoencephalographic appearances andclinical problems associated withcommunicating and non-communicating cavumsepti pellucidi are discussed on thebasis of 11 cases.  non-communicating cspmay lead to intermittent headaches dueto variations of intracranial pressure andobstruction to the flow of csf.  in rarecases, representing a special etiologicalgroup, the foramina of monro and theaqueduct may be narrowed.  a communicatingcsp is generally associated with mildto moderate symmetrical internal hydrocephalus.in the author's opinion this is inmost cases a direct result of the cavum, sincefluid continues to be formed in thecavum after communication with the rest ofthe ventricular system has been established.the conditions resemble those inhypersecretory hydrocephalus.  for thesereasons the author rejects the view that acommunicating csp is of no clinicalsignificance.  in some cases the possibility of acombination of a cavum with a cerebralmalformation must be considered.
