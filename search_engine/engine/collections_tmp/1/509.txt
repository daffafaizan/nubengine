1752. separation of the soluble proteins of bovine lenses onpolyacrylamide gelsthe soluble proteins of bovine lenses wereseparated by gel filtration on polyacryl-amide gels.  the presence of ethylenediaminetetra-acetate in the buffer was foundto be essential for achieving a good separationof the lens homogenate into fourfractions - a, b, c and d.  ultracentrifugal,electrophoretic and immunochemicalanalyses were used to compare these fractionswith the soluble crystallin fractionsof the lens.  fraction a was comparedwith a-crystallin, fractions b and c withb-crystallin and fraction d with y-crystallin.the distribution of these four proteinfractions in the nuclear and cortical partsof calf and cow lenses was determined.the oxidation-sensitive protein fraction ofthe calf lenses was separated fromfraction b on an se-sephadex column.
