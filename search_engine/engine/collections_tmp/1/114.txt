congenital heart disease in the adult .events in the natural course of 310 adult patients with provedsignificant congenital cardiac anomalies have been reviewed to determineincidence, longevity, complications and cause of death .atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus were the mostfrequently encountered lesions and comprised over one third of theentire series . ventricular septal defect and pulmonic stenosis made upalmost a quarter of the group . twenty-two instances of the eisenmengersyndrome secondary to a variety of shunting lesions are included .bacterial endocarditis, sudden death and cardiac decompensation werethe greatest threats to these patients . symptoms were minimal until theappearance of heart failure, which was the most common cause of death,especially with older patients . sudden death occurred most often inpatients with ventricular septal defect .although the clinical features are usually characteristic of acongenital malformation, young adults with acyanotic congenital heartdisease are often misdiagnosed as rheumatic,. and in older patients,presenting manifestations are frequently attributed to arterioscleroticheart disease . at times an associated acquired cardiovascular disordermay alter the basic syndrome .three quarters of the patients survive and continue under observationthe ability of many to live active, productive lives and to withstandstress, surgery, both cardiac and non-cardiac, and pregnancy wasimpressive . further observation of the patient with congenital heartdisease but without surgical intervention is essential for accurateevaluation of the long term efficacy of cardiac surgery .
