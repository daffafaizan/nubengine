4958. the mechanism of messenger-rna replication in bacteriathe transformation of bacillus subtilissb25 his-tryp-by two linked genetic mar-kers under the action of hybrid moleculesof dna was investigated.  the molecularhybrids were obtained by thermal denaturationand annealing of a mixture of twodna's, each one extracted from a singleauxotrophic strain (h25 his-and 168 tryp-).the formation of the heterozygous dnadouble helices was proved by special experi-ments.  the transformation procedureexcluded dna synthesis by recipient cellsprior to the formation of enzymes forhistidine and tryptophane synthesis.  it wasfound that heterozygous molecules ofdna are able to transform in these conditionsthe double auxotrophic cells to prototrophicones.  this means that both strands ofthe dna double helix can serve as templatesfor the m-rna synthesis.  the possi-bility of a secondary replication of m-rnaoutside the chromosome under the actionof rna-polymerases, using rna as a primer,is discussed.
