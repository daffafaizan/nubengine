the effect of growth hormoneon kidney transamidinase in thehypophysectomized mousethe role of growth hormone and certain other endocrine factors in re-gulating kidney transamidinase has been investigated in the mouse.  thekidney transamidinase values are low following hypophysectomy.  growthhormone administration in doses of 0.5 to 5.0 ug/day (ovine nih) restorethe enzyme activity towards normal.  a bioassay for growth hormone issuggested based on the determination of the total kidney transamidinase.intact mice that had been given relatively large doses of triiodothyroninhad low enzyme activities.  enzyme values in alloxan-treated mice werenormal.
