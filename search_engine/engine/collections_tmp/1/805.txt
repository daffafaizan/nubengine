evaluation and treatment planningfor autistic childreninfantile autism is considered to be a re-action on the part of an immature organismat a primitive and undifferentiated stage ofego development.  little choice of defensivereactions is available; the possibility of sub-limation does not exist and, even thoughother object relationships are graduallydeveloping, the mother is still the child'sprimary object.  at this vulnerable develop-mental stage, a wide range of pathologicalcircumstances, ranging from the most severefamily psychopathology to the most adventi-tious physiological traumata or the most un-fortunately malignant circumstances, mayconstitute an acute or cumulative cata-strophic stress.  the primitive organismtends to respond to this overwhelming stresswith a paranoid reaction which is directed atthe mother (regardless of the actual etiologi-cal variables) because the mother is still thechild's primary object.  we believe that thechild then responds with an autistic reactionand shows varying degrees of simple with-drawal, obsessional behavior, magical or de-lusional thought processes, and consequentdisruption of developmental skills, speech,and relationships with others.many families can and do make everyeffort to counter the paranoid reaction of thechild and do not respond to his rejection withcounterrejection and counterwithdrawal.some of the child's autistic symptoms mayabate without formal treatment.  yet, sincethe mother (and family) are the primaryobjects of the child's paranoid attitude, it isfelt that formal therapeutic intervention isnecessary to modify the paranoid core ofthe autistic reaction.
