comparative studies of the glycogen content of heart, liver and brainbefore and after iodine treatment and under conditions of asphyxia .blood sugar level and glycogen concentration in the heart, brain andliver of rabbits after treatment with inorganic iodine, depot insulin,iodine and insulin combined, hostacortine and hostacortine and iodinecombined are being examined . a control group remains untreated . in asecond test series the glycogen determination under asphyxia (thetrachea is being pinched off for three minutes) is repeated .contrary to the brain the glycogen content of the heart muscle is notdependent upon the blood sugar level . after iodine treatment a loweringof the blood sugar becomes noticeable, but also an increase in heartglycogen . the liver glycogen shows greater variations . the levelsachieved in these test series therefore show no significant differencesduring asphyxia there is a significant lowering of glycogen in allthree organs . preliminary treatment with iodine succeeds in stoppingthe lowering of glycogen in the heart muscle and the brain . thepossible causes for this phenomenon are being discussed .
