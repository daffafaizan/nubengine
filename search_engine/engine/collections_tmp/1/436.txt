172. autoradiographicstudies of lymphoidcells in blood andbone marrow of nor-mal and irradiateddogsthe migration, fate, andturnover of lymphoidcells in blood and bone marrowof 4 irradiated and 4 non-irradiated dogs were studiedby serial autoradiographywith clamping of the hind legsduring the plasma clear-ance time of h3-thymidineinjected into an anteriorvein.  in irradiated dogs, theh3-thymidine injection pro-cedure was carried out duringthe early recovery phaseafter 250 r of whole-bodyx-irradiation.  the results on2 irradiated and 2 normaldogs were described in de-tail.  migration of lymphoidcells from blood to marrowparenchyma was confirmedin the irradiated dogs.  con-clusive evidence of transformationof these cells intohemopoietic precursors was notfound.  the relativenumber of large lymphoid cells,the labeling index ofthe whole population of lymphoidcells, and that of smalllymphoid cells were increasedin irradiated marrow;few initially labeled smalllymphoid cells could also beobserved.  these data indicatethat the pattern of pro-liferation of lymphoid cells ischanged in irradiated re-generating bone marrow.
