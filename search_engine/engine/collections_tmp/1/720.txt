pulmonary vascular changes complicatingventriculovascular shunting for hydrocephalusa patient is described in whom pulmonary hypertension and corpulmonale were noted 3 years after placement of a ventriculovascularshunting apparatus for treatment of hypdrocephalus.  in addition,the histologic sections of lung tissue obtained from 65 patients with hy-drocephalus who died at various intervals following placement of aventriculovascular shunting apparatus were reviewed with regard to vas-cular alterations.  a high incidence of "old" and "multiple" pulmonaryvascular lesions was found in this group compared to the incidencein control subjects.  this difference can be attributed to the operativeprocedure.  the lesions in postmortem material were notwidespread and did not suggest the diagnosisof pulmonary hypertension on purely histologic grounds.
