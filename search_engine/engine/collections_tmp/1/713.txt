dural sinus pressurein normal and hydrocephalic dogssimultaneous measurement of cerebro-spinal fluid pressure (csfp) and venouspressure in the anterior (ssvp) and poste-rior sagittal sinus (tvp) has demonstratedthat in the normal dog the mean pressures arerelated as follows: csfp>ssvp>tvp.the statistical relationship between the pres-sures has shown a poor correlation of ssvpand tvp with changes in csfp.  on theother hand, in the hydrocephalic dog, ssvprises to meet csfp and is related to fluidpressure in a 1:1 fashion.  this could be ex-pected to cause a "non venting" of acutechanges of csfp and a decrease in fluid ab-sorption.  it is postulated that the mechanismof ssvp elevation is a partial occlusion ofthe sinus.
