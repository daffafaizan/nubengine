the apparent immunofluorescence of tissue mast cells .both rat mast cells and rat cosinophils exhibited fluorescence in blueviolet light after treatment with fitc-conjugated rabbit anti-ratg-globulin and in each cell this fluorescence was immunologicallynonspecific .whereas cosinophils fluoresced after treatment with fluorescein alone,mast cells fluoresced only after treatment with a protein conjugatecontaining g-globulin .the phenomenon was observed in cells from different organs and thefluorescence was seen to be associated with the cytoplasmic granulesnormally present in these cells .
