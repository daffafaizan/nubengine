1116. na, k, ca, mg, and cl concentrations in choroid plexus fluidand cisternal fluid compared with plasma ultrafiltratein 7 cats the concentrations of na,k, ca, mg, and cl were measured in plasmaultrafiltrate, newly formed choroidplexus fluid, and cisterna magna fluid.  thechoroid plexus fluid did not differfrom plasma ultrafiltrate in cl and k concentra-tion but contained higher na, markedlyhigher mg, and lower ca concentrationsthan the ultrafiltrate.  cisterna magnafluid differed from the ultrafiltrate withrespect to all 5 electrolytes, containinghigher concentrations of cl, na, and mgand lower concentrations of k and ca.it differed from choroid plexus fluid in con-taining a higher concentration of cl butlower concentrations of k, ca, and mg.hco3-concentration, calculated on thebasis of the charge balance, was 7 mm/kgh2o higher in choroid plexus fluid thanin cisterna magna fluid, suggesting an ele-vated ph at the former site.  withoutmeasurement of the potential difference be-tween the csf and plasma, definitiveconclusions could not be drawn as to whichcations were actively transported.  the factthat the distribution ratio between cerebro-spinal fluid and ultrafiltrate of one divalentcation was in the opposite directionfrom that of the other, and that this wasalso true of the monovalent cations, wastaken as evidence that the mechanismsinvolved in cation transfer are quite selec-tive.  though not proven, active transportwas considered the most likely explana-tion of these findings.  the data suggestthat these specific transfer mechanismssubserve a homeostatic function withregard to mg and k in the cerebrospinal fluid.
