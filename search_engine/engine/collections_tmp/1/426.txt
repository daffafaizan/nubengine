815. the origin of macrophagesfrom bone marrow in the ratskin windows' and subcutaneous coverslipswere applied to rats in a study designedto identify the tissues in which the precursorsof macrophages proliferate.  lympho-cyte-depletion by either chronic drainage fromthe thoracic duct or 400 rads of x-irradiation failed to suppress the emigration ofmacrophages or to reduce the pro-portion of them which became labelled after aninjection of tritiated thymidine.  x-irradiation with 750 rads suppressedthe emigration and the labelling of the exudatemacrophages.  both were restored tonormal when the tibial marrow was shieldedduring irradiation.  radioactively-labelledcell suspensions obtained from thoracicduct lymph, lymph nodes, thymus, spleenand bone marrow were transfused intosyngeneic recipients.  the emigration oflabelled macrophages on to coverslipscould be demonstrated only in recipientsof labelled bone marrow and spleen cells.labelled monocytes were found in the bloodof rats which had received injectionsof labelled bone marrow.  it was concludedthat in the rat, bone marrow, and to alesser extent spleen, are major sources ofthe macrophages which emigrate intofoci of acute, non-bacterial inflammation.
