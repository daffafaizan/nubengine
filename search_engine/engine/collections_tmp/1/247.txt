tumor scanning with radioactive cesium .fourteen patients with cancer were scanned 10 minutes to 48 hoursafter injection of radioactive cs. and satisfactory scans of the tumorswere obtained in seven . positive scans were obtained in large,superficial tumors, in a pulmonary lymphoma, and in a carcinoma of theupper third of the esophagus . the negative scans were all in abdominaltumors . correlations were made with data obtained from externalcounting and by well scintillation counting of biopsy specimens . twomodes of uptake are suggested.. (a) early uptake due to vascularity andprobably not proportional to stable cesium content.. and (b) a lateruptake based upon greater alkali metal content of tumors than of normaltissue .
