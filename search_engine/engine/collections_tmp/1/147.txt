autolysis of bacillus subtilis by glucose depletion .in cultures in minimal medium, rapid lysis of cells of bacillussubtilis was observed as soon as the carbon source, e.g. glucose, hadbeen completely consumed . the cells died and ultraviolet-absorbingmaterial was excreted in the medium . the results suggest that the cellslyse because of the presence of autolytic enzymes . in the presence ofglucose the damage to the cell wall caused by these enzymes is repairedimmediately .
