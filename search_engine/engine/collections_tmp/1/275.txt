3075. vaccinia pneumonia in mice.  a light and electron microscopic and viralassay studyswiss white mice between 2 and 4 days of agedeveloped generalized vaccinia viralinfection 2 to 7 days after intranasal inoculation.gross and histologic evidence ofpneumonia was seen in more than 80% ofapproximately 300 mice.  virus was re-covered in relatively high titers from thelungs (10   pfu per g) during the per-iod when pneumonia developed; viremiawas also present, but virus titers in theblood stream remained much below thosein the lungs.  histologically, vacciniapneumonia was characterized by large swollenmononuclear cells giving rise tomarked widening of alveolar septa.  onlyscattered neutrophils were noted, usuallyin association with cell necrosis.  exudationof edema fluid and red cells into al-veoli was considered the result of viralreplication and cytopathic effect on cellscomprising alveolar septa.  various formsof vaccinia virus were observed by elec-tron microscopy within both 'type i' and'type ii' alveolar lining cells, capillaryendothelial cells, and interstitial cellswithin alveolar walls.  these infected inter-stitial cells were probably derived fromfixed macrophages and were noted alsoaround bronchioles.  virus particles weresimilarly observed in bronchiolar epi-thelium and surrounding smooth musclecells.  the earliest pathologic ultrastruc-tural change noted in virus infected cellswas intracellular edema, evidenced bylow electron density of the backgroundcytoplasmic material and dilatation of theendoplasmic reticulum.  more extensivechanges resulted in cell necrosis withrelease of virus particles into the extracellular space.
