spontaneous verbal rehearsal in a memory task as a function of agea distinction is made between 2 alternative hypotheses for explaining anoften-reported deficiency in verbally mediated performance during earlychildhood: (1) the verbal response is made, but tends not to mediateperformance ("mediational-deficiency hypothesis"); (2) the verbal responsetends not to be made ("production-deficiency hypothesis").  a study isdescribed which attempts to meet the ideal criteria for a test of theproduction-deficiency hypothesis.  the method used was that of directobservation of s's spontaneous verbalizations, and the hypothesis was confirmedby the finding that kindergarteners are less likely than older children torehearse stimulus names in a nonverbal serial recall task.
