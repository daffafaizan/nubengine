concurrence of hyperplasia andneoplasia of the parathyroid glandsthe concurrence of parathyroid hyperplasiaand neoplasia in a group of six patients is re-ported.  two patients had long-standing renaldisease with azotemia and hyperphosphatemia.in both hypercalcemia developed while theywere under observation and they were found tohave parathyroid adenomas as well as hyper-plasia of the other glands.  a third patientfollowed an apparently similar course.  one pa-tient with primary hyperparathyroidism due to alarge mediastinal adenoma displayed hyper-plasia of other glands in association with moder-ate renal insufficiency.  two patients with pri-mary generalized parathyroid hyperplasia werefound to have superimposed neoplastic lesions:multiple adenomatous nodules in one, adenocar-cinoma in the other.these observations add new dimensions to thediagnosis and therapy of parathyroid disorders.they indicate the necessity of examining all fourparathyroid areas at time of surgery.  they alsoemphasize that hypercalcemia developing inpatients with chronic renal disease is a manifesta-tion of autonomous parathyroid function.
