age differences in cellularproliferation in rat kidneysthe hyperplastic response to unilateral ne-phrectomy after 48 hours in the cortex andmedulla of the remaining kidneys of weanlingand young adult rats was studied by means ofautoradiography.  tritiated-thymidine, whichis destined exclusively for nucleoprotein synthe-sis, was administered to 11 control and 11 ex-perimental rats 4 hours prior to sacrifice.labeled tubular cells were rare in controltissues, especially in medulla, where the per-centages did not differ greatly for the two agegroups.  in the cortex of controls such cells werethree times more frequent for weanling ratsthan for adults.  significant increases in per-centages of labeled cells over control levelswere found in both regions of the remainingkidneys for both age groups.  the percentage ofincrease was greater in medulla than in cortexand most pronounced in medulla of the youngadult rats.
