3640. poisoning with sodium selenitechronic poisoning with na selenite (in the drinking water) causes hepaticcirrhosis, usually of atrophic type, in rats.  in rabbits there seems to be adefinite diabetogenic action, while attempts to demonstrate such action indogs have so far given inconclusive results.  the difference between these2 species is perhaps due to the technique used (different spacing of injectionsfor practical reasons).  the action of selenite on the pancreas is discussedand it is pointed out that se can replace s in sh groups, thus rendering thelatter ineffective.  both in effects on the liver and in those on the pancreasse seems to resemble alloxan.
