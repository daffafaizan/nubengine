1139. optimal coronary flow in the bypassed normothermic and hypothermic hearta series of experiments were conducted in dogsin which bypass flow, temperature,and direct coronary perfusion pressure were varied.coronary flow, coronary ven-ous saturation, myocardial oxygen consumption (mvo2),and coronary vascular re-sistance were assayed.  coronary flow as a percentageof total bypass flow did notvary appreciably at varying levels of bypass flow.induction of hypothermia, whentotal bypass flow is constant, results in decreasingcoronary flow.  induction of hy-pothermia when maintaining a constant bypass pressureresults in an increasingcoronary flow with temperatures down to 22 c.further cooling causes a reductionin flow.  using isolated coronary perfusion at 100 mm. hg,coronary flow fell andresistance rose during the first 15 min. of bypass.using isolated coronary perfu-sion at 100 mm. hg, induction of moderate hypothermia(25 c.) caused an increasein coronary flow and venous saturation and a decreasein cardiovascular resistanceand mvo2.  under the same conditions, induction ofhypothermia to 18 c. producedsimilar changes but caused myocardial hemorrhageand ventricular fibrillation.  pro-found hypothermia probably leads to excessivefragility of the capillary bed.  reduc-tion of perfusion pressure to 50 mm. hg at nearnormothermia reduced coronaryflow and slightly reduced venous saturationand mvo2.  the same reduction of perfu-sion pressure at 18 c. produced similar butless marked changes.  reduction to 25mm. hg at 18 c. markedly reduced coronary flow,venous saturation, and mvo2initially, but with partial recovery later.  from thisdata of acute experiments indogs, coronary perfusion using moderate hypothermia(about 31 c.) and 50 mm.hg, slightly pulsatile mean pressure appears optimal.
