gel filtration of the soluble proteins from normal and cataractous humanlenses .the soluble proteins of normal and cataractous lenses were separatedaccording to their molecular size on the polysaccharide gel sephadexg-100 . in cataractous as well as in normal lenses 4 different compo-nents were obtained . during the evolution of cataract there is a pre-ferential decrease of the low molecular weight proteins of the lens .these disappeared completely in mature and hypermature cataract . on theother hand, the proteins of high molecular weight (e.g., -crystallin)are very resistant to the pathological process . the electrophoreticpattern of the low molecular weight proteins in the normal lens revea-led several fractions distributed over a large mobility area . afterimmunoelectrophoresis, 3 different precipitin lines were obtained .
