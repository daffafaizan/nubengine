8914. the effect of hypoxia on oxygen consumption of cerebralcortex, liver slices and of diaphragm in vitro during post-natal development of the ratoxygen consumption of slices from the liverand cerebral cortex and of the cut dia-phragm was determined in rats aged 5, 10,14, 20 and 25 days and in adult animals.under hypoxic conditions (gas phase 10%oxygen, 90% nitrogen) oxygen consumptionof liver slices and diaghragm is decreasedby about 25% in all age groups.  hypoxia,however, did not affect oxygen consumptionof slices of the cortex from 5-day-oldrats and its inhibitory effect only appearedlater as the normal oxygen consumptionstarted to rise.  the inhibitory effect ofhypoxia was greatest in adult animals.
