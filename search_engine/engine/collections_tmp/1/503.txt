3106. fractionation of b-crystallin from calf lens by gel fil-trationb-crystallin was isolated from calf lensesby a combination of gel filtration onsephadex g-75 and vertical-column zoneelectrophoresis.  it was subdivided into4 fractions by subsequent gel filtration ondextran gels with low cross-linkage.each fraction showed only 1 major peak inthe ultracentrifuge, the sedimentationcoefficients of which were 13.6, 9.6, 4.9 and4.2 s for fractions i-iv, respectively.however, all 4 fractions contained someadditional minor components, as revealedby sedimentation and immunoelectrophoreticanalyses.  the fractionation proceduremay be of value as a first step in the isolationof individual proteins of the b-crystal-lin group.
