oophorectomy and cortisone treatment as a method of eliminatingoestrogen production in patients with breast cancer .the urinary excretion of oestrone, oestradiol-17b, oestriol, and 17-hydroxycorticosteroids has been estimated in 55 premenopausal and 91postmenopausal women with breast cancer at various stages of the diseasebefore therapy . the depletion of oestrogen excretion caused byoophorectomy combined with cortisone treatment was studied in thepatients with metastasising breast tumours (32 premenopausal and 56postmenopausal subjects) .patients with disseminating breast cancer excreted significantlylarger quantities of oestriol than healthy women of the same age,whether pre- or postmenopausal . the excretion of oestrone andoestradiol-17b was similar in cancer patients and healthy women ofcorresponding age .oophorectomy reduced the oestrogen excretion not only in premenopausalsubjects but also in quite a number of postmenopausal patients,particularly in those who were still excreting significant amounts ofoestrogens . this decrease in the oestrogen output was transient and wasfollowed by a compensatory increase, possibly of adrenal origin .cortisone administered within a month after the oophorectomy at adosage of 50 mg per day rapidly depressed the secondary rise in theoestrogen output to a level of about 4 to 5 ug/24 h irrespective of theage of the patient . this excretion level was unchanged as long ascortisone was given in an adequate dose, but increased rapidly when thecortisone treatment was discontinued .oophorectomy combined with adequate cortisone treatment seems to offeran alternative to the extensive surgical porcedures undertaken toeliminate oestrogen production in breast cancer patients .
