moderate hypothermia in man.. haemodynamic and metabolic effects .studies were performed on four patients undergoing intracranial opera-tion during the induction and reversal of surface hypothermia to 30 c .oxygen uptake decreased an average of 26 per cent from 34 to 30 c to amean value of 48 per cent of predicted basal uptake . at the same time,cardiac output decreased only 11.5 per cent, resulting in a consistentrise in calculated mixed venous oxygen saturation from a mean of 76 to81 per cent at 30 c . as a result of this and the effect of cooling onoxygen dissociation, the estimated tension of oxygen in mixed venousblood remained virtually unchanged . when shivering was allowed to occurin two patients, oxygen uptake increased approximately 50 per centwithout any concomitant increase in cardiac output . observed rightatrial and svc oxygen saturations correlated well with calculated mixedvenous oxygen saturations with regard to direction and magnitude ofchange with change in temperature .
