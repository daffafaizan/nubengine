hyperglycemic coronary perfusion.. effect of hypothermia on myocardialfunction during cardiopulmonary bypass .in a series of 84 animal experiments hyperglycemic perfusion of theheart gave significant protection to the anoxic heart . this protectionwas evaluated by ventricular function and contractile force studies andwas observed after aortic occlusion at 37, 28 and 10 degrees c .metabolic data revealed a considerable myocardial glucose uptake,higher coronary ph, higher po and lower pco in the glucose-perfusedgroups as compared to controls .a hypothesis for the protective effect may be an alteration inmetabolic pathway and support of the myocardial enzyme systemsassociated with high glucose concentration and utilization .
