cisternal fluid oxygen tension in man .using a beckman micro-oxygen-electrode we have studied the oxygentension simultaneously in the cisterna magna, the internal jugular veinand in arterial blood under various conditions . the results suggestthat the cisternal oxygen tension to some degree reflects the averageoxygen tension of the surrounding brain tissue and besides reflectingthe available free oxygen to the brain it registrates changes of shortduration in the cerebral blood flow .
