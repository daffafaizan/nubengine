1808. separation anxiety  a factor in the object relations ofschizophrenic patients.the thesis is advanced thatspecial vulnerability to separation anxiety is a crucialfactor in the schizophrenic's difficulty in establishingand maintaining satisfactory interpersonal relationships.2 major reasons for this are lack of autonomy and lackof object constancy.  without a stable autonomouscapacity for self-regulation and adaptation, he is inordi-nately dependent upon others for help, protection, anddirection.  without object constancy, he is unable tomaintain a stable representation of the needed person inthe latter's absence.  evidence is presented from theintensive psychotherapy of schizophrenic patients.many of the vicissitudes of the doctor-patient relation-ship center about the patient's separation anxiety andhis attempted defenses against it.  these include clinging,perceptual and cognitive distortions designed to denyseparation, and recourse to substitute objects.  promi-nent in many of these efforts is the attempt to reversepassive victimization into active mastery.  the practicalimplications of this thesis for the treatment of schiz-ophrenic patients are discussed.
