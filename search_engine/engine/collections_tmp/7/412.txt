1593. bleeding tendencies associated with profound-hypothermia technics inneurologic surgeryforty-three patients with bleeding intracranialaneurysms were operated on underdeep hypothermia and with the aid of extracorporealcirculation.  the open-thoraxmethod was used in 18 cases and the closed-thoraxmethod in 25.  the followingpoints are made  (1) the closed-thorax methodis considered superior to the open-thorax method in several respects; (2) meticuloushemostasis is essential to controlthe oozing that occurs during extracorporealcirculation under profound hypothermiauntil the heparin antagonist can becomeeffective and body temperature can returnto normal; (3) significant thrombocytopeniamay develop during extracorporeal cir-culation, and inhibition of the thrombin-fibrinogenreaction by factors other thanheparin may cause a major coagulation defectand may also, by mimicking the he-parin effect, lead to the excessive use ofheparin antagonists; (4) pathologic changesin microcirculation during extracorporealcirculation may be determinants of ahemorrhagic tendency.
