growth hormonegrowth hormone influences protein, fat,carbohydrate, and mineral metabolism.  itpromotes nitrogen retention, growth ofcartilage, transportation of amino acidsthrough the cell wall, and incorporation ofamino acids into protein.  this factor mo-bilizes free fatty acids from adipose tissueand increases the serum concentration ofthese substances; long-term administrationof this hormone is followed by depletion ofbody fat stores and inhibition of fatty acidsynthesis.  in diabetic subjects growth hor-mone administration is followed by hyper-glycemia, glycosuria, and ketosis; its effecton carbohydrate metabolism in normal sub-jects is more subtle.  sodium, potassium, andinorganic phosphate are retained followingthe administration of growth hormone.hypercalciuria also accompanies such treat-ment, an effect mediated through the para-thyroid glands.human growth hormone may be detectedin the serum through the use of the radio-immunoassay.  the hypothalamus is inti-mately involved with the control of thesecretion and release of growth hormonefrom the pituitary.  there is a correlationbetween the availability of glucose for me-tabolism and the plasma concentration ofgrowth hormone; when glucose is unavail-able growth hormone is released in order toprovide a substitute source of energy, fattyacids.the administration of growth hormoneto the patient with hypopituitarism is fol-lowed by growth in many instances, but ithas not usually been effective in promotinggrowth in individuals with other abnormali-ties.  acquired resistance to the effect ofgrowth hormone is accompanied by the de-velopment of antibodies directed againstthis protein.
