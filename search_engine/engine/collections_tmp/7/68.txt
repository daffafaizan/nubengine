biosynthesis of glycoproteins i. incorporation of glucosamine- c intoliver and plasma proteins of the rat .it has been shown that glucosamine-1- c administered intravenously tofed rats is rapidly removed from the blood stream and appears first astrichloroacetic acid-soluble derivatives in the tissues . this isfollowed by a conversion to macromolecules . at least 80 of theadministered compound can be recovered in tissues . the liver is by farthe most active organ in accumulating glucosamine . this is rapidlyconverted to protein-bound components of the liver particulate fraction(microsomes and mitochondria) and is then released to the plasma withoutappreciable accumulation in the soluble proteins of the liver . it isconcluded that the glucosamine is transferred to the peptide chains ofglycoproteins at some stage before these proteins are released from theliver particulate fraction .
