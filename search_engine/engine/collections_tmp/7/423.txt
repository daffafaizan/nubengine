3194. systemic hypothermia via gastric coolingeight dogs underwent gastric cooling forsystemic hypothermia.  each dog was cooledwith the balloon filled with a 'safe' volumebased on weight (20 ml/kg) and subjectedto cooling with the balloon filled maximally,but safely to a pressure of 10 mm hg.consistently, the latter procedure was farmore efficient, averaging 2.6 times asrapid for all degrees of hypothermia.  adecrease in core temperature by 7 c re-quired an average of only 28.4 minutes.on comparison with clinical reports of hy-pothermia induced by the usual gastriccooling, an improved efficiency of two-foldto three-fold is still noted.
