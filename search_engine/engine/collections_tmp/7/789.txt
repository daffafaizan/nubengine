palliative radiation therapythe care of the patient with "incurable" cancer may bedirected by physicians of various backgrounds and per-suasions.  if this physician has little experience in suchcare, he is prone to be influenced by still prevalent atti-tudes of therapeutic futility or by equally unjustifiedpremature claims for widely publicized methods recent onthe scene.  surgery and radiation therapy remain thedominant treatment forces for the patient with cancer.  itis unfortunate that lack of demonstration of good radiationtherapy has led to unjustified condemnation of the methodrather than the user, with resultant loss to the patient'swelfare.  to obtain maximal benefit, radiation therapymust be allowed indications and contraindications like anytherapeutic modality.  these must be the responsibility ofthe therapeutic radiologist.  application of realisticallystringent indications and contraindications does not lessenuseful accomplishment, but avoids unnecessary morbidity,waste of time, money and effort, and delay in seekingsuitable treatment.
