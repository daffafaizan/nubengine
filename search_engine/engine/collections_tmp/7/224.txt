the heterogeneity of rheumatoid factors and the genetic control ofpolypeptide chains of globulin .(1) evidence is presented that most rf proteins are heterogeneous intheir antigenic composition although occasional ones are homogeneous andthus resemble the paraproteins .(2) studies pointing out some of the difficulties encountered withcurrently available preparations of polypeptide chains in the geneticmapping of globulin are described .
