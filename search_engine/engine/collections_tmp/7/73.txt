the role of alveolar inclusion bodies in the developing lung .the developing alveolar epithelium of man and rat containscharacteristic inclusion bodies which are heterogeneous structures butbasically consist of a system of membranous profiles and a limitingmembrane of the unit type .inclusion bodies appear to result from focal cytoplasmic degradationwhich occurs in the rapidly changing cuboidal alveolar epithelium . someinclusion bodies in the developing rat lung are similar to the so-called/lamellar transformed mitochondria./ however, evidence is presentedsuggesting that alteration of all cytoplasmic membranes may be involvedin the process of inclusion body formation . certain images associatedwith the golgi complex are interpreted as early forms of inclusionbodies . there is also evidence that inclusion bodies enlarge byaccretion of membranes which finally are extruded into the alveolarspace . inclusion bodies are formed and /secreted/ in greater numberlate in fetal life and in early infancy, i.e., at the time when thecuboidal alveolar epithelium is differentiating to the mature flattenedtype . the latter contains no inclusion bodies .on the basis of the morphologic characteristics of the inclusionbodies and the distribution of the acid phosphatase reaction, it isconcluded that inclusion bodies are lysosomal structures active duringremodeling of the developing alveolar epithelium .the possible interrelationship of inclusion bodies and pulmonarysurfactant is discussed .
