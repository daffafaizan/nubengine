transient familial neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.a syndrome of transient familial neonatalunconjugated hyperbilirubinemia not dueto known causes has been described in 24infants of 8 unrelated, healthy caucasianmothers.  four of the infants developedkernicterus.  beginning in the 2nd trimesterof pregnancy, sera from the 8 mothersand their newborn infants inhibited direct-reactingbilirubin and o-aminophenol glucuronideformation by rat liver slices andhomogenates, respectively, 4 to 10 timesmore than was observed with sera froma control group of pregnant women andtheir infants.  the serum inhibitory factorin these women is unidentified.  the factthat the inhibitor occurs in pregnancyserum suggests that it is probably a progestationalsteroid that inhibits glucuronyltransferase activity in the liver of neonates.the mechanism responsible for increasedserum inhibitor factor activityin these women is unknown and requiresfurther study.
