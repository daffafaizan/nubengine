evoked response in visual disorders .1. erg and ver have been recorded from eyelid and lateral occipitalelectrodes in response to diffuse stroboscopic stimulation . in 45normal subjects ver was found to be composed of an early triphasicpotential arising from the occipital region . wave i was present in 67percent of subjects, wave ii in 97 percent, and wave iii in 100 percentlater waves were inconstant and contained components from the vertexreference . no overall asymmetry in ver from right to left was found innormal subjects, although average asymmetry with smaller side comparedto larger was 19 percent 12.5 . on monocular stimulation thecontralateral ver was regularly larger than the ipsilateral reflectingpredominant retinal representation of the temporal field .2. a statistically determined criterion of 50 percent depression inwave ii successfully identifies most patients with hemianopic defectsinvolving the central 10 percent of visual field on tangent screencampimetry .latency asymmetry of six msec. or more and grossly asymmetricalaberrant wave forms are seen in some patients with diffuse cerebraldisease and hemianopic defects .3. severe or diffuse retinal disease is associated with alteration orloss of erg and ver on stimulation of the involved eye .4. optic nerve disease is indicated by bilateral loss or suppressionof ver on stimulation of the involved eye . erg is normal .5. bilateral prechiasmal involvement is associated with completesuppression of ver . if only waves i and ii are lost, disease isprobably, but not conclusively, demonstrated .6. involvement of nasal retinal fibres is indicated by reversal of thenormal contralateral preponderance of ver on monocular stimulation .these changes are observed in chiasmal disease .7. retrogeniculate blindness is associated with loss of early ver andpreservation of late response . nonspecific projections are felt tocontribute to the late cortical response to photic stimulation .
