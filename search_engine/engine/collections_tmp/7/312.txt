502. the haemodynamic implications of the bisferiens pulsea bisferiens carotid arterial displacement pulsewas recorded in 10 patients withsevere aortic valvular disease.  the braunwaldtest indicated that moderately severe,severe, or gross aortic regurgitation was presentin each.  the absence of a peaksystolic aortic pressure gradient in certain cases,particularly in those with themost severe regurgitation, suggested their freedomfrom an element of stenosis.the anacrotic wave and the peak of the aorticpressure pulse were found to coincidewith the percussion and the tidal waves of thesimultaneously recorded carotid ar-terial displacement curves.  it is suggested thatamplitude of the peak of the anacro-tic wave is proportional to the rate of change ofmomentum of the ejected blood, andthat the amplitude of the corresponding percussionwave of displacement is modified bythe distensibility of the artery.  the depth and shapeof the trough between the twopeaks is thought to depend upon the magnitude andslope of the two waves rather thanupon a venturi effect.  it is suggested that the conditionof the arterial wall, the dia-stolic blood pressure, and the stroke volume caninfluence the pulse sufficiently topreclude its use as a simple guide to the nature ofthe aortic valve lesion.
