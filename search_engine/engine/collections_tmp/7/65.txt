induced tumour resistance in rats .the human sarcoma hs has been grown in weanling rats treated withcortisone . this growth was modified by prior injection of varioustissue antigens . active /immunity/ was produced by using human placentaor embryonic tissue as antigen, and similar results were obtained usingsuspensions of rapidly growing human tumours .the response to other human tissues varied.. foetal muscle and spleenwere active, whereas adult plasma was inactive except from some patientswith extensive malignant disease .passive protection was produced by using certain human sera at thetime of challenging with hs . sera from five women who aborted showedthis characteristic . where the pregnancy continued to term,antisubstances were not found,. and they were present in the puerperiumin only two out of fifty cases .further groups of rats were given rat embryonic tissues as antigen,and the tumour challenge was then made with walker tumour,. the resultswere variable .with a benzpyrene-induced tumour in a pure line of /wag/ rat theeffect was not obtained except in isolated cases .in experiments in mice, using as challenge an irondextran inducedmouse sarcoma, prior injection with embryonic mouse liver or placentaincreased the resistance to the growth of the tumour, but the tumour hasnot as yet been produced in a pure-line mouse . on the other hand mouseexperiments, using as challenge the crocker tumour, proved negative .it is suggested that immune reactions may play a part in causing someabortions .
