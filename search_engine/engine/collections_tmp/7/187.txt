measurement of oxygen tensions in cerebral tissues of rats exposed tohigh pressures of oxygen .brain and cerebrospinal oxygen tensions have been measured in ratsbreathing air or in various high pressures of oxygen (ohp) . addition of5 percent co2 to the inspired oxygen raised cerebral oxygen tensionswhen rats were exposed to 2 atm abs or above . inhibition of 75hemoglobin saturation by para-aminopropriophenone lowered cerebral po inrats breathing air, but not in rats exposed to ohp . the rate of rise ofcerebral po to a steady level after rapid compression was found to befaster than the rate of fall to a steady level following decompression .addition of co to the inspired gas mixture increased the rate of rise ofcerebral po . the anesthetics urethane and pentobarbital sodium did notaffect cerebral po in rats breathing air or oxygen at 4 atm . theresults are discussed in relation to factors contributing to oxygenpoisoning at high pressures .
