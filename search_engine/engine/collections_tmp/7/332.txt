1320. the plasma free fatty acid composition and blood glucoseof normal and diabetic pregnant women and of their new-bornsthe blood glucose and plasma ffa contentand composition of the newborns ofnormal women, gestational diabetics, andinsulin-dependent diabetics were analyzed.normal maternal ffa levels were twice thefetal values; by 2 hr of age ffa in-creased 4-fold over initial values in normalinfants, while infants of gestationaldiabetics had a 3-fold rise, and those ofinsulin dependent diabetics only 2-fold.blood sugar at the same time decreased andthere was an inverse relationship be-tween blood glucose in the normal infants andffa.  this relationship is altered inthe infant of the diabetic mother.  gaschromatography of plasma indicated a higherratio of unsaturated to saturated ffa inmothers compared to infants.  no patterndifferences were noted between the normaland diabetic mothers, except that thelatter had higher oleic acid.  in the initial 2hr of life, the patterns changed, althoughno differences were noted between infantsof diabetic mothers and normals.  theobservations suggest  (1) the metabolicinterrelationships of glucose and ffa inthe normal infant are different from thosein the infant of the diabetic mother, thelatter infant having a state of physiologichyperinsulinism; (2) plasma ffa in thefetus is derived from both fetal fat synthesisas well as placental transfers; (3) theinfant of the diabetic mother does not differfrom the normal as regards ffa com-position.
