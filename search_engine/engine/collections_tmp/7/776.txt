chemotherapy of breast cancerthe majority of cancer patients who arereferred for chemotherapy are in far advancedstages of the disease.  the difficulty in deliver-ing an effective dose of an oncolytic agentto the involved areas may limit the results oftreatment unless the patient's tumor is an un-usually responsive one.  the variability in re-sponse between apparently similar cases ofcancer of the same cell type has become in-creasingly evident, and is as puzzling as thefact that 20 per cent of patients with breastcancer will live 5 years with no treatment.  thedecisions as to the choice between chemother-apy and hormone therapy, as well as to thechoice of the chemotherapeutic agent to beemployed, may be difficult.as experience increases, the usefulness ofchemotherapy in the treatment of cancer isbecoming increasingly apparent.  it also has be-come apparent that chemotherapy cannot beregarded as a curative procedure in advancedcancer even though an occasional patient ap-pears to have been cured.  however, the valueof the oncolytic agents in prolonging usefulsurvival time, ameliorating many of the dis-tressing symptoms associated with cancer, andproviding the physician with an extra tool fora positive program in the care of the cancerpatient is now established.
