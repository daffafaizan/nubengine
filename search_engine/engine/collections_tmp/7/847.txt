localization of phosphaturic effect ofparathyroid hormone in nephron of the dogthe renal mechanism and tubular site of the phosphaturic action ofparathyroid hormone were investigated by clearance and stop-flowtechniques in one intact and seven thyroparathyroidectomizeddogs.  administration of hormone caused a significant increasein the excretion of phosphate without increasing the filteredload.  stop-flow analysis indicated that in the absence of parathyroidhormone most of the filtered phosphate was reabsorbedin the proximal tubule, and that the hormone increased therate of phosphate excretion by inhibiting this reabsorptivemechanism.  p32 injected during stopped flow showed no significanttransport across the renal tubule despite the presence ofexcess parathyroid hormone.  significant p32 activity appearedin the stop-flow collections simultaneously with the appearanceof new filtrate.  there was no evidence that parathyroid hormonemediated a secretory process for phosphate excretion.
