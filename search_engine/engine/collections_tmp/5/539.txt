2373. factors influencing the induction of enhancement and re-sistance to methylcholanthrene-induced tumours in a syn-geneic systemactive immunological enhancement of thegrowth of methylcholanthrene-induced tu-mors was demonstrated in a syngeneicsystem in mice.  enhancement was detected3-5 wk. after preimmunization withirradiated tumor suspension and was succeededafter the 6th wk. by the development ofresistance to the tumor.  analysis by meansof adoptive and passive transfer showedthese to be true immunological phenomena.enhancement and resistance were transferredby serum and by the lymph node cellsof preimmunized mice.  threshold doses oftumor cells were found to be the mostsatisfactory for the detection of resistanceand enhancement in this system.
