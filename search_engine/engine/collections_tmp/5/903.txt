hela cells resistant to bromodeoxyuridine and deficient in thymidinekinase activity.mutant sublines of hela s3 cells resistantto growth inhibition by bromodeoxyuridine(budr) have been isolated.  the resistantcell lines (hela bu-10, hela bu-15,hela bu-25, hela bu-50, and hela bu-100)proliferated in the presence of 10,15,25,50, and 100 mg/ml budr, respectively.extracts from hela bu-25, helabu-50, and hela bu-100 cells exhibited2-5% of the thymidine-h, deoxyuridine-h,and bromodeoxyuridine-h phosphorylatingactivities of parental hela s3 cells.hela bu-10 and hela bu-15 cell extractswere also deficient in thymidine kinaseactivity, yielding approx. 43% and 8%,respectively, the thymidine kinase activityof parental hela s3 cells.  the deficiencyin thymidine kinase activity of hela bu-100cells was not due to negative feedback inhibitionby high levels of budr or to interferencewith the thymidine kinase assay byinhibitors or competing enzymes in thehela bu-100 cell extracts.  following 5 weeklypassages in media lacking budr,the hela bu-100 cells did not exhibit increasedthymidine kinase activity.  moreover,mixtures of extracts from hela s3and hela bu-100 cells displayed a thymidinekinase activity equivalent to the sumof the activities or extracts prepared,respectively, from the hela s3 and helabu-100 cells.  radioautographic studieshave shown that after hela s3 cells wereincubated for 6 hr with thymidine-h,35-45% of the nuclei were heavily labeledwith radioactivity.  however, fewer helabu-100 cells displayed labeled nuclei andthe nuclei were only lightly labeled.hela bu-100 cell extracts contained normalamounts of thymidylate synthetase,thymidilate kinase, and uridine kinase activities.following infection by vacciniavirus, high levels of thymidine kinase activitywere induced in hela bu-100 cells.
