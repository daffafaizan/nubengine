an autoradiographic study on cell migration in the eye lens epitheliumfrom normal and alloxan diabetic rats .lenses from normal and alloxan diabetic rats with and without cataractwere investigated by autoradiography 4 hours, 4 days and 8 days after anintraperitoneal injection of h3-thymidine (0.4 uc/g body weight) . therats were made diabetic 8 days prior to the injection of thymidine at anage of 4 weeks . the position of labelled nuclei of the lens epitheliumwas noted and their grain numbers counted . the diabetic rats had alower frequency of labelled nuclei than the controls but after 4 hourstheir grain counts were equal . frequency diagrams of labelled nucleiare given for each of the three experimental periods . a predominantpeak appears after 4 hours at a distance of 30-60 cells in front of thebeginning of the nuclear arc . a successive shift towards this area wasobserved for the longer experimental periods . the shift of the peakswas more restricted in the diabetic animals . this result may best beinterpreted as an effect of an increased time of cell generation .as an appendix a histotechnique for the eye lens is given incollaboration with mrs. gertraude moewis .
