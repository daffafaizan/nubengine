1959. analysis of mechanism of immunosuppressive drugs in renalhomotransplantationdammin g. j.a long-term study of the mechanism of action of immunosuppressive drugs hasbeen completed in bilaterally nephrectomized dogs with kidney homotransplants.over 1,000 test animals with 24 different drug protocols have been analyzed.increasing numbers of long surviving animals have posed many questionsregarding the status treated host.  the current drug protocol of azathioprineand diazoacetylserine ('azaserine') has produced 90% 50-day survivors and 50%100-day survivors.  the following observations have been documented  allanimals on prolonged drug therapy are immunologically competent; drug therapycan be stopped successfully in some but not all animals; long surviving kidneysapparently are protected in some way in the new environment because asecond donor kidney can be rejected while the first survives; retransplantationof a long surviving kidney back to its original host did not lead to a decreasein renal function; long surviving kidneys successfully retransplanted backto their original donors are rejected when transplanted to third party,non-drug treated recipients; immune paralysis does not account for theprolonged survival because the second donor kidney which constitutes a doubledose of antigen is rejected while the first continues to survive; absorption ormetabolism of the drug does not account for the variation in results becausetwo kidneys, each from separate donors, can be rejected differentially in thesame drug treated host; and all hosts are sensitized against the recipient andthis sensitization continues even in those animals successfully weaned fromdrugs.  additional analyses of the relationship of skin homografts and kidneyhomografts reveal the following  skin homografts are universally rejectedwithin 20 days by hosts treated with the drug regimen which protects kidneyhomografts sometimes permanently.  when skin and kidney homografts from thesame donor are placed simultaneously skin survival is prolonged while kidneysurvival is shortened.  this paradoxical effect probably is explained by theproduction of antibodies by skin which are absorbed by the rejecting kidney.additional observations indicate that drug-treated animals, male and female,are fertile and that multiple rejection processes can produce generalizedimmunological picture in the host similar to an autoimmune disease process.
