biliary tract morphology and prognosisof biliary atresiain 86 infants who did not have extrahepatic "hepatic" ducts, presentobservation after use of artificialbile ducts suggests that the presence of thegallbladder may be of good prognostic significance in biliary atresia.there are 11 long-term survivors (as of october 1965) up to 8 1/4 years ofage (100 months) after use of artificial bile ducts in 86 babies.  agallbladder was identified in 10 of the 11 infants.other specific factors for this prolonged survival pattern in these infantswith biliary atresia have not yet been identified, although suggestivecorrelations among minimal hepatic fibrosis, maximal bile ductuleproliferations and the presence of the gallbladder were noted.it is suspected that if any opportunity for long-term survivals exists forinfants to overcome the tragic occurrence of biliary atresia that thesurgeon should avoid trauma to the hepatic pedicle.we may be able to provide a "guarded" rather than a "pessimistic" prog-nosis when the gallbladder is found in the babies with biliary atresia.
