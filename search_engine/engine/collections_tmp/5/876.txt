treatment of short stature in children and adolescentswith human pituitary growth hormone (raben).  experiencewith thirty-five cases.human pituitary growth hormone (raben) wasevaluated by longitudinal study ofgrowth as a therapeutic agent in the treatmentof short stature.  clinically significantincreases in growth rate were achieved in 11of 13 hypopituitary patients.  no significantimprovement in linear growth rate wasnoted with a dose of 2 mg 3 timesweekly in children whose short stature was dueto other conditions.  no adverse reactionswere noted; thyroidal, adrenal or gonadalactivation was not observed.  growthwas stimulated, probably without an undue increasein bone age, though this pointdemands continued scrutiny.  owing to the limitedsupply of this material it is recommendedthat it be used only in cases of documentedgrowth failure, and a protocolfor evaluation of therapeutic response is discussed.though not a panacea for treatmentof short stature, human growth hormonefulfils a unique and invaluable rolein replacement therapy for the hypopituitary dwarf.
