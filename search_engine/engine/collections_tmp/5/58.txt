specific carcinoembryonic antigens of the human digestive system .a wide variety of human adult and fetal tissues were studied byimmunodiffusion techniques in agar gel to determine whether theycontained the tumor-specific antigen(s) previously found in coloniccancers . in the adult tissues it was demonstrated that identicalantigens were present in all tested specimens of malignant tumors of theentodermally derived epithelium of the gastro-intestinal tract andpancreas, but were absent from all other tested adult tissues . thecommon antigenic constituents, therefore, represent system-specificcancer antigens of the human digestive system . system-specific cancerantigens have not previously been demonstrated in humans .experiments with fetal tissues demonstrated that identical antigenswere also present in fetal gut, liver, and pancreas between 2 and 6months of gestation . these components were named /carcinoembryonic/antigens of the human digestive system . on the basis of the presentfindings and the recent work regarding control of the expression ofgenetic potentialities in various genetic potentialities in varioustypes of cells, it was concluded that the carcinoembryonic antigensrepresent cellular constituents which are repressed during the course ofdifferentiation of the normal digestive system epithelium and reappearin the corresponding malignant cells by a process ofderepressive-dedifferentiation .
