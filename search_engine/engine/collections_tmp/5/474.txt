906. molecular mechanism of genetic recombination in bacterial transformationthe mechanism of dna incorporation intothe recipient cell chromosome was in-vestigated in a b. subtilis transformationsystem.  the recipient cells were auxo-trophic for 2 linked markers.  hybrid dnaused for transformation was heterozy-gous for one of these markers.  no differencesin transformation activity were foundwhen the effect of native and hybrid dna wascompared.  according to the authorsthis observation is easily explained if we acceptthat each of both complementarystrands of the donor dna can be incorporatedinto the recipient chromosome withequal probability.  the results on the segregationof genetic characters in the pro-geny of transformed cells are also consistentwith the model of independent incorpo-ration of both dna strands.  some calculationswere done on the probability of theintegration of a single dna strand carrying aparticular genetic marker, and on theprobability of recombination leading to double transformants.
