actinomycin d inhibition of intestinal transport of calcium andof vitamin d action.actinomycin d injection inhibits the actions of vit din increasing concentrative transport of ca across theintestinal wall in vitro and in raising serum ca concentrationsof fasted vit d-deficient rats.  actinomycin d blocksthe transport of ca across the mucosal surface of vit ddeficient as well as vit d-treated rats so that its action ison the ca transport system, rather than on the stimulatoryeffect of vit d.  this inhibitory effect of actinomycin d onca transport is present within 3 hr of its s. c. injectionand is less marked at 18 hr which suggests a direct interactionwith the ca transport system.  under the same conditionsactinomycin d does not influence the transport of1-tyrosine across the intestinal wall in vitro.
