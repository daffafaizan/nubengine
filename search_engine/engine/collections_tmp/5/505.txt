773. the effect of radiation on lenticular epithelial enzymesin young rabbitsthe mitochondrial fraction and the solublefraction of the epithelial cells of the lensfrom 6-week-old new zealand white malerabbits, exposed to 800 r of whole-headx-irradiation, were evaluated for glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase, isocitratedehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase,glutathione reductase, glyceraldehydephos-phate dehydrogenase, purine nucleosidephosphorylase, nadph2 diaphorase, andnadh2 cytochrome c reductase activities.increased enzyme activities were notedin the irradiated lenticular tissues forpurine nucleoside phosphorylase, nadph2diaphorase and nadh2 cytochrome creductase.  decreased activities for glucose6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malatedehydrogenase, glutathione reductase and gly-ceraldehydephosphate dehydrogenasewere observed in the lenticular tissues of ir-radiated animals.  the activity of isocitratedehydrogenase was the same in the ir-radiated and in the control animals.
