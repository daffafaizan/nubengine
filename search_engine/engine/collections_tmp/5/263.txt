significance of blood groups in homotransplantation of marrow in the dogten dogs were given 1,500 r whole-body irradiation and an infusion ofallogeneic marrow from a donor matched with respect to six erythrocyteantigens . methotrexate was given to reduce secondary syndromes . fourdogs survived . in a similar experiment with 10 dogs, in which no effortwas made to match donors and recipients, three dogs survived . it wasconcluded that matching of donor and recipient for these six red cellantigens did not increase significantly the longterm survival rate oflethally irradiated dogs with allogeneic marrow grafts .
