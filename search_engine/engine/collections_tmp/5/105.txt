optokinetic nystagmus and occipital lesions .six cases are presented to invalidate the rule that horizontallysymmetric optokinetic responses indicate a vascular etiology in patientswith occipital lobe type hemianopias . the converse of this rule is, inour experience, still a valuable observation . that is, asymmetry ofhorizontal optokinetic responses accompanying an occipital type fielddefect is a strong indication of a mass lesion . optokinetic nystagmusmay be helpful, therefore, as corroborative evidence in diagnosingoccipital lobe tumor but not in ruling it out .
