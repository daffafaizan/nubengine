fluid and electrolyte metabolism in nephrogenic diabetes insipidusthe body fluid volumes have been fol-lowed in two infants with nephrogenicdiabetes insipidus.  without treatment bothpatients had a low extracellular fluidvolume (ecv) and a normal to low-normal total body water (tbw).  followingthiazide therapy (case 1) and during afluid deprivation test (case 2) a furtherreduction of ecv and tbw was found.untreated both patients revealed a se-vere hypernatriemia without any increasein the urinary aldosterone excretion.the first patient had a cerebral atro-phy and a rightsided hydronephrosis, ahigher diuresis and a lower concentrationcapacity was found on this side.  thepatient was treated continuously withthiazide.  when an ordinary house dietwas given this drug could only maintainnormal electrolytemia in combinationwith spirolactone.  a considerable increasein height and psychic development tookplace during this combined treatment.it is noted, that nephrogenic diabetesinsipidus may be present in infants withunexplained fever and vomiting in theabsence of polydipsia and polyuria.  theurine may even be hypertonic.
