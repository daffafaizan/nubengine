phospholipids of the bovine, rabbit, and human lens .the phospholipids of bovine, rabbit, and human lenses contain cephalinlecithin, and sphingomyelin but their distribution differs with eachspecies . there is suggestive evidence that there may also beplasmalogen in the lens, but, if so, it represents a minor phospholipidcomponent . the fatty acid composition of each phospholipid differs ineach species, with most of the differences centering around 16..0,18..1, and 24..1 .
