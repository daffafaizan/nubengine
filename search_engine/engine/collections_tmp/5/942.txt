influence of the adrenal glands on dna synthesis in normaland compensating kidneys.the role of the adrenal glands in controllingthe synthesis of dna in normal andcompensating kidneys of rats given salinedrinking fluid was studied using tritiated-thymidineand radioautography.  adrenalectomyalone increased significantly thelabeling of the renal cortex and medulla ofotherwise intact rats.  two days followingunilateral nephrectomy of rats with intactadrenal glands, the number of labelednuclei in the remaining kidney increased byfactors of about 4 and 2.5 in the cortexand the medulla, respectively.  adrenalectomymoderately decreased the hyper-plasticresponse of the cortex of the remainingkidney, but increased still furtherthe labeling index of the medulla.  by 5 daysafter unilateral nephrectomy of ratswith intact adrenal glands, neither the cortexnor the medulla of the remaining kidneyexhibited a marked hyperplastic response.in adrenalectomized animals, also,unilateral nephrectomy caused only slightincreases in the labeling indices of thecortex and the medulla of the remaining kidney.
