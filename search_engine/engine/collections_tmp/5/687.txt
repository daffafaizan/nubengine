the antidiuretic mechanism of hydrochlorothia-zide in the treatment of diabetes insipidusthe changes in water and electro-lyte balance during hydrochlorothiazidetherapy in 2 patients with vasopressin-deficient diabetes insipidus were studi-ed.  in 1 case, under fixed daily so-dium intake, the urinary sodium excre-tion markedly increased on the first dayof treatment, but the urinary volumebegan to fall on the second day and per-sisted low for 3 days after discontinua-tion of the drug.  in the other case theurinary volume markedly decreasedwhen the daily sodium intake was strict-ly limited.  it further decreased onhydrochlorothiazide therapy but aftersodium intake was restored it returnedto the pretreatment level despite con-tinued use of the drug.the antidiuretic action of hydro-chlorothiazide in the treatment of dia-betes insipidus is believed to be relatedto the sodium depletion state of the bodybrought about by increased output ordecreased intake of sodium.  sodiumand water reabsorption in the proximalconvoluted tubules in the kidney in-creases and the amount of glomerularfiltrate reaching the distal convolutedtubules decreases.  thus the finalurinary volume falls.
