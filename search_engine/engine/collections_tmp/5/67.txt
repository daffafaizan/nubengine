primary epidermoid cancer of the lung.. ultrastructural study .the early epidermoidic epithelioma of the human lung are initiated bythe proliferation of body cells whose structure is analogical to that ofthe medium cells and/or the modificated basal cells of the normalbronchial wall .the presence of desmosomes and tonofibrils in the cells of the stratumgerminativum of the bronchial epithelium and in the cells derived fromit, allows us a better understanding of the malpighian metaplasis ofthis wall and gives account of the epidermoidic evolution of thebronchial epithelioma .certain nuclear and cytoplasmic modifications suggest the possibilityof a causal virus .
