nephrogenic diabetes insipiduschlorothiazide has been found of value inestablishing and maintaining adequate hydra-tion in some patients; its exact mechanism ofaction is not known.  the antidiuretic effectsof chlorothiazide and its analogues have beenstudied in six patients with ndi, two ofwhom were infants less than six months ofage.  dehydrated infants showed a dramaticresponse to treatment.  with those unable toachieve an optimal fluid intake prior to treat-ment, the initial beneficial response was asso-ciated with an increased fluid intake.  follow-ing this initial antidiuretic response, a vari-able degree of "escape" or resistance to theaction of the drug commonly occurred.  de-spite the unpredictability of a prolonged anti-diuretic response, a therapeutic trial of chloro-thiazide in ndi seems warranted if diet aloneis not sufficient to maintain hydration.  it mustbe remembered, however, that this drug is po-tentially toxic.
