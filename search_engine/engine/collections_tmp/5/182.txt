glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenasein lens and blood of different species .the activities of glucose 6-phosphate and 6-phosphogluconate dehydro-genase were measured in the lens and erythrocytes of man and severalother species . there is a wide variation between individuals of thesame species, but there seemed no correlation between the activity ofeither enzyme in the lens and their activity in the erythrocytes of thesame species . there is a wide range of activity of both glucose 6-phos-phate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the lens andin the blood of different species . several species had glucose 6-phos-phate dehydrogenase activity in erythrocytes below the level considered/deficient/ in man . the sorbitol content of the lens was not correla-ted with glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity .
