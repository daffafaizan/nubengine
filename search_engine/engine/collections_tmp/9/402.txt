1696. further comparative studies on two isogenic cell lines of autologousorigin, one of which is tumor-producinga single explant of normal lung tissuefrom an adult female mouse c57bl provided2 cell lines.  one remained normaland is referred to as pg, the other becamemalignant and is designated as pt.with successive in vitro passages by tryp-sinization the tumour-inducing capacityof the pt line considerably decreased itstumour-producing capacity as wellas its acrobic glycolysis coefficient, while thepg line showed no appreciablechange.  results of chromosome studies are de-scribed, but proved inconclusive.similar experiments were also carried out oncell lines derived from the pt lineand their results are discussed.
