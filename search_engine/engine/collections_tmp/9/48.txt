toxicity of sulfur-35, selenium, and tellurium to avian embryos .continuous internal irradiation of chick embryos with sulfur-35administered on the 4th or 8th day of incubation produced abnormalitiessimilar to those observed in selenium toxicosis of avian embryos . thehighest level of sulfur-35 (1600 uc) injected into eggs containing 4-dayembryos produced morphological abnormalities more severe than thoseproduced by the same level of radiosulfur administered to 8-day embryos,or by any level of stable selenium tolerated . selenium at levelsgreater than 30 ug killed all the embryos within 24 hours afterinjection . nearly 20 times more tellurium than selenium was required tokill all the embryos within 24 hours.. no abnormalities were observed inthe tellurium-injected embryos .
