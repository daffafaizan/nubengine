renal factors in the pathogenesis of hypertensionrenal arteriography and other modern diagnostic procedures have providedthe means of establishing a close relationship between high blood pressure andrenovascular disease.  many of these cases are amenable to surgical cure.  atthe present time there is no single test for the definitive diagnosis of renalhypertension.  careful and intensive studies are mandatory in the selection ofcases suitable for surgery, since hypertension has many etiologic factors andinvolves many complex and sometimes obscure mechanisms.  aortography,intravenous urography and split-function tests are among the most importantmethods for definitive diagnosis and for the planning of appropriate surgicalprocedures.at operation, the most commonly observed cause of renal arterial con-striction in the elderly is atherosclerosis, whereas in younger patients it ishyperplasia of the intimal and muscular coats of the renal artery and itsbranches.  renovascular surgery may require a variety of technical procedures.in the successful cases there is a striking and permanent reduction in bloodpressure.the accuracy of blood pressure readings is emphasized, since hypertensionis usually discovered for the first time during the course of a routinephysical examination.
