2803. effect of dosage on endotoxin-induced changes in the reticuloendothelialsystem of rabbitstissues were removed from rabbits 4and 24 hr. following an i.v. injection of 5,25, or 200 ug of endotoxin.  explants oftissues from normal and injected animalswere grown in a coagulated plasma mediumand in medium containing 1 ug/ml ofendotoxin.  the migration and growth of cellswere observed during the following weekof incubation.  the inhibition or stimulationof cells of the reticuloendothelial system(res) at different host sites after endotoxinadministration depended on the dosageand on the known capacity of different organsto take up circulating endotoxin.  macro-phage migration was suppressed in culturesof spleen removed 4 hr. after a dose ofhibited by 200 ug, but macrophages inlymph node, testis, and thymus showed an in-crease in numbers, in extent of migrationand in phagocytic activity.  widespreadres stimulation was seen in tissues removed24 hr after the largest dose.  in ad-dition to the restoration of re cell activity inspleen and lung there was a markedincrease in the migration of large phagocyticcells from bone marrow, as well asother organs.  macrophages from endotoxin-injectedanimals were as sensitive asnormal macrophages to added endotoxin in vitro.
