the morphologic demonstration of an alveolar lining layer and itsrelationship to pulmonary surfactant .the presence of an alveolar lining layer was histologicallydemonstrated in animal lungs by ultraviolet microscopy . this layerappeared as a thin fluorescent line at the air-tissue interface .the fluorescent lining layer could be abolished from lung sections byextraction with chloroform..methanol and was diminished by digestionwith cl.welchii a-toxin lecithinase, suggesting that the structure was alecithin-containing lipid . an alveolar lining structure was alsoidentified by the use of phosphatide and polysaccharide stains,suggesting that the lipid was a phosphatide, but that amucopolysaccharide component might also be present .bilateral cervical vagotomy resulted in diminution or loss of thefluorescent alveolar lines and abnormal surface tension properties oflung extracts . this suggested that the presence of the fluorescentmaterial was associated with the surface activity of the lung .alveolar lining structure could not be demonstrated by electronmicroscopy, even with special staining techniques .
