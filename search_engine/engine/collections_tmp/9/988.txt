identification of canine microfilariae.the importance of microfilarial identificationsin diagnosing canine filariasis wasemphasized by comparing the significance ofinfections due to different species.personal experiences and an analysis of publishedreports found the modified knottmethod to be the simplest and most practicalof the reliable methods.  its usefulnesswas improved by new morphologic criteria fordifferentiating microfilariae.  microfilarialconcentrations in peripheral blood froma number of naturally infected dogswere determined.  the average count for 44dogs infected with dirofilaria immitiswas only 24,430 (range: < 50 to 168,350) perml. of blood compared with an averageof 235 (range: < 50 to 2,450) per ml. for 100dogs infected with dipetalonema reconditumonly.  of 38 dogs with inapparent infectionsof d. immitis, 17 had microfilarialconcentrations within the range found for infectionsof d. reconditum only.  male andfemale dogs with d. reconditum had similarconcentrations of microfilariae.
