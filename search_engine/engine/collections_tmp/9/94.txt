transformation of bovine cells in vitro after inoculation of simianvirus 40 or its nucleic acid .cells of bovine embryonic lung tissue in culture were inoculated withsimian virus 40 (sv 40) or a phenol extract of a high titer suspensionof sv 40 . both the virus and the nucleic acid preparation inducedproliferative morphological changes characteristic for sv 40transformation . non-infected control cultures and cultures which wereinoculated with a preparation of nucleic acid exposed to dnase andmaintained under the same conditions as infected cultures showed aregular fibroblastic growth .cell lines of rapidly growing transformed cells have been obtained .most attempts to isolate virus from the transformed cells were negative,but minute amounts of virus were recovered from occasional passages .
