1835. the decrease of the steroids in the urine in the course of lung tb.(the therapeutic value of their increase after calciferol)quantitative determination of the urinarysteroids in 38 patients with extensive ul-cero-caseous pulmonary tb confirmedthat the 17-ketosteroids are always decreasedin these cases.  calciferol, in the formof one ampoule of vit.  d2 of 600,000 u.every 10 days, in combination with activetuberculostatic drugs, in the majority ofthe cases leads to an increase of theurinary 17-ketosteroids from 50 to 100% in 2mth.  it appears that the calciferolexerts its action through proteolysis; it stimulatesthe liquefaction and evacuation of thecaseous material.  this proteolytic effect isrelated to that of the mineralocorticoids,which are phlogistic and proteolytic sub-stances.  calciferol offers the advantageover these substances that it does not affectthe electrolytes and is well tolerated bythe organism.  for this reason, good resultsmay be expected from its administrationin cases of extensive pulmonary tb, inwhich the myc. tuberculosis has remainedsensitive to the administered tuberculosticdrugs but nevertheless does not proceedtowards recovery because of the marked caseouslesions.  in such cases calciferol treatmentleads to a rapid and pronounced decreaseof the radiological shadows, improves thegeneral condition and also modifies thesteroid metabolism rendered abnormal by the disease.
