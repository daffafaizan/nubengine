3748. four separate tumour clones derived from a transplantable pleo-morphic carcinoma of the lung in a heterozygous mousea metastasising pleomorphic adenocarcinomain the lung of an untreated hetero-zygous male mouse was successfullytransplanted to 4 brothers by the 'plating'technique of henderson and rous.  by'plating' multiple small grafts in air bells inthe subcutaneous tissues of the new hostsit was possible to select 4 different clonesof transplantable tumour for further study.the histological peculiarities ofdifferent parts of the original tumourwere reproduced in the different clones a i,ii, iii, and b.  retrospective studyof the primary tumour and of its metastasesprovided some interesting clues to routesof metastasis and the selective survival ofmalignant cells.  it is concluded that bythe cloning of transplantable cells, at thefirst serial passage, valuable informationabout the histogenesis and potentialmalignancy of the primary tumour can beobtained.  lastly, the highly malignantcharacter of 4 clones of tumour cells apparentlyderived from the familiar clinicallybenign adenoma of the mouse lung maybe of some interest, from the point ofview of prognosis based on histology.
