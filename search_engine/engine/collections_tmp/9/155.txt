evidence for an immunological reaction of the host directed against itsown actively growing primary tumor .cells isolated from primary benzo(a)pyrene-induced fibrosarcomas inrats of a pure line were tested for their ability to grow as autograftswhen injected back into the autochthonous host . the autograft did nottake if the primary tumor had been removed but grew occasionally inanimals in which the major part of the tumor was left . in everyinstance the sarcoma cells grew when injected into syngeneic recipientsin these recipients the growth of the sarcoma cells was prevented orretarded when they were mixed in vitro, prior to injection, with spleencells from animals that had been immunized against the tumor .autochthonous spleen cells taken from the animal with the tumor behavedin this test like those from immunized animals as long as the spleen wastaken 3 weeks after removal of the tumor . when the spleen and tumorwere removed at the same time, however, autochthonous spleen cells didnot behave like spleen cells from immunized animals and did notinterfere with the growth of the tumor . the results of both theautograft and spleen cell experiments suggest that rats react activelyagainst their own growing primary tumors, but that the tumor exhauststhe supply of lymphocytes responsible for this reaction . after thetumor is removed, the concentration of antitumor lymphocytes in thespleen builds up and the animals can reject an autograft .-j nat cancerinst 36.. 29-35, 1966 .
