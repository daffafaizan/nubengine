surfactant in fetal lamb tracheal fluid .lambs delivered by cesarean section with intact fetal circulation havea fluid filling the trachea . analysis revealed that this fluidcontained material high in surface activity in lambs delivered nearterm, but less surface activity in premature lambs .administration of 10 per cent oxygen to the ewe for 1 hour prior todelivery did not alter the surfactant properties of the fetal trachealfluid .two analyses of the fetal tracheal fluid revealed it to contain 146and 198 mg. of lipid per 100 ml., 30 to 40 per cent of which wasphospholipid, part of the active component of surfactant .the investigations reported here offer a model for further researchinto possible intrauterine factors in the pathogenesis of hyalinemembrane disease .
