the expression of urine analysis results -dash  observations on the useof a specific gravity correction .urine analyses are very useful for measuring the extent of exposure tocertain toxic substances . the types of specimen obtainable from personsemployed in industry, and the effect of concentration variations arediscussed . in expressing the results of analysis it is shown that aconcentration correction is essential . the correction based on specificgravity is the easiest to apply . the mean specific gravity for personsresident in the u.k. has been found to be around 1.016, a figureconsiderably lower than the mean of 1.024 used by many workers(particularly in the u.s.a.) . the implications of this on the resultsof urine analysis are indicated .
