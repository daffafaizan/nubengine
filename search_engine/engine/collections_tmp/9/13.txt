analysis of mammalian lens proteins by electrophoresis .lens proteins of different mammalian species were analyzed bytwo-dimensional starch gel electrophoresis . the number of fractionsdetected by this means varied from 11-20 . a-crystallin was resolvedinto two to three components, b-crystallin into 5-11, and y-crystallininto three to five components . this technique provides a sensitivemethod for the fractionation of lens proteins and for analyzing speciesdifferences .
