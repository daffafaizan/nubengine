465. conversion of a-crystallin of bovine lens into insolubleprotein in vitroa-crystallin can be converted into an insolubleform by treatment with alloxan andto a very small extent with iodoacetate.other reagents such as hcl, naoh, reducedglutathione, hydrogen peroxide,mercaptoethanol, were not able to convert a-crys-tallin into an insoluble form.  thealloxan treated insoluble a-crystallin could be madesoluble by treatment with 7 m urea.the product thus made soluble had the sameelectrophoretic mobility as a-crystallin,but showed cross reaction with a-crystallinin ouchterlony plate and did not haveproteolytic activity.  alloxan was effective inproducing cataract of rabbit lens when verysmall amounts were injected into theaqueous.
