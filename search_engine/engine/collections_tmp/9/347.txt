2302. the carcinogenic activities of n-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene and itsmetal chelates as a function of retention at the injection sitethe carcinogenic activities of s.c. administeredn-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene(n-hydroxy-aaf) and a variety of its metal chelates indicate that greateractivity locally is associated with a longer retention of the chelates at thesite of injection with a slow release of n-hydroxy-aaf to the surroundingtissue.  no tumors were obtained at the sites of 4 injections of n-hydroxy-aaf(3.2 mg. /injection), but 4 and 16 of 20 rats developed sarcomas at thesites of 8 and 16 injections, respectively.  the nickelous, cobaltous, ferric,or cupric chelates induced moderate to high incidences of sarcomas with 1 or 4injections; in these cases one-half of the administered n-hydroxy-aaf wasretained at the injection site for 4-50 days.  the manganous and zinc chelatesand the potassium salt were less active at the injection site; thehalf-retention times for these ranged from 2.5 hr. to 2.5 days.  the comparablehalf-retention time for n-hydroxy-aaf was about 2 hr.  injection of the metalderivatives s. c. with short half-retention times resulted in higher incidencesof mammary tumors than injection of the derivatives with half-retentiontimes of 4 or more days.  when administered in the food the cupric chelateof n-hydroxy-aaf induced the same spectrum of tumors as n-hydroxy-aaf,but the incidences were lower.  while the prolonged retention of the materialat the injection site may account for the greater carcinogenic activities ofthe metal chelates, serious consideration must also be given to the possibleimportance of chelation of carcinogens or their metabolites to cellularconstituents.
