frontal lobes and vision .the influence of the frontal lobe on vision is discussed based on thepresentation of a rather unusual case . after the operation of a rightfrontal brain abscess, which never had led to papilledema, there was apronounced diminution of the visual capacities of the patient,.gradually these disturbances regressed to the point of return of fullvisual acuity,. but there remained a hemianopic field defect . this andpsychological defects in the sense of a partial visual agnosia (whichlatter are also regressing very well) prompted a discussion of thoseneuroanatomical and neurophysiological observations pertinent to thefindings in this patient . the many data on the fronto-occipitalconnections in subhuman primates point to the role of the frontal lobe(area 8) in the development of visual disturbances in the sense of atemporary hemianopia with partial visual agnosia and some intellectualdeficits . contrary to a single observation in an anthropoid ape, ourcase would seem to indicate that the aforementioned combination ofsymptoms may originate in the frontal lobe,. and we hope it will promptother long-term follow-up studies of similar patients . the continuedobservation of this patient and perhaps of others will give apossibility to gain insight into the role of the frontal lobe in vision,as has been assumed for animals .
