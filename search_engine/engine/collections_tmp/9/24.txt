idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia and idiopathic thrombocytopenicpurpura associated with diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia, amyloidosis,hypoalbuminemia and plasmacytosis .a case is reported of a sixty-nine year old woman with severe,idiopathic, autoimmune hemolytic anemia which was initially controlledby splenectomy . a relapse associated with the development of severe,autoimmune, thrombocytopenic purpura failed to respond to large doses ofprednisone, but was controlled to a variable degree with imuran .associated features included diffuse hypergammaglobulinemia, excessivegamma-u proteins in the urine, idiopathic hypoalbuminemia with a greatlyreduced total exchangeable albumin pool, amyloidosis in the spleen andother organs, and diffuse plasmacytosis of the bone marrow, lymph nodes,and thoracic and peritoneal fat . these features and theirinterrelationships are discussed . there was no deficiency in thesynthesis of specific neutralizing antibodies against viruses,indicating that a qualitative immune deficiency did not exist .the frequency of occurrence of thrombocytopenic purpura in such a caseis discussed, as is the prognosis . the mechanism of action ofantimetabolites in inducing a remission in autoimmune hemolytic anemia,as well as the etiology of the disease, is reviewed .
