immunological studies on filariasis.  iii.  fractionation andpurification of antigen for intradermal skin reaction in filariasis.it had been reported that the antigen tcaobtained from adult worms of dirofilariaimmitis produced noticeable reactions infilariasis patients in whose blood microfilariaecould be demonstrated.  further fractionationand purification of this antigenwas attempted in order to study thesubstance responsible for the skinreaction and to obtain a more reliableantigen with high sensitivity and specificity.the fraction fs obtained by treatmentsimilar to that described inthe previous report was used as parent material.by gel-filtration and sephadexg-100 column chromatography of antigen fs,antigen fsi, which produced noticeablereactions in the filariasis patients,was obtained.  this highly reactive antigenfsi was separated into 6 fractions, viz.fsc-1,fsc-2, fsc-3, fsc-4, fsc-5 andfsc-6, by cm cellulose chromatography.the 6 antigens were tested at the 1(protein component) level on patients infectedwith wuchereria bancrofti.  antigenfsc-4, containing 1,500 of protein and40 of carbohydrate per ml., wasmost active.  next, the further fractionationof antigen fsc-4 by deae-sephadexa50 column chromatography was carriedout to yield 4 antigens, viz.fscd-1,fscd-2, fscd-3 and fscd-4.  the 4 antigenswere tested at the 0.05 (proteincomponent) level on filariasis patients. antigenfscd-1 produced the most noticeableskin reaction in the patients.  the eliminationof protein components from antigenfscd-1 was attempted with nagase (a proteolytic enzyme)and pronase to obtainantigens fscdn and fscdp.  each ofthese 2 antigens was tested on the patientsproved to have filariasis, but the reactionproduced by the injection of each antigenwas weaker than that produced by antigenfscd-1.  it may be inferred from thesestudies that the substance responsible forthe skin reaction is proteinic.
