etude radiographique des genoux de 100 hemophilesde 7 a 15 ansradiographic examination of the knee were syste-matically performed in 100 haemophiliac subjectsaged from 7 to 15 years, 64 of whom had a bilateralhaemarthrosis, 30 had only one knee affected and6 were uninjured.an intra-articular opacification, observed in29 knees, corresponded to a recent haemarthrosis.densification of the synovial membrane was ob-served in 25 knees and corresponded to irondeposits.an interlinear pinch was present in 52 knees.erosions of articular surfaces are especially fre-quent (78 knees) or homogeneous (28 knees).hypertrophy of condyles or knee-caps, broadeningof intercondylian space, crushing of internal tibialdisk, genu valgum and posterior subluxation of tibiaare osseous deformations that are encountered.atrophy of femur diaphysis explains the frequencyof fracture of femur.some of these aspects seem to occur early (inter-linear pinch, erosion of the surfaces), others aretardier (geodes, decalcification).a relation between the intensity of abnormal radio-logical findings and the severity of sequelae doesnot always exist, but one can observe major radio-logical alterations only when there is a major bio-logical disturbance.
