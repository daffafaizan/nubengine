7828. selective cerebral hypothermia  physiology and technica safe, suitable technique for producingselective brain cooling by a perfusionmethod is described.  of 15 dogs, 7 survived.the salient features aiding survivalare discussed.  the use of a direct vasodilator(papaverine) in the perfusate torelieve vasospasm markedly reduced cooling timeand represented the most signi-ficant technical advance over previouslydescribed methods.  an acid base analysisutilizing the siggaard-andersen curve nomogramwas performed on 4 dogs and nosignificant acidosis noted during selective braincooling.  a definite arteriovenouslactic acid difference developed at hypothermictemperatures indicating the brainmay metabolize this substance in preference toglucose at lowered brain tempera-tures, the reasons for which were discussed.the rate of disappearance of physi-cally dissolved oxygen (po2) was measuredin the brain following ischemia at dif-ferent temperatures.  the average rate ofdisappearance at 20 c. was 40% of therate at 37 c.  the discrepancy between thisfinding and the in vitro oxygen utili-zation rate at the same temperature was discussed.
