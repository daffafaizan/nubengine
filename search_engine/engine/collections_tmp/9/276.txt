1161. electron microscopy of the bovine lungs  lattice and lamellar structuresin the alveolar lumenin an electron microscopic study of samplesfrom the lungs of 20 normal cattle,and from 4 with high mountain disease, latticeand lamellar structures were obser-ved free in the alveolar lumens in 25% of thenormal cattle and in 100% of those withhigh mountain disease.  in one specimen, alattice and lamellar structure was ob-served in a vacuole within an alveolar epithelialcell.  all others were extracellular.the shape and dimensions of these lattice andlamellar structures were similar tothose described by other workers in experimentsinvolving intratracheal injectionsof silicon and oleic and linoleic acid.  this is thefirst report of the structures freein the alveolar lumens of apparently normal cattle.
