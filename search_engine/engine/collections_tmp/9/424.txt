3820. the dubious haemopoieticstem cell function of the lym-phoid cells of the blood.autoradiographic studies ondogsthe migration, fate and turnover oflymphoid cells in blood and bone marrow ofirradiated and non-irradiated dogs werestudied by serial autoradiography with co-ping of the hind legs during the plasmaclearance time of h3-thymidine injected intoan anterior vein.  in irradiated dogs,the h3-thymidine injection procedure was car-ried out during the early recovery phasefollowing 250 r whole body x-irradiation.conclusive evidence of transformation ofhematogenous bone marrow lymphoid cellsinto hemopoietic precursors was not found.however, in the light of the individualgrain counts transformation of a few lymphoidcells into hemopoietic cells cannot beruled out.  the data obtained from a dog in thevery early recovery phase followingwhole body irradiation strongly indicate sucha transformation.
