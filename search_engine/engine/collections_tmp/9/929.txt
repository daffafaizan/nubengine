the effect of folic acid on growth and deoxyribonucleic acid synthesisin the rat kidney.the effect of a single injection of folic acid (250mg/kg of body wt) on growth of the rat kidney was studied.the patterns of the response were found to be essentiallysimilar in animals aged between 3 wk and 12 mth.maximum values of kidney weight and nucleic acid content,relative to body weight, were found at 4 days atfolate administration.  the increases in wet and dryweights at this time were approx. 80% and 30% resp.above the control weights, and the percentage dry matterof the kidney was significantly lower than normal duringthis period.  at 4 days the rna content of the kidney wasalso maximal, being about 90% greater than the controlvalue, and the dna content after 4 days was increasedby about 60%.  whereas the dna values in 6-wk-old ratswere slightly lower at 7 and 10 days than at 4 days, in12-mth-old animals a further small increase was observedat 7 days, suggesting a prolongation of dna synthesisin the older animals.  autoradiographic studies ofdna synthesis with thymidine-h have shown a greatlyincreased labeling index in all zones of the kidney followingfolate injection.  maximum values were observedat 48 hr in the cortical zone, but the patterns of thechanges in the medulla were less well defined.  the labellingindices in the kidneys of 12-mth-old rats remainedabove normal for a longer period than in 6-wk-old rats.these results concur with the evidence of an increaseddna contents of the kidneys of older rats between 4 and7 days after folate.
