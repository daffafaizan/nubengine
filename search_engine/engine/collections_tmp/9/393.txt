2626. a study of central arteriovenous shunts byprecordial recording of radioalbumin dilution curvesprecordial dilution curves of 185 patients werestudied, 56 of them without cardio-vascular disease, 48 with central arteriovenousshunts and 45 with various cardiacdiseases.  collimation was not used, allowing onlyminimal quantities of radioactivematerial (0.5-2.2 uc. of i 131-tagged albumin) to beutilized.  the precordial focusingzone was a critical factor in this technique.  theapplication of different discrimina-tion factors, among them the ratio between theminimal concentration and the latter-an index proposed here - made possible thediagnosis in 46 of the 48 patients withshunts.  this method was shown to be as sensitiveas classical oximetry done duringcardiac catheterization.  the curves in pure valvularstenosis do not show similarchanges to the shunts.  on the other hand, thesechanges are shown in certain val-vular regurgitations.  this fact becomes the mostimportant limiting factor in thediagnosis of central arteriovenous shunts.  cardiacfailure does not preclude thediagnosis, providing one can exclude valvularregurgitation by other means.  themethod is thus, in spite of its limitations, of extremevalue in diagnosing centralarteriovenous shunts, especially when the results areanalyzed together with clinical
