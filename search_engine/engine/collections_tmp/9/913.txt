electron microscopic studies of mycoplasma (pplo strain 880) inartificial medium and in tissue culture.mycoplasma strain 880, isolated from a leukemicpatient, was studied in brothcultures and in several cell culture lines.this strain exhibited considerable pleomorphismin size, internal structure, andshape, including forms with filamentousprojections.  the most common form observedwas 0.5 to 1 in diameter andhad a nuclear area of fibrillar strands, probablydna.  the cytoplasm of the organismscontained ribosome-like granules anda flattened vacuole which indented thenuclear area.  there were various other forms,including 'elementary bodies' 100min diameter that were very electron-dense.in the tissue culture lines in whichthe cells grew as a monolayer, the mycoplasmawere closely associated with thecell surface and were occasionally seen inmembrane-lined cytoplasmic vacuoles.in cell lines that did not attach to the glass,the mycoplasma were fewer and notattached to the cell surface.  although theultrastructure of this strain is similarto that of previously described strains, thereare differences in details of structurewhich may be related either to the growthconditions used or to characteristics ofthe strain.  the various forms of the organismare consistent with the suggestionthat mycoplasma may have several mechanismsof reproduction (growth).  the intracellularmycoplasma may be protected fromantibiotics.  this would partly explainthe difficulty of eradicating mycoplasma frominfected cell cultures.
