demonstration of ventricular aneurysms by radioisotope scanning .radioisotope scanning of the cardiac blood pool after the intravenousinjection of i -labeled iodipamide was carried out in 14 patients withventricular aneurysm . in 4, the aneurysm could be demonstrated onneither the anteroposterior chest roentgenogram nor the scan . in 5, theaneurysm was apparent on the radiograph, but the blood pool did notenter the area, suggesting a thrombus within the aneurysm . in 5, theaneurysm was detectable on the film and was also seen to be filled withradioactivity on the scan . presumably these findings showed that athrombus had not yet formed . blood pool radioisotope scanning appearsto be another tool in the diagnosis of ventricular aneurysm, useful alsoin demonstrating in some patients the presence or absence of anintraluminal clot within the aneurysm .
