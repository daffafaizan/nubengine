auto-radiographic studies of the protein metabolism of the singlekidney in the nephrectomized rat.rats were subjected to unilateral nephrectomy,following which the protein metabolismof the other kidney, which exerteda compensatory activity, was studiedwith h-labelled l-phenylalanine, at differentintervals (3hr. to 7 wk.).  twophases of enhanced incorporation of amino-acidsinto the cells of the convolutedtubules were found, with one maximumafter 6 hr., at which time the uptake islimited to the cytoplasm, and a 2nd maximumon the 4th day, when the nucleus isequally involved.  in the course of the 2ndphase of enhanced amino-acid uptake,there is also an increased mitotic indexof the epithelia of the tubules.  in thecollecting tubules, there was only one phaseof enhanced amino-acid uptake, with amaximum on the 4th day, also coincidingwith an increased mitotic index.  theincrease of the number of cells of the kidneywas determined by a study of the variationsof the mitotic index.  the meanmultiplication factor in the beginning amountsto 1.6.  the protein metabolism is increased1.3 times.  the increase of the volume(factor 1.3) and the increase of the proteinmetabolism per unit of volume (factor 1.3)of the hypertrophic kidney result in atotal increase of the protein metabolismof 2.1 times, once the adaptation processis complete, so that the residual kidneyhas approximately the same proteinmetabolism as 2 normal kidneys.
