chronic respiratory disease in mice and ratschronic respiratory disease (crd) in both mice and rats embraces twoseparate entities, namely: infectious catarrh caused by mycoplasmas(pleuropneumonia-like organisms) and enzootic bronchiectasis by a virus.the two syndromes are discussed in regard to their etiology, pathologicmanifestations, and transmission.  particular attention is paid to the relationof mycoplasmas to infectious catarrh.  the morphologic and culturalcharacteristics of the catarrhal types of these organisms are consideredfrom the standpoint of differential diagnosis.  the importance of crd in themaintenance of breeding colonies and in the use of animals for experimentalpurposes is stressed.  methods for the establishment of specific pathogen-freecolonies, as a means of control, are briefly outlined together withobservations on a cesarean-derived line of swiss mice.
