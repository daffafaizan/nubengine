the problems of infantile autism and psychiatric nosology.in psychiatric literature the syndrome ofearly infantile autism has been dividedinto several subgroups (as, for instance,the subgroup of kanner and the subgroupof asperger) and has been assigned todifferent mental conditions (schizophrenia,psychopathy, neurosis).  these distinctionsand classifications are thought to becontroversial, so long as the etiology ofearly infantile autism is unknown.  norshould any 'psychiatric school' claim tohave the 'right' concept of schizophrenia,since the etiology of schizophrenia, too,has not yet been discovered.  in this particular'pre-scientific' situation of psychiatryit seems more promising to analyzethe individual mental case and to concentrateon clinical symptomatology insteadof discussing arbitrary 'nosological entities'.
