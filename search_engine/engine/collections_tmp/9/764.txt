risk of severe jaundice inglucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenasedeficiency of the newbornthe incidence of g.-6-p.d. deficiency and neonataljaundice in all male infants born in one year in an area ofthe island of lesbos was studied.of 634 infants tested, 29 (4.6%) were found to beg.-6-p.d. deficient.  hyperbilirubinaemia of 16 mg. per100 ml. or over was observed in 34% of g.-6-p.d.-deficient newborn males and in 9.1% of those with normalenzyme activity--in more than half of them in the absenceof incompatibility or prematurity.this is the first time that such a high incidence ofsevere neonatal jaundice has been reported in both ag.-6-p.d.-deficient and a g.-6-p.d.-normal group.  it ispostulated that in the population of lesbos a secondfactor increases the incidence of neonatal jaundice,especially when this factor is combined with g.-6-p.d.deficiency.
