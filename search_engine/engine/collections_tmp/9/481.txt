2565. separation of the transforming and viral deoxyribonucleic acids of atransducing bacteriophage of bacillus subtilisthe authors used the transducing b. subtilisphage ps 10 and present the fol-lowing experimental data  dna isolated fromps 10 is effective for transformationof competent b. subtilis cells.  ps 10 dna isdistinguishable from b. subtilis dnaby its higher density in a cs2so4 gradient andits lower thermal denaturationtemperature.  the transforming activity presentin dna from ps 10 denatures ata temperature characteristic of b. subtilis dnarather than of viral dna.  thetransforming activity of ps 10 dna bands in acs2so4 gradient with bacterial dna.this data indicated that bacterial dna isincorporated into phage ps 10 withoutbeing integrated in the viral dna.  this incorporatedbacterial dna is involvedin transduction.
