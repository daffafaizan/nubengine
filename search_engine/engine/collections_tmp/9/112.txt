cardiac malformations associated with ventricular septal defect .in this study, 46 necropsy-proved cases of ventricular septal defectassociated with another anomaly but not part of a recognized complexwere selected .the associated anomalies were classified as (1) obstructive orpositional anomalies of the great vessels, (2) anomalies responsible foradditional shunts, (3) anomalies causing intraventricular obstructionand (4) aortic valvular insufficiency .clinical findings were often those of the ventricular septal defect,and the findings related to the associated lesion were frequentlyobscure . even with special studies, including cardiac catheterizationand angiocardiography, there was often failure to arrive at a completediagnosis . the findings which led to an erroneous or incompletediagnosis have been presented . when a complete diagnosis was madepreoperatively, the procedures leading to it have been outlined . whilethe diagnostic approach varies with the malformations which may coexistwith ventricular septal defect, it was observed that aortography andselective left ventricular angiocardiography were most commonly helpfulin identifying occult malformations associated with ventricular septaldefect . it is therefore recommended that complete studies, includingleft-sided cardiac catheterization with left ventricularangiocardiography and aortography, should be considered in all cases inwhich the clinical, electrocardiographic, and right-sided cardiaccatheterization studies are not entirely typical for isolatedventricular septal defect .
