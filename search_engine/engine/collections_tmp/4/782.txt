systemic chemotherapyfor cns metastasesof solid tumorsof the 13 cases studied, remissions were ob-tained in eight.  this 62% remission rate is notsignificant because of the number of variablespresent.  however, we believe that chemother-apy for this type of patient is indicated, as sup-ported by the reported data.  the results suggestthat the blood supply to solid tumors is differentfrom that of tumors associated with hematopoi-etic disorders.  the latter respond very poorly,if at all, to systemic therapy.  although we werenot able to measure the central nervous system(cns) lesions exactly, the regression of thecns symptomatology was significant.  in pa-tients who had other demonstrable metastaticdisease, those lesions also regressed.  with thisevidence we feel that patients with metastaticcns lesions, even when these have recentlyresulted in paralysis or seizures, should be con-sidered for systemic chemotherapy.
