effect of mycoplasma on interferon production and interferon assay incell cultures.the influence of mycoplasma on the productionand action of interferon was studied in cultures of bothl and human embryonic kidney (hek) cells.  m. hominis1, the negroni agent, and the f12 mycoplasma wereused for infection of l cells, and m. hominis 1 and m.pneumoniae for inoculation of hek cells.  all strainswere capable of multiplication in the culture systemsemployed.  none produced detectable levels of interferon,and responsiveness of the cells to induction of interferonby virus remained unaltered.  infection with mycoplasmadid not impair the sensitivity of the cells to the action ofinterferon, nor was the replication of vesicular stomatitisvirus noticeably diminished.
