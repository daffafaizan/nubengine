factors limiting survival after circulatory occlusion under hypothermiaand hyperbaric oxygenation .thirty minutes of circulatory occlusion with mild hypothermia andhyperbaric oxygen ventilation resulted in a mortality of 83.3 percent inanimals . when coronary perfusion from a reservoir was added, themortality rate was 22 percent . ventricular fibrillation was much moreeasily reversed after coronary perfusion . there was no evidence ofbrain damage in survivors which leads to the conclusion that the braintolerates circulatory arrest better than the heart under theseconditions .
