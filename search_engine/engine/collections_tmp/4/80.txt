rate of change of carbon dioxide tension in arterial blood, jugularvenous blood and cisternal cerebrospinal fluid on carbon dioxideadministration .1. the rate of change of p in arterial blood and cisternal c.s.f., wasmeasured following 5 percent co administration in eight anaesthetizedpatients undergoing routine air encephalography . ventilation wasmaintained constant throughout the procedure by a respirator . in threeof the experiments the rate of change of p in the jugular venous bloodwas also measured .2. the rise in p varied between 25.7 and 14.8 mm hg . the finalsamples of blood and c.s.f. were taken 20-25 min after the start of coadministration in five experiments . at this time the mean rise in p was65.9 (maximum range 68.1-61.6 percent) of the rise in p . in theremaining three experiments the final samples were taken at 15 min whenthe rises in p were 53.2, 39.4 and 38.1 percent of the arterial change .3. the increases in p were 57.5, 76.2 and 76.1 percent of those in thearterial blood . the changes in p in the c.s.f. were smaller than in thejugular venous blood in all three experiments . in two of theexperiments the final samples were taken 15 min after the start of coadministration when the increases of p in the c.s.f. were 68.5 percentand 50 percent of those in jugular venous blood . in one experimentwhere the final samples were taken at 20 min the increase in p was 89percent of the rise in p .4. there was a delay, following the start of co administration, in therise of p in jugular venous blood and in the c.s.f . this delay wasabout 1 min in the jugular venous blood but in the c.s.f. it varied from1.6 to 4.2 min (mean 2.3) .5. the rise of p in blood and c.s.f. was exponential . the rise in pin all experiments consisted of a fast component with time constantswhich varied between 0.2 and 0.9 min (mean 0.5) and a slow componentwith time constants varying between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) .the rise in p and p consisted of only one component . the timeconstants for the changes in jugular venous blood were 2.1, 3.8 and 4.3min, whilst in the c.s.f. they varied between 6.7 and 14.7 (mean 11.6) .6. it is probable that about 40 percent of the increase in ventilationfollowing co administration is due to stimulation of an area in theantero-lateral surface of the medulla sensitive to changes in ph or p(mitchell et al. 1963) . this area is superficial and ventilation isaffected by changes in the p of the overlying c.s.f . it can bepredicted from our experiments that the rise in p on co administrationwill take some 30 min to be complete . this may explain the slow rise inventilation on co breathing when compared with the rate of rise ofarterial and jugular venous p .
