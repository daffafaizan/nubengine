766. a comparison of the effects of selected cytotoxic agents on the primaryagglutinin response in rats injected with sheep erythrocytesa comparative study was made of the effects of several cytotoxic agents, givenat maximally tolerable doses, on the primary agglutinin response in ratsimmunized with sheep erythrocytes given intraperitoneally.  antigen was givenbefore, at the beginning, or in the middle of a 5-day course of drugtreatment.  chlormethine (mechlorethamine), 5-fluorouracil, and5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine did not suppress the primary responsesignificantly.  methotrexate, 6-mercaptopurine, 6-mercaptopurine robosideand 2-amino-6-((1-methyl-4-nitro-5-imidazolyl) thio) purineprolonged induction time and suppressed peak titer maximallywhen immunization was performed one to three days priorto drug treatment.  vinblastine did not affect peak titer, but did prolonginduction time when antigen was given 2 days prior to drug treatment.cyclophosphamide markedly prolonged induction time and suppressed peak titerirrespective of the time of antigen administration.  the antimetabolitesappeared to suppress maximally the intermediate stage of the primary response.cyclophosphamide appeared to suppress all stages.
