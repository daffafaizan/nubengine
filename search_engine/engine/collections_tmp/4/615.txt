learning problems in children: ii. emotional aspectsat the last meeting we tried to deal with a general over-all approachto the problem of learning, considering it not merely as a problem inreading, but learning in general which begins at birth.we hope to deal with this problem at a relatively high level and wewant to have the emotional problems dealt with in this manner ratherthan in terms of diagnostic criteria.  the child with learning problemsshould not be compartmentalized in terms of "organicity" and "nonorganicity".the subject of this talk, then, is emotional issues in learning.
