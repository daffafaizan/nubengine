immunological demonstration of factor viii protein in the plasma ofhemophiliacs and its value for an insight into hemophilia a.by immunization of rabbits one obtains antiseraagainst human factor viii, the actionof the immunsera has been determined usinga modification of the thromboplastingenerationstest (the factor viii neutralizationtest).  the antibodies against factor viiiare equally absorbed by either normal or hemophiliaa plasma.  this observation showsthat hemophilia a plasma contains as much factorviii protein as normal plasma does.in normal and hemophilia a serum one findsat a lower level similar concentrations offactor viii.  in analogy with cross-reacting substances(crm) in bacteria mutants anhypothesis has been made according to whichthe authors are dealing with the productof a genetically altered synthesis of factor viii.this product is functionally less activebut possesses the same antigenic determinantsas the normal factor viii.  some inhibitorproperties of the hemophilia plasma can beexplained by competitive inhibition madepossible by the similarity of structure.  the factthat the inhibitor discovered by mammenand factor viii have similar properties supportthe hypothesis.  the theory of someauthors according to which the plasma of anhemophiliac a contains normal amountsof a normal factor viii blocked by a specificinhibitor, the pathogenetic agent of hemophilia ais rejected because of genetic considerationsand because the accelerator appearingafter ether treatment of hemophilia a plasma isnot identical with factor viii.
