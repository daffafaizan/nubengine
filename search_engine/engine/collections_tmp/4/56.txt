current status of hypothermia .moderate hypothermia has been recommended for many and variedconditions . today its value is being questioned in the light ofcontrolled groups of patients . at the moment its use is justified incertain cardiac and other operations where circulation may beinterrupted for short periods.. in general surgical procedures wheremassive, sudden blood loss may be anticipated.. in neurosurgicaloperations where a /relaxed/ brain is required.. following acute hypoxiasuch as seen in cardiac arrest.. and perhaps in the therapy of acutesepticemic shock .profound hypothermia in association with extracorporeal circulationrests on shakier premises, but can be of value in major cardiacoperations where asystole is required and in certain neurosurgicalprocedures where complete interruption of circulation is indicated .there is a great hazard in the development of inadvertent orunrecognized hypothermia in the anesthetized patient . monitoring ofbody temperature is an important feature of the care of the patient inthe operating theater and in the recovery room .
