anodized aluminium grains labelled with radiophosphorusfor medical purposesg. b. fasolo, r. malvano, u. rosa and e. zimmerinterstitial b-therapy, by implantation in tissues ofradioactive sources, is widely applied to the treatmentof certain forms of human malignancies.  among theradio-elements proposed for this therapeutic technique,yttrium-90 and gold-198 are the most generally used.radiophosphorus (32p) shows some attractive featuresbecause of its suitable half-life (14.3 days) and its ratherhigh-energy b-emission (maximum energy 1.71 mev);but the use of this radionuclide is limited by the diffi-culties found in the preparation of safe solid sources.  theonly techniques we have found in the literature are thosereported by riechert and mundinger and by rames andmoravek, who used respectively small plastic capsulesfilled with phosphomolybdic acid solution, and ca(po4),grains, labelled with phosphorus-32.  these methodsrequire a delicate preparative work, and, moreover, alarge b-self-absorption effect can be expected in bothcases.a new simple method for the preparation of grainslabelled with phosphorus-32 basically consists in ad-sorbing labelled po4 3- ions on an active aluminium oxidefilm produced by anodic oxidation of aluminium wire.the adsorption capacity of the oxide film for po3 3- ionsis quite high, but the process is reversible: the phos-phorus-32 activity is partially desorbed, even after'sealing' in boiling water, when the labelled wire is keptin isotonic sodium chloride solution.
