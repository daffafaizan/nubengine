1848. antigen analysis of sera from patients with malignanttumors by immunodiffusion methodsimmunoelectrophoresis and ouchterlony'smethod were used for the antigen analy-sis of sera from 320 cancer patients; 250normal or non-tumorous cases served ascontrols.  immunoelectrophoresis showedabnormal precipitin lines which could notbe demonstrated in normal sera.  most ofthe abnormal antigens were demonstratedin the a2- and b1-globulin fractions.  thedistribution of these antigens differed inindividual cases and was not related to thehistopathological classification and siteof the tumors.  however, these antigensincreased in parallel with growth of thetumors and disappeared or markedlydecreased after surgical removal of the tumortissue.  almost all sera of patients withmyeloma, leukemia, and malignant lymph-oma formed one characteristic line inthe b2-globulin region and they could be dif-ferentiated from the patterns in cases of carcinoma.
