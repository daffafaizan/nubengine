surgical treatment of atrial septal defect under hypothermia .the technique of inflow occlusion under 30 c. hypothermia was adoptedfor direct visual correction in 133 consecutive cases of atrial septaldefect of the secundum variety and the associated anomalies .the use of extracorporeal circulation combined with hypothermia wasreserved for the repair of two cases of ostium primum defects .the over-all operative mortality was 4 .post-operative evaluation showed that the results have been good inalmost all patients, including those with pulmonary hypertension .since an ostium primum defect requires cardio-pulmonary bypass for itsclosure, the pre-operative recognition of the defect is highly desirablein the selection of patients for operation and in planning the procedureitself .the information derived from the clinical examination and appropriatediagnostic studies has been found to be consistently accurate in thepre-operative differentiation of the primum from the secundum defect .therefore, the unexpected discovery of a primum defect at operation wasnot a problem .in our experience, open-heart surgery under 30 c. hypothermia for therepair of an atrial septal defect of the secundum type and theassociated anomalies is a safe and practical technique and effectivelycorrects the anomaly with minimal risk .
