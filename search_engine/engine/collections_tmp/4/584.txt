bone growth and metabolic studies of prematureinfants treated with human growth hormonethe influence of exogenous humangrowth hormone on growth and metabo-lism of premature infants was observed.it was not possible to register any in-crease of linear bone growth after hormoneadministration; concomitantly urinary hy-droxyproline excretion did not changesignificantly.nitrogen balance studies indicated asharp increase of nitrogen retention, due toa reduced urinary excretion, in all infants.calcium and phosphorus balances rose inthree out of four premature infants treatedwith growth hormone, but the characteris-tic sth calciuric action of sth was notobserved.  furthermore, sth failed to in-duce any significant increase in nefaserum concentration of premature infants.it may therefore be concluded that themetabolic response of premature infants tosth differs consistently from that normallyobserved in more mature subjects.
