long-term prognosis and the response of schizophrenic childrento drug therapy: a controlled study of trifluoperazine.it is evident from this study that treatment andcontrol groups must be matched for severity of illness,since this affects the responsiveness to pharmacologicalas well as to other types of treatments.  the use ofthe double-blind technique does not of itself guaranteea well-controlled study; the comparison of 2 or moretreatment regimes may be misleading if the groups arenot matched, or if the matching is not based on criticalfactors.  in this study, both the response to the nonpharmacologicaspects of treatment and the type ofresponse to the drug itself were related to the initialseverity of language impairment.  thus the major developmentaldefect which determines long-term outcomefor schizophrenic children in this group also predictedthe immediate responsiveness to treatment.  within the2 major prognostic subgroups of young schizophrenicchildren, those with speech and those without, are childrenwith different profiles of disordered developmentand different patterns of assets and handicaps.
