decrease in serum and urinary phosphorus in manin the course of pyrotherapyduring the feverpeak occurring a few hours after the in-jection, urinary phosphorus (up) dis-appears entirely.  this fact cannot beaccounted for by the parallel decrease ingfr, because serum phosphorus level(sp) does not increase (as it would beexpected to, should retention occur) buton the contrary, it, too, declines to amarked degree.the possibility that changes in sp andup could have been brought about by anincreased utilization of glucose was alsoconsidered.  an intravenous glucose toler-ance test (method of macho and licko(8)) was carried out in another group ofpatients on control days and on days ofpyrotherapy five hours after the pyrogenadministration.  an increase in the rate of"glucose utilization" was observed(table 2).  however a different opinion isfound in the literature.  in the course ofglucose tolerance tests, conn (3) andcomparini (9) observed a lowered rate ofglucose utilization in febrile subjects.malizia (10) found an accentuated rateof decline of serum phosphorus duringglucose tolerance tests in subjects withhigh temperatures, but the glycemicresponses did not differ from those ob-tained when controls without fever weresubjected to the same tests.  whether itbe for utilization purposes or not, thefact remains that a massive transfer ofphosphorus from the serum into thetissues takes place in fever.
