evaluation of tylosin inpreventing egg transmission ofmycoplasma gallisepticum inchickensthe inoculation of mycoplasma gallisepticum infectiveyolk into the left posterior thoracic air sac of laying chickensresulted in an infection which produced a rate of egg infectionsatisfactory for experimental purposes.  culturing of all liveembryonating eggs as well as all dead and infertile eggs wasnecessary to determine the rate of egg infection.  tylosin,either injected subcutaneously, administered in the drinkingwater, or employed in an egg-dipping solution, greatly reducedbut did not completely eliminate egg infection.  in the 3 eggdipping trials, only 11 isolates of m. gallisepticum were ob-tained from 2329 tylosin-dipped eggs, compared to 400 isolatesfrom 2984 control eggs.
