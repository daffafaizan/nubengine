action of phytohaemagglutinin in vitro on the lymphocytes of chroniclymphoid leukaemia .the in vitro action of phytohaemagglutinin has been the subjects of acomparative investigation of the lymphocytes of 13 normal subjects andof 15 cases of chronic lymphatic leukaemia .in both groups there is cellular change shown by the appearance oflarge basophil nucleolated cells showing mitotic activity .in all the cases of lymphatic leukaemia the percentage of cellsundergoing such change is lower than in normal subjects, and thetransformation occurs more slowly .the two phenomena are more striking the higher the initialleucocytosis .these results suggest, in chronic lymphatic leukaemia, the cellsaffected by the transformation are residual normal lymphoid elements .leukaemic lymphoid cells appear to be incapable of this transformation .
