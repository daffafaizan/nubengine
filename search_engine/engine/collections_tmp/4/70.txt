a light and electron microscope study of developing respiratory tissuein the rat .1. light microscopic observations on the development of the rat lunghave shown the presence of glandular, canalicular and alveolar stages .2. these same three stages can be identified by electron microscopyand all may be present in different parts of the lung at one time, e.g.at 40 and 45 mm. c.r. length .3. in the glandular stage, the lung tissue itself has an immatureappearance by light microscopy and by electron microscopy individualcells also are immature in respect of organelles . glycogen is presentin immature cells .4. during the canalicular stage, lung tissue becomes more vascular .5. throughout all stages of development, the 'duct' or 'air' spacesare always lined by a continuous and complete epithelium, and bloodvessels by a complete endothelium .6. lamellated inclusion bodies are present in epithelial (endodermal)cells at an early stage of development .7. micropinocytotic vesicles are present in large numbers in bothepithelial and endothelial cytoplasm and it is suggested that in thefoetus they may indicate absorption of amniotic fluid from alveolarspaces .8. the mechanism of alveolar distension is discussed and its natureremains uncertain .9. respiratory tissue of the rat is not fully differentiated at birthand the importance of this fact in human infants is discussed .10. the adult blood-air barrier, consisting of epithelium, zonadiffusa and endothelium, varies in thickness .this project was performed whilst both of us were in receipt of grantsfrom the medical research council of canada, for which gratitude isexpressed . our gratitude is also expressed to miss sylvia smith fortyping the manuscript .
