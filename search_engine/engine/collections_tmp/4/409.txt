1106. the simultaneous use of extracorporal circulation and hypothermia in thesurgery of the heartthe operative technique of cardiacsurgery under conditions of deep hypothermia withsimultaneous use of a pump oxygenatorand cardiopulmonary bypass is described.  inthe majority of cases the patients werecooled with water at 2 c. and the perfusionvolume was reduced by more than 50%during hypothermia.  in others, a gradient of10 c. between blood and water wasmaintained and the perfusion volume was reducedby less than 50%.  the data presentedshow that neither technique leads to hypoxicchanges in the cerebrum and internalorgans, provided the mean arterial pressureis kept between 70 and 90 mm. hg during perfusion.the overall mortality in theauthors' 168 cases - most of whichhad congenital heart disease - was 14.8%.  in 53cases of tetralogy of fallot - mostof them cyanotic - the vsd was closed by takinga flap of tissue from the crista supraventricularis.in this group mortality was 24.5%.
