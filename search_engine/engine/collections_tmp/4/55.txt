study on the behavior of tumor tissue in diffusion chambers againstpenetrating host cells in tumor-resistant rats .tumour cells in diffusion chambers, which were implanted intumour-resistant rats, were only destroyed by penetrating immunized hostcells when membrane filters of large pore size were used, whereas withfilters of small pore size the tumour cells survived and remainedvirulent .
