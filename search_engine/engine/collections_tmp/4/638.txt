coombs-positive hemolytic anemia and generalized amyloidosis inmice following transmission of subcellular leukemic materialfollowing transmission withcell-free supernatant fluid or with virus ex-tract of leukemic tissue or plasma from vari-ous types of murine plasma cell leukemiasa disease developed, characterized by hyper-gammaglobulinemia, weight loss, anemia,marked splenic, renal and hepatic amyloido-sis and plasma cell infiltrations in the lungs.the disease was also transmissible throughthe placenta or with the milk of infectedmice.  in dba/2 males the incidence of thedisease was much higher (100%), the sur-vival shorter and the anemia much moresevere than was the case in dba/2 femalesand in (dba/2 x cba) f1 mice of bothsexes.  it is proposed that the developmentof the lesions is mediated through an auto-immune mechanism created by the antigeniceffect of the virus-transformed host cells.
