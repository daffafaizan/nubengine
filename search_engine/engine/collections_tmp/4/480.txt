2564. chemical inactivation and reactivation of transforming dna (russian)the kinetics of the inactivation of linkedand unlinked genetic markers by meansof hno2 or uv light was studied.  closelylinked markers are inactivated simul-taneously, unlinked markers are inactivatedindependently.  it seems that thechemical attack on dna impairs a large partof macromolecule, including manycistrons.  it was shown by genetic experimentsthat chemical inactivation prac-tically does not influence the process of dnainclusion into competent cells.  bymeans of viscosity measurements it wasshown that the molecular weight andmacromolecular properties of dna do notsignificantly change during chemicalinactivation by means of hno2.  two explanationsfor the inactivation of trans-forming activity of dna are discussed  (1) structuraldeteriorations, preventingintegration of dna molecule into the genome ofrecipient cell, or (2) deletion ofa chain unit out of dna chain resulting in wrongreading of code triplets.  it waspreviously described in the literature that extensiveinactivation leads to a stateof dna, apparently more resistant than the initial one.inactivation does not con-firm to exponential kinetics.  the authors discuss thecoding mistake hypothesisas an explanation for this remarkable fact.  extensivehno2 or uv light action re-sults in multiple lesions in the dna molecule andleads to reactivation becausethe deletions restore correct reading of the codein a large part of dna molecule.on the basis of this explanation reactivation ofchemically injured dna by meansof fusion and annealing with homologous butgenetically inactive dna, or by slightfragmentation of dna by means of ultrasonicvibrations may be expected.  attemptsto achieve reactivation by both methods gavepositive results.
