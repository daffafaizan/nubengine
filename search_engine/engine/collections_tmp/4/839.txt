the prevention of cripplingin haemophilic childrenchildren who are severely affected with haemo-philia or christmas disease suffer repeatedhaemorrhages into joints and muscles after trivialinjuries.  these episodes of bleeding producecumulative crippling.  the haemarthroses tend to berecurrent; each episode produces some damage tothe joint surface and the immobility during con-valescence leads to muscle weakness.  thus afterrecovery the joint becomes increasingly liable torenewed bleeding.  the deep muscle haematomatacan produce crippling by actual destruction ofmuscle tissue, by pressure on important nerves orarteries, by contractures which develop duringhealing and by failure of resolution of the originalhaematoma leading to chronic cyst formation.
