comparison of mutation and inactivation rates induced in bacteriophageand transforming dna by various mutagens .inactivation and mutation rates were measured for t4 phages andbacillus subtilis transforming dna treated by low ph, nitrous acid, orhydroxylamine at different temperatures . the frequency of mutantsincreased linearly with time for all three agents, whereas the logarithmof survival gave a linear plot only for nitrous acid and low ph . anarrhenius plot showed the same slopes for both inactivation and mutationrates after treatment with low ph or nitrous acid,. for the latter agentthe slope remained unaltered even when the dna was treated in thedenaturated state . in contrast, mutation rates obtained after theexposure to hydroxylamine differed greatly for native or denatured dna,phage t4 being intermediate .treatment by low ph or nitrous acid interrupted the genetic linkagebetween tryptophan and histidine, the interrupting hits being about 1/3as frequent as lethal hits, independent of the temperature .
