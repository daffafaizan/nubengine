mesenteric vascular response to hypothermia .1. total and segmental resistances were studied in the mesenteries of37 dogs, and the effects of hypothermia, changes in blood viscosity andepinephrine on these resistances were compared .2. cooling to 15 c. caused an increased mesenteric resistance in 94per cent of animals with approximately 90 per cent of the resistancerise contributed by the arterial segment . small vessel resistanceincreased in 52 per cent . there was no evidence of venous constriction3. blood viscosity appeared to play a minor role .4. it is suggested that hemorrhagic necrosis of the bowel wall is dueto intense vasoconstriction in the precapillary vessels with subsequentdistal anoxia and cellular damage .
