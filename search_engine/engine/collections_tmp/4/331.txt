1163. the effect of glucose infusions on the lipoid and thecarbohydrate metabolism of the parturient woman andthe fetusin 20 parturient women who were given glucoseinfusions during the expulsive stageof labor, the authors were able to observe an unusualhyperglycemia and a decreasein unesterified fatty acids (uefa).  the uefa-levelusually increases regularlyduring delivery.  likewise, the values of esterifiedfatty acids (efa) showed an in-crease above the normally present levels in womenwho had received a glucose in-fusion during the expulsive stage of labor.  theresults show that during deliveryboth hyperglycemia and the increase in lipoidsare predominantly due to the energydemands of the organism.  however, there is alsoevidence that other, hitherto un-known factors may play a role.  in the fetus,the infusion of glucose leads to an in-creased glucose retention.  the infusion, however,does not bring about a decrease,but, contrary to the expectations, an increasein the uefa-values.  in general,such a reaction is not found in any of thesubsequent periods of life.  further inves-tigations were conducted in order to find anexplanation for the paradox uefa-reaction.  as shown by an analysis of the lacticacid and the pyruvic acid values, theincrease in the uefa can most probably not beattributed to an impairment in thefetal metabolic conditions.  the administrationof physiological saline infusions to10 parturient women under equal conditionsrevealed that the cause for the uefa-increase can apparently neither be found inhemodynamic changes due to the infusionnor in changes of the electrolyte balance, butrather in an adaptation insufficiencyof the fetal islet cells, respectively in a differentfat mobilization or fat deposition.
