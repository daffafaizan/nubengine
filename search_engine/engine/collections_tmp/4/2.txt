changes of the nucleic acid and phospholipid levels of the livers in thecourse of fetal and postnatal development .we have followed the evolution of dna, rna and pl in the livers of ratfoeti removed between the fifteenth and the twenty-first day ofgestation and of young rats newly-born or at weaning . we can observethe following facts..1. dna concentration is 1100 ug p on the 15th day, it decreases fromthe 19th day until it reaches a value of 280 ug 5 days after weaning .2. rna concentration is 1400 ug p on the 15th day and decreases to 820during the same period .3. pl concentration is low on the 15th day and during foetal life (700ug) and increases abruptly at birth .4. the ratios rna cyto/dna and pl cyto/dna increase regularly from the18th day of foetal life .5. nuclear rna and pl contents are very high throughout thedevelopment .6. these results enable us to characterize three stages in thedevelopment of the rat liver.. - from the 15th day to the 18th day offoetal life.. stage of growth through hyperplasia without hypertrophy,- from the 19th day of foetal life to the 3rd day of post-natal life,.stage of cellular reorganisation,- after the 3rd day of post-natal life.. stage of growth throughhyperplasia and hypertrophy .
