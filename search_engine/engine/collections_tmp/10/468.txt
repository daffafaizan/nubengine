3553. diffuse nodular amyloidosis of the lungsin a 59-year-old man, who 12 yr. previouslyhad ceased working in an aluminiumfactory and who had died from respiratoryinsufficiency, the postmortem examinationrevealed disseminated nodules in the lungs.the nodules were sharply defined, ofa greyish color and of a doughy consistencyand could easily be removed from theircapsules.  the diagnosis of amyloidosis wasmade on the basis of the histologicalfindings, the staining qualities of the material,its intraseptal and periarteriolarlocalization, and the existence of plasmocyticinfiltrates and foreign-body giant-cellgranulomas.  amyloid deposits were also foundin the spleen, kidney and somecoronary branches.  in regard to the pathogenesis,it is suggested that the exposureto aluminium products for more than 10 yr. mighthave constituted a predisposingfactor.
