1635. intra-atrial pressure measurement and electrocardiography in thedetailed diagnosis of atrial septal defectafter discussing the possibilities andlimitations of different methods for identifyingthe anatomical type of atrial septaldefect, the authors suggest a more useful newmethod.  this consists in simultaneousrecording of both the pressure curve andendocavitary electrocardiogram duringwithdrawal of the catheter from the left intothe right atrium.  in the ostium primumtype, the septal foramen has no infe-rior margin, and the point of the catheterduring retraction (unlike in the ostiumsecundum type) rests on the intermediatesection of the atrioventricular septum.the endocavitary electrocardiogram in thezone of passage between the two atriashows the typical pattern of the intermediatesection of the atrioventricular septum;the pressure curve may show a pattern of theatrial of intravalvular type.
