248. data on etiology, pathogenesis, treatment results and survival period in560 patients with cirrhosis of the liverstatistics were compiled from a total of 560 cases chosen at random, ofcirrhosis of the liver.  the figures refer to the age and sex of the patients,as well as to the etiology and the hepatic morphology.  as the date of death of304 of the subjects was known, it was possible to calculate the survival timeafter the diagnosis was made.  only 36% survived the time of diagnosis by 1year, 16% by 3 years, and 8% by 5 years.  these figures show that moderntherapy of liver cirrhosis has up to now not succeeded to prolong the life ofthe majority of the victims.  in many cases, however, it is possible to a largeextent to relieve the patients' suffering by improving the appetite and thegeneral condition and by eliminating ascites and periods of hemorrhage andstupor.  particular attention should be paid to the prophylaxis of the diseaseand, by studying the survival time assessments and therapeutic reports, to themethod of selection of the subjects.
