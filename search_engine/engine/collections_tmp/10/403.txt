1202. characteristics of human adenovirus type 12 induced hamster tumorcells in tissue culturecharacteristics of a human adenovirustype 12 induced hamster tumor serially pro-pagated in vitro are described.  theseinclude small cell size, epithelioid appear-ance, rapid growth rate, resistance tosuperinfection with a-12, and transplant-ability to weanling hamsters.  these cells greweither as monolayers or as balls ofaggregated cells detached from the glass,depending on whether calf serum or horseserum was added to the eagle's medium.  attemptsto demonstrate virus activity bysubculture of supernatant fluids and lysed cells intohela cells, mixed culture withhuman and hamster cells, electron microscopy,and inoculation of newbornhamsters with irradiated tumor cells were negative.
