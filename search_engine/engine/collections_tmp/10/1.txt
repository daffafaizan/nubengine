correlation between maternal and fetal plasma levels of glucose and freefatty acids .correlation coefficients have been determined between the levels ofglucose and ffa in maternal and fetal plasma collected at delivery .significant correlations were obtained between the maternal and fetalglucose levels and the maternal and fetal ffa levels . from the size ofthe correlation coefficients and the slopes of regression lines itappears that the fetal plasma glucose level at delivery is very stronglydependent upon the maternal level whereas the fetal ffa level atdelivery is only slightly dependent upon the maternal level .
