10642. the effects of antioxidants on high pressure oxygen toxicityseveral commonly used antioxidants havebeen tested for their effect against poison-ing due to high pressures of oxygen (ohp).the tests used were preconclusive pe-riod and survival time of mice at 5 atmabsolute oxygen, lung damage in rats ex-posed to 5 atm oxygen for 1 hr., and postohp paralysis in rats following deeppentobarbital-na anesthesia and ohp at 4atm for 30 min.  2,5-bis (1,1-dimethyl-propyl) hydroquinone gave excellentprotection against ohp toxicity in all tests,and several other antioxidants alsoprotected against ohp toxicity but their potencyand effectiveness varied for thedifferent criteria of oxygen poisoning tested in theexperiments.
