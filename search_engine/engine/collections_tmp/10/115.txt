a study of ventricular septal defect associated with aorticinsufficiency .clinical, electrocardiographic, radiographic, and hemodynamic findingsin 12 children with the combination of a ventricular septal defect andaortic insufficiency are presented . the left-to-right shunt wasdetermined to be small or moderate in all, and significant aorticinsufficiency was documented by aortography in 11 patients . clinicalindication of aortic insufficiency as manifested by an aortic diastolicmurmur first appeared at an average age of 6 years in 7 patients, withconcomitant widening of the pulse pressure in 4 . progressive leftventricular hypertrophy was noted electrocardiographically, withprogressive cardiac hypertrophy and aortic dilatation on x-rayexamination in 2 patients . progression of the hemodynamic disabilitydoes not appear to be common in childhood, however .
