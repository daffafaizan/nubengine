chlorambucil-prednisolone therapyfor disseminated breast carcinomaover a 7 1/2-year period, 71 patients withdisseminated breast cancer were treatedwith combined alkylating-agent-cortico-steroid therapy.  chlorambucil and pred-nisolone were the drugs of choice.  theseagents, administered orally, produced noserious or disagreeable toxic effects.  twen-ty-four patients (33.8%) had objectiveregression of six months' duration or long-er; average survival time after therapywas 23.9 months.  results are statisticallysimilar to those obtained with sex-steroidand endocrine-ablation therapy, presum-ably because the three modalities have asimilar mechanism of action, ie. suppres-sion and/or eradication of endogenousestrogen.
