serological relationships among human mycoplasmas as shownby complement-fixation and gel diffusionand robert m. chanockantigenic relationships among humanmycoplasmas were studied by complement-fixation and agar gel diffusion techniques.  fourrecognized human species.  mycoplasma hoministype 1, m. hominis type 2, m. salivarium, andm. fermentans were antigenically distinct inthese tests.  in addition, m. pneumoniae (eatonagent, the etiological agent of cold agglutinin-positive atypical pneumonia) was different fromthese four species.  although these species weredistinct, evidence of shared antigenic componentswas obtained in complement-fixation and agargel diffusion tests.  since rabbits were immunizedwith mycoplasmas grown in rabbit muscle infu-sion broth supplemented with rabbit serum or,in the case of m. pneumoniae, with infected chickembryo lung suspension, the possibility that theheterologous reactions resulted from antibodyto growth medium components could be excluded.four recent mycoplasma isolates from the oro-pharynx were analyzed, and three were shown tobe closely related to m. hominis type 1, and thefourth was closely related to m. salivarium.although the recent isolates could not be dis-tinguished from the related "prototype" humanspecies by complement-fixation, differences couldbe detected by the agar gel diffusion technique.
