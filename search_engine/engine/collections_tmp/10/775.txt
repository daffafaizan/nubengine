management of advanced endometrialadenocarcinoma with medroxyprogesteroneacetatea basis for progestin therapy for patientswith advanced endometrial adenocarcinomais presented.  the criteria for selection ofpatients for hormone therapy and the sched-ule of administration of medroxyprogester-one (provera) is discussed.  evaluation ofpatients for objective changes only, i.e., byvisual, palpable, histologic, or roentgeno-logic means, revealed complete or partialremission with significant palliation in 8 of20 patients (40 per cent).  response to me-droxyprogesterone therapy is apparently re-lated to degree of differentiation of the pri-mary neoplasm, the well-differentiated le-sions being more responsive.  documentationof tumor effect by serial biopsies duringtreatment provides an index to the histologicchanges this progestin produces in suscep-tible cases.  the effects of therapy uponserial urinary hormone excretion rates isdocumented in several patients.on the basis of our experience, the treat-ment of patients with advanced endometrialadenocarcinoma with the potent progestinmedroxyprogesterone seems justified.
