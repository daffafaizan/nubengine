neuroaxonal dystrophy in congenitalbiliary atresianeuroaxonal dystrophy has been described in 8 patients with congenitalbiliary atresia.  the characteristic changes include axonal dystrophy, a mildloss of nerve cells and a variable degree of astrocytic reaction, mainly in thegracile, cuneate and trigeminal nerve nuclei in the medulla, and rarely inother parts of the central nervous system.the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients is remarkably similar to thatin patients with prolonged mucoviscidosis and in experimental vitamine-deficient rats.it is strongly suggested that the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patientswith congenital biliary atresia is a manifestation of prolonged vitamin edeficiency.the neuroaxonal dystrophy in these patients is also similar to that seenin aging and bears resemblance to the axonal change encountered in a groupof heredo-degenerative diseases, the various forms of "hallervorden-spatzdisease".  the pathological similarity between these diverse conditionswarrants further investigation as to the possible metabolicrelationship between them.
