infantile autism: a family approachthe autistic child appears to be unable to integrate or to respond tostimuli, both from an internal source, the body, as well as from externalsources, such as human contact.  we have noted in the children at ourresidential treatment center how in their preliminary period with us theyappear to be unaware of their body; they give the impression of beinginsensitive to pain, display little autoerotic behavior, inflict injury onthemselves, such as hitting their heads against objects and biting their ownbodies, with little outward display of distress.  in working with thesechildren in therapy, one of the guideposts for change and for growth is adisplay on the child's part of an increased body awareness and autoeroticbehavior.  for example, one child who developed polio during his early stayat the clinic residence did not communicate this to anyone and it was onlymade known by observing the child's dragging one leg (memorial guid-ance clinic, 1959).  later, he was able to point to his body and to indicatepain.  another child, who at first seemed to be quite unaware of both himselfand others, concurrent with his growing display of affective expressiontoward the therapist also manifested pleasure through genital stimulation,was quite ticklish, and when injured would display the area of pain quitereadily.
