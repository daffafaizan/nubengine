pathogenesis of polycystic kidneysmicrodissection confirms our previous de-scription of an uncommon variety of poly-cystic kidney found only in the newbornperiods.  it is characterized by symmetricalenlargement caused by saccular or cylindri-cal increase in size of all collecting tubules.the number and relative length of differentgenerations of collecting tubules are normal.nephrons are present in normal numbers,and their attachment to collecting tubules isnormal.  the pattern of the nephrons is nor-mal except for minimal localized areas ofdilatation.  interstitial connective tissue isnot increased.  intrahepatic bile ducts are in-variably cystic.  siblings may be affected.we believe that in such kidneys the be-havior of the ampullae of the branches of theureteral bud is normal and that secondaryhyperplasia of the interstitial portions of thebranches is responsible for the greatly in-creased renal size.
