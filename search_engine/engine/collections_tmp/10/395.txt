1375. loss of neoplastic properties in vitro. ii. observations onkb sublinesten sublines of the kb cell line obtained froma number of different laboratorieswere reexamined with respect to chromosomenumber and heterotransplantabilityto the syrian hamster cheek pouch.  twelveclonal cultures derived from 2 of thesesublines were similarly examined.  threesublines differed from one another andfrom the kb cell line originally studied,which was heterotransplantable with inoculaof circa 10 cells.  only 2 of the sublinescould be heterotransplanted with inoculaof less than 10 4 cells; 5 were heterotransplantablewith inocula of 10 4-10 6 cells; and2 failed to heterotransplant, even withinocula of 10 6 cells.  similar differences inheterotransplantability were observedamong the clonal derivatives of 2 of thesesublines.  although the modal numbers ofthese sublines and clonal derivatives werebasically similar, ranging from 73 to 80,a few lines had a chromosome of sufficient-ly distinctive morphology to serve as amarker.  there was, however, no apparentcorrelation between these minor karyotypicdifferences and heterotransplantability.possible differences between non-heterotransplantableand heterotransplantablesublines with respect to the pattern ofvariability in cytoplasmic protein and cyto-plasmic ribonucleic (rna) content per cellremain to be studied in detail.  for i of thisseries of articles see exc. medica cancer, 1965, abstr. no. 2378.
