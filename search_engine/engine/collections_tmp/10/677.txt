renal hyperplasia and neoplasiain rats given dimethylnitrosaminemultiple foci of hyperplasia and neoplasia were induced in the kidneyof rats that had been dosed orally with dimethylnitrosamine.  the younger ratsand the male sex had a greater incidence of renal tumors.  the hyperplasticor neoplastic lesions were classified into two groups on the basis of theirhistogenesis, namely that of tubular epithelial origin and that of interstitialcell origin.  dimethylnitrosamine is recommended as a useful chemicalcompound for the study of renal carcinogenesis.
