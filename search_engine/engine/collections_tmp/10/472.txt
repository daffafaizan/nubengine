2567. the molecular basis of histidase induction in bacillus subtilisbacillus subtilis growing at 37  onglutamate, as only carbon source, is inducedto form histidase by l-histidine.  thisenzyme, converting histidine to urocanicacid, was isolated in a purified form.a highly sensitive and convenient assay forthe induced enzyme is described andapplied to show that histidase appears in thecell 5 min. after addition of the inducer.histidase-synthesizing capacity appearsafter 2 min. and decays exponentially afteraddition of actinomycin (an inhibitorof dna-dependent rna synthesis).  thehalf-time value of histidase-synthesizingcapacity of 2.4 is high, compared with thehalf-time value of messenger rna.the histidase formation after addition ofactinomycin was not only due to proteinsynthesis directed by accumulated m-rnabut also by conversion of an enzymatical-ly inactive protein, present on the momentof actinomycin addition and product ofthe specific m-rna, to the active enzyme.the existence of this enzyme pre-cursor was shown by means of experimentsperformed in the presence of chlor-amphenicof.  finally, numerical values forthe steady state of histidase synthesis,reached 9 min. after addition of the inducer,are calculated, on the basis of ki-netics of histidase synthetic capacity, precursorand enzyme formation  the cellcontains sufficient precursor to formapproximately 100 molecules of histidase.the cell produces approximately 50molecules histidase per min.  the cell ac-quires and loses, every minute, thecapacity to make 15 molecules of histidaseper minute.  the maximal enzymelevel is 15,000 molecules per cell.
