microbiological studies of reiter's diseaseattempts were made to demonstrate viruses andpplo in body fluids and synovial tissues of patientswith various rheumatic diseases.  all attempts todemonstrate viruses were negative.  pplo werelooked for in 499 specimens from 114 patients withrheumatic and non-rheumatic diseases.  whereasthese organisms were readily isolated from genito-urinary specimens, they were found in none of 31synovial fluid specimens.  they could not be grownfrom synovial tissue biopsies of patients withrheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, gout,gonococcal arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, traumaticarthritis, or arthritis accompanying ulcerative colitis,but they were present in one and possibly in two ofeight synovial tissue specimens from patients withreiter's disease.  complement-fixation tests werenegative in nine patients with reiter's disease,including the two from whose synovial tissuespplo were thought to have been isolated.
