ventricular septal defect with aortic insufficiency a clinical andhemodynamic study of 18 proved cases .eighteen patients with the combination of ventricular septal defectand aortic insufficiency were studied . nine also had infundibularpulmonary stenosis . seventeen were treated by open-heart operations .the physical findings were those of a typical ventricular defectmurmur and thrill together with an aortic insufficiency blow and a widepulse pressure . a systolic murmur at the upper left sternal border withthrill is strongly suggestive of the additional lesion of infundibularpulmonary stenosis, but the presence or absence of infundibularpulmonary stenosis was indicated most accurately at cardiaccatheterization and on inspection at operation . it was not ofsufficient severity for signs of additional right ventricularhypertrophy to appear on the electrocardiogram .retrograde aortography serves to demonstrate the severity of theaortic regurgitation .the problem of the surgical correction of these lesions will be thesubject of a separate communication .
