effects of hypophysectomy and growth hormone on renal compensatoryhypertrophy in rats.the effect of hypophysectomy on renal compensatoryhypertrophy (rch) was observed in unilaterallynephrectomized rats receiving no therapy and thosereceiving replacement therapy and was compared to therch attained by non-hypophysectomized unilaterallynephrectomized rats at 2, 5, and 10 days.  in the lattergroup there was an initial rapid rch seen at day 2which continued, but at a slower rate, through day 10.in the hypophysectomized group without replacementtherapy there was also an initial rch in the first 48 hrs.however, instead of the rch continuing there was aregression in kidney size at 5 days and with no subsequentchange at 10 days.  in the hypophysectomized groupreceiving hormone replacement there was an initialrch comparable to the other 2 groups, but the furtherrenal enlargement at 10 days was much less than thatof the non-hypophysectomized animals.  the results ofthis experiment and of other reported studies implyexistence of a renotropic factor which is not producedin the pituitary, but which requires an intact pituitaryfor full effectiveness.
