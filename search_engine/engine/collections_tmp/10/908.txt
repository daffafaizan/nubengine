isolation of mycoplasma pneumoniae from adults with respiratoryinfections.isolation of mycoplasma organisms from the sputumwas attempted in 254 patients with various syndromeof respiratory disease.  isolates were obtained in 56% ofthe 197 patients with pneumonia, 50% of patients withchronic bronchial diseases who were not treated withtetracycline, and 33% of persons with acute upper respiratoryinfection.  these differences are not statisticallysignificant and indicate a nonpathogenic role for m.pharyngis and m. salivarium which were the strains mostfrequently isolated.  the highest frequency of isolationwas from males 15 to 30 yr. of age.  isolation of m.pneumoniae requires one to 2 weeks:therefore, it is notuseful for rapid diagnosis.  also, it underestimates theprevalence of infection, especially if patients have receivedtetracycline.  of the serologic tests, complement-fixation(cf) was the most specific.  the growthinhibition test (tri) was the most sensitive and wassignificantly related to atypical pneumonia.  the 2 testsmay measure different antibodies against m. pneumoniae.serum cold agglutinins developed in many casesof pneumonia and were poorly discriminatory in etiologicdiagnosis.  m. pneumoniae infection occurred in aminimum of 8% and a maximum of 20% of civilian patientshospitalized for pneumonia during the season studied.serologic evidence for m. pneumoniae was rare inlobar pneumonia.  in nonlobar pneumonia, m. pneumoniaeaccounted etiologically for 13% to 50% of cases.  the incidenceof m. pneumoniae infection was constant indifferent seasons but greatest relative to the occurrenceof pneumonia in the fall and spring.
