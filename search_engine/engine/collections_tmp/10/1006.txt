the importance of steroid hormones in hyperbilirubinemia, and icterusof the newborn.administration of naturally occurring steroids(estriol, pregnanediol, cortisone)between the 7th and the 11th day of life increasesthe bilirubin level of these newborns.administration of the same steroidsor of progesterone to nursing mothersresults in hyperbilirubinemia of their infants.these facts explain the pathogenesisof neonatal jaundice.  interpretation of theexperimental and clinical findings leadsto the conclusion that the high amount ofsteroid hormones which must be excretedduring the neonatal period in conjunctionwith the relative insufficiency of the neonatalliver is responsible for the inabilityto conjugate bilirubin with glucuronic acid.the steroid hormones probably competewith bilirubin for the enzyme and substratenecessary for conjugation.  the functionalcapacity of the neonatal liver isnot high enough to conjugate both bilirubinand steroids.  only after excretion of theplacental steroids does sufficient conjugationof bilirubin become possible.  furthermore,pregnanediol appears to inhibit theenzyme glucuronyl transferase.  thesemechanisms show the importance of steroidhormones in the pathogenesis of neonataljaundice and their importance as anaggravating factor in the development ofjaundice due to erythroblastosis.  these newlydeveloped concepts may have therapeuticimplications on which the author willreport at a later date.
