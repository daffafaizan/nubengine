4790. metal chelates as potential reactivators of organic phosphate poisonedacetylcholinesteraseas part of a study to investigate metal chelates as possible reactivatorsof phosphate poisoned acetylcholinesterase, it is shown that chelates actas inhibitors of the enzyme.  in addition, copper and nickel chelates of2-pyridinealdoxime catalyze the decomposition of dfp and sarin.  compared to2-pam, however, these chelates are very poor reactivators, probably becauseof an improper alignment of the oxine oxygen in the chelate-enzyme complex.
