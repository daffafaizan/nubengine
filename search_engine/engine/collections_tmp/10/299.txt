244. oxygen tension in human malignant disease under hyperbaricconditionsoxygen tensions were recorded continuouslyin tumours and normal tissues of 34 pa-tients pressurized in pure oxygen to 4 atmospheresabsolute.  mean rises to 620 mm.hg and 320 mm. hg for tumours and normal tissuesrespectively were recorded.with patients breathing air at atmosphericpressure 22/90 (24%) of tumour elec-trodes registered po2values of less than 4 mm. hgcompared to only 2/39 (5%) of normaltissue electrodes.  the results obtainedsuggest that oxygen polarography as a meth-od for determining po2 in 'solid' tissuesin vivo is complicated by many artefacts -particularly tissue damage due to electrodetrauma - which reduce its value to clin-ical research concerned with accurateinformation of absolute po2 values in intacttissues.
