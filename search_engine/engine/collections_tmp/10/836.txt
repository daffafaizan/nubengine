volkmann's ischaemiavolkmann's ischaemia is the name given to a sequenceof events originally described by volkmann in 1881.basically the condition consists of the replacement ofthe limb flexor muscles by fibrous tissue following injury orocclusion of the main arterial supply of blood to thesemuscles.  the condition is rare fortunately--mainly becauseof improved methods of prevention.  the flexor muscles ofthe toes are sometimes affected, but the commonest group ofmuscles so damaged are the flexor muscles of the forearm.total arterial occlusion to a limb for several hours usuallycauses frank gangrene; partial or total occlusion for shorterperiods may give rise to ischaemic contracture.  the muscles,being deprived of their blood supply, die and are sub-sequently replaced by fibrous tissue.  like all scars, the fibroustissue contracts, producing the complete picture ofvolkmann's ischaemic contracture.  the forearm is thin andwasted, and the fingers are held in flexion owing to theoverall shortening of the flexor muscles.  in severe cases, ifthe nerves are also affected or if the entire muscle mass isreplaced by fibrosis, the fingers may be totally paralysedas well.
