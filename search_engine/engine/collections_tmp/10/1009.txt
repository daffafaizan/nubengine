the pathology of 'giant cell hepatitis' in early infancy.a 1-month-old male infant was admitted tohospital because of acute cardiac andcirculatory failure.  autopsy revealed macronodularliver cirrhosis with splenomegaly,left ventricular dilatation of the heart,hydrothorax, and ascites.  histologyof the liver showed a giant cell hepatitis.  theportal areas were widened, with fociof erythropoiesis and histiocytic infiltrations.the liver cells showed vacuolar anddegenerative changes.  the giant cells, presentin the margin of the regenerationareas, as well as in the degenerated lobuleshas irregular borders and varied insize from 45-60 ft.  their nuclei were large,sometimes bizarre.  their basophilecytoplasm showed granules of iron pigmentwhich was also found in some normalhepatic cells, in the prominent kupffer cellsand in the connective tissue.  in thespleen there were proliferation of connectivetissue and scattered areas of erythropoiesis,as well as pigment deposits in the pulpa.iron pigment was also found in thepancreas and salivary glands.  the islets oflangerhans were hyperplastic.  the etiologyof giant cell hepatitis is still unknown.its pathogenesis may be due to a malformation,immunologic response to some typeof antibody, inborn errors of ironmetabolism and viral infection.  it is suggestedthat the giant cell transformation isa response of the immature liver cell to a varietyof stimuli.  this case is of interestfor the predominance of giant cells with 1 or2 nuclei, presumably it is an intermediatestage or a variant of hepatitis.
