pulmonary vascular plexiform lesion pathogenetic studies .an attempt was made to test the theory that in pulmonary arterialhypertension, the plexiform lesion is a jet lesion beyond points ofarterial stenosis resulting from nonspecific intimal thickening .in 39 subjects with such congenital communications as are associatedwith pulmonary arterial hypertension, the lungs were studiedhistologically . in each, there was an additional element of pulmonaryvenous obstruction . it is likely that in the absence of pulmonaryvenous obstruction, adult patients with only the congenitalcommunication would have developed plexiform lesions .in the three adult patients in the study, no plexiform lesions wereidentified . among the 36 infants or children, one subject showedplexiform lesions, a 53-day-old girl with mitral atresia, ventricularseptal defect, and patent ductus arteriosus .while the findings in the three adult subjects support the theoryregarding the genesis of plexiform lesions, the findings in the oneinfant with plexiform lesions appear to contradict it .
