growth and survival of mycoplasma neurolyticum in liquid media.maximal growth of m. neurolyticum (between10 and 10 colony-forming units/ml)was obtained after 3 days of incubationat 36 c in broth media containing 10% agamahorse serum.  when whole horse serumwas used in the medium, a complement-mediatedinhibition was observed.  thisinhibition could only be detected when growthwas followed by daily plate counts.  maximalgrowth was delayed for about 24 hr bythe horse serum, and the inhibition wasspontaneously reversed at the temperatureof incubation.  penicillin g was also foundto have a temporary inhibitory effect.this was detected with as little as 40 units/ml.maximal growth was delayed untilthe 6th day of incubation, when 200 units/mlwas present, and until the 16th day,when 1,000 units/ml was present.  thesurvival of m. neurolyticum at undetectablelevels in cultures during the incubationperiod presented an 'eclipse' phenomenonwhich has not been explained.  the recrudescenceof growth in such cultures late inthe incubation period illustrates the eventswhich may occur when mycoplasmas areisolated from clinical material by prolongedincubation in the presence of inhibitorssurvival data showed that m. neurolyticumhad greatest stability at ph 8.0, withreduced viability at ph 9.0, 7.0, 10.0, and6.0, in that order.  the data on growthand stability suggest a close relationshipbetween the species of mycoplasma studiesand bacteria.
