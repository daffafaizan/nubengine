twins discordantfor early infantile autisma pair of heterozygous twins discordantfor early infantile autism is reported and therelevant literature reviewed.  although mani-fest organic factors were ruled out, the twins'physical development was different.  a spe-cific emotional etiology was not demon-strated.  the few available twin studies offerfindings consistent with the hypothesis thatgenetic factors are relevant to the develop-ment of childhood autism.  evidence is alsopresented that impaired acquisition of lan-guage may have hereditary determinants.a second set of probably homozygoustwins are reported who were also discordantfor autism.  this second case suggests that,although genetic factors may play a part, insome cases the syndrome of infantile autismappears to be a reversible one.  in view ofthis set of twins and of kanner's sibling data,the role of genetic factors remains obscure,and more twin studies properly documentedwith blood typing are needed.
