1751. on the subunits of a-crystallina-crystallin was isolated from totalwater-soluble lens extract by preparative zoneelectrophoresis on starch or pevikonc870 blocks and purified by density gradientcentrifugation and sephadex chromatography.these preparations were treated withurea or sodium dodecyl sulphate andsubmitted to electrophoresis on polyacrylamidegels containing either urea or sodiumdodecyl sulphate.  whereas in 7 m urea a largenumber of zones was detected, onlythree bands were observed in 1% sodium dodecylsulphate.  on the other hand, thesedimentation coefficient had the same value in bothmedia.  the authors re-investigated then-terminal amino acid content in the starch blockpreparations and compared the resultwith that obtained from the preparations isolatedaccording to their new procedure.  theconcentration of dinitrophenyl-glutamic acidwas lower in the purified samples.urea-treated samples had the same concentrationof n-terminal glutamic acid whereasthe concentration of the 'trace' end-groups didnot change.  sedimentation-diffusionequilibrium in the analytical ultracentrifugerevealed a slight heterogeneity in thepurified samples.  electron micrographs ofelectrophoretic and of further purifiedsamples were very similar.  at neutral orslightly alkaline ph they showed almostuniform spherical aggregates in which asubstructure was observed.  at acid ph,coiled filaments rather than small globulescould be demonstrated.
