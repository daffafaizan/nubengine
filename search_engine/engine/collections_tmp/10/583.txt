hyperplastic lesions of mouse mammaryglands after treatment with 3-methyl-cholanthrenehyperplastic lesions were present in the mammary glands ofmice treated with 3-methylcholanthrene and exogenous hormones.  thelesions were similar to those found in glands that were exposed to mammarytumor virus.  it is probable that the production of mammary gland hyper-plastic lesions could serve as a measure of the effectiveness of a chemicalcompound as a carcinogenic agent for the mammary gland.
