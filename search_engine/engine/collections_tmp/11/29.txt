selectivity of protein excretion in patients with the nephrotic syndrome.with a gel diffusion precipitin technique and commercially preparedantisera, urine/plasma ratios of specific proteins were determined .individual protein clearances, expressed as a percentage of transferrinclearance, were plotted as ordinates against respective molecularweights on a log-log graph . a straight line was evident graphically,its constants were estimated by the method of least squares, and theslope, expressed as , was determined . the slope of the line may be saidto express the degree of glomerular selectivity to protein excretion .sixty-five determinations were performed in 48 patients . 45 satisfyingthe usual criteria of the nephrotic syndrome .1) those patients with primary renal disease and the nephroticsyndrome who displayed high selectivity types of proteinuria ( greaterthan the average for the group + 1 sd) usually respond initially tosteroid therapy, regardless of the acute or subacute glomerular changesobserved on renal biopsy .2) those patients with chronic renal disease and the nephroticsyndrome display an average and frequently a low selectivity type ofproteinuria .3) there appears to be no characteristic type of selectivity for agiven pathologic group of patients with the nephrotic syndrome .4) the degree of selective protein excretion is not related to thetotal daily amount of protein being excreted at any one time and remainsfairly constant despite fluctuation in the amount of protein beingexcreted .5) there is a slight correlation of borderline significance betweenthe degree of selective protein excretion and the duration of thedisease, and the initial para-aminohippuric acid clearance .6) a statistically significant correlation exists between the initialblood urea nitrogen or inulin clearance and the selectivity type ofprotein excretion . those patients who were not azotemic and hadinitially near-normal inulin clearances had an average selectivity typeor better .7) it is suggested that if the adult patient is initially azotemic andhas a grossly abnormal inulin clearance, response to therapy isunlikely, whereas if the blood urea nitrogen is normal and the inulinclearance is near normal, response to therapy cannot be predicted withany degree of accuracy . further studies of adult patients with thenephrotic syndrome are required to substantiate this premise .
