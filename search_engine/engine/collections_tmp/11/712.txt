hydrocephalus: changes in formation and absorptionof cerebrospinal fluid within thecerebral ventriclesformation, flow and absorption ofcerebrospinal fluid were measured in normaland progressively hydrocephalic dogs bysteady-state studies during ventricular per-fusion.  the formation of cerebrospinal fluidwas found to be constant, independent ofhydrostatic pressure, and unaffected by thedevelopment of hydrocephalus.  the normaldog produced 0.016 ml. cerebrospinal fluid/min. in the lateral ventricles, 0.011 ml. cere-brospinal fluid/min. in the 4th ventricle and0.20 ml. cerebrospinal fluid/min. in the sub-arachnoid space.  the intraventricular forma-tion of fluid was calculated to be 0.24 ml.cerebrospinal fluid/min./gm. of choroidplexus, and 0.3x10-3 ml. cerebrospinal fluid/min./cm.2 of ependymal surface.absorption of cerebrospinal fluid wasfound to take place within the ventricles aswell as in the subarachnoid spaces.  the re-sistance to absorption of cerebrospinal fluidin the normal ventricle was much higher thanin the hydrocephalic ventricle.  the decreasein resistance occurred as the ventricularvolume increased and the ependyma becameflattened so that in chronic hydrocephalusthe resistance was not significantly differentthan in the normal dog.  the theory of re-stricted diffusion was applied to the data tocalculate the diffusive permeabilities of crea-tinine and urea, and from this the mean poreradius within the ventricle.using formation of cerebrospinal fluidand data on absorption, the hydrocephalicanimals could not be distinguished from thenormal with sufficient accuracy to suggestusing this as a clinical test.  the reason forthis is that intraventricular pressure hasalways been considered as if it were constantwhen, in fact, it is changing constantly.  theproblem of ventricular enlargement concernsthe ability of the craniospinal contents toadjust to and absorb the small but very rapidchanges in intracranial contents that occurwith each beat of the pulse.
