on language disorders in young children: a reorganization of thinkingcurrent questions and confusions aboutthe use of the term aphasia with referenceto young children seem often toreflect semantic problems accruingfrom professional habits of thinking interms of etiologic and pathologic labels.it is argued that if the term aphasia isgeneralized simply to refer to inabilitiesor interferences in the development oflanguage comprehension and use, thenit is the task of an evaluating group todescribe as well as possible, and in detail,the specific impairments of functionin each child.  this task commonlyrequires the use of an extensive periodof "diagnostic teaching," wherein careis taken to explore which sensory andmotor modalities are working andwhich are not, and whether integrationof various stimuli is taking place.some current ideas are discussed withreference to descriptions of impairment,causal factors that are fairly unique inchildhood, some thoughts about theneurophysiology of the human "languagesystem," and some psychosocialfactors important for language-learning.special attention is given to various relations,in terms of temporal resolvingpower, between sensation and sensoryintegration.  a scheme, or model, is suggestedwhich may prove fruitful forexperimental design in attacking someof these problems at a prelanguage orpremeaning level.  it is argued that theproportion of "unknowns" can be reducedby careful study based on informationabout impaired functions within the sensory-integrative-motor complex,without particular regard for "site andextent of lesion."
