cortisone and atypical pulmonary /epithelial/ hyperplasia furtherstudies including electron microscopy, tissue culture, animaltransplantation and long term observations .previous work in rabbits showed that there was a proliferation ofcells within pulmonary alveoli following intratracheal injection ofnitric acid and that the proliferation was greatly enhanced by theadministration of cortisone to the animals .electron microscopic observations indicated that these weremorphologically large alveolar lining cells . tissue culture studies ofdamaged and normal lung with and without cortisone showed no evidencefor a direct effect of the drug on the proliferation of these cells .this observation, together with the knowledge that fibrosis wasdelayed in the cortisone treated animals, support the thesis that thecortisone effect is an indirect one . transplantation of damaged lungtissue to hamster cheek pouch failed to reveal evidence of growth .within the period of observation (99 to 420 days) there was evidencethat the proliferation subsided considerably and no neoplasms developed
