on early infantile psychosis.the symbiotic and autistic syndromesin conclusion, i wish to state that thecore of child psychosis mustbe sought in one or the other of thedescribed distortions of the sym-biotic phase.  in the first case, what layat the heart of the psychotic dis-turbance was the marked emotionalunavailability of the mother,which alternated with a purely physicalextreme closeness during thebreast-feeding situations, and particularlywith the destructiveness ofthe mother's unpredictable rage attacks.the contrasting experiencesdrove the child to the autistic wardingoff of any human contact andthe de-animation of the world of reality.constitutional factors couldnot, in this case, be evaluated with anydegree of accuracy.in the second case, it was, by contrast,the mother's ever-presencethat created an unendurable instrusionupon and interference withthe structuralization of the budding ego,which constitutionally andperhaps predispositionally may have beenvery vulnerable.  this madeit impossible for the infant to experiencethe normal alternation ofthe gratification-frustration sequences athis own pace; it also madethe process of individuation in theseparation-individuation periodone which was beset with abysmal panic.in both instances, we can see that it wasprimarily in the severe dis-tortions of the normal symbiosis that thechild psychosis had its roots.
