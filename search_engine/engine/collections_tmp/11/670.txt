cell proliferation in compensatory renal growthrats with one kidney removed showed a progressive increase in weight of theremaining kidney over a six-week period.autoradiographic and radiochemical studies with 3h-thymidine indicated that theincrease in new kidney cell formation was maximal forty-eight to seventy-twohours after unilateral nephrectomy.  this early response was chiefly due to theproduction of new cells by the renal cortical tubules.  normal rates of tubulecell turnover were achieved two weeks after operation.  the glomerular tuftscontained fewer new cells and their peak production was delayed to theone-week period with a slow decline thereafter.rats forty-eight hours after unilateral nephrectomy were chosen as a model tostudy the effect of various substances on the magnitude of new cell formation.the number of dna-synthesising cells in the stimulated kidney was reduced bytreatment with hydrocortisone, acth, 9,10-dimethyl-1,2-benzanthracene, and1,2-benzanthracene; the numbers were increased by the administration ofdeoxycorticosterone and aldosterone.
