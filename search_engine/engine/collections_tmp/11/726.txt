gastrointestinalulceration and centralnervous system lesionsthere is both a real and an apparent in-crease in the incidence of severe gastroin-testinal ulceration due to central nervouslesions.  some of this increased incidencereflects recently devised iatrogenic measuresincluding new drugs and surgical therapy.in adults, cerebrovascular lesions are thecommonest single cause of acute peptic ul-ceration found at autopsy.  in children, wefound 25 instances of upper gastrointestinalulceration due to central nervous system le-sions in 1,750 autopsies.  two general ana-tomical categories could be recognized: acuteulceration and malacias.a variety of causative central nervous sys-tem lesions was responsible in these 25 cases,the commonest being bacterial meningitis.other causes were poliomyelitis, brain tu-mor, hydrocephalus, etc.theories of pathogenesis are presented.more experience with both drug and surgicaltherapy is needed.  the recent developmentof local freezing techniques offers promisefor reduction of mortality.
