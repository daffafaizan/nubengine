visual neglect .clinical trainees in nursing and in psychology from boston college andsimmons college, boston, mass., collected data and observed patientsunder the direction of the authors in a pilot program designed tomeasure visual spatial neglect and to develop rehabilitative material .these measurements and exercises might also be used by nurses in theircare of those patients who have had cerebral vascular accidents .the diversity of daily activities in which the patient becomesinvolved during his hospitalization should provide some indication ofthe extent to which the compensatory visual neglect therapeutics havebeen effective . more formal estimates can be obtained byre-administering the battery of visual neglect tests at periodicintervals . nursing personnel adopting a program of therapeutics such asthis must bear in mind that patients suffering cerebral insult areusually less adaptive than their nonbrain-injured peers . they developnew habit patterns slowly and regression often will follow apparentfixation at a more adaptive level of response habituation(11) . however,experimental inquiry has shown that the dimension of behavioraldifference between the brain-injured adults and normal adults is one ofdegree rather than kind -dash a difference that skilled nursing canoften reduce(12) .
