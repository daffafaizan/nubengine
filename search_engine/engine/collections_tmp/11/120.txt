early effects of digitalis on central hemodynamics in normal subjects .the intravenous administration of lanatoside c in 7 normal subjectshad the following effects..1. an early significant reduction of heart rate .2. a significant transient reduction of cardiac output .3. a significant increase of the stroke volume initially accompaniedby a significant rise of the end-diastolic volume with unchangedsystolic rate of emptying . the increase of end-diastolic volume seemsto be related to the lengthening of the diastolic filling period . lateron, the systolic emptying rate increases, and the ventricular volumesdecrease, suggesting an inotropic effect of the drug .4. a significant increase of pulmonary blood volume, parallel to theincrease of the stroke volume, suggestive of a passive relation betweenthe two variables .
