the relationship between vitamin d and parathyroidhormonemarit von stedingkthe effect of parathyroidectomy and parathy-roid hormone administration upon the concentra-tions of plasma calcium and phosphate have beenmeasured in vitamin d-deficient rats and the re-sults compared to those observed in d-fed ani-mals.  also, the influence of dietary calcium andphosphate content upon these responses has beeninvestigated.  parathyroidectomy in the d-fed ani-mal results in a rapid fall in plasma calcium and abiphasic plasma phosphate response with an initialfall followed by a striking rise.  in contrast,parathyroidectomy in the d-deficient rat is fol-lowed by no significant change in plasma calciumand an immediate rise in plasma phosphate thatcan be prevented by the administration of para-thyroid hormone.  dietary phosphate restrictionabolished the effect of parathyroidectomy in bothgroups of animals.administration of a dose of 500 u of hormoneto the intact d-deficient rat had little influenceupon plasma calcium; a dose of 2,000 u did in-crease plasma calcium.  a dose of 25 u was suffi-cient to increase the plasma calcium of the d-fedanimal.  these results are discussed in relationto the effects of vitamin d and parathyroid hor-mone upon mitochondrial metabolism.
