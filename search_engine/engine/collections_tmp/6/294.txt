82. central nervous system lesions in ratsexposed to oxygen at high pressureadult female rats paralyzed by repeated exposuresto oxygen at high pressure were found to have cns le-sions of 2 types  (1) focal necrosis of individual neuronswithin certain nuclear groups, and (2) complete or partialnecrosis of nuclear groups with frequent damage to mye-lin, axons, and glia in the area involved.  both typeswere usually bilateral and symmetrical.  lesions of thefirst type were found consistently in the superior olivarycomplex, ventral cochlear nuclei, and nuclei of the spinaltract of cranial nerve v.  lesions of the second type werefound consistently in the substantia nigra and globus pal-lidus, were frequent in the rhinencephalon, and neveroccurred in the neocortex.
