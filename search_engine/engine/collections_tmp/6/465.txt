7364. experimental amyloidosis in immunitymuch of interest in the mechanism ofexperimental amyloidosis as a result of theparenteral introduction of foreign proteinhas been centered around the nature ofthe links leading to cytological and biochemicalchanges in tissues and body fluids.some of the authors suggested that such linksmay be of immunological nature.there is however, no clear-cut proof eitherin favor of or against the theory of animmunological origin of amyloid.  sinceinjection of proteins during the perinatalperiod prevents an immune response whenthe animal is subsequently challengedwith the same antigen, the authors studiedamyloidosis caused by casein in micetreated after birth with this protein.  miceexposed soon after birth to casein ac-quire an immune tolerance to this antigen.this was demonstrated by the absenceof circulating antibodies as measured by thedisappearance of i-labeled caseinfrom the circulation and by means of passivehemagglutination tests with asciticfluids.  both tolerant and control animalsdeveloped amyloidosis to the same extent.the results imply that the pathogenesis ofamyloidosis does not rest upon a classicimmunological basis; they do not excludethe possibility, that the disease may bedue to some auto-immune process.
