intradermal test using cobalt chloride .selected groups of patients with cobalt allergy and nickel allergy aswell as normal controls were tested intradermally with cobalt chloridein the dilutions 10 to 10 . reactions of the wheal and flare type appearduring the first hours and make the 24-hour reading misleading . thepapular response to cobalt chloride 10, when read 48 to 96 hours afterthe injection, appears to be a reliable test for cobalt allergy .patients with combined nickel-cobalt allergy were excluded from thestudy, and the question of group reactions is not discussed . nickelallergics give a somewhat stronger reaction than controls to theslightly impure cobalt chloride . it would be preferable if the degreeof purity of the cobalt chloride were ten times greater .
