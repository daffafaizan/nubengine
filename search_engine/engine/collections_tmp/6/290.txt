4181. cerebrospinal fluid in man native to high altitudecsf ph was shown in a prior report toremain essentially constant during 8 daysof acclimatization to 3,800 m.  in orderto further evaluate the possible role ofcsf acid-base equilibria in the regulationof respiration, 20 peruvian andean na-tives were studied at altitudes of 3,720-4,820 m.in 10 subjects at 3,720 m, meanswere  csf ph 7.327, pco, 43, hco3-21.5,na+136, k+2.6, cl-124, lactate 30 mg/100 ml.  arterial blood  ph 7.43, pco, 32.5,hco3-21.3, na+136, k+4.2, cl-107,hematocrit 49, sao, 89.6.  in 6 subjects at4,545 m and 4 at 4,820 m csf valueswere not significantly different; mean arterialpco, was 32.6 and 32.3, respectively.the only significant variations with altitudewere the expected lowering of pao, to47 and 43.5 mm hg, and of sao, to 84.2 and80.7, and increase of hematocrit to67% and 75%, respectively.  the nativesdiffered from recently acclimatized sea-level residents in showing less ventilation(higher pco,) in response to the ex-isting hypoxia, and less alkaline arterialblood.  the difference appears to relateto peripheral chemoreceptor responseto hypoxia rather than central medullarychemoreceptor.
