hypoglycemia and dwarfism associated with the isolateddeficiency of growth hormone.the authors have studied a 7-year-old dwarfedboy with a history of severe, recurrenthypoglycemic episodes since age 1 andretarded bone age.  hepatic, adrenal,and thyroid function were normal.  he demonstratedfasting hypoglycemia with bloodsugars of 30-40 mg./100 ml.  he was not sensitiveto l-leucine but showed insulinsensitivity and hypoglycemic unresponsiveness.glycogenolysis in response to bothadrenaline and glucagon was appropriate.  fastingplasma gh levels were less than1 m g./ml. (normal 1-3), and no rise was seenafter insulin-induced hypoglycemia.similarly, these low gh levels did not rise 3-6hr.  after a glucose tolerance test.treatment with hgh reversed the alterationsin carbohydrate metabolism.  it isconcluded that the patient suffered from an isolatedgh deficiency which resulted indwarfism and alterations in carbohydrate metabolism.
