actinomycin and erythropoiesis and the production of erythropoietin inmice.in b6d2f female mice a single dose of 10of actinomycin will suppress normalerythropoiesis (fe erythrocyte uptake).  inpolycythemic mice 2 is enough toprevent the stimulatory effect of 0.25 a unitsof erythropoietin.  the curves of suppressionand recovery versus time support thehypothesis that erythropoietin actsfor a short time in an early stage oferythropoiesis; after this early stage developingcells are no longer so sensitive to actinomycin.recovery, even from repeateddoses, is rapid and adequate.  amounts ofactinomycin which are adequate to abolisherythropoiesis do not prevent the new appearanceof erythropoietin in the plasma ofhypoxic mice.
