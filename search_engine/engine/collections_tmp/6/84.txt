heparin levels during and after hypothermic perfusion .1. perfusion-temperature influences the rate of heparin-loss duringextracorporeal circulation, and therefore, the requirement ofre-heparinization .2. heparin half-lives of approximately 13/4 hours and 21/2 hours werecalculated during perfusions conducted at average temperatures of 31.5and 22.6 c. respectively .3. the rate of heparin-loss during extracorporeal circulation isinconstant in an individual, and variable between individuals, so thatexact neutralization requires an accurate estimation of the heparinconcentration present at the end of perfusion .4. the protamine titration test provides a crude but simple andsatisfactory means of monitoring free-heparin levels .5. complete neutralization of heparin is an important factor inminimizing postoperative blood losses .6. protamine is a less efficient neutralizing agent than polybrene atthe same dosage level . it may be most effective in divided dosage .7. /rebound/ was detected in 5 of 45 cases studied, although in onlyone instance was it of a degree likely to be significant .8. significant prolongation of the clotting-time resulting from excessneutralizing agent, was not evident in this study .
