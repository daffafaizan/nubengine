cineradiographic comparison of normal to noncleft subjects with velopharyngealinadequacycineradiographic studies of the normal subjects were compared withstudies of noncleft subjects who demonstrated velopharyngeal inadequacy.the following conclusions were made: a) there was a significant differencebetween soft palate length in normals and the velopharyngeal inadequacygroup.  b) there was not a significant difference between depth of nasopharynxin normal and the velopharyngeal inadequacy group.  c) thedifference of the means of the soft palate length and depth of nasopharynxbetween the normals and velopharyngeal inadequacy group was significant.d) the thickness of the soft palate was greater in the normal than theabnormal group.  e) in 70% of the normal and velopharyngeal inadequacygroups the height of soft palate elevation was above the palatal plane.   f)in 80% of the normal group the height of velopharyngeal closure tookplace below the palatal plane.  none of the subjects in the velopharyngealinadequacy group obtained velopharyngeal closure.  g) there was no significantcorrelation between amount of gap and voice quality.  h) there wasno significant correlation between amount of gap and intelligibility ofspeech.  i) there was a difference between vital capacity readings for thevelopharyngeal inadequacy group with nose occluded and unoccluded.  j)the correlation coefficient between quality judgment and intelligibilityjudgment was highly significant.
