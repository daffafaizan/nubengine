9787. changes in developmental quotient under two conditions of maternalseparation.developmental scales wereadministered to 2 groups of infants during and sub-sequent to a temporary period of institutionalization.although both groups experienced maternal separa-tion, only 1 group was subjected to deprivation, inthat it received very much less stimulation than theother.  results from a longitudinal testing programshow that the scores of the deprived group duringthe period of separation were significantly lower thanthose of the nondeprived group, no progressive de-terioration of scores took place in the course ofinstitutionalization, immediately following returnhome, while the scores of the nondeprived group re-mained constant, those of the deprived infants jumpedto the level of the other group.  3 theories regardingthe mechanism underlying the association betweendeprivation and developmental retardation are exam-ined and it is suggested that an explanation in moti-vational terms best fits the results obtained.
