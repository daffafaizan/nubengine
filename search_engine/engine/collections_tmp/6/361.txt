375. hemianopsia and glaucomaafter a discussion of the bibliographic references to the few observations onthe simultaneous occurrence of hemianopsias and glaucoma the author states onthe basis of his experiences the following points  homonymous hemianopsiasoccasionally take place in glaucoma, although no direct relation can beestablished between the former and the glaucoma.  it has to be pointed out,however, that in other older patients, for example in those with retinaldetachment, neuritis, etc. who are likewise subjected to repeated and exactperimetry, such hemianopsias do not occur, or are to be found at a lesser ratethan in glaucoma.  a homonymous hemianopsia has to be taken into considerationalso in the event of a sudden impairment of the visual field in a glaucomatouspatient or when the hemianopic defect supervenes in addition to the visualfield defect due to glaucoma.  in cases of binasal hemianopsia, thesimultaneous presence of glaucoma is not a rare incident.  whether thebinasal hemianopsia is the result of the gradual development of aglaucomatous visual field with nasal defects or whether it constitutes anindependent symptom to a certain extent, cannot always be clarifiedin the individual case.  obviously the condition of the basal cerebralvessels plays a certain role in the development of glaucoma, even ifthis role cannot be clearly defined as yet.  in cases ofbinasal hemianopsia, a glaucoma has to be ruled out before radical diagnosticand therapeutic measures are carried out.
