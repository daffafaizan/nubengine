cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in the arnold-chiari malformation.a method using radio-iodinated serum albuminto measure the volume of the ventricularsystem, and the rate of disappearanceof csf from the lateral ventricles, hasbeen described.  newborn infants with a rateof flow less than 70 ml. /24 hr. aftersurgical repair of the myclomeningocelewill develop progressive hydrocephalusrequiring a ventriculo-atrial shunt.  thetest can be used to detect the patency of aventriculo-atrial shunt, and may allow saferemoval of the shunt in selected patients.
