5196. effects of nutritional deficiency of unsaturated fats onthe distribution of fatty acids in rat liver mitochondrial phospholipidsthe fatty acid composition of liver mitochondrialphospholipids from rats rendereddeficient in essential unsaturated fatty acidshas been determined, and comparedwith that of rats fed a diet containing corn oil.in addition to marked reductions inthe amounts of linoleic and arachidonic acidsesterified at the b-position of ethanol-amine-, inositol-, and choline glycerophosphatides,the deficiency resulted in ex-tensive changes in the distribution of saturatedacids at both the a- and b-positions.palmitoleic and oleic acids were increased inamount in fat deficiency, and largeamounts of docosatrienoic acids appeared inthese 3 phospholipids.  the fatty acidsof the sphingomyelins were not altered as aresult of essential fatty acid deficiency.the data demonstrate that each phospholipidis unique in the way in which its fattyacid moieties change in response to feedinga fat deficient diet.
