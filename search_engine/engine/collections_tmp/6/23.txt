renal amyloidosis a clinicopathological study .the clinical and histopathological data from 40 cases of renalamyloidosis diagnosed by percutaneous renal biopsy are presented .twenty-two cases were labelled as 'secondary' amyloidosis, as definiteaetiological factors responsible for renal amyloidosis could bediscovered . the predisposing disease states leading to amyloid depositsin the kidney in the order of frequency were fibrocaseous pulmonarytuberculosis, bronchiectasis, lung abscess, and ileocaecal tuberculosisfive cases were labelled as suspected 'primary' amyloidosis as adefinite evidence of the predisposing disease could not be obtainedalthough the skiagram of chest revealed minimal healed foci . no causecould be determined in thirteen cases, which were, therefore, labelledas 'primary' amyloidosis .albuminuria was a constant feature in all the cases and 32 casespresented as nephrotic syndrome . the rest of the cases presented withhypertension or renal failure in addition to albuminuria .the ancillary procedure, viz., congo-red test, gingival and liverbiopsies proved to be of limited value in the diagnosis of renalamyloidosis .the importance of percutaneous renal biopsy as a diagnostic tool hasbeen emphasised .
