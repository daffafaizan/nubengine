congenital heart disease, deaf-mutism and associated somatic malformationsoccurring in several members of one familym.d. and patrick h. lehan, m.d.a unique family is described in which themother and four of her eight children have pulmonarystenosis.  two of the four affected childrenare deaf-mutes; one of these has, in additionto the pulmonary valvular stenosis, idiopathichypertrophic subaortic stenosis.  all the affectedchildren had several associated somatic malformations.genetic and nongenetic factors andtheir role in the development of the malformationsare discussed.  it is suggested that the cardiacdefect is transmitted by a single non-sex-linkedgenetic factor (dominant autosomalinheritance).  in the presence of a normal karyotypeit appears that a single dose of either apoint mutation, or a small deletion or translocationis the most likely cause.
