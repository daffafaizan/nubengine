studies in sickle cell anemia xxi. clinico-pathological aspects ofneurological manifestations .neurologic manifestations are frequent in patients who have sicklecell disease . these manifestations may be the earliest presenting signsand symptoms and they are so variable that the patient may beerroneously diagnosed as having conditions such as meningitis,poliomyelitis, subdural hematoma, neoplasm, subarachnoid hemorrhage,lead encephalitis, subacute bacterial endocarditis, and congenitalmalformations of the brain . furthermore, development of thesemanifestations cannot be predicted on the basis of the type of crisisinvolved .prognosis following neurological involvement is unpredictable, butrecurrent episodes, together with abnormal electroencephalographicreadings suggest a poor outcome . such patients die or are the victimsof rather severe neurological deficits .neurological examination of these patients suggests diffuseinvolvement of the cerebral hemispheres . examination of thepathological material, however, often fails to reveal thromboses . thestriking findings are infarcts in the white matter and perivascularhemorrhages .the thesis that the abnormal neurological findings in these patientsare actually due to sickle cell disease is supported by the fact thatall such symptoms appear in association with clinical circumstancesknown to induce sickling . these include surgery and anesthesia, feverand infection .
