1066. the effect of lymphoid cells fromthe lymph of specifically immunised sheepon the growth of primary sarcomata inratsthe growth of primary fibrosarcomata induced inrats with 3:4-benzpyrene was retarded by the injectionof lymphocytes obtained from the efferent duct of alymph node in a sheep immunized with a piece of thetumor to be treated.  the action of the heterologous lym-phocytes was specific to the particular tumor used forimmunization suggesting that reaction against tumor-specific antigens is involved.  the cells responsible arebelieved to be medium-sized pyroninophilic lymphocyteswhich may stimulate the immune system of the host toreact against the autochthonous tumor.
