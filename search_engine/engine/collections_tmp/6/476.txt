1361. the mechanism of histidase induction and formation in bacillus subtilisthe role of the inducer, l-histidine, in thesynthesis of histidase (l-histidine am-monia lyase) in b. subtilis was investigated.it was found that induced cells poisonedwith actinomycin, an inhibitor of rna synthesis,lose their capacity for the forma-tion of a protein precursor of histidase at a ratewhich is independent of the presenceor absence of the inducer.  these results showthat the inducer does not increasethe intracellular level of histidase-specificmessenger rna by preventing the des-truction of the major portion of this material,the fraction that is engaged in pro-tein synthesis.  the possibility has not beenexcluded that the inducer exerts itseffect by bringing about the stabilization ofthe messenger rna that is still attachedto dna or has not yet become attached toribosomes.  alternatively, the inducer mayactually stimulate the synthesis ofhistidase-specific messenger rna.  the conver-sion of the precursor to active enzymeappears to involve polymerization of mono-mers, rather than the release ofribosome-bound inactive enzyme.
