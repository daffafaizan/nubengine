histological research on the lens in condition of hypoxia, changes inthe mitotic activity of the epithelium .the effect of hypoxia on the mitotic activity of the cells of the lensepithelium was studied in 24 rats of the same strain and weight . thehypoxia was obtained in the decompression chamber .the results show that the mitotic activity of the lens epithelium isdepressed at any of the examined altitudes (6.500, 8.000, 9.500 m),. inparticular, a marked reduction in the number of the prophases and anaccumulation in metaphase was observed .the results were examined from the statistical standpoint anddiscussed .
