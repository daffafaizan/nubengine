effects of graded hemorrhage on cardiopulmonary functions of hypothermicdogs .experiments were conducted on anesthetized dogs subjected to moderatehypothermia (28 c.) and then bled in percentages of the estimated bloodvolume . respiratory work was not influenced by the degree of hemorrhagepulmonary ventilation, respiratory rate and tidal volume were notinfluenced significantly as a result of blood withdrawal . physiologicdead space as a percentage of tidal volume increased with hemorrhage .oxygen consumption decreased as the hemorrhage was made more severe,whereas carbon dioxide production was unchanged, indicating a shift inthe respiratory exchange ratio . cardiac output decreased 78 per centfrom control level when 35 per cent of the estimated blood volume waswithdrawn . systemic arterial pressures decreased markedly but heartrate was not changed as a result of blood withdrawal . comparison ofresponses to hemorrhage in hypothermia and normothermia is discussed .
