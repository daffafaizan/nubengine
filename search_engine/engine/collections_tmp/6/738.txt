the periodicity of microfilariae.x. the relation between the circadian temperature cycleof monkeys and the microfilarial cycle.monkeys were used whose blood contained the microfilariae of edesonfilariamalayensis, which has a nocturnal periodicity.artificial lowering of the body temperature during the daytime caused themicrofilaria count in the blood to rise; and artificial raising of the bodytemperature during the night caused it to fall almost to zero, i.e. inversionof the normal circadian temperature rhythm of the body was followed byinversion of the microfilarial rhythm.the hypothesis is put forward that the circadian rhythm of the microfilariaeof e. malayensis (but probably not of the microfilariae of some other species)is entrained by the circadian rhythm of body temperature, which thus providesthe "effective stimuli" to which these microfilariae respond.
