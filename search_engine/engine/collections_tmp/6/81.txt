studies on the compound lipids from x-ray irradiated animal, ii.biological and biochemical properties of the compound lipids in thex-ray irradiated rabbit organs .for the purpose to clarify the causes of x-ray disturbances a seriesof experiments have been conducted on biological and biochemicalproperties of compound lipids extracted from normal and x-ray irradiatedrabbit organs with a special reference to the p -labeled compound lipidsuptake, inhibitory action to l cell proliferation and uncoupling ofoxidative phosphorylation, and the following results have been obtainedthe compound lipids (lysophosphatide rich fraction) isolated from thex-ray irradiated rabbit organ have been found to possess a stronghemolytic action and also an action to inhibit the cell proliferation aswell as to accelerate the respiration of the mitochondria in the rabbitliver and spleen . it has also been proven that they act as to induce amarked swelling of mitochondria, to impede the formation of high energyphosphate as well as to act as an uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylationin vivo . in the test to see the uptake of p -labeled compound lipids byvarious organs, a marked uptake has been observed in spleen, bonemarrow, and liver of both irradiated and non-irradiated groups .further, the uptake of p -labeled compound lipids in the rabbits givenintravenous injections of compound lipid fraction for 30 consecutivedays previously has been found to be greatest in pancreas followed bybone marrow, spleen, liver in the order mentioned in male group, whereasit is greatest in spleen, followed by liver and bone marrow in thefemale group .with these results the discussion was conducted concerning therelation between the lipid metabolism and x-ray disturbances .
