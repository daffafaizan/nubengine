a genetic study of neonatal obstructive jaundice58 children with extrahepatic biliary atresia, 7 with intrahepaticbiliary atresia and 50 with 'neonatal hepatitis' were analysedconcerning diagnostic criteria, natural history, familial, clinicaland pathological data.  in extrahepatic biliary atresia, there is noevidence of a familial tendency, influence of maternal age, birthorder or disturbance of foetal development.  in 'neonatal hepatitis',there were 4 consanguineous parents, suggesting a mutantautosomal gene in homozygous form.  some infants with the genotypefor 'neonatal hepatitis' may manifest a very mild or a very severeform, so, a diagnosis was not made.  an apparent excess of malesover females may be another evidence of failure of manifestation ofthe genotype.  but 'neonatal hepatitis' may be a manifestation ofmore than one disease.  in 'neonatal hepatitis' the birth weightshows a marked decrease, perhaps as a sequence of disturbed liverfunction in the foetus.
