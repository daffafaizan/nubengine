respiratory virus vaccines. ii. mycoplasma pneumoniae (eaton agent)vaccines.purified and concentrated formalin-killed vaccineswere prepared from m. pneumoniae propagated inserum-free artificial medium.  the vaccines wereaqueous or were incorporated in alum or emulsifiedpeanut oil (adjuvant 65) adjuvant.  two or 3 differentconcentrations of mycoplasma were included in eachpreparation.  serum neutralizing and cf antibody responseswere measured in hamsters, monkeys, and ininstitutionalized persons following 1,2,3 and sometimes4 vaccinations.  all of the preparations werehighly antigenic in animals and in man.  alum vaccineswere better than aqueous vaccines and those in adjuvant65 appeared to give best results although the bleedingtimes were not always optimal for demonstratingmaximal effect.  persons who were without detectableantibody initially and thus would be most vulnerable toinfection gave better responses to the vaccine than didthose with pre-existing antibody.  alum vaccine is anacceptable formulation for use in man, and only 2 dosesof such vaccine were necessary to induce neutralizingantibody in 90% of the persons who were initially withoutdetectable antibody.  no local or systemic reactionof clinical consequence was noted in any of the personsvaccinated.  recent unpublished findings, which indicatea high degree of effectiveness of the alum vaccinein stimulating antibody in preschool children and inprotecting children and adults against the natural disease,are mentioned.
