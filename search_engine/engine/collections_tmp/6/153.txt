on the value of thymectomy in adult mice as a means of potentiating theimmunosuppressive action of melphalan (l-phenylalanine mustard) .thymectomy has been found to be ineffective as a means of potentiatingthe immunosuppressive action of melphalan in adult cba-p mice challengedwith a-strain mammary carcinoma transplants . this was true when thethymectomy was performed 2 days, 4 weeks or 7 weeks prior to injectionof a single dose (15 mg/kg body weight) of melphalan, administered 24hours prior to tumour transplantation, and also when thymectomy wascombined with multiple doses of melphalan given before and after tumourtransplantation . these findings are discussed .
