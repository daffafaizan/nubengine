a method for direct demonstration of pleuropneumonia-likeorganisms in cultured cells.direct microscopic observationof pleuropneumonia-like organisms (pplo)in cell cultures is easily accomplished follow-ing hypotonic treatment, air-drying andstaining with orcein.  a rapid technique usingfl human amnion cells, inoculated with su-pernatant from suspected cultures, is de-scribed.  the demonstration of pplo con-tamination of 30 cell lines by this rapidmethod was in complete agreement with re-sults of pplo-agar techniques.
