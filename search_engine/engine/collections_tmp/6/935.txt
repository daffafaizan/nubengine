a study of induced renal hyperplasia using autoradiography.to establish a base line for futureautoradiographic investigations, compensatoryrenal hyperplasia was studied using tritiatedthymidine.  labelled cells were infrequentin the tubular tissues of control kidneys.in the kidneys remaining after unilateralnephrectomy there was a 5- to 6-foldincrease in the cortex and a 12- to 13-foldincrease in the medulla of labelled tubularcells over the numbers seen in controltissues.  the findings obtained here are inagreement with the observations made inearlier investigations with routine methodsof staining and mitotic observation.
