renal and adrenal relationshipsin compensatory hyperplasiathe compensatory renal hyperplasia thatnormally follows unilateral nephrectomyis abolished by bilateral adrenalectomy ifrats are maintained on fresh drinkingwater, but is restored when saline drinkingwater is provided or if such animals areinjected with doca.  the adrenals are alsoimportant for the increased proliferationcaused by unilateral hydronephrosis.  theseexperiments suggest that the role of theadrenal cortex in renal hyperplasia may be tosecrete mineralocorticoids, whichpromote the retention of sodium and therebystimulate cell division in the kidneys.
