cellular proliferation and deoxyribonucleic acidsynthesis in compensating kidneys of miceand the effect of food and waterrestrictioncompensatory enlargement of the kid-ney occurred after unilateral nephrectomyin mice.  fourteen days after the removal ofone kidney the surviving renal tissue                                  6weighed 23 per cent more than single kid-neys from sham-operated animals.  thehyperplastic response of the cortex on thesecond postoperative day was 8 timesgreater than that seen in the same zone ofkidneys from sham-operated animals.  by10 days after surgery the mitotic index ofthe cortex returned to control values.  theouter medulla also underwent hyperplasiabut only on the second day followingunilateral nephrectomy was the increasesignificant.  an increase in mitotic activitywas found in the inner medulla of survivingkidneys, but it was not statistically signifi-cant.both starvation for 48 hours and waterrestriction for 60 hours prevented the hyper-plastic responses in the remaining kidneys2 days after unilateral nephrectomy.  whenwater was given 48 hours after unilateralnephrectomy (after 60 hours of waterrestriction) significant increases in mitoticactivity were noted in the cortex of remain-ing kidneys on the fourth and fifth post-operative days.  however, even after freeaccess to food was allowed (after 48 hourswithout food) no significant increase inmitotic frequency of the remaining kidneywas found.deoxyribonucleic acid synthesis in con-trol kidneys of mice was highest in the cor-tex and lowest in the inner medulla asrevealed by radioautographic studies fol-lowing the injection of tritiated thymidine.two days following removal of one kidneythe labeling index of the cortex of remainingkidneys increased 3-fold.  no statisticallysignificant increases of deoxyribonucleicacid synthesis were noted in either the outeror inner medullary regions of the remainingkidneys.
