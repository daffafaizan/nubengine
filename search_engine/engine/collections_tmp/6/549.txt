the aetiology and treatment ofurinary calculusinvestigations in this laboratory have beenbased on the hypothesis that calculus formation isprimarily a process of crystallization from super-saturated solutions rather than one of adsorptionon a specific protein matrix, as has been postulatedby boyce and his colleagues (boyce and king,1963).  that crystallization is the primary factoris strongly suggested by the recent studies ofvermeulen, lyon and gill (1964).  these authorsproduced artificial concretions which closelyresembled urinary calculi by immersing a rotatingwire loop in normal urine for several days andslowly adding the appropriate stone-formingelements.if the above hypothesis is correct then thefactors of primary interest in urinary stoneformation are those responsible for supersaturation,nucleation and crystal poisoning.  much remainsto be learnt about these various factors, theirinter-relationships, and their relative importance.the significance of the urinary colloids (proteins,muco-proteins and polysaccharides) in calculusformation is still not clear but it is probable thatthey play an important secondary role in bindingcrystalline precipitates to form a non-friablecalculus.  since time is an important factor incrystal growth such non-specific binding byproteins would increase the chances of stonegrowth and retention within the upper urinarytract.
