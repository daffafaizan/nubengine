2570. treatment of canine neoplasms with autogenous vaccinial preparationsinbred mice with transplantable sarcomaand carcinoma were treated with im-plants of their tumours which had beengrown in strains of mice normally resistantto the tumours.  complete regression oftransplantable tumours was noted in 22%of the treated mice and 78% had lifespans double that of untreated controls.one dog with spontaneous scirrhousmammary carcinoma and another withlymphosarcoma were treated with implantsof their own tumours after growth incortisone-treated mice.  regression of thespontaneous neoplasms followed in bothcases.  it is suggested that growth of aneoplasm in a foreign host alters the mole-cular structure of the neoplasm, making itantigenic when returned to the originalhost.  antigens produced are also effectiveagainst the original lesions.
