studies on transformation of syrian hamster cells by simian virus 40(sv40).. acquisition of oncogenicity by virus-exposed cells apparentlyunassociated with the viral genome .lines of syrian hamster lung and liver cells originally exposed asprimary cultures to large doses of sv40 exhibited increased growth rate,high plating efficiency, morphological transformation, and, in someinstances, oncogenic potential after unusually long intervals . in atleast two lines acquisition of oncogenic potential occurredindependently of morphological transformation . in none of a total of 11cell lines studied in detail was conclusive evidence for the presence ofthe sv40 genome obtained .
