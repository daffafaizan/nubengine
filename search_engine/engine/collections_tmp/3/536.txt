2354. isoantigenic properties of tumors transgressing histocompatibilitybarriers of the h-2 systemsublines capable of transgressing h-2 histocompatibilitybarriers have been derivedfrom strictly strain-specific tumors by 1) passagethrough newborn hosts of aforeign genotype; 2) passage through adult h-2incompatible recipients pretreatedwith isoantisera directed against the tumor cells.the nonspecific character inducedby these procedures was usually expressed in anumber of different h-2 incompa-tible recipients.  the changes responsible forthe conversion to nonspecific growthappeared to proceed in a stepwise fashion.expression of the nonspecific characterrequired exposure to the foreign host environmentfor more than 30 days.  at thisstage and during the subsequent 3 transfergenerations, reversion to strain-specificgrowth occurred on back-transfer to thestrain of origin; after 4 passages in theforeign hosts the nonspecific character waspermanently established, however, andcould not be reverted by prolonged passagein the original host genotype.  thegrowth rate of strain-specific tumors andtheir nonspecific sublines was comparedin the strain of origin.  no difference wasfound with one tumor, while the strain-specific line grew better than the nonspecificsublines with another.  this differencewas detected in the homozygous strain oforigin and in different semi-isologous f1hybrids.  all lines grew better in thehomozygous strain than in the f1 hybrids,however.  a comparison was madebetween the concentration of h-2 isoantigenicsurface determinants in strain-specifictumors and their nonspecific sublines by aquantitative absorption technique invitro.  all nonspecific sublines had a lowerconcentration of h-2 isoantigens thanthe strain-specific tumors.  this suggeststhat nonspecific tumors develop as a resultof immunoselection of variants resistantto the homograft reaction and are characterizedby a lowered concentration ofh-2 antigens.
