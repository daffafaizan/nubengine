the meaning of ph at low temperatures during extra-corporeal circulationa review of the temperature gradients occurring during profoundhypothermia is made in regard to acid base changes in general, and to phreadings in particular . it is concluded that terms such as 'body','mean', 'average' and 'core' temperature should be discarded and thatwhen a temperature is quoted it should be referred to the site at whichit was measured .the main circumstances in which blood ph is measured at a temperaturedifferent from that at which the blood is equilibrated with respiratorygases are reviewed by describing the changes which occur duringtonometry experiments . in this way fundamental changes can beunderstood before considering the more complicated sequences of eventstaking place in the living body .the alterations that occur in the concentrations of protein andbicarbonate ion when whole blood is cooled are reviewed, together withtheir influence on 'correction factors' . the reasons why these factorsshould not be applied to blood when the living body is undergoinghypothermia involving the use of an extra-corporeal circulation arediscussed .examples of the numerical values for blood ph during the two mainmethods for producing profound hypothermia, one using autogenous lungperfusion and the other a pump-oxygenator are given, with reference tothe influence of pco2 upon these values .the existing methods of acid-base measurement appear to besufficiently accurate to reflect the metabolic component during profoundhypothermia .
