vergleichende renale phosphatelearance-untersuchungenbeim hyperparathyreoidismus und beim sog.  phosphatdiabetesthe analysis of the function of the kidneys give a contribution tothe pathophysiology of two different diseases of general osteopathieswhose pathogenesis or etiology are still not clear in some points.  thephosphate clearance pre- and postoperative in one patient with hyper-parathyroidism showed that after the removal of the adenoma of theparathyroid the renal reabsorption of phosphate improved only tempo-rary as a secondary form of hyperparathyroidism was already present.in a patient with a "phosphatdiabetes" the clearance examination showedthat under a high dosage of vitamin d the reabsorption of phosphate didnot increase.  based on these results we have not continued therapywith vitamin d which is certainly not indifferent.  comparative renalclearance examinations were carried out in 10 patients which did notshow any disturbances of calcium/phosphate-metabolism.
