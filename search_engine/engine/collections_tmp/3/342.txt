188. studies of nickel carcinogenesis;metastasizing pulmonary tumors in ratsinduced by the inhalation of nickel carbonylin a combined series of studies, 6 out of 409 rats (n.b. only 195 survived formore than 3 wk.) exposed to nickel carbonyl developed pulmonary carcinomawith metastases.  the lesions included the common types of pulmonary cancer,squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and anaplastic carcinoma.  all ofthe pulmonary lesions were found between 24 and 27 mth. after the initialexposure to nickel carbonyl.  the amount of nickel found capable of inducinglung cancer in the rat was comparable to the amount of nickel inhaled bypersons smoking less than 15 cigarettes per day for a period of a year.  themean weight of rats chronically exposed to nickel carbonyl was found to beconsistently less than that of the control rats throughout the entire 3-yearperiod of study.
