mammary growth in rats treated with somatotropin duringpregnancy and/or lactationgroups of rats received dailyinjections of 2 mg somatotropin (sth) fromeither day 3-19 of pregnancy or day 1-13of lactation.  another group of rats receivedgraded increments (0.5-3.0 mg) of sthevery 6 days during both pregnancy andlactation.  other groups of rats served aspregnancy and lactation controls.  mammarygland deoxyribonucleic acid (dna) contentwas determined in all rats and milk yieldwas determined in all rats carried to day14 postpartum.  significant increases in mam-mary dna occurred in all rats treated withsth irrespective of dose or schedule of in-jections when compared to gestation controls.a significant elevation in mammary dnaabove the lactation control level was alsoevident in rats receiving the hormone andcarried to day 14 of lactation.  milk yieldof rats treated with graded increments ofsth was significantly greater than that ofcontrol lactators but milk yield of rats re-ceiving a constant daily dose of the hormonedid not differ from that of controls.
