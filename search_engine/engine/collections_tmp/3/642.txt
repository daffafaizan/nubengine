suppression of rous sarcoma virus growth in tissuecultures by mycoplasma oralean agentwhich produced cell destruction in human diploid and chick-embryo fibroblastswas isolated from wi-26 strain of human diploid fibroblasts and shown to be amycoplasma.  the multiplication of rous sarcoma virus (rsv) and rous associatedvirus (rav) was inhibited in wi-26, wi-38, and chick-embryo fibroblastsinfected with this mycoplasma.  the mycoplasma isolate, designated strain 941,reacted strongly in the complement-fixation test with antiserum to mycoplasmaorale ch19299, an isolate obtained from the human oral cavity.  the cytopathiceffect of mycoplasma strain 941 could be eliminated by growing the mycoplasmaon an artificial agar medium before inoculation into chick-embryo fibroblasts.serial passage in chick-embryo fibroblasts restored the cytopathogenicity ofthe agar-grown mycoplasma.  however, growth of rsv and rav was inhibited byboth the tissue culture-grown and the agar-grown 941 strain, and also by thech19299 strain which did not produce any cytopathic effect.
