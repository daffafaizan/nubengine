spontane genetische veranderungen am zellstamm l (earle)the chromosomal constitution of a clone of the cell strain ,,l'' was studied byrepeated chromosomal analyses within 2 years.  there resulted the stability ofthe cellular clone with regard to the tested feature for the duration of aboutone year.the maximal number of chromosomes amounted to 60-64.  in later tests a spon-taneous doubling of the chromosomal number (maximum 120 chromosomes) wasascertained.  the cause of this phenomenon could not yet be cleared up.  thisnew chromosomal pattern remained unchanged in the subsequent examination periodof 6 months.as was proved by these observations, under the present cultivation-conditionscell populations can be retained stabile in vitro for a certain period.  thedefined substances, however, still imply unknown factors which may have amutagenous effect, so that sudden changes of cell populations may result.  therespective physiological features are hardly known as yet.
