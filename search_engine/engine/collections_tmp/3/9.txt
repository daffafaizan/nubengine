acetoacetate formation by livers from human fetuses aged 8-17 weeks .slices and homogenates from livers of human fetuses aged 8-17 weekshave a low rate of acetoacetate formation which can be raised byaddition of acetate or octanoate to the incubation medium . it was notpossible to demonstrate acetoacetate formation by isolated livermitochondria from 17-week-old fetuses, probably because mitochondria areinjured during isolation .
