femoral neuropathy in hemophilia.six new cases of femoral neuropathy in hemophilicpatients are described.  the syndrome begins with severepain in the groin, in the inferior aspect of the thigh,and deep in the hip region.  this is followed by a pronouncedcontracture of the hip in flexion and externalrotation.  a tender swelling appears in the iliac fossa andgroin with a depression in the center corresponding tothe inguinal ligament.  finally, a flaccid paralysis ofthe quadriceps femoris and diminution or absence of sensationin the anteromedial aspect of the thigh and proximalportion of the leg, with a depressed or absentpatellar reflex, is discovered.  the authors propose thatthis syndrome is the result of hemorrhage in the iliopsoasmuscle at the musculotendinous junction beneaththe iliacus fascia and that the femoral nerve becomescompressed beneath the unyielding inguinal ligamentsuperiorly and the iliopectineal ligament medially.treatment consists in bed rest, analgesics, and freshfrozenplasma during the acute phase.  during the convalescentphase, a hessing long brace is used to protectthe knee from hemarthrosis until functional returnof the quadriceps femoris has occurred.  to date, thevalidity of the theory that the femoral-nerve palsy isthe result of iliopsoas hemorrhage at the musculotendinousjunction and compression of the femoral nerve beneaththe inguinal ligament has not been verified.  theauthors anticipate some day seeing a non-hemophilic patientwith a traumatic iliacus hemorrhage and femoralneuropathy.  should such an opportunity present itself,exploration beneath poupart's ligament may show thefemoral nerve to be compressed and thus confirm theproposed cause of the clinical picture.
