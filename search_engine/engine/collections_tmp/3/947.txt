the action of vasopressin in renal diabetes insipidus.as the water-retaining action of antidiuretichormone is eliminated in renal diabetesinsipidus, the steps in na transport canbe separately determined.  vasopressininduced a prompt increase in freewaterclearance and urinary volume, as wellas a delayed increase in sodium clearance.it is suggested that vasopressin bringsabout stimulation of sodium reabsorption inthe ascending limb of henle's loop.  itis supposed that both physiological actionsof antidiuretic hormone - the antidiureticand the sodium-active effect - become operativein two different places in the nephronand synergistically produce a maximumconcentration of urine.
