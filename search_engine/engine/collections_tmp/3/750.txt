lesions of the liver in hereditarymetabolic diseaseswhether the various cells of the liver, both parenchymal and stromal,receive genetic misinformation in all hereditary diseases caused by genemutation is unknown, but the metabolic capabilities of these several celltypes are so diverse that it is not surprising that their involvement inmany such diseases can be demonstrated by clinical, pathological, or bio-chemical methods.  repetitive abnormality of the liver has apparently notbeen defined for any disease caused by quantitative (i.e., chromosomal)gene anomaly, whether produced by nondisjunction, translocation, ormajor deletion, perhaps because relatively few such diseases have beendescribed.  as a result, the genetically determined disorders of the liversurveyed in this paper appear to be the result of conventional "singlegene" abnormalities, and to be transmitted in affected families by men-delian mechanisms.
