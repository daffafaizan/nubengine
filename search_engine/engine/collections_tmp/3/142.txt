the effects of electrophoretically separated lens proteins on lensregeneration in diemyctylus viridescens .in the present study, lenses were removed from the eyes of adultanesthetized newts, macerated in 0.03 m borate buffer at ph 8.6, andseparated by starch gel electrophoresis . upon staining with amido black10-b, seven distinct staining areas appeared in the blocks . three bandsmoved toward the anode, and three toward the cathode . in addition, aseventh moiety represented by a smear of material moved toward the anodeone millimeter times five tenths millimeter plugs were removed fromeach of these areas and were placed into freshly lentectomized eyes .plugs from most strongly positive and most weakly negative proteinsinhibited lens regeneration . in addition, plugs from the areacontaining the weakly negative protein induced either lenses withaberrant polarity or double centered lenses with centers of opposedpolarity . all other protein bands had no significant effect onregeneration .in addition to the above experiments, homogenates andproteinasedigested homogenates of lenses were injected into eyesfollowing lentectomy . three 5-ul samples were injected in each caseover a six day period . injection of the plain homogenate stimulatedlens regeneration markedly, while the proteinase destroyed thestimulatory activity .theoretical considerations of the above data are discussed .
