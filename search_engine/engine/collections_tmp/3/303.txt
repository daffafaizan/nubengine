5407. hypoxic-hypercapnic interaction in subjects with bilateralcerebral dysfunctionto analyze cerebral influences modifyingautonomic respiratory responses, theauthors compared normals and patientswith bilateral pyramidal tract disease fortheir ventilatory response to hypoxia andhypoxia-hypercapnia.  during eucapnia,the 2 groups showed similar hypoxicresponses.  during hypercapnia, the ventilatoryresponse to hypoxia was greater in thebrain-damaged subjects.  this apparent aug-mentation, however, was due entirelyto anoxia interacting with an abnormally fa-cilitated carbon dioxide sensitivitycompared with normals, brain-damaged patientsat pao,90-100 mm hg showed an 85%greater co2 response, and at pao,50mm hgshowed a 79% greater co2 response.since cerebral dysfunction facilitated the ven-tilatory response to hypoxia-hypercapniacombined but not the response to hypoxiaalone, the results imply that the 2respiratory stimuli interact centrally rather thanperipherally.
