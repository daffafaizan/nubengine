387. ophthalmic manifestations of bilateral non-occipital cerebral lesionstwelve patients are described with neuro-ophthalmic symptoms resulting frombilateral cerebral lesions in areas other than the occipital lobes.  thesymptoms and signs are categorized as follows  group i  those showingpredominant disturbances in visual object recognition (visual agnosia) anddisturbances of visual spatial localization.  group iia  those having defectsin voluntary control of eye movements (ocular motor apraxia).  group iib  thosewith persistent palsies of conjugate gaze.  although these symptoms may bepresent to some extent with unilateral lesions, they are much more profoundand less able to be compensated with bilateral lesions.  the evidence in thepresent cases suggests a biparieto-temporal localization for the lesionscausing visual agnosia, disturbances of spatial localization, and ocular motorapraxia, and a more frontal localization for the lesions causing prolongedparalysis of conjugate gaze.
