evaluation of 20 years' experience with the treatment of hydrocephalusin infants.a total of 394 infants were examined between1943 and 1962.  till 1961, 369 infantswere examined and 246 were operated on (66.7%);this group is analyzed.  laurence'sopinion on the favorable spontaneousevolution is not agreed to and themerits of surgical treatment are proved.  adynamic form of hydrocephalus inoperated infants is shown; the patients whowere not operated on suffered from otherdiseases combined with macrocephaly whichmust be distinguished from hydrocephalus.a spontaneous arrest of the processwas observed in only 14 children, e.g.3.8%, as compared with laurence's 42.6%.the cause and pathological findings areanalyzed in 102 infants operated on between1957 and 1962.  a great discrepancybetween the time of the onset of first symptomsand the time of operation was found.this disease manifests itself in 50% of infantsin the first month of life, but the averageage of infants at the time of operation is6.1 mth.  only 3% of infants are operatedon in the first month.  thirteen operatingprocedures were used in the 20 yr. underreview.  until the introduction of deviation ofthe csf into the jugular vein or intothe cardiac atrium, 15.33% of the infantssurvived 1 yr. after operation.  since theintroduction of this procedure the survivalrate of infants was 67.8%.  in spite ofthe late operation about 27% of survivingchildren showed an average mentaldevelopment.  surgical treatment of dynamichydrocephalus is advocated.  theyconsider this method as the only means of helpingthe infant at present.
