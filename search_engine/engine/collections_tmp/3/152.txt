some reactions of cytotoxic antibodies against previously unknown mouseisoantigens .the antiserum produced in c3h/he against c3h/st lymphosarcoma 6c3hedcontains a mixture of at least two antibodies of different propertiesand specificities . anti h-5a is a hemagglutinating antibody removed byabsorption with red cells and many tissues . anti v is a cytotoxinreacting with c3h/st tissue and 6c3hed but not with red cells.the reciprocal antiserum c3h/st anti c3h/he sarcoma mc1m is morecomplex . it contains the hemagglutinin anti h-6a and a variety ofcytotoxins . one appears to be specific for c3h/he tissues and thetumor mc1m . another reacts with antigens on the c3h/go carcinomabp8. two additional cytotoxins may also be present .immunization between sublines of the same inbred strain can result inthe production of a variety of antibodies directed against unrelatedantigens present on even long transplanted cells . the significance of
