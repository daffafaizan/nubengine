the inorganic constituents of human teeth and bone examined by x-rayemission spectrography .x-ray emission spectrography has been applied to study of theelemental composition of human teeth, enamel, dentine and bone . thematerial consisted of eight crushed teeth, enamel and dentine powderseparated from eighteen teeth, and four pieces of buccal corticalmandibular bone . the teeth did not have fillings . the whole materialcontained nineteen elements, of which the main ones were calcium andphosphorus . in all the samples of tooth material, there were found ca,p, cl, fe, zn, sr and k, and the bone also contained ni . the timeneeded for a semi-quantitative analysis compares very favourably withthat needed for other methods .
