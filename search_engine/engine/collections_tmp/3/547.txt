absorption and excretion of toxogonin, an alkyl-phosphate antidote,after intramuscular injection in mantolerance, absorption and urinary excretion stu-dies of toxogonin (bis-(4-hydroxyiminomethyl-pyridine-1-methyl) ether dichloride), a specific anti-dote in poisoning by esterase-blocking organicphosphates, were made on 11 men by intramuscularinjection of 250 mg. (ca. 3 mg./kg.) of the drug,given by self-injection ampoules.  injections madewith the automatic ampoule autule caused no localirritation.  certain facial symptoms reported can forthe time being be regarded as resorptive side-effectsof toxogonin.  maximum blood levels of 6 ug./ml.were recorded within 20 minutes.  even after fourhours the level was still 1-2 ug./ml., a concentra-tion amply sufficient to ensure reactivation of bloodesterases.  of the injected dose, 52% was excretedin the urine after two hours, 87% after eight hours.toxogonin appears to pass through the body un-changed.
