practical human growth hormonepreparation and clinical usehuman growth hormone was prepared fromacetone-dried pituitary powder by hot glacialacetic acid extraction and subsequent precipita-tion by sodium chloride and cold acetone.  theyield was 13 per cent and the preparation wascalled practical growth hormone in recognitionof its complement of corticotropin.treatment of two dwarfs with practical growthhormone in aqueous solution, 1 or 2 mg intra-muscularly on alternate days, accelerated thegrowth rate and there were no physical signs orlaboratory indications of adrenal stimulation orother adverse effects.  the preparation is recom-mended for its safety, simplicity and relativelygood yield.
