the determinants of cerebrospinal fluid po2 the effects of oxygen andcarbon dioxide breathing in patients with chronic lung disease .the lumbar cerebrospinal fluid po2 of some hypoxemic hypercapnicpatients with chronic lung disease is the same as that of patientswithout chronic lung disease . breathing 95 oxygen with 5 carbon dioxideincreased lumbar cerebrospinal fluid po2 more than breathing 95 oxygenwith 5 nitrogen . the change in cerebrospinal fluid po2 is closelyrelated to the change in arterial pco2, and this relationship is similarto the relationship between arterial pco2 and cerebral blood flow inpatients with and without hypercapnia . interpretation of theseobservations must be qualified by the following.. cisternalcerebrospinal fluid po2 differs from lumbar cerebrospinal fluid po2 inits response to breathing oxygen with carbon dioxide,. regulation ofblood flow to the spinal cord and nerve roots is not known to becomparable to that of the brain,. and factors other than blood flow mayhave contributed to the changes of cerebrospinal fluid po2 .
