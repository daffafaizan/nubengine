the autistic child in the school and theschool-nurse teacher responsibilityautistic children demonstrate a more persistent pattern of retreatingfrom reality than is apparent in those children categorized as normal.some psychologists have established the cause of symptoms in the autisticchild as extreme anxiety which forces withdrawal from social contact.such anxiety is reported to have its initial occurrance during the agerange of one to five years.  a sense of security which is considered es-sential for a child is gained through overt manifestations of love, care andapproval of those adults most closely associated with him.  when thisneed is not satisfied, the child's attempts at self-realization and esteemare deterred or thwarted, and a state of anxiety may result.  the severityof the anxiety may be the forerunner of a schizophrenic disorder.  sucha condition can develop in a child, an adolescent or an adult.  schizo-phrenia, a serious mental illness, is considered to be a major cause foradmitting patients to mental institutions.another school of thought has placed infantile autism in the categoryof a disturbance resulting from abnormalities of development during theintrauterine period.  such a congenital condition is not categorized asmental retardation.yet another concept of autism conceives of the problem as the absenceof an innate ability or capacity for developing meaningful contacts withother people.  a detachment of varying degrees persists where humancontacts are concerned.
