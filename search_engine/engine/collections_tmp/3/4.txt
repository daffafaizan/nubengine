placental and cord blood lipids.. comparison in a set of double ovumtwins, a stillborn and a live-born .1. determinations of phospholipid, total and free cholesterol,triglyceride and nefa have been made on placental tissue and cord bloodin a set of double ovum twins, one stillborn and one live-born .2. similarities occurred in all fractions studied except the cordblood triglyceride and nefa levels .3. the serum of the stillborn infant contained one-third as muchtriglyceride and 21/2 times as much nefa as did the live-born infant .4. the phospholipid content and the total lipid content of thestillbirth placenta were the highest studied in this laboratory whichincludes determinations on 26 live births .5. the suggestion is made that increased lipoprotein lipase activityin the cord blood may accompany intrauterine fetal death .
