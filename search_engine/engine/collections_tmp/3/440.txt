4179. reduced estriol excretion in patientswith breast cancer prior to endocrinetherapythe urinary quotient of estriol/estrone +estradiol-17b(eq) was measured chemically inwomen with and without breast cancer, as an in-dex of the ratio of noncarcinogenic impeded es-trogens to mammary carcinogenic estrogens.  in34 controls, the median eq was 1.3 before and 1.2after menopause, with only 21% of the patients sub-normal.  in 26 breast cancer patients without endo-crine treatment or recent surgery, the median eqwas 0.5 and 0.8 respectively, with 62% of the pa-tients subnormal.  after major surgery or hormo-nal therapy, only 23% of 53 patients were subnor-mal, no remissions being observed unless the eqrose toward normal.  matching of 24 controls andpatients in pairs by age and ovarian status in thewilcoxon test indicated that the decreased eq ex-creted in untreated cancer was significant at the0.2% confidence level.  the marked increase in eqinduced by castration and androgen, estrogen, andcorticosteroid therapy suggests that normaliza-tion of a precancerous metabolic imbalance be-tween impeded and active estrogens derived fromovarian and adrenocortical sources contributed toarrested growth of estradiol-dependent metastases.
