eye and kidney tissue reactions to heterologous anti-uveal antibodies .the uvea, lens capsule and kidney glomerulus in the albino wistar rathave a common antigenic component(s) . the uvea and lens capsule in thepigmented bovine eye also have a common antigenic component(s) . theseresults were demonstrated by the immunofluorescence technique . thecommon antigenic sites in the uvea were assumed to be the basementmembrane surrounding the vascular trees in the tissues . the possibilityof the basement membrane participation as an antigenic source forinducing sympathetic ophthalmia is discussed .
