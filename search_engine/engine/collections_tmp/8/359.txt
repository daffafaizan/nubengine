2568. clinical observations on hemianopia (japanese)the clinical findings in 19 cases of hemianopia were analyzed.  hemianopia wascaused most frequently by vascular lesions of the central nervous mianopsia,and by tumors.  wilbrand's prism sign, which is generally taken as evidenceof an optic tract lesion, was positive in one case with a parietal lesion.  nocase showed a cogwheel movement of the eyeball.  optokinetic nystagmus waspositive in 3 cases, one of which proved to have a parieto-occipital aneurysm.the etiological factor could not be identified in the remaining 2 cases.macular sparing was found to be symptomatic of an occipital lobe lesion.incongruity of the 2 fields was observed in 2 cases with an occipital lobelesion.  as for the prognosis, hemianoptic field defects remained stationary incases of vascular lesions.  on the other hand perfect recovery of the visualfield defect occurred in cases with an occipital lobe tumor and in hypophysealhypertrophy caused by pregnancy.  the visual acuity of hemianoptic patients wasfairly good and no deterioration occurred during the observation period ofabout 4 years.  only one patient out of the present series died.  these resultssuggest that a favorable vital prognosis can be accorded to hemianopticsubjects.
