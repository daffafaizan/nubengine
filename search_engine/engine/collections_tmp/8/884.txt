clinical features of the alalies (russian).the term 'alalies' is applied to the variousstates of absence or insufficient developmentof speech in children, resultingfrom defective development or affectionsof the speech centers before the developmentof speech.  from the clinicalstudy it is possible to distinguish between severalforms: motor, sensory, andsemantic alaly with signs of amnesia.  thecauses are multiple: trauma, perinatalcerebral hemorrhage, inflammatory processes,metabolic disorders before thedevelopment of speech, and alimentary andtrophic disorders.  the alalies showvarying degrees of severity.  in most childrensuffering from alaly, neurologicalsigns can be demonstrated on the right side,an indication of the organic nature ofthe condition.  the presence of local symptomsin the various forms of alaly isoften associated with signs indicating involvementof adjacent regions of the cerebralhemispheres in the pathological processwhich would explain why the alaliesare often complex.  the character of the alaliesdepends on functional disordersresulting from the lesion in the frontal, anterior,motor, temporal or parietalregion of the dominant cerebral hemisphere.patients with alaly often show neuroticreactions, resulting from the disordersof the processes of inhibition and excitationof the cerebral cortex and the subcorticalformations.  early treatment ofthe alalies with drugs combined with logopedicand pedagogic measures gives good results.
