effect of heterologous antiserum and complement on glycolysis of tumorcells .the effect of heterologous antiserum and complement on glucosemetabolism of rat ascites tumor cells was examined to clarify themechanism of the cytotoxic effect of antibody .1. lactate-production of the target cells was inhibited by thecooperation of antiserum and complement, while no inhibition wasobserved when the cells were subjected to either antiserum or complementalone . the inhibition of lactate-production was observed under bothacrobic and anacrobic conditions . no effect of the antiserum andcomplement was observed on the oxygen consumption of the cells .2. the amount of antiserum necessary for the inhibition oflactate-production of the cells was determined in the presence of adefinite amount of complement, and it was found that the degree ofinhibition was not in parallel with the concentration of antiserumbeyond a certain threshold . on the other hand, a parallelism wasobserved between the amount of complement and the rate of inhibition oflactate-production when different amounts of complement were added to adefinite amount of antiserum .3. similar inhibitory effects of the antiserum and complement onlactate-production of the cells from glucose, fructose-1, 6-diphosphate,and pyruvate suggested that the inhibition occurred toward the finalstep of glycolytic process of the cells .
