impaired development of rat liver enzyme activities atbirth after irradiation in uterodevelopment of activity of three liver enzymes at birth was studied in rats re-ceiving 180 rads of x-rays on day 15 of gestation.  at 20 days of gestation,activities of lactic and glycerophosphate dehydrogenases andglucose-6-phosphatase were not altered.  the subsequent increases in enzymeactivities in the 3 days between 20 days of gestation and 1 day of age wereonly 30 to 60% of those observed in controls.  this finding suggests thatirradiation in utero may alter later development of enzyme activity in theperinatal period.
