liver resections for embolic metastases from cancer of the colon andrectum.two patients, who underwent resections of theleft lobe of the liver for embolic metastases from primarycancers of the colon and rectum, are reported.the internal anatomy of the liver, as it relates to thetechnic and terminology of resections, is reviewed.cases of liver resection performed for embolic metastasesfrom cancer of the colon and rectum, found in anextensive review of medical literature, are classifiedand the results are analyzed.  resection of either halfof the liver (hemihepatectomy) for embolic metastasisfrom cancer of the colon or rectum, so rarely curesthe patient and carried such a high operative mortalityrate, that it is seldom, if ever, justifiable.  the lesseroperations (left lobectomy or right-lobe metastasectomy)often can be performed simultaneously with the primaryoperation and are occasionally followed by freedom fromrecurrence for periods of 5 yr or more.  they are justifiableif the metastasis is situated favorably in the liverfor complete removal, and if the primary lesion appearsto be curable.
