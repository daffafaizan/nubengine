a comparison between inhaled dust and the dust recovered from humanlungs .experiments on the loss of dust particles during breathing indicatetotal deposition in the respiratory tract,. subjection of the results toqualitative arguments may give information about alveolar deposition .measurements of insoluble dust recovered post mortem from human lungsgive the absolute retention of dust which was deposited in the alveoliand subsequently shifted, probably to a large extent, to the lymphaticvessels of the lungs .experimental results for total deposition and absolute retention arediscussed in connection with the health risk due to inhaling insolubleparticles, such as plutonium dioxide .
