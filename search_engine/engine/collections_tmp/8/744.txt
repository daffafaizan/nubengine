extrahepatic biliary atresia: comments on thefrequency of potentially operable casesin a 10 year period, 35 infants with extrahepatic biliary atresia wereencountered.  twenty-eight babies, who were subjected to surgery and operativeliver biopsy, are discussed.  although an operable lesion was detected atlaparotomy in only one baby, 5 further potentially correctable lesions werediscovered in the 14 necropsies performed.  review of the literature revealedthat few authors have discussed necropsy findings and that confirmation of thediagnosis by liver biopsy has been neglected in many cases, including someof those claimed as surgical cures.  it is concluded that the frequency ofpotentially operable forms of biliary atresia is not really known.
