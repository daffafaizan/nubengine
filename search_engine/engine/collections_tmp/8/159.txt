studies of the generalized shwartzman reaction induced by diet vi.effects of pregnancy on lipid composition of serum and tissues .pregnancy induced profound alterations in the lipid composition ofserum and tissues . (1) there is an elevation of total serum lipid,phospholipid, triglyceride, free fatty acid and cholesterol,. (2) whilethe total lipid of the liver and kidney are increased, that of the depotfat is decreased,. (3) palmitate and oleate are increased in serum andliver,. (4) arachidonate and stearate are decreased in serum and liver,.and (5) placentas contain more stearate than the other organs of thepregnant rat and also have a higher water content . the decrease indepot total fat,. elevation of serum, liver and kidney total fat,. andelevation of serum free fatty acids suggest that pregnancy inducedmobilization of depot fat . the increase in proportion of liver andserum palmitate suggests that pregnancy induces increased lipogenesisfrom the acetate pool . the appearance of an increased amount oflong-chain fatty acids in the liver may be due to the increased intakeof dietary fat . the decrease in arachidonate and stearate in serum andliver suggests a relative decrease in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis
