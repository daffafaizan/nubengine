an evaluation of the bentonite flocculation and indirecthemagglutination tests for the diagnosis of filariasis.the indirect haemagglutination test and the bentoniteflocculation test utilizing asaline extract of dirofilaria immitis have beenevaluated.  the test was reactivewith sera from individuals with infections ofacanthocheilonema perstans and showedhigher titres for symptomatic patients withmicrofilariae in the blood.  in a groupof 42 symptomatic patients, 92% of 13 microfilariae-positivepatients and 62% of 29microfilariae-negative patients showed positiveserologic tests.  in a group of 15asymptomatic individuals with microfilariaein the blood, 67% were positive.  froma group of 295 asymptomatic microfilariae-negativeindividuals, 21 sera (7%) werepositive.  testing 632 sera from 295 normalmissionaries, 84 normal americans,and 253 individuals with various other parasiticand bacterial infections, an overallnon-specific response of 10% was obtained,utilizing the following criteria for apositive serologic test: (1) haemagglutinationtitre of 1:200 or higher with a positiveflocculation of 1:5 or higher, or (2) a haemagglutinationtitre of 1:400 with a negativeflocculation reaction.  sera from 141 patientswith helminth diseases showed a non-specificrate of 21%.  this high rate was dueto cross-reactions with trichinosissera (35%), schistosomiasis (20%) and ascariasis (27%).since the schistosomiasisand ascariasis sera were from individuals bornin an area endemic for filariasis,the reactions may represent a serologic responseto past experience with filariasis.only 5% of 112 sera from individuals with non-helminthicdiseases and 5% of 84sera from normal individuals were positive.
