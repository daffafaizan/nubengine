the antidiuretic effect of angiotensin in diabetes insipidus.the effect of angiotensin (val-5-hypertensinii-asp- -amide)was studied in 2 children with diabetesinsipidus (a 9 yr old boy with diabetes insipidus neuro-hormonalisand a 4 yr old girl with diabetes insipidusrenalis) in whom the clearances of inulin, pah, na andurea and the osmolar and free-water clearances wereexamined.  angiotensin produces a prompt antidiuresiswhich is combined with a gross decrease of the na-clearance.the osmolality of the urine is increased only slightlyand the free-water clearance does not become negative,both effects being contrary to those seen with vasopressin.the antidiuresis and antinatriuresis can be producedin salt-loaded and salt-deprived states.  furosemidereverses the effects of angiotensin.  the clearance ofurea is not changed by angiotensin as long as the glomerularfiltration rate remains normal.
