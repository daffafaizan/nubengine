carbonic anhydrase distribution in rabbit lens .the distribution of carbonic anhydrase activity in the mature rabbitlens was determined . the activities in nucleus, cortex, epithelium withanterior capsule, anterior capsule, and posterior capsule were,respectively, 2484 ( 256), 1571 ( 87), 545 ( 93), 159 ( 39) and 65 ( 49)moles co /kg wet tissue wt per hr at 0 c . it was concluded, on thebasis of the available evidence, that carbonic anhydrase cannot play aprimary role in the cation transport system of the lens .
