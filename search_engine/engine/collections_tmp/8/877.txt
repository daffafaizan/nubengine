the development of bilateral adenomatous adrenal hyperplasiain a case of cushing's syndrome of eighteen years' duration.a case of cushing's syndrome of 18 years'duration is presented.  the diseasebegan when the patient was 8 years old andwas partially controlled by pituitaryradiation when she was 13.  however, clinicalevidence indicate low grade but continuousadrenocortical activity for the next 13years.  the probable suppressionof gh secretion by the increased steroid levelsduring her growth period providesa reasonable explanation for the dwarfism ofthe patient.  the administration of 8 mgof dexamethasone per day failed to decreaseurinary steroid excretion.  bilateralnodular hyperplasia was found at surgery.it is suggested from the evidence presentedthat this patient's disease began firstas a primary pituitary process butduring the long duration of the acth secretionit evolved into one of autonomouslyfunctioning bilateral nodular hyperplasia.
