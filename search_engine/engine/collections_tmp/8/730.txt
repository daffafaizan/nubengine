experimental onchocercal ocular lesions in the chimpanzeethis is the first attempt to produceonchocercal eye lesions with microfilariae ofo. volvulus in the chimpanzee.live microfilariae, once in the anteriorchamber of the eye, could penetrate the an-gle of the anterior chamber, the iris, theciliary body, the choroid and the vitreous.most of the microfilariae injected aliveinto the anterior chamber of the eyes of thechimpanzee died within a short time.  com-parison, therefore, could not be made be-tween the effects of live and dead micro-filariae.microfilariae debris was demonstratedwithin giant cells for the first time.subconjunctival and limbal infiltrationwith incipient pannus, inflammation withinthe trabecular meshwork of the angle of theanterior chamber and extensive active iri-docyclitis were demonstrated in histologicsections, although the conditions were clini-cally quiescent.the posterior segment lesion of oncho-cercal chorioretinal degeneration could notbe reproduced.subcutaneous and intravenous injec-tions of worm extracts, derived from humanonchocercomas, may have contributed to theonset of active choroiditis.  this sensitizationalone, without the intraocular injection ofmicrofilariae, had no effects on the eye.various aspects of the pathogenesis ofhuman onchocerciasis are discussed on thebasis of present experimentation.
