a color test for the measurement of antibody to the non-acid-forminghuman mycoplasma species.a metabolic inhibition testfor the measurement ofgrowth inhibiting antibodies tothe non-acid producinghuman mycoplasma species isdescribed.  the test isbased upon the ability of theseorganisms to metabolizearginine with a resultant alkalineshift in the ph of themedium.  the alkaline shift isinhibited by specific antiserum.labile accessory factor(s)present in unheatedguinea pig serum potentiatesthe inhibitory effect of antiserum.the test is sensitiveand specific for the measurementof antibody to mycoplasmasin rabbit immuneand human convalescent serum.
