on the mechanism of genetic recombination in transforming bacillussubtilis .the molecular fate of transforming dna in competent bacillus subtilishas been studied . the physical differentiation of transforming dna andthe genetic material of recipient bacteria was effected by employing theisotopes n and p . competent bacteria labeled with n and p were allowedto incorporate n p-labeled transforming dna intracellularly . dna wasisolated from these recipient cells and centrifuged in cesium chloride .analysis of drop fractions collected at equilibrium showed the presenceof radioactivity in a region of density corresponding to recipient dna .material contribution from donor dna to the resident dna did not occurwhen genetically inert bacillus cereus dna was substituted forhomologous dna . it was concluded that radioactivity appearing in theunlabeled resident dna was not the result of degradation of input (p)dna and subsequent incorporation by normal metabolic processes . sincesingle-stranded dna of donor origin was not detected, nor was thereevidence for the non-specific aggregation of donor and recipient dna, itwas concluded that the observed physical association of transforming andrecipient dna occurs as a result of genetic recombination in transformedb. subtilis .
