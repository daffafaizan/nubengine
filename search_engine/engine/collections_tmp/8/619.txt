the speech production and spoken language of the deafthe distinction was made between speech production and spoken language inanalysing the oral output of those with hearing impairment.  a brief review ofstudies in both areas was undertaken, including the report of a new electronicvisual monitoring device, the glossal transducer.  it was postulated that thedeaf utilise a unique visual-to-motor conversion within the brain when speakingand monitor conscously by tactile-kinaesthetic control.  the more recentstudies relate to the syntactical features of the speech of the deaf.  theseshow that deafness creates telegraphic speech with reduced sentence length andomissions of essential words such as functors.  the speech of the deaf seems tocontain mostly nouns and verbs, with a limited number of words used to expandverb forms.
