2317. the use of needle biopsy of the liver in the diagnosis of visceralamyloidosis in patients with pulmonary tuberculosis (russian)the results of 86 puncture biopsies of theliver in 84 patients with pulmonary tuber-culosis (55 men and 31 women aged from18 to 73 yr.) for the purpose of diagnosingamyloidosis are reported.  puncture wasperformed when amyloidosis was suspectedon the basis of the case history (destructiveprocess of more than 2-3 years' duration),clinical signs in the form of enlargement ofthe liver and spleen, edema, changesin the blood picture and blood protein formula,and changes in the urine (proteinuria,cylindruria, isohyposthenuria).  amyloidosiswas diagnosed or its presence surmisedbefore puncture in 23 patients; the puncturebiopsy confirmed the diagnosis in 14and refuted it in 9 of them.  in 8 patients withoutclinical symptoms, amyloidosiswas diagnosed on the basis of the puncture biopsyalone.  in 9 cases with fatal out-come, the post-mortem findings coincided withthe results of the bioptic puncture.of the 62 patients in whom amyloidosis was notdetected by biopsy, 31 had moderatedystrophic changes and 9 had marked dystrophicchanges while in 22 cases no patho-logical changes were found; 6 of these patientslater developed amyloidosis.  thesefindings supported the contention that liveramyloidosis is linked with dystrophicchanges in the epithelial cells.  markeddystrophic changes can precede amyloidosisor may occur simultaneously with it.  moderatedystrophic changes are quite commonin patients with an exacerbating tuberculousprocess in the lungs.  the wide applica-tion of bioptic puncture of the liver in indicatedcases can increase our knowledgeof the morphological changes taking place in theliver in tb.
