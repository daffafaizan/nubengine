infantile hydrocephalus and hematoma in the posterior fossawe have presented a case of hydrocephalus inan infant, the basic cause being intracranialhemorrhage in the perinatal period.  surgical re-moval of a hematoma in the posterior fossa did notgive permanent relief of the raised intracranialpressure.  a lumbar air study at this stage dis-closed information that the passage through theintracerebral cerebrospinal-fluid pathways wasnormalized whereas the extracerebral ones stillwere occluded by arachnoiditis.  the conditionnecessitated a ventriculo-atrial shunt.
