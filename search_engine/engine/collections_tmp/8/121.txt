measurement of pericardial fluid correlated with the i -cholografin andihsa heart scan .in 23 patients undergoing open-heart surgery in whom the pericardialcontents were accurately measured, and in 11 additional patientsexamined at autopsy or by pericardiocentesis, isotopic photoscans of theheart were made and the results were correlated .the most accurate means of diagnosis of pericardial effusion was foundto be the ratio of the maximum transverse cardiac diameters on scan androentgenogram . in patients with less than 100 cc of pericardial fluidthis ratio was greater than 0.80, and it was less than this in cases ofeffusion of 200 cc or more .measurement of the difference of these diameters, and visibleseparation of the cardiac blood pool from the pulmonary vasculature andliver aided in the diagnosis .pericardial effusions of 200-300 cc or greater can be detected byisotopic photoscanning . although cardiac dilatation and/or hypertrophydecrease the sensitivity of the technique somewhat, a definite diagnosisof pericardial effusion can be made even when cardiomegaly exists .
