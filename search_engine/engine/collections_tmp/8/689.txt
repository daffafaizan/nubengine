investigations into the thiazide-induced antidiuresis inpatients with diabetes insipidusplasma sodium, osmolality and serumchloride, together with creatinine clear-ance, were studied before and duringthiazide treatment of 7 patients withdiabetes insipidus.the diuresis was reduced by 28-39%.the urine osmolality was increased by7-128%.  an average decrease in plasmasodium of 4 meq/i, in plasma osmolalityof 21 mosm/kg, and in serum chloride of8 meq/i was observed.  only in one pa-tient was the creatinine clearance re-duced significantly.  the thirst-feeling wasreduced even from the first day of treat-ment.  the diuresis was not minimal untilthe third to fourth day.  if the diuresis wascorrected for the extra electrolyte ex-cretion initiated by the thiazide, theantidiuresis was found to be operating tothe full extent even on the first day oftreatment.it is concluded that the antidiuresis ismainly secondary to the natriuresis and toa certain degree due to a decreased thirst-feeling; but there seems also to be a directrenal action, involving at least a reduc-tion of the glomerular filtration rate.  apronounced antidiuresis was found by awater deprivation test after thiazidetreatment in one patient.
