the action of oral diureticsin diabetes insipiduschronic administration of chlorothiazide andother thiazide analogues in diabetes insipidusresults in a striking reduction in urinary volumewith increase in urinary osmolality.  this curiousantidiuretic action was first described bycrawford & kennedy (1959), and though it hassince been widely confirmed in both the pituitaryand nephrogenic forms of the disease, its precisemechanism remains obscure.  a number ofinvestigators have sought to explain the phenom-enon entirely on the basis of the renal actions ofthese drugs (earley & orloff 1962, goodman &carter 1962), whilst others have contended thatabatement of polyuria may be secondary to acentral effect of the thiazides in decreasing thirst(robson & lambie 1962, skadhauge 1963).over the past two years, we have conducteddetailed in-patient studies of the action ofvarious diuretic drugs of the thiazide and otherseries in a group of 7 patients with pituitarydiabetes insipidus.
