1162. electron microscopy of the bovine lungs  the blood-air barrier in acutepulmonary emphysemaelectron microscopic studies of experimentallyinduced acute pulmonary emphy-sema in 2 cows yielded the following findingsalveolar epithelial edema and cyto-lysis, endothelial 'thinning' and cytolysis,excessive elastic and collagenous alveo-lar wall fibrosis, hyperplasia of alveolarwall smooth muscle, numerous intra-alveolar lattice and lamellar bodies, hyalinemembrane formation, hypertrophiedendothelial perikaryons, numerous alveolarmacrophages, and alveolar epithelialsecretion of an electron-dense amorphous mass.it was postulated that the latticeand lamellar bodies were a result of degeneratingalveolar epithelial cells.
