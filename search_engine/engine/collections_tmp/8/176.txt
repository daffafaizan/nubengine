a comparison of the fine structure of cultured mac-21 and hela cell .the fine structure of a cultured mucoid adenocarcinoma cell of humanlung (mac-21) is described and compared with the fine structure of thehela cell . the differences in fine structure between the two strainsare primarily quantitative . the mac-21 cell differed, however, in thefollowing respects.. a spindle-shaped cell with larger nucleus andincreased nuclear membrane invaginations, and considerably largeramounts of perinuclear golgi apparatus . the cytoplasm contained areasof low density, undefined by a limiting membrane, which are thought tobe accumulations of mucin .the two cell strains contained numerous multivesicular bodies, somewith lamellae in various stages of development, suggesting that theseorganelles may be involved in the formation of the lipide-rich,myelinated structures observed in both hela and mac-21 cells . thenumber of myelinated bodies was found to be inversely proportional tothe ph of the medium .
