2431. the natural history of arrhythmias following septal defect reapirthe repair of 191 atrial and ventricular septaldefects between 1955 and 1961 wasreviewed to determine the incidence and prognosisof arrhythmias related to operation.cases included 90 ventricular septal defects, 61atrial defects of the ostium secundumtype, and 40 of the ostium primum variety.nodal rhythms, second degree blocks,complete heart block, and flutter or fibrillation thatpersisted after completion of operationwere analyzed, while intermittent ectopic beats,sinus tachycardia, and bundle branchblocks were excluded.  fifteen per cent of thepatients with ventricular defects, 17%with ostium primum defects, and 35% with ostiumsecundum defects developed abnormalrhythms associated with repair.  of 18 patients whosearrhythmias began during operation,there were 8 deaths; no fatalities occurred in the 24patients who developed arrhythmiasin the postoperative period.  seven deaths wereassociated with complete heart block andone with second degree block.  although only onehalf of the patients who developedarrhythmias had pulmonary artery pressure greaterthan 30 mm. hg systolic, all fatalitiesoccurred in this group.  four of the deaths followedsurgery with the use of the pumpoxygenator in children under 30 months of age.thirty-eight per cent of the abnormalrhythms that began in the postoperative periodwere nodal.  flutter and fibrillationwere common following repair of atrial secundumdefects in patients over 15 yr. of agebut did not occur in younger patients.  deaths fromheart block occurred in the first 30 daysfollowing operation except one, 5 months later.survivors of complete heart block revertedto a less serious arrhythmia or normal rhythmwithin 3 months.
