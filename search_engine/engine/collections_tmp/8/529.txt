1845. further studies on specific transplantation antigens in rous sarcoma ofmicemice allografted with different sarcomas, induced by the schmidt-ruppin variantof rous sarcoma virus (rsv-sr), showed a resistance against subsequentisografting of 9 different rous sarcomas.  transplantationresistance could also be induced byrous mouse tumor cells x-irradiated with 8000 ror with cell-free tumor extracts,containing no demonstrable virus.  notransplantation resistance could be demon-strated after allograft pretreatment withvarious polyoma tumors or non-viral tu-mors.  allograft pretreatment with roustumors induced no demonstrable resistanceagainst isografting of polyoma tumors.inoculation of rsv-sr or rous chicken sar-coma suspension into adult mice gaveno clear cut resistance against isograft-ing of mouse sarcomas.  neither afterallografting of rous tumors nor after virusor chicken sarcoma inoculation into adultmice could virus-neutralizing activity bedemonstrated in the sera.  the resultsdemonstrate the presence of common, speci-fic transplantation antigen(s) in differentrous sarcomas in mice and speak againstan identity between the transplantationantigen(s) and viral antigen(s).
