major surgery on the severe hemophiliac, lessons in management.three cases of pseudotumor of the thigh whichrequired surgical amputation and onecase of open pericardial drainage for cardiactamponade are briefly reported in severehemophiliacs.  in the first case hemostasis, followingamputation, was produced, but thepatient died of septicemia secondary to proximallyinfected tissues; the level of amputationshould, therefore, be proximal to all grosslyinfected tissues.  in the second case, withinfected massive pseudotumor of the left thigh,5 separate operative procedures wereperformed.  the last procedure was elective revisionof skin flaps at the hip disarticulationsite.  here application of the knowledge gainedfrom previous experience resulted in a completelyuncomplicated postoperative course bydint of timing of the surgical procedurein relation to control of infection, loss of plasmafastness, and the judicious use of antibioticand direct-current electrocoagulation therapy.a plea is made to avoid the useof plasma and ahg therapy in hemophiliasfor trivial reasons and to consider patientsfor surgical procedures early in the course of theircomplications, which demand surgery,at a time when the patient is still responsiveto hematologic therapy and prior to theonset of infection in areas of hematoma.  it isfelt that a second significant hemorrhagein any particular site constitutes a bona fideindication for surgical intervention, longbefore the time when surgery is considered asthe last resort by the physician, patient andfamily.  although the authors believe that surgeryin the hemophiliac is not to be takenlightly, they do not endorse the prevailing nihilisticattitude that has resulted in temporizingdelays which can only guarantee a fatal outcome.
