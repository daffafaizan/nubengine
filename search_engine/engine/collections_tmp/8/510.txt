1745. the deaggregation of bovine lens a-crystallinsedimentation equilibrium studies of lensa-crystallin at neutral ph indicate thatthis material is composed of a numberof different sized species.  a study of theeffect of alkali upon a-crystallin indicatesa progressive deaggregation of the ma-terial with increasing ph.  sedimentationequilibrium studies were performed at ph12.8 as well as in guanidine hydrochloride,7 m urea, and with succinylated material.under all of these conditions a molecularheterogeneity was observed.  the dataindicate that independent species coexistedunder most dissociating conditions.  theweight average molecular weights of thesuccinylated, and of the alkali-, urea-,and guanidine hydrochloride-treatedmaterial were found to have an integral relation-ship of 8 4 2 1, respectively.  since aconstant ratio of m2 mw was found, it wasconcluded that the same spread ofdistribution of molecular species occurred foreach of the deaggregating conditions.the results in guanidine hydrochloride couldnot be evaluated in this manner becauseof a small concentration dependence.  theseconclusions imply that not only theweight average molecular weight in 7 m ureabut the actual molecular weight ofeach individual species in urea was one-half ofthe value to be found in alkali andone-quarter that of the succinylated material.
